ABSTRACT: Although cumulative culture is a hallmark of hominin evolution, its origins can be traced back to our common ancestor with chimpanzees. Here, we investigated the evolutionary origins of chimpanzee cumulative culture and why it remained incipient. To trace cultural transmission among the four chimpanzee subspecies, we compared population networks based on genetic markers of recent migration and shared cultural traits. We show that limited levels of group connectivity favored the emergence of a few instances of cumulative culture in chimpanzees. As in humans, cultural complexification likely happened in steps, with transmission between populations, incremental changes, and repurposing of technologies. We propose that divergence in social patterns led to increased mobility between groups in the genus Homo, resulting in irreversible dependence on cultural exchange and complexification. © 2024 the authors, some rights reserved;

ABSTRACT: Objectives: Many early fossil hominins are associated with savanna-mosaic paleohabitats, and high sexual dimorphism that may reflect differences in positional behavior between sexes. However, reconstructions of hominin behavior and the selective pressures they faced in an open habitat are limited by a lack of studies of extant apes living in contemporary, analogous habitats. Here, we describe adult chimpanzee positional behavior in the savanna-mosaic habitat of the Issa Valley, Tanzania, to test whether Issa chimpanzees show larger sex-differences in positional behavior than their forest-dwelling counterparts. Materials and Methods: We quantified and compared adult locomotor and postural behavior across sexes (6 females, 7 males) in the riparian forest (closed) and miombo woodland (open) vegetation types at Issa Valley (13,743 focal observations). We then compared our results to published data of chimpanzee communities living in more forested habitats. Results: Issa females and males both spent less time arboreally in open vegetation and showed similar locomotor and postural behavior on the same substrates, notably using a high level of suspensory locomotion when arboreal. Females were, however, more arboreal than males during locomotor behavior, as well as compared with females from other communities. Issa males behaved similarly to males from other communities. Conclusion: Results suggest that open habitats do not elicit less arboreal behaviors in either sex, and may even select for suspensory locomotion to effectively navigate an open canopy. An open habitat may, however, increase sex differences in positional behavior by driving female arboreality. We suggest this is because of higher energetic demands and predator pressures associated with open vegetation, which are likely exaggerated for reproducing females. These results have implications for the interpretation of how sexual dimorphism may influence reconstructions of hominin positional behavior. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Across species, communication systems may differ in their levels of flexibility, but comparisons are challenging, because flexibility is not operationalized in a consistent way. In this study, we investigated different aspects of flexibility in the gestural communication systems of 7 groups of captive apes (N = 53), including 19 chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), 16 Sumatran orangutans (Pongo abelii), and 18 siamangs (Symphalangus syndactylus). We operationalized flexibility in four different ways: (i) the use of one gesture type across several contexts (i.e., contextual flexibility), (ii) the use of many gesture types in the same context (i.e., pragmatic flexibility), (iii) the production of one gesture type with different limbs and/or toward different target locations (i.e., morphological flexibility), and (iv) the ability to combine different signals into a sequence in different orders (i.e., combinational flexibility). Comparisons across individuals and species revealed variation in contextual and morphological flexibility. In particular, contextual flexibility increased with age and was overall higher in chimpanzees than siamangs. Moreover, morphological flexibility increased with social integration and was highest in siamangs and lowest in orangutans. Overall, variation largely reflected differences in social experience and possibly in the socioecological characteristics of the species. Our findings suggest that contextual and morphological flexibility might be good candidates to study interindividual and interspecific variation in primate gestural production. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Long-standing questions about human brain evolution may only be resolved through comparisons with close living evolutionary relatives, such as chimpanzees. This applies in particular to structural white matter (WM) connectivity, which continuously expanded throughout evolution. However, due to legal restrictions on chimpanzee research, neuroscience research currently relies largely on data with limited detail or on comparisons with evolutionarily distant monkeys. Here, we present a detailed magnetic resonance imaging resource to study structural WM connectivity in the chimpanzee. This open-access resource contains (1) WM reconstructions of a postmortem chimpanzee brain, using the highest-quality diffusion magnetic resonance imaging data yet acquired from great apes; (2) an optimized and validated method for high-quality fiber orientation reconstructions; and (3) major fiber tract segmentations for cross-species morphological comparisons. This dataset enabled us to identify phylogenetically relevant details of the chimpanzee connectome, and we anticipate that it will substantially contribute to understanding human brain evolution. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and humans cooperate in reciprocal patterns, but it is unclear whether these interactions are based on the same psychological foundations. While there is evidence suggesting that both species engage in long-term forms of reciprocity, there is very little work exploring their short-term behavioural contingencies with suitable methods. Here, we present a direct comparative study on short-term reciprocity in chimpanzees and human children using a novel, low-cost instrumental helping task. We investigated whether participants help a conspecific partner to obtain a tool for accessing a reward, and whether the level of helping depends on the partner's previous helpful or unhelpful behaviour. In line with prior research, both chimpanzees and children demonstrated helping behaviour towards their partner. However, the extent to which the two species showed short-term reciprocity differed considerably. After receiving help, tested children always helped in return. They helped substantially less when interacting with an unhelpful partner. Chimpanzees showed a higher tendency to help when interacting with a helpful compared to an unhelpful partner only in the first half the experiment. With increasing trial number, chimpanzees stopped discriminating between helpful and unhelpful partners. This study provides evidence for short-term reciprocity in human children and, to a lesser extent, in our closest living relatives. Our findings demonstrate that helping paradigms provide a useful context to investigate reciprocal motives in humans and chimpanzees alike. © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Disease outbreaks are one of the key threats to great apes and other wildlife. Because the spread of some pathogens (e.g., respiratory viruses, sexually transmitted diseases, ectoparasites) are mediated by social interactions, there is a growing interest in understanding how social networks predict the chain of pathogen transmission. In this study, we built a party network from wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), and used agent-based modeling to test: (i) whether individual attributes (sex, age) predict individual centrality (i.e., whether it is more or less socially connected); (ii) whether individual centrality affects an individual's role in the chain of pathogen transmission; and, (iii) whether the basic reproduction number (R0) and infectious period modulate the influence of centrality on pathogen transmission. We show that sex and age predict individual centrality, with older males presenting many (degree centrality) and strong (strength centrality) relationships. As expected, males are more central than females within their network, and their centrality determines their probability of getting infected during simulated outbreaks. We then demonstrate that direct measures of social interaction (strength centrality), as well as eigenvector centrality, strongly predict disease dynamics in the chimpanzee community. Finally, we show that this predictive power depends on the pathogen's R0 and infectious period: individual centrality was most predictive in simulations with the most transmissible pathogens and long-lasting diseases. These findings highlight the importance of considering animal social networks when investigating disease outbreaks. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Planning is a type of problem solving in which a course of future action is devised via mental computation. Potential advantages of planning for tool use include reduced effort to gather tools, closer alignment to an efficient tool design, and increased foraging efficiency. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) in the Goualougo Triangle use a variety of different types of tools. We hypothesized that procurement strategy (brought to the termite nest, manufactured or acquired at the termite nest, or borrowed from others) reflects planning for current needs, with tool transport behavior varying by tool type and by age and sex class. It is also possible that chimpanzees anticipate the need for tools at future times, which would be evidenced by transporting multiple tool types for a sequential task. One year of video recordings at termite nests were systematically screened for tool procurement; data comprised 299 tool procurement events across 66 chimpanzees. In addition, we screened video recordings of leaf sponging and honey gathering, which resulted in another 38 procurement events. Fishing probes, which are typically used during a single visit, were typically transported to termite nests, while puncturing tools, which are durable and remain on site, were more often acquired at termite nests. Most tools transported in multiples were fishing probes, perhaps in anticipation that a single probe might not last through an entire foraging bout or might be transferred to another chimpanzee. We further documented that chimpanzees transported tool sets, comprising multiple different tool types used in sequence. Mature chimpanzees transported tools more often than did immatures. These observations suggest that chimpanzees plan tool use flexibly, reflecting the availability of raw materials and the likelihood that specific tool types will be needed for particular tasks. Developmental studies and further integration of behavioral, spatial, and archaeological data will help to illuminate the decision making and time depth of planning associated with tool technologies in living primates and hominin ancestors. © The Author(s) 2023.

ABSTRACT: Though common among humans, social play by adults is an uncommon occurrence in most animals, even between parents and offspring.1,2,3 The most common explanation for why adult play is so rare is that its function and benefits are largely limited to development, so that social play has little value later in life.3,4,5,6 Here, we draw from 10 years of behavioral data collected by the Kibale Chimpanzee Project to consider an alternative hypothesis: that despite its benefits, adult play in non-humans is ecologically constrained by energy shortage or time limitations. We further hypothesized that, since they may be the only available partners for their young offspring, mother chimpanzees pay greater costs of play than other adults. Our analysis of nearly 4,000 adult play bouts revealed that adult chimpanzees played both among themselves and with immature partners. Social play was infrequent when diet quality was low but increased with the proportion of high-quality fruits in the diet. This suggests that adults engage in play facultatively when they have more energy and/or time to do so. However, when diet quality was low and most adult play fell to near zero, play persisted between mothers and offspring. Increased use of play by adult chimpanzees during periods of resource abundance suggests that play retains value as a social currency beyond development but that its costs constrain its use. At the same time, when ecological conditions constrain opportunities for young to play, play by mothers fills a critical role to promote healthy offspring development. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Chimp Haven is a private, nonprofit organization that serves as the largest chimpanzee sanctuary in the world. The National Institutes of Health supports the federal sanctuary system, which is operated by Chimp Haven, to provide lifetime care for chimpanzees who have retired from biomedical research. Chimp Haven is home to over 300 chimpanzees, with a wide variety of individual health needs including infectious diseases. The chimpanzees live in large, mixed-sex social groups within corrals, multi-dimensional enclosures, and naturally forested habitats, which presents challenges for monitoring and balancing individual versus group needs. Primate veterinarians and animal behavior directors have an obligation to collaborate for the best possible health and welfare outcomes for the species in their care. This manuscript details how veterinarians and behavioral staff at Chimp Haven interface to enhance clinical management and improve chimpanzee welfare using two clinical cases to illustrate this relationship. This is accomplished through the development of individual care plans that include the utilization of welfare assessment metrics and positive reinforcement training programs collaboratively developed between the veterinarians and behaviorists to facilitate voluntary medical procedures without the need for social isolation. Specifically, welfare metrics such as monitoring chimpanzee wounding levels and severity, as well as targeted assessments, involve the input of both the veterinarians and behaviorists. Positive reinforcement training initiatives such as weight loss, heart health, and wound care also require the interface between the two disciplines. The authors aim to demonstrate that working together provides optimal levels of expert care for both the physical and mental health of the chimpanzees in our care. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Objective: Chimpanzees are altricial in terms of their locomotor development and transition from being carried to engaging in suspensory and arboreal locomotor behaviors to eventually relying on terrestrial quadrupedalism as their main form of locomotion. Here, we consider the mechanical implications of femoral cortical bone restructuring during growth and locomotor development in wild chimpanzees. Materials and Methods: Cortical bone structure was examined in an ontogenetic sample of wild chimpanzees from a single subspecies (P. t. verus) spanning in age from 2 weeks to 12.6 years. Diaphyseal cross-sections were extracted from micro-CT scans of the femur at 35%, 50%, and 65% of total intermetaphyseal length and variation in cortical bone structure was assessed based on bending rigidity (Imax/Imin, Ix/Iy), relative medullary area, and cortical bone porosity. Results: Diaphyseal shape is relatively circular with a high amount of cortical bone porosity and a large relative medullary area during early infancy. Distinct shifts in cortical bone structure occurred for each studied parameter with the biggest changes occurring within the first 5 years. Values appear to stabilize as quadrupedal walking increases in frequency and is established as the main form of locomotion. Discussion: Collectively, the results suggest a degree of integration in which cortical bone restructures in response to rapid changes in locomotion in addition to nonmechanical influences such as hormonal, and growth factors, without compromising function and structural integrity. The extent of influence of each factor varies throughout growth and highlights the need for caution in functional interpretations of cortical bone geometry. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are related to long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons, comprising gene sequences of exogenous retroviruses integrated into the host genome and inherited according to Mendelian law. They are considered to have contributed greatly to the evolution of host genome structure and function. We previously characterized HERV-K HML-9 in the human genome. However, the biological function of this type of element in the genome of the chimpanzee, which is the closest living relative of humans, largely remains elusive. Therefore, the current study aims to characterize HML-9 in the chimpanzee genome and to compare the results with those in the human genome. Firstly, we report the distribution and genetic structural characterization of the 26 proviral elements and 38 solo LTR elements of HML-9 in the chimpanzee genome. The results showed that the distribution of these elements displayed a non-random integration pattern, and only six elements maintained a relatively complete structure. Then, we analyze their phylogeny and reveal that the identified elements all cluster together with HML-9 references and with those identified in the human genome. The HML-9 integration time was estimated based on the 2-LTR approach, and the results showed that HML-9 elements were integrated into the chimpanzee genome between 14 and 36 million years ago and into the human genome between 18 and 49 mya. In addition, conserved motifs, cis-regulatory regions, and enriched PBS sequence features in the chimpanzee genome were predicted based on bioinformatics. The results show that pathways significantly enriched for ERV LTR-regulated genes found in the chimpanzee genome are closely associated with disease development, including neurological and neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders. In summary, the identification, characterization, and genomics of HML-9 presented here not only contribute to our understanding of the role of ERVs in primate evolution but also to our understanding of their biofunctional significance. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Social play in adults is considered rare in non-human species. A new study has found that play among adult chimpanzees is common and linked to cooperation and social bond maintenance. The societal function of adult social play may thus have deep evolutionary roots. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Background and objectives: Lifestyle has widespread effects on human health and aging. Prior results from chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), one of humans' closest evolutionary relatives, indicate that these lifestyle effects may also be shared with other species, as semi-free-ranging chimpanzees fed a naturalistic diet show healthier values in several specific health biomarkers, compared with their sedentary, captive counterparts. Here, we examined how lifestyle factors associated with different environments affect rates of physiological aging in closely related chimpanzees. Methodology: We compared physiological dysregulation, an index of biological aging, in semi-free-ranging chimpanzees in an African sanctuary versus captive chimpanzees in US laboratories. If the rate of aging is accelerated by high-calorie diet and sedentism, we predicted greater age-related dysregulation in the laboratory populations. Conversely, if costs of a wild lifestyle accelerate aging, then semi-free-ranging chimpanzees at the sanctuary, whose environment better approximates the wild, should show greater age-related dysregulation. We further tested whether dysregulation differed based on sex or body system, as in humans. Results: We found that semi-free-ranging chimpanzees showed lower overall dysregulation, as well as lower age-related change in dysregulation, than laboratory chimpanzees. Males experienced lower dysregulation than females in both contexts, and the two populations exhibited distinct aging patterns based on body system. Conclusions and implications: Our results support the conclusion that naturalistic living conditions result in healthier aging in chimpanzees. These data provide support for the proposal that lifestyle effects on human health and aging are conserved from deeper into our evolutionary history. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Maintaining water balance is imperative for organismal survival. Various socioecological conditions such as sex, reproductive state, and dominance rank can impact water intake and hydration status. Eastern Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) present an interesting biological model to investigate the socioecological correlates of hydration status, given adult sex differences in behavior. Males are more gregarious than females, which may afford them less behavioral flexibility to reduce dehydration risk. However, females invest heavily in their offspring, producing a water heavy milk for up to 5 years, and adult females experience disparities in access to water in foods dependent on dominance rank, which may cause variation in hydration status. In the present study, we investigated correlates of adult chimpanzee hydration status at Gombe National Park, Tanzania, using a measure of urine concentration - urine specific gravity (USG) - highly concentrated urine results in a higher USG, indicating dehydration. We found that both males and females had significantly higher USG in the dry season, but males had lower USG than females during the dry season. Within females, reproductive state did not significantly impact hydration status; however, females in middle lactation tended to have higher USG than nonpregnant, nonlactating females. Additionally, high-ranking females had lower USG than mid- and low-ranking females. While our study showed consistency with USG values that have been demonstrated at other Chimpanzee research sites, we found evidence that this population may be chronically dehydrated by human standards, but more research is needed across populations to determine the health and fitness effects of chronic dehydration in Chimpanzees.  © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Reinforcement learning is a mathematical framework for learning better choices through trial-and-error. Recent studies revealed that reinforcement learning is applicable to animal behavior and cognition. However, applying reinforcement learning to animal behavior sometimes encounters difficulties because the information sources utilized by animals to make choices are often unknown, whereas this is identified as the “state” in the reinforcement learning framework. We sought to identify possible state settings including non-standard formulations suitable for explaining data from past chimpanzee studies. Although chimpanzees’ performance in a serial learning task was inconsistent with standard reinforcement learning formulations, we found that the combination of state-independent choice making and state-dependent evaluation produced consistent results. Exploration of state settings in reinforcement learning may shed new light on animal learning processes. © International Society of Artificial Life and Robotics (ISAROB) 2024.

ABSTRACT: The emergence of conflicting reports on the natural occurrence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in non-human primates has prompted research on the comparison of the role of diet-associated changes in gene expression between humans and non-human primates. This article analyzes the effects of different human and chimpanzee diets and their link with apolipoproteins, lipid, and iron (Fe) metabolism, starting from available data, to find out any gap in the existing knowledge. By using a system biology approach, we have re-analyzed the liver and brain RNA seq data of mice fed with either human or chimpanzee diet for 2 weeks to look for genetic differences that may explain the differences in AD occurrence between those two classes. In liver samples of mice fed with the chimpanzee diet in comparison to the human diet, apolipoprotein A-1, ceruloplasmin, and 10 other genes were upregulated while 21 genes were downregulated. However, brain apolipoprotein E4 gene expression was not changed upon diet. Genetic, structural, and functional differences in apolipoprotein E protein, along with differences in Fe metabolisms and a longer lifespan of humans during evolution may account for the observed disparity. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.

ABSTRACT: Housing different animal groups in close-by facilities is common in wildlife centers. However, the impact on animal welfare is insufficiently studied in the literature. In this study, we analyzed the behavior of two adjacently housed chimpanzee groups to investigate how intergroup interactions may affect their behavior and, thus, their welfare. We recorded occurrences of abnormal and self-directed behaviors, two well-known indicators of stress in chimpanzees. Furthermore, we explored the social responses to said intergroup interactions by recording all inter- and intragroup affiliative and agonistic behaviors. Finally, we measured the number of vigilance occurrences that individuals directed towards other chimpanzees as an indicator of interest. Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) were used to assess whether and how social interactions between neighboring groups might influence their behaviors, taking gender, age, group, and intergroup participation into account. Our results suggest that intergroup interactions promoted the occurrence of affiliative behaviors between group members. However, intergroup interactions caused the chimpanzees to exhibit a higher number of abnormal and self-directed behaviors and increased vigilance towards their group members when agonistic intergroup interactions occurred. Thus, adjacent housing does impact the chimpanzees’ behavior and welfare and should be continuously monitored and assessed to promote and maximize welfare. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: This study aimed to establish a baseline hematological profile and examine the influence of age, sex, and season on hematological parameters in captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) living in a humid tropical climate. Hematological parameters are a useful tool for assessing health status and diagnosing diseases in animals. We analyzed 473 blood samples collected from 84 chimpanzees (43 females and 41 males) during annual health checks, conducted under anesthesia for a routine physical examination. The main findings revealed significant sex differences in some hematological parameters: males had higher hematocrit and red blood cell counts than females. Age-related variations have also been noted, with adolescents and adults having lower lymphocyte counts but higher neutrophil and monocyte counts than infants. Adults, in particular, had significantly lower platelet counts compared to other age classes. Seasonal fluctuations were also observed: lymphocyte counts were higher in the rainy season, while neutrophil counts were higher in the dry season. In addition, the general trends in hematological parameters for this captive population of chimpanzees were similar to those reported in captive chimpanzees living in the United States. These results should provide animal health professionals, particularly those working with nonhuman primates, with data to compare and interpret. They will help improve practices for monitoring and managing the health of nonhuman primates in captivity. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT: Human fascination with chimpanzees has driven extensive research on the species, but also led to exploitation by private owners and entertainment industries. These animals often suffer species-specific inadequate conditions, which can result in the development and display of abnormal behaviors even after rescue. These behaviors highlight the importance for zoos and sanctuaries to actively prevent worsening the effects of previous inadequate treatment by providing apes with social and stimulating environments that support their recovery. We conducted a 2-month behavioral survey on two groups of former pet and entertainment chimpanzees (n = 10) at the Fundación MONA sanctuary in Spain. From 116 h of instantaneous scan observations, we documented individual abnormal behaviors (e.g., self-poking, overgrooming, self-scratching). We assessed the association between the occurrence of these behaviors and individuals' origin, early history, age at rescue, and pre-rescue social conditions. We found no significant difference in the frequency of abnormal behavior between pet and entertainer chimpanzees, and between individuals born in captivity versus in the wild. Moreover, we observed that the frequency of abnormal behaviors increased with age at rescue for previously isolated individuals, but the correlation disappeared for those socially housed pre-rescue. These findings suggest that early social isolation and a late age at rescue may impose long-term changes on chimpanzees' behavior, and they emphasize the importance of accounting for age at rescue and previous housing conditions in care management and rehabilitation procedures. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Norovirus (NoV) infection is a major cause of gastroenteritis worldwide. The virus poses great challenges in developing vaccines with broad immune protection due to its genetic and antigenic diversity. To date, there are no approved NoV vaccines for clinical use. Here, we aimed to develop a broad-acting quadrivalent NoV vaccine based on a chimpanzee adenovirus vector, AdC68, carrying the major capsid protein (VP1) of noroviral GI and GII genotypes. Compared to intramuscular (i.m.), intranasal (i.n.), or other prime-boost immunization regimens (i.m. ​+ ​i.m., i.m. ​+ ​i.n., i.n. ​+ ​i.m.), AdC68-GI.1-GII.3 (E1)-GII.4-GII.17 (E3), administered via i.n. ​+ ​i.n. induced higher titers of serum IgG antibodies and higher IgA antibodies in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and saliva against the four homologous VP1s in mice. It also significantly stimulated the production of blocking antibodies against the four genotypes. In response to re-stimulation with virus-like particles (VLP)-GI.1, VLP-GII.3, VLP-GII.4, and VLP-GII.17, the quadrivalent vaccine administered according to the i.n. ​+ ​i.n. regimen effectively triggered specific cell-mediated immune responses, primarily characterized by IFN-γ secretion. Furthermore, the preparation of this novel quadrivalent NoV vaccine requires only a single recombinant adenovirus to provide broad preventive immunity against the major GI/GII epidemic strains, making it a promising vaccine candidate for further development. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Heart rate is a crucial vital sign and a valuable indicator for assessing the physical and psychological condition of a target animal. Heart rate contributes to (1) fundamental information for cognitive research, (2) an indicator of psychological and physical stress, and (3) improving the animal welfare of captive animals, especially in nonhuman primate studies. Heart rate has been measured using a contact-type device; however, the device burdens the target animals and that there are risks associated with anesthesia during installation. This study explores the application of heartbeat measurement techniques using millimeter-wave radar, primarily developed for humans, as a remote and noninvasive method for measuring the heart rate of nonhuman primates. Through a measurement test conducted on two chimpanzees, we observed a remarkable correspondence between the peak frequency spectrum of heart rate estimated using millimeter-wave radar and the mean value obtained from electrocardiograph data, thereby validating the accuracy of the method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the precise measurement of great apes' heart rate using millimeter-wave radar technology. Compared to heart rate measurement using video analysis, the method using millimeter-wave radar has the advantage that it is less susceptible to weather and lighting conditions and that measurement techniques for multiple individuals have been developed for human subjects, while its disadvantage is that validation of measurement from long distances has not been completed. Another disadvantage common to both methods is that measurement becomes difficult when the movement of the target individual is large. The possibility of noncontact measurement of heart rate in wild and captive primates will undoubtedly open up a new research area while taking animal welfare into consideration. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Sympatric primate species coexist in tropical communities through interactions with the abiotic environment and other species. Determining the factors that influence primate species co-occurrence can help to inform conservation practices. Our study focused on the ecological interactions of central chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) with each other and their environment in a multiuse landscape. We assessed species-specific occupancy at 17 camera trap sites across different land-use types (National Park, Forest Management Units, or Community Lands) between June 2019 and May 2020 and examined the impact of fruit availability and human presence on ape presence. Across the study area, chimpanzees occupied a greater total number of sites than did gorillas, with a significantly higher proportion of occupied sites within the National Park than in other land-use types. The density of fruiting trees positively influenced the presence of gorillas but had no effect on chimpanzee presence. We found no effect of human presence on the presence of either chimpanzees or gorillas, although this analysis was limited to sites where apes were present. The probability of either species being present at a site during a given month remained stable under the conditional presence or absence of the other species, suggesting the absence of interactions between the two species at our study sites. These results support previous findings that the heterogeneous distribution of fruits and preferred resources allows chimpanzees and gorillas to limit direct competition by exploiting different feeding resources. Our findings provide insights on the factors influencing the occupancy of each species, including environmental variables and land-use type, information relevant when monitoring their coexistence within tropical communities. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

ABSTRACT: Empathy is a complex, multi-dimensional capacity that facilitates the sharing and understanding of others' emotions. As our closest living relatives, bonobos (Pan paniscus) and chimpanzees (P. troglodytes) provide an opportunity to explore the origins of hominin social cognition, including empathy. Despite certain assumptions that bonobos and chimpanzees may differ empathically, these species appear to overlap considerably in certain socio-emotional responses related to empathy. However, few studies have systematically tested for species variation in Pan empathic or socio-emotional tendencies. To address this, we synthesise the growing literature on Pan empathy to inform our understanding of the selection pressures that may underlie the evolution of hominin empathy, and its expression in our last common ancestor. As bonobos and chimpanzees show overlaps in their expression of complex socio-emotional phenomena such as empathy, we propose that group comparisons may be as or more meaningful than species comparisons when it comes to understanding the evolutionary pressures for such behaviour. Furthermore, key differences, such as how humans and Pan communicate, appear to distinguish how we experience empathy compared to our closest living relatives. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The ingestion of bark has been observed across the animal kingdom and is well documented in free-ranging chimpanzees. Thus far, the best-supported hypothesis for the adaptive function of this behavior is the fallback food hypothesis, which asserts that chimpanzees consume bark and cambium when preferred foods are scarce. However, alternative explanations exist, including the essential nutrient and mineral hypothesis, the self-medication hypothesis, and the stressed-tree hypothesis. We tested whether the fallback food hypothesis can explain bark-feeding across two communities of Eastern chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) in the Budongo Forest, Uganda. We used 13 years of the site’s long-term behavioral data, 5 years of food availability data, and 8 months of direct and indirect observations. We also conducted eight 400-m line transects to collect data on the distribution of tree species across community home ranges. We employed several analyses, including Pearson correlation tests, qualitative comparisons of descriptive data and heat maps, and interpretation of behavioral anecdotes. We found varying patterns of bark-feeding seasonality across tree species, with bark-feeding on several species showing no correlation with food scarcity. We also identified differences in the amounts of bark targeted between tree species and report anecdotal evidence of chimpanzees prioritizing bark over high-value foods. Lastly, we found that bark-feeding on certain species disproportionally occurs far from community core areas, despite relative abundance of these species within the home range. As a result, we argue that the fallback food hypothesis cannot explain bark-feeding across all tree species. Instead, we present supporting evidence for several alternative hypotheses, including self-medication, thereby challenging the widely accepted function of this behavior. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: The earliest evidence for complex tool use in the archaeological record dates to 3.3 Ma. While wooden tools may have been used by our earliest ancestors, the evidence is absent due to poor preservation. However, insights into possible early hominin wooden tool use can be gained from observing the tool-use practices of our closest living relatives, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). By using stone hammers used to crack various nuts, chimpanzees leave a durable material signature comprised of formal tools and associated diagnostic fragments. While the archaeological evidence of chimpanzee wooden tool use is temporary, the combination of stone hammers and wooden anvils can create a more enduring lithic record. This study explores the lithic assemblages associated with wooden and stone anvil use at nut-cracking sites in Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire, using technological and use-wear analyses. Our results indicate clear differences in density, fracture patterns, and use-wear in the lithic records between wooden anvil and stone anvil sites. New archaeological excavations at six chimpanzee nut-cracking sites reveal that the anvils' material directly influences the visibility of nut-cracking evidence in the archaeological record. By examining the nature of the lithic signatures associated with wooden anvil and stone anvil use by chimpanzees, we can formulate hypotheses about the probability of such behaviors being preserved and identifiable in the Plio-Pleistocene hominin archaeological record. The variability in material signatures from nut-cracking on different anvils suggests that stone anvils leave a clear archaeological record. Evidence for wooden anvil use is likely underrepresented due to the more ephemeral nature of the associated percussive damage and material signature. It may, however, still be possible, albeit challenging, to identify wooden anvil use in the archaeological record. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees use spatiotemporal cognition for fruit foraging by remembering tree locations and fruiting seasons. However, the spatiotemporal cognition behind exploiting other foods has rarely been studied. Here, we investigate whether chimpanzees use memory to exploit concealed, underground army ant nests. We analyse 679 chimpanzee visits to four nests recorded during five years (2018–2022) using camera traps in a savanna habitat. We explore if chimpanzees intentionally revisit nests, study how they detect ants, and assess ant availability and chimpanzee ant consumption. Nests are concealed, scarce, and intermittently reoccupied, yet chimpanzees eat ants frequently. We find that out of 34 identified chimpanzees who visit the nests, 23 revisit at least one. Chimpanzees visit nest sites significantly more often than similar sites without nests. Individuals revisit significantly sooner and inspect significantly longer nests where they have more recently encountered ants. The apes use sight, smell, taste, touch, and probing tools, to detect ants inside nests. We provide the first evidence suggesting that chimpanzees use spatial and episodic-like memory to exploit concealed social insects throughout multiple years. Our results expand our understanding of the cognitive strategies behind chimpanzee insectivory, suggesting it may have played an important role in the evolution of primate spatiotemporal cognition. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Strong, affiliative bonds often function to facilitate social competition through cooperative defence of resources, but the benefits of social bonds may be low when direct competition is less intense or less beneficial. In such cases, one possible outcome is that relationships are weak and undifferentiated. Alternatively, negotiating stable, selectively tolerant relationships may be a strategy to mitigate the costs and risks of sharing space when direct competition is undesirable. We investigated dyadic social tolerance among wild adult female eastern chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, who engage in low rates of affiliation and aggression with one another. While females associate with one another at different rates, these patterns could reflect shared patterns of behaviour (e.g. ranging) rather than social preference or variation in relationship quality. We first determined whether patterns of dyadic spatial association (5 m proximity) were differentiated and stable over time. To assess whether dyadic spatial association reflected preference and variation in social tolerance, we tested whether spatial association was actively maintained by waiting and following behaviour and associated with decreased aggression and increased co-feeding. Spatial associations were differentiated, and stronger associations were more stable. Frequent associates used following and waiting behaviour to actively maintain associations. Association positively predicted time co-feeding and negatively predicted aggression. These patterns were true among related and unrelated dyads. Among unrelated females, dyads with stronger associations maintained proximity more mutually. This study highlights social tolerance as a stable relationship attribute that can predict and explain patterns of behaviour and social network structure, distinct from, or in the absence of, affiliation. © 2024 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Malocclusion is a common finding in both companion animals and humans due to dental or maxillofacial discrepancies. Treatment depends on the complications and the species it presents in. In humans, orthognathic surgery is commonly performed to address skeletal malocclusions. A male chimpanzee born in 2002 and orphaned due to the bush meat pet trade was rescued in 2010 by Chimp Eden, a chimpanzee sanctuary. In 2017, it presented with inappetence and weight loss of 6-month duration. After a computed tomography scan was performed and full mouth impressions were made, a diagnosis of asymmetry of the mandible with the left side markedly shorter and rotated along its long axis was made (malocclusion class IV in a side-to-side direction). A bilateral sagittal split operation was performed to correct the malocclusion and improve its feeding. At the time of writing this report, it was eating freely and no complications were seen on multiple post-operative radiographs. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Although gene expression divergence has long been postulated to be the primary driver of human evolution, identifying the genes and genetic variants underlying uniquely human traits has proven to be quite challenging. Theory suggests that cell-type-specific cis-regulatory variants may fuel evolutionary adaptation due to the specificity of their effects. These variants can precisely tune the expression of a single gene in a single cell-type, avoiding the potentially deleterious consequences of trans-acting changes and non-cell type-specific changes that can impact many genes and cell types, respectively. It has recently become possible to quantify human-specific cis-acting regulatory divergence by measuring allele-specific expression in human-chimpanzee hybrid cells-the product of fusing induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells of each species in vitro. However, these cis-regulatory changes have only been explored in a limited number of cell types. Here, we quantify human-chimpanzee cis-regulatory divergence in gene expression and chromatin accessibility across six cell types, enabling the identification of highly cell-type-specific cis-regulatory changes. We find that cell-type-specific genes and regulatory elements evolve faster than those shared across cell types, suggesting an important role for genes with cell-type-specific expression in human evolution. Furthermore, we identify several instances of lineage-specific natural selection that may have played key roles in specific cell types, such as coordinated changes in the cis-regulation of dozens of genes involved in neuronal firing in motor neurons. Finally, using novel metrics and a machine learning model, we identify genetic variants that likely alter chromatin accessibility and transcription factor binding, leading to neuron-specific changes in the expression of the neurodevelopmentally important genes FABP7 and GAD1. Overall, our results demonstrate that integrative analysis of cis-regulatory divergence in chromatin accessibility and gene expression across cell types is a promising approach to identify the specific genes and genetic variants that make us human. © 2023, Wang, Starr et al.

ABSTRACT: Researchers investigating the evolution of human aggression look to our closest living relatives, bonobos (Pan paniscus) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), as valuable sources of comparative data.1,2 Males in the two species exhibit contrasting patterns: male chimpanzees sexually coerce females3,4,5,6,7,8 and sometimes kill conspecifics,9,10,11,12 whereas male bonobos exhibit less sexual coercion13,14 and no reported killing.13 Among the various attempts to explain these species differences, the self-domestication hypothesis proposes negative fitness consequences of male aggression in bonobos.2,15,16 Nonetheless, the extent to which these species differ in overall rates of aggression remains unclear due to insufficiently comparable observation methods.17,18,19,20,21,22,23 We used 14 community-years of focal follow data—the gold standard for observational studies24—to compare rates of male aggression in 3 bonobo communities at the Kokolopori Bonobo Reserve, Democratic Republic of Congo, and 2 chimpanzee communities at Gombe National Park, Tanzania. As expected, given that females commonly outrank males, we found that bonobos exhibited lower rates of male-female aggression and higher rates of female-male aggression than chimpanzees. Surprisingly, we found higher rates of male-male aggression among bonobos than chimpanzees even when limiting analyses to contact aggression. In both species, more aggressive males obtained higher mating success. Although our findings indicate that the frequency of male-male aggression does not parallel species difference in its intensity, they support the view that contrary to male chimpanzees, whose reproductive success depends on strong coalitions, male bonobos have more individualistic reproductive strategies.25 © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Over the last decades, a growing body of literature has focused on the role of compassion in legal decision making. To this respect, judicial compassion has been almost exclusively thematized in relation to human animals. In this paper, I claim that compassion shows itself especially relevant when judges should decide controversial cases involving animals. Drawing on Schopenhauer's account of compassion, I contend that this emotion in particular can contribute to good decision making. To illustrate the argument, I analyze a renowned case from Argentinian jurisprudence: the case of Cecilia the chimpanzee.  © 2024 Luciana Samamé.

ABSTRACT: AU Tool: use Pleaseconfirmthatallheadinglevelsarerepresentedcorrectly is considered a driving force behind the evolution of : brain expansion and prolonged juvenile dependency in the hominin lineage. However, it remains rare across animals, possibly due to inherent constraints related to manual dexterity and cognitive abilities. In our study, we investigated the ontogeny of tool use in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), a species known for its extensive and flexible tool use behavior. We observed 70 wild chimpanzees across all ages and analyzed 1,460 stick use events filmed in the Taï National Park, Côte d’Ivoire during the chimpanzee attempts to retrieve high-nutrient, but difficult-to-access, foods. We found that chimpanzees increasingly utilized hand grips employing more than 1 independent digit as they matured. Such hand grips emerged at the age of 2, became predominant and fully functional at the age of 6, and ubiquitous at the age of 15, enhancing task accuracy. Adults adjusted their hand grip based on the specific task at hand, favoring power grips for pounding actions and intermediate grips that combine power and precision, for others. Highly protracted development of suitable actions to acquire hidden (i.e., larvae) compared to non-hidden (i.e., nut kernel) food was evident, with adult skill levels achieved only after 15 years, suggesting a pronounced cognitive learning component to task success. The prolonged time required for cognitive assimilation compared to neuromotor control points to selection pressure favoring the retention of learning capacities into adulthood. © 2024 Malherbe et al.

ABSTRACT: Understanding the mechanism underlying the evolution of knuckle-walking in African great apes but not in humans may provide important implications about the origin and evolution of human bipedal locomotion. In this study, aiming to reveal possible structural adaptations of the chimpanzee's forearm and hand musculature related to knuckle-walking, we measure the passive elastic moment of the chimpanzee's and orangutan's wrist as it was rotated into extension, immobilizing the metacarpophalangeal joint at three different positions: extended (as in knuckle-walking), flexed (as in fist-walking), and an intermediate position. Our findings demonstrate that when the metacarpophalangeal joints are extended, the rigidity of the wrist joint in the extended direction increases. This increased rigidity is attributed to the passive elongation and force generation of digital flexor muscles, which are relatively short in chimpanzees. Consequently, this enhanced wrist-joint rigidity contributes to the stability and energetically efficient transmission of propulsive force to the ground during the stance phase. Overall, our study supports the hypothesis that knuckle-walking is an adaptation to terrestrial locomotion for an ancestor characterized by the restricted capacity for wrist extension owing to the relatively shorter tendons of digital flexor muscles. © 2024 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Adult social play is a universal human trait, promoting the tolerance, bonding, cooperation, and collective action that sustain our large and complex societies.12 Play serves as a conduit for transmitting positive emotions, thereby stimulating psychological resilience to stressors and facilitating the positive intent and trust3456 essential for cooperation emergence. In contrast, non-human adult social play is considered rare, and its role in cooperation remains unknown. We address this gap by studying the play behavior of 57 adult chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire, where adult social play and collective action regularly occur. We show that adult female and male chimpanzees play more during times of increased mate competition (with males mainly playing with immatures) and with adult partners they had recent disputes with, highlighting the role of play in regulating social tension that can undermine cooperation. Chimpanzees also preferred playing with adult partners with whom they share strong affiliative bonds, aligning with the idea that play is associated with social familiarity and trust. Finally, adult chimpanzees were more likely to play before collectively defending their territory against outsiders and hunting monkeys. Those who played together were subsequently more likely to collaborate, reinforcing the notion that the positive feedback signaled via play can facilitate cooperation.5 Our findings demonstrate the sustained significance of adult social play throughout the chimpanzee lifespan, providing valuable insights into the evolution of adult social play and its societal functions, from diffusing tension to supporting social bonds and collective action. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Background: Major Human Histocompatibility complex (MHC or HLA in humans) has been associated to autoimmune diseases. However, only statistical phenomenological and no pathogenetic description has been reached after decades. This shows that MHC single locus association studies are probably useless for HLA/diseases association. Extended HLA (class I and class II genes) haplotypes should also be studied conjointly with class III or complement alleles (complotypes). Complotypes in humans are defined as alleles belonging to C2, C4 and Bf (Factor B) genes/proteins (class III). Also, the placing of MHC class I and class II genes close together with complement genes from at least birds to humans shows existence of a strong selection to gather conjointly these loci that fight microbes, help self-maintenance and avoid autoimmunity. In this paper we aim to study Bf alleles in primates in order to rise again interest to study the role of Bf alleles together with other MHC genes in their physiopathology and evolution. Methods: Orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus, Popy) cell lines RNA from 6 different individuals were retrotranscribed, PCR amplified, cloned and DNA sequenced in order to study Bf alleles. Results: A Bf allele identical to that found in chimpanzee (Patr-Bf*A01) and human (rs641153) was found in two of the six studied orangutans: Popy-Bf*A01 and Popy-Bf*A02. This polymorphism is placed in Factor B codon 32 that defines BF*S and Bf*F proteins in man and produce Leu instead of Arg (Bf*S) or Gln (Bf*F). In addition, each new orangutan allele present synonymous differences with each other at codon 25: Popy-Bf*A01 shows ACG while Popy-Bf*A02 bears ACA, both codifying for Thr. Conclusions: The selection for about 15 million years (time gap of evolutionary appearance between orangutan and hominids) shows the importance of this particular allele conservation in immune and self defense in primates. The complotypes (Bf,C2 and C4 loci) alleles together with other MHC class I and Cass II loci alleles are often transmitted in block to the germinal line: this indicates that all specific alleles from the MHC different loci may work together to accomplish MHC functions. All MHC loci alleles should be studied together to unveil their physiopathology and also maintenance of specific alleles (like the one described in this paper) for so long time in evolution should be further studied in Bf and the other neighbouring complement loci (C2 and C4). © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

ABSTRACT: The origin of tool use is a central question in human evolutionary studies. Plio-Pleistocene core and flake technologies represent the earliest evidence of tool use in the human lineage. Some suggest this form of tool use is probably pre-dated by a phase of percussive tool use. However, there is currently no evidence for such a record. The archaeological signature of solely percussive behaviours is not as well understood as that associated with cores and flakes. The durable nature of primate percussive stone tools and their by-products provide an opportunity to investigate what such a record looks like. Here, we present a landscape-scale study of the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) material culture from the Djouroutou Chimpanzee Project, Taï Forest, Cote d'Ivoire. This study explores the interplay between behavioural and environmental factors in shaping the stone record of nut cracking. Through a survey of nut-cracking sites, the available nut species, and raw materials, we show how resource availability influences the resulting material signature of nut cracking. These results also reveal the diversity of material signatures associated with a purely percussive material record. We gain insight into the range of signatures that may be associated with a pre-core and flake archaeological record, providing new expectations for an earlier record of tool use. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are categorized as Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and habitat loss due to conversion of land for agriculture is one of the major threats to wild populations of this species. This challenging scenario can lead to negative human-chimpanzee interactions, including crop feeding. Chimpanzees consume crops across their geographical range, although little is known about this behavior in savanna habitats. Here we provide new evidence of crop feeding by savanna chimpanzees. We conducted our observations at Dindefelo, a community nature reserve in southeastern Senegal. The chimpanzees were observed to feed on mango (Mangifera indica) and also on baobab (Adansonia digitata), a wild species considered a crop by local people when found in and around villages. Although local people use the fruits of these species for food and income, they tolerated crop-feeding events until recently. In 2023, a case of harassment of a crop-feeding chimpanzee in a mango orchard was witnessed, and four days later a chimpanzee corpse was found at the same place. We conclude that habitat conversion into agricultural fields, uncontrolled bush fires and extraction of wild fruits are the important factors influencing crop-feeding events at Dindefelo. Our findings highlight the need to better understand human-chimpanzee interactions in the anthropogenic landscape of Dindefelo to help mitigate negative attitudes and behaviors towards chimpanzees. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Rhythm is an important component of human language and music production. Rhythms such as isochrony (intervals spaced equally in time) are also present in vocalizations of certain non-human species, including several birds and mammals. This study aimed to identify rhythmic patterns with music-based methods within the display behaviour of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), humans' closest living relatives. Behavioural observations were conducted on individuals from two zoo-housed colonies. We found isochronous rhythms in vocal (e.g. pants, grunts and hoots) as well as in motoric (e.g. swaying and stomping) behavioural sequences. Among individuals, variation was found in the duration between onsets of behavioural elements, resulting in individual-specific tempi. Despite this variation in individual tempi, display sequences were consistently structured with stable, isochronous rhythms. Overall, directed displays targeted at specific individuals were less isochronous than undirected displays. The presence of rhythmic patterns across two independent colonies of chimpanzees suggests that underlying mechanisms for rhythm production may be shared between humans and non-human primates. This shared mechanism indicates that the cognitive requirements for rhythm production potentially preceded human music and language evolution.  © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: High-precision evaluations of water environment quality are highly important for improving the accuracy of early warning systems of regional water pollution risk and improving the regional water environment. This paper employs the chimp optimization algorithm (ChOA) to enhance the traditional random forest model, resulting in the chimp optimization algorithm-random forest (ChOA-RF) water quality assessment model for evaluating the Jiansanjiang area in Heilongjiang Province, China. The results show that the overall water environment in Jiansanjiang has the following characteristics: “The water quality of farms in the northwest is poor, and the quality of groundwater is better than that of surface water.” Total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) in surface water and ammonium nitrogen (NH3-N), ferrum (Fe), and manganese (Mn) in groundwater are the main pollutants. The TP and TN in surface water and the NH3-N in groundwater exceeded the relevant standards, likely due to the excessive application of chemical fertilizers, especially nitrogen fertilizers. Additionally, Fe and Mn are harmful native substances. According to these findings, targeted improvement strategies, such as reducing nitrogen fertilizer application, plugging well, and increasing the surface water utilization rate, are proposed. Moreover, the ChOA-RF model is compared with the traditional empirical value model and the particle swarm optimization-random forest (PSO-RF) model. The results show that the ChOA-RF model can effectively reduce the root mean square error and mean absolute percentage error and improve the coefficient of determination. The running time and convergence ability are also better than those of the PSO-RF model, which is a more accurate and efficient machine learning model. The model can be used not only for high-precision evaluation of regional water environment quality but also for other machine learning fields. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: One promising method to tackle the question, “In which modality did language evolve?” is by studying the ontogenetic trajectory of signals in human’s closest living relatives, including chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Concerning gestures, current debates centre on four different hypotheses: “phylogenetic ritualization”, “social transmission through imitation”, “ontogenetic ritualization”, and “social negotiation”. These differ in their predictions regarding idiosyncratic gestures, making such occurrences a crucial area of investigation. Here, we describe a novel and potential idiosyncratic behaviour — ‘hand-on-eye’ — which was initially observed in one mother-infant dyad in a community of chimpanzees living in the wild. We systematically investigated the form, sequential organisation, intentionality, usage, function, and distribution of the behaviour over a five-year period. The results showed that ‘hand-on-eye’ was nearly exclusively deployed in a single mother-infant dyad, was accompanied by hallmarks of intentionality, and served to initiate or resume joint dorsal travel. Although the behaviour was observed once in each of three other mother-infant dyads, these lacked the same frequency and hallmarks of intentionality. ‘Hand-on-eye’ thus qualifies as an idiosyncratic gesture. The proposed developmental pathway gives support to both the “ontogenetic ritualization” and “social negotiation” hypotheses. It also stresses the crucial need for longitudinal approaches to tackle developmental processes that are triggered by unique circumstances and unfold over relatively long time windows. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: In human speech, the close back rounded vowel /u/ (the vowel in “boot”) is articulated with the tongue arched toward the dorsal boundary of the hard palate, with the pharyngeal cavity open. Acoustic and perceptual properties of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) hoo’s are similar to those of the human vowel /u/. However, the vocal tract morphology of chimpanzees likely limits their phonetic capabilities, so that it is unlikely, or even impossible, that their articulation is comparable to that of a human. To determine how qualities of the vowel /u/ may be achieved given the chimpanzee vocal tract, we calculated transfer functions of the vocal tract area for tube models of vocal tract configurations in which vocal tract length, length and area of a laryngeal air sac simulacrum, length of lip protrusion, and area of lip opening were systematically varied. The method described is principally acoustic; we make no claim as to the actual shape of the chimpanzee vocal tract during call production. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that it may be possible to achieve the acoustic and perceptual qualities of back vowels without a reconfigured human vocal tract. The results, while tentative, suggest that the production of hoo’s by chimpanzees, while achieving comparable vowel-like qualities to the human /u/, may involve articulatory gestures that are beyond the range of the human articulators. The purpose of this study was to (1) stimulate further simulation research on great ape articulation, and (2) show that apparently vowel-like phenomena in nature are not necessarily indicative of evolutionary continuity per se. © The Author(s) 2023.

ABSTRACT: While force-feedback devices have been developed in areas such as virtual reality, there have been very few comparative cognitive studies in nonhuman animals using these devices. In addition, although cross-modal perception between vision and touch has been actively studied in nonhuman primates for several decades, there have been no studies of their active haptic perception. In this study, we attempted to train force discrimination in chimpanzees using a force-feedback device modified from a trackball. Chimpanzees were given different levels of force feedback (8.0 vs. 0.5 N) when moving the on-screen cursor to the target area by manipulating the trackball and were required to select one of two choice stimuli based on the force cue. The experiment was conducted using a trial-block procedure in which the same force stimulus was presented for a fixed number of trials, and the force stimulus was changed between blocks. The block size was progressively reduced from ten trials. Four chimpanzees were trained, but none reached the learning criterion (80% or more correct responses under the condition that the force stimuli were presented randomly). However, a detailed analysis of the chimpanzees’ performance before and after the trial-block switching revealed that their choice behavior could not be explained by a simple win–stay/lose–shift strategy, suggesting that the switching of the force stimuli affected the chimpanzees’ choice behavior. It was also found that the chimpanzees performed better when switching from small to large force stimuli than when switching from large to small force stimuli. Although none of the chimpanzees in this study acquired force discrimination, future studies using such force-feedback devices will provide new insights for understanding haptic cognition in nonhuman primates from a comparative cognitive perspective. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Japan Monkey Centre 2024.

ABSTRACT: Humans can retain memories for months to decades. In contrast, relatively few studies have examined such very long-term memory in nonhuman animals. We, therefore, investigated whether chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) who had learned arbitrary relations between stimuli remembered these relations over a long period. In Experiment 1, we tested four chimpanzees, one of whom (Chloe) had learned a “symbolic” matching task between colors and geometric forms at age 9–10 years, and three who had not been previously trained, on their memory for these relations 19 years later. Chloe showed perfect accuracy in the test trials; the three other chimpanzees did not perform better than chance level. In Experiment 2, we tested Popo and Reo, who had learned the same set at the same time as Chloe, on their memory 27 years later. Although they relearned the identity-matching task very quickly (savings effect), they did not retain the stimulus relations learned 27 years ago. In Experiment 3, we tested Chloe’s retention of a different set of stimulus relations, which she had learned at the same time as those tested in Experiment 1 but with less intensive training than with the first set. She did not perform better than the chance level. Finally, in Experiment 4, we tested the memory retention of another chimpanzee, Ai, who had learned to “label” objects with lexigrams more than 20 years earlier by using the matching task. She did not perform significantly better than chance on test trials. Thus, our results were not consistent across the experiments, providing only limited evidence that chimpanzees retain associative stimulus relations over the long term. Several factors, such as the effect of cognitive environments, the levels of processing, and the context-dependent nature of memory retrieval, could have affected our results, but none of these factors can account for all the results from the four experiments. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

ABSTRACT: We identified five distinct full-length human mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) genes containing either 984 amino acids (MR-984) or 988 amino acids (MR-988), which can be distinguished by the presence or absence of Lys, Cys, Ser, and Trp (KCSW) in their DNA-binding domain (DBD) and mutations at codons 180 and 241 in their amino-terminal domain (NTD). Two human MR-KCSW genes contain either (Val-180, Val-241) or (Ile-180, Val-241) in their NTD, and three human MR-984 genes contain either (Ile-180, Ala-241), (Val-180, Val-241), or (Ile-180, Val-241). Human MR-KCSW with (Ile-180, Ala-241) has not been cloned. In contrast, chimpanzees contain four MRs: two MR-988s with KCSW in their DBD, or two MR-984s without KCSW in their DBD. Chimpanzee MRs only contain (Ile180, Val-241) in their NTD. A chimpanzee MR with either (Val-180, Val-241) or (Ile-180, Ala-241) in the NTD has not been cloned. Gorillas and orangutans each contain one MR-988 with KCSW in the DBD and one MR-984 without KCSW, and these MRs only contain (Ile-180, Val-241) in their NTD. A gorilla MR or orangutan MR with either (Val-180, Val-241) or (Ile-180, Ala-241) in the NTD has not been cloned. Together, these data suggest that human MRs with (Val-180, Val-241) or (Ile-180, Ala-241) in the NTD evolved after humans and chimpanzees diverged from their common ancestor. Considering the multiple functions in human development of the MR in kidney, brain, heart, skin, and lungs, as well as MR activity in interaction with the glucocorticoid receptor, we suggest that the evolution of human MRs that are absent in chimpanzees may have been important in the evolution of humans from chimpanzees. Investigation of the physiological responses to corticosteroids mediated by the MR in humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans may provide insights into the evolution of humans and their closest relatives. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: As humans’ closest living relatives, chimpanzees offer valuable insights into human evolution. However, technical and ethical limitations hinder investigations into the molecular and cellular foundations that distinguish chimpanzee and human traits. Recently, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have emerged as a novel model for functional comparative studies and provided a non-invasive alternative for studying embryonic phenomena. In this study, we generated five new chimpanzee iPSC lines from peripheral blood cells and skin fibroblasts with SeV vectors carrying four reprogramming factors (human OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, and L-MYC) and characterized their pluripotency and differentiation potential. We also examined the expression of a human-specific non-coding RNA, HSTR1, which is predicted to be involved in human brain development. Our results show that the chimpanzee iPSCs possess pluripotent characteristics and can differentiate into various cell lineages. Moreover, we found that HSTR1 is expressed in human iPSCs and their neural derivatives but not in chimpanzee counterparts, supporting its possible role in human-specific brain development. As iPSCs are inherently variable due to genetic and epigenetic differences in donor cells or reprogramming procedures, it is essential to expand the number of chimpanzee iPSC lines to comprehensively capture the molecular and cellular properties representative of chimpanzees. Hence, our cells provide a valuable resource for investigating the function and regulation of human-specific transcripts such as HSTR1 and for understanding human evolution more generally. © The Society for In Vitro Biology 2024.

ABSTRACT: Local ecological knowledge (LEK), tied to specific cultures, is crucial for sustainability in conservation initiatives. Therefore, including holders of this knowledge in management decisions is essential. Collecting protected area-specific data on local people's attitudes, opinions and perceptions towards wildlife, especially for highly threatened species like great apes, is therefore crucial for effective conservation. This study emphasizes the importance of LEK as an interdisciplinary approach, highlighting its essential role in informing conservation decisions and understanding human–environment interactions. To fill the information gap on the LEK on the Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee in central Cameroon, we used questionnaires to assess the LEK of respondents specifically their perceptions, opinions and attitudes towards the population trend of chimpanzees, as well as their opinion about the current management systems of Mpem and Djim National Park. We collect data from 240 respondents in 15 villages in the neighbourhood of the park. Using generalized linear mixed models, we were also able to assess socioeconomic and demographic factors that correlate with the opinions, attitudes and perceptions of the respondents towards chimpanzee conservation. About 87% of the respondents exhibited good knowledge about chimpanzees and 59% reported taboos related to chimpanzees. About 94% were aware of laws that prohibit the hunting of chimpanzees, while 87% agreed that it is a good initiative to conserve chimpanzees, and 42% reported that their population increased. Almost half (52%) of the respondents said they were satisfied with the current park management system. Age, gender, education level, number of children in the household and time spent in the community were predictors that influenced the attitude, opinion and perception of the respondents while occupation and the geographic distance between the village and the park did not. Our findings suggest that raising awareness of human–chimpanzee coexistence through adult education programmes should target specific demographic groups, such as those with larger families, limited education, older age, individuals with lower LEK or native. These findings brought insights to guide future studies and should be taken into account when discussing regional management.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Several COVID-19 vaccines use adenovirus vectors to deliver the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. Immunization with these vaccines promotes immunity against the S protein, but against also the adenovirus itself. This could interfere with the entry of the vaccine into the cell, reducing its efficacy. Herein, we evaluate the efficiency of an adenovirus-vectored vaccine (chimpanzee ChAdOx1 adenovirus, AZD1222) in boosting the specific immunity compared to that induced by a recombinant receptor-binding domain (RBD)-based vaccine without viral vector. Mice immunized with the AZD1222 human vaccine were given a booster 6 months later, with either the homologous vaccine or a recombinant vaccine based on RBD of the delta variant, which was prevalent at the start of this study. A significant increase in anti-RBD antibody levels was observed in rRBD-boosted mice (31–61%) compared to those receiving two doses of AZD1222 (0%). Significantly higher rates of PepMix™- or RBD-elicited proliferation were also observed in IFNγ-producing CD4 and CD8 cells from mice boosted with one or two doses of RBD, respectively. The lower efficiency of the ChAdOx1-S vaccine in boosting specific immunity could be the result of a pre-existing anti-vector immunity, induced by increased levels of anti-adenovirus antibodies found both in mice and humans. Taken together, these results point to the importance of avoiding the recurrent use of the same adenovirus vector in individuals with immunity and memory against them. It also illustrates the disadvantages of ChAdOx1 adenovirus-vectored vaccine with respect to recombinant protein vaccines, which can be used without restriction in vaccine-booster programs. Key points: • ChAdOx1 adenovirus vaccine (AZD1222) may not be effective in boosting anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity • A recombinant RBD protein vaccine is effective in boosting anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity in mice • Antibodies elicited by the rRBD-delta vaccine persisted for up to 3 months in mice © 2024, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Precise estimates of population dynamics and social grouping patterns are required for effective conservation of wild animal populations. It is difficult to obtain such information on non-human great apes as they have slow reproductive rates. To gain a better understanding of demography in these populations, previous research has typically involved habituation\, a process that requires years. Here, we collected data continuously over year-long periods to monitor an unhabituated population of critically endangered Western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) in the Moyen Bafing National Park, Guinea. We used two arrays of 100 camera traps that were placed opportunistically in two distinct 100 km2 sites, named Bakoun and Koukoutamba. We identified 227 individuals in Bakoun and 207 in Koukoutamba through their unique facial features. Our camera trap data make clear that these individuals belong to six and seven closed groups, respectively. Six of those groups were near-completely sampled with an average minimum size of 46.8 individuals (range: 37–58), and a mean adult sex ratio of 1.32 (range: 0.93–2.10). We described the demographic composition of these groups and use Bayesian social network analysis to understand population structure. The network analyses suggested that the social bonds within the two populations were structured by sex homophily, with male chimpanzees being more or equally likely to be observed together than other adult associations. Through estimation of minimum convex polygons, we described the minimum home range for those groups. Compared to other chimpanzee groups living in a similar environment (mosaic savanna-forest), the Moyen Bafing region seems to host a high-density of chimpanzees with small home ranges for their group size. Our research highlights the potential of camera traps for studying the demographic composition of chimpanzee populations with high resolution and obtaining crucial information on several groups in a time-efficient and cost-effective way. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The decision to urinate involves a complex combination of both physiological and social considerations1,2,3. However, the social dimensions of urination remain largely unexplored. More specifically, aligning urination in time (i.e. synchrony) and the triggering of urination by observing similar behavior in others (i.e. social contagion) are thought to occur in humans across different cultures (Figure S1A), and possibly also in non-human animals. However, neither has been scientifically quantified in any species. Contagious urination, like other forms of behavioral and emotional state matching4, may have important implications in establishing and maintaining social cohesion, in addition to potential roles in preparation for collective departure5 (i.e. voiding before long-distance travel) and territorial scent-marking6 (i.e. coordination of chemosensory signals). Here, we report socially contagious urination in chimpanzees, one of our closest relatives, as measured through all-occurrence recording of 20 captive chimpanzees across >600 hours. Our results suggest that socially contagious urination may be an overlooked, and potentially widespread, facet of social behavior. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Many of the complex behaviours of humans involve the production of nonadjacent dependencies between sequence elements, which in part can be generated through the hierarchical organization of sequences. To understand how these structural properties of human behaviours evolved, we can gain valuable insight from studying the sequential behaviours of nonhuman animals. Among the behaviours of nonhuman apes, tool use has been hypothesised to be a domain of behaviour which likely involves hierarchical organization, and may therefore possess nonadjacent dependencies between sequential actions. However thus far, evidence supporting hierarchical organization of great-ape tool use comes from methodologies which have been criticised in their objectivity. Additionally, the extent to which nonadjacent dependencies appear in primate action sequences during tool use has not been formally investigated. We used estimations of mutual information (MI)—a measure of dependency strength between sequence elements—to evaluate both the extent to which wild chimpanzees produce nonadjacent dependencies during a naturalistic tool-use task (nut cracking), as well as how sequences of actions are likely organized during tool use. Half of adult chimpanzees produced nonadjacent dependencies at significantly greater sequential distances than comparable, nonhierarchical Markov models once repeated actions had been accounted for. Additionally, for the majority of chimpanzees, MI decay with increasing sequential distance included a power-law relationship, which is a key indicator that the action sequences produced by chimpanzees likely entail some degree of hierarchical organization. Our analysis offered the greatest support for a system of organization where short subroutines of actions (2–8 actions long) are hierarchically arranged into longer sequences—a finding which is consistent with previous qualitative descriptions of ape tool-use
behaviours. Interindividual variability was detected within our analysis in both the maximum distance dependencies were detected, and the most likely structuring mechanism for sequential action organization. We discuss these results in light of possible interindividual variation in the systems of action organization used by chimpanzees during tool use, in addition to methodological considerations for applications of MI estimations to sequential behaviours. Moreover, we discuss our main findings alongside hypotheses for the coevolution of complex syntax in language and tool-action across hominin evolutionary history. © Copyright 2024 Howard-Spink et al.

ABSTRACT: Because senescence impairs the ability of older males to compete successfully for mates, male reproductive strategies are expected to change with age. The terminal investment hypothesis proposes that older males, who could die soon, should take greater risks to obtain mating opportunities. Another possibility is that older males avoid such risks, adopting alternative reproductive tactics, such as increased affiliation with females, increased reliance on coalitions or sexual coercion to continue to compete with younger animals. We tested these hypotheses in wild chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, of the Kanyawara community, Kibale National Park, Uganda, where old males sire offspring at relatively high rates. Our data set included >40 000 incidents of male aggression and >5800 copulations observed between 2005 and 2017. We found that, even as their dominance status declined, old males maintained relatively high copulation rates, especially with established mothers. There was no evidence for terminal investment in response to ageing. Males became generally less aggressive as they aged. Neither did old males form affiliative bonds with females, nor use sexual coercion more frequently, as alternative reproductive tactics. Old males did, however, participate in coalitionary aggression at higher rates than young males and increased the proportion of their aggression that was coalitionary over time. Coalitions were positively associated with mating success, particularly for low- and middle-ranking males. These results support the hypothesis that ageing male chimpanzees use coalitions as an alternative reproductive tactic. The lack of evidence for terminal investment in response to ageing appears to reflect a broader mammalian pattern in which males who rely on fighting to secure mating opportunities avoid excessive risk taking as their formidability wanes. © 2024 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ABSTRACT: Objectives: Bonobos and chimpanzees do not differ from one another in overall frequencies of arboreality versus terrestriality as much as once thought. Thus, at a broad level, one would predict that there is little difference in foot morphology among Pan taxa. However, behavioral data suggest that bonobos more often use smaller diameter substrates (<10 cm) when climbing whereas western chimpanzees frequently climb larger diameter (>15 cm) substrates. This study tests the hypothesis that if Pan medial cuneiform and talus morphology reflects these substrate preferences, then the morphology of these bones should favor hallucial grasping in bonobos and an inverted foot set in western chimpanzees. Materials and Methods: Three-dimensional geometric morphometric (3DGM) methods were used to explore shape variation in 126 talus and 127 medial cuneiform 3D surface models acquired from 108 chimpanzees (24 western, four Nigeria-Cameroon, 33 central, 32 eastern, and 15 captive unknowns) and 22 bonobos. Results: The shapes of the talus and medial cuneiform in Pan covary as a functional unit emphasizing hallucial grasping with a less inverted foot set in bonobos and a more inverted foot set with a less abducted hallucial set in western chimpanzees. Other chimpanzee subspecies fall between these two extremes. Discussion: Bonobo and western chimpanzee medial cuneiform and talus shapes are consistent with their differing preferences for using smaller and larger diameter substrates, respectively, when vertically climbing. These results suggest that even among closely related taxa, foot, hand, and other postcranial anatomy may be fine-tuned for specific locomotor behaviors or preferences. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) have been jumping between non-human primates in West/Central Africa for thousands of years and yet, the HIV-1 epidemic only originated from a primate lentivirus over 100 years ago. Methods: This study examined the replicative fitness, transmission, restriction, and cytopathogenicity of 22 primate lentiviruses in primary human lymphoid tissue and both primary human and chimpanzee peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Findings: Pairwise competitions revealed that SIV from chimpanzees (cpz) had the highest replicative fitness in human or chimpanzee peripheral blood mononuclear cells, even higher fitness than HIV-1 group M strains responsible for worldwide epidemic. The SIV strains belonging to the “HIV-2 lineage” (including SIVsmm, SIVmac, SIVagm) had the lowest replicative fitness. SIVcpz strains were less inhibited by human restriction factors than the “HIV-2 lineage” strains. SIVcpz efficiently replicated in human tonsillar tissue but did not deplete CD4+ T-cells, consistent with the slow or nonpathogenic disease observed in most chimpanzees. In contrast, HIV-1 isolates and SIV of the HIV-2 lineage were pathogenic to the human tonsillar tissue, almost independent of the level of virus replication. Interpretation: Of all primate lentiviruses, SIV from chimpanzees appears most capable of infecting and replicating in humans, establishing HIV-1. SIV from other Old World monkeys, e.g. the progenitor of HIV-2, replicate slowly in humans due in part to restriction factors. Nonetheless, many of these SIV strains were more pathogenic than SIVcpz. Either SIVcpz evolved into a more pathogenic virus while in humans or a rare SIVcpz, possibly extinct in chimpanzees, was pathogenic immediately following the jump into human.

ABSTRACT: Measuring the relative contributions of milk and non-milk foods in the diets of primate infants is difficult from observations. Stable carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) isotopes in hair can be used to physiologically track infant feeding through development, but few wild studies have done so, likely due to the difficulty in collecting hair non-invasively. We assessed infant feeding at different ages in wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) at Ngogo, Uganda using δ13C and δ15N of keratin in 164 naturally shed hairs from 29 infants (61 hairs), 6 juveniles (7 hairs), 28 mothers (67 hairs) and 14 adult males (29 hairs). Hairs were collected when they stuck to feces during defecation or from the ground after chimpanzees groomed or rested. We could not distinguish between the hairs of infants and mothers using strand length and diameter. Infants 1–2 years old were most enriched in 13C and 15N and showed means of 1.1‰ in δ13C and 2.1‰ in δ15N above their mothers. Infants at 2 years had hair δ13C values like those of their mothers, which suggests infants began relying more heavily on plants around this age. While mother-infant δ13C and δ15N differences generally decreased with offspring age, as is expected when infants rely increasingly more on independent foraging through development, milk seemed to remain an important dietary component for infants older than 2.5 years, as evidenced by continuing elevated δ15N. We showed that stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes in naturally shed hairs can feasibly detect trophic level differences between chimpanzee infants and mothers. Since it can mitigate some of the limitations associated with behavioral and fecal stable isotope data, the use of hair stable isotopes is a useful, non-invasive tool for assessing infant feeding development in wild primates. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Objectives: Facial width-to-height ratio (fWHR) has been widely investigated in the context of its role in visual communication, though there is a lack of consensus about how fWHR serves as a social signal. To better understand fWHR variation in a comparative context, we investigate the associations between fWHR and canine crown height (CCH) and body mass, respectively, among two chimpanzee subspecies (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and bonobos (Pan paniscus). Materials and Methods: We collected landmark data from 3D surface models of 86 Pan cranial specimens to quantify fWHR and upper CCH, and to estimate body mass. We used Spearman's r and Kruskal-Wallis tests to test for significant relationships among variables, and to assess sexual dimorphism. Results: There is an inverse relationship between fWHR and CCH in both sexes of Pan, however there are interpopulation differences in the relationship between fWHR and CCH among Pan taxa. Pan paniscus have relatively wide faces and small canine crowns, and wide faces in Pan t. schweinfurthii males may be driven by body size constraints. Pan troglodytes and Pan paniscus show fWHR dimorphism, and Pan paniscus have significantly higher fWHRs than do either Pan troglodytes subspecies. Discussion: Our findings indicate that CCH and facial breadth may serve subtly different signaling functions among Pan taxa. Further research into the circumstances in which wide faces evolved among chimpanzees and bonobos will likely afford deeper insights into the function of relatively wide faces in the context of visual signaling among humans and our extinct hominin relatives. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Identifying novel medicinal resources in chimpanzee diets has historically presented challenges, requiring extensive behavioral data collection and health monitoring, accompanied by expensive pharmacological analyses. When putative therapeutic self-medicative behaviors are observed, these events are often considered isolated occurrences, with little attention paid to other resources ingested in combination. For chimpanzees, medicinal resource combinations could play an important role in maintaining well-being by tackling different symptoms of an illness, chemically strengthening efficacy of a treatment, or providing prophylactic compounds that prevent future ailments. We call this concept the self-medicative resource combination hypothesis. However, a dearth of methodological approaches for holistically investigating primate feeding ecology has limited our ability to identify nonrandom resource combinations and explore potential synergistic relationships between medicinal resource candidates. Here we present two analytical tools that test such a hypothesis and demonstrate these approaches on feeding data from the Sonso chimpanzee community in Budongo Forest, Uganda. Using 4 months of data, we establish that both collocation and APRIORI analyses are effective exploratory tools for identifying binary combinations, and that APRIORI is effective for multi-item rule associations. We then compare outputs from both methods, finding up to 60% agreement, and propose APRIORI as more effective for studies requiring control over confidence intervals and those investigating nonrandom associations between more than two resources. These analytical tools, which can be extrapolated across the animal kingdom, can provide a cost-effective and efficient method for targeting resources for further pharmacological investigation, potentially aiding in the discovery of novel medicines. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Aim: The purported defining features of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) biogeography are sometimes simplistic and contradictory, yet we rely on these metrics to shape conservation and management planning for this endangered ape. We analysed the cover and configuration of woody vegetation at the northern margins of the species' range in Senegal to elucidate key predictors of chimpanzee biogeography. Location: Southeastern Senegal. Taxa: Western chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus). Methods: We combined reconnaissance surveys and interviews with published accounts of chimpanzee presence to verify previous estimates of the range limits of the species. High-resolution, multispectral satellite images were used to quantify the configuration of trees and shrubs at each site. Woody vegetation cover and physiognomy, river density and road density were compared within and outside of the species range with generalised linear mixed models. Results: Our surveys and interviews support the current estimates of the northern limits of the species range. Chimpanzee-occupied sites had more patchily-distributed vegetation, greater patch edge complexity, and slightly higher river density than unoccupied sites. Unoccupied sites had more woody vegetation cover and higher road density. Of all predictors, roads had the highest impact on chimpanzee occupancy. Main Conclusions: In line with previous findings, anthropogenic modifications of the landscape had a strong impact on chimpanzee occupancy, but surprisingly, woody vegetation cover was negatively associated with chimpanzee occupancy in this region. Instead, more specific metrics of vegetation configuration were positively associated with chimpanzee site occupancy, indicating that precise measures are needed for assessing chimpanzee biogeography at the landscape scale. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzee insectivory is seasonally variable, with pronounced peaks or set seasonal periods of consumption observed in most chimpanzee communities. This variation is interesting given that chimpanzees invest considerable effort into complex tool-using behaviors to acquire insect prey. Evidence suggests this seasonal variation is related to insect behavior, but few studies have been done to empirically examine this relationship. In this study, we assessed whether a seasonal pattern of termite fishing by Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes ellioti) in Mbam & Djerem National Park, Cameroon was driven by termite behavior. We measured termite presence and termite foraging activity monthly at seven termite mounds near Ganga Research Station from April 2022 to April 2023. Macroscopic fecal analysis and camera traps placed at each mound demonstrated termite fishing in this community occurred from March to June, with a rare smaller period of termite fishing in October 2021. Average monthly rainfall, average monthly temperature, and average monthly fruit availability were used to examine potential environmental factors that could impact termite fishing seasonality. Termite presence was significantly different between months with and without chimpanzee termite fishing (t-test, −6.569, p <.001). Termite presence was also significantly associated with average monthly rainfall (ANOVA, F = 13.9, p =.002, R2 =.775). Termites in this region appear to respond to the transition from dry to wet seasons by moving closer to the soil surface. This corresponds with greater chimpanzee termite fishing, suggesting that termite accessibility may be driving seasonal variation in this behavior. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Although chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (Pan paniscus) share a multi-male/multi-female societal organization and form male-philopatric groups, disparities in terms of male aggression and stability of temporary parties are thought to exist among them. However, existing research in bonobos has mainly focused on the high social status, prolonged receptivity, and characteristic sexual behaviors of females, leaving the behaviors of males understudied. Moreover, prior comparative studies on Pan suffer from methodological inconsistencies. This study addresses these gaps by employing a uniform observation method to explore party attendance and aggressive interactions among male bonobos in Wamba and male chimpanzees in Kalinzu. Unlike male chimpanzees, which exhibit dispersion in the absence of receptive females in the group, male bonobos showed a lesser degree of such dispersion. Although the overall frequency of aggressive interactions per observation unit did not significantly differ between the two species, the nature of these interactions varied. Notably, severe aggressive behaviors such as physical confrontations among adult males were absent in bonobos, with most aggression occurring between the sons of the two highest-ranking females. Additionally, in bonobos, females actively engaged in polyadic aggressive behavior as aggressors, while all instances of coalitionary aggression in chimpanzees originated from male aggressors. These findings underscore the substantial impact of female behaviors on the observed distinctions in male aggressive interactions between the two species. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Japan Monkey Centre 2024.

ABSTRACT: Several primate species use tools for a wide variety of functions, such as probing or obtaining out-of-reach food, both in captivity and in the wild. Given the ubiquitous presence of plants, the study of plant tool use may serve as a proxy to reconstruct archeologically invisible aspects of early human behavior. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are the most prolific non-human primate tool users. We evaluated the use of two artificial mounds filled with food in two groups of sanctuary-housed chimpanzees (N = 14) at Fundació Mona (Girona, Spain). We assessed how the group, the use and size of tools, posture, and the type of substratum affected chimpanzee behavior during an enrichment task that replicated termite fishing observed in wild chimpanzees. We also focused on the grasping postures and explored the manual laterality of individuals performing the task. We analyzed 290 min of video footage, including 5736 bouts of extractive foraging. Our results showed that individuals mainly performed the task alone, sitting on the ground, and probing with larger, rather than smaller, tools. Ten individuals showed manual preference: two showed a preference for using the left hand, while eight showed a preference for the right. Additionally, chimpanzees tended to use a variety of unimanual grip strategies. This study highlights the impact that enrichment activities that mimic realistic scenarios can have on the manual capacities of captive chimpanzees, enhancing the opportunity to develop further comparative studies with wild chimpanzees to understand the evolution of the manual abilities in human and non-human primates. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

ABSTRACT: Under the obstetrical dilemma hypothesis, sexual dimorphism in pelvic shape is a solution to accommodate high fetopelvic constraints. It is therefore unclear why chimpanzees display a human-like pattern of pelvic sexual dimorphism despite having easier births enabled by small neonates and capacious pelvic canals. Here we reassessed chimpanzee fetopelvic fit using three-dimensional simulations, revealing a similarly constricted midpelvis as in humans, with even narrower outlet dimensions. Geometric morphometric analyses confirm that female chimpanzees have larger pelvic canals than males despite a smaller body size and a morphology that maximizes pelvic dimensions favourable for parturition, particularly in smaller-bodied individuals. Together with evidence for increased neurological immaturity at birth relative to monkeys, our findings imply substantial obstetric constraints in chimpanzees and possibly other apes. We therefore propose that difficult birth did not arise abruptly in Homo with increasing encephalization but evolved gradually through a series of obstetric compromises from an already constricted birth canal shared across anthropoid primates. Specifically, we propose that obstetric selection pressures exacerbated incrementally with the stiffening of the symphysis that accompanied body size increase in hominoids, while subsequent adaptations to bipedalism shortened the ilium. The resulting contorted birth canal required obligatory fetal rotation, thus greatly increasing birth difficulty. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.

ABSTRACT: Heart rate measurements can be useful for the monitoring of both physical and mental condition in humans and nonhuman animals. Yet, information about heart rates in chimpanzees, who are phylogenetically the closest species to humans, is scarce. Existing data on chimpanzee heart rates have mainly been collected from chimpanzees under anesthesia. To address this issue, we conducted electrocardiogram recordings in captive chimpanzees under normal conditions without anesthesia based on positive reinforcement training. We obtained a total of 771 recordings from 35 individuals (22 males and 13 females, 14–53 years old) with no cardiac problems. The females had a higher heart rate than the male chimpanzees, and heart rate decreased as a function of age. In addition, heart rate was lower in the morning and increased during the day. Overall, the mean heart rate of adult males was 86.5 beats/min, and that of female chimpanzees 106.4 beats/min. Our data could serve as a reference point for future research and health-based monitoring of chimpanzee heart rates. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Japan Monkey Centre 2024.

ABSTRACT: Background: Accumulating evidence indicates that some ape species produce more alarm behaviors to potential dangers when in the presence of uninformed conspecifics. However, since previous studies presented naturalistic stimuli, the influence of prior experience could not be controlled for. Method: To examine this, we investigated whether apes (wild chimpanzees of the Budongo Forest, Uganda) would communicate differently about a novel danger (an unusually large spider) depending on whether they were with an uniformed conspecific. We tested nine adult males, four of which were exposed to the danger twice alone (Non-Social group), while the remaining five were exposed to the danger first alone and then in the presence of conspecifics (Social group). Results: We found that both alarm calling and gaze marking (i.e., persistent gaze after stimulus detection) were more persistent in the Social than Non-Social group, although the effect of condition only reached statistical significance for gaze marking, nonetheless suggesting that chimpanzees tailored their warning behavior to the presence of others, even if they were already familiar with the potential threat.  © 2024 Taylor et al.

ABSTRACT: Studying nocturnal behavior is crucial for understanding the full scope of a species' behavioral flexibility so as to inform the conservation of wild populations and the care of captive individuals. However, this aspect of primate behavior is understudied, especially in great apes, which exhibit some of the widest documented behavioral diversity and flexibility. Our investigation is among the first to systematically compare the 24 h activity patterns and behavioral activities of captive chimpanzees (Saint Louis Zoo, USA) with those of wild chimpanzees (three sites across the Nouabalé-Ndoki National Park in the Republic of Congo) and a published data set of the nocturnal behavior of all chimpanzee subspecies. Furthermore, we examined the influence of human activity and changes to the group's composition on the activity patterns and nocturnal behaviors of the zoo-living chimpanzees. Our results reveal that the zoo-living chimpanzees exhibit significantly different activity patterns compared to their wild counterparts, with increased nocturnal activity (particularly in the early morning) and more observations of feeding and social behaviors at night. Additionally, the absence of human visitors and a change in the group's composition were found to influence these activity patterns. These findings underscore the importance of integrating more holistic approaches to captive primate care and wild primate conservation. This study also highlights the immense potential of implementing remote monitoring technology, such as video camera traps, across contexts. Such data that extend across contexts benefit not only the captive and wild great apes but also provide opportunities for caregivers, conservation managers, and students who are involved in these collaborative initiatives. © 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT: Humans regularly engage in efficient communicative conversations, which serve to socially align individuals1. In conversations, we take fast-paced turns using a human-universal structure of deploying and receiving signals which shows consistent timing across cultures2. We report here that chimpanzees also engage in rapid signal-to-signal turn-taking during face-to-face gestural exchanges with a similar average latency between turns to that of human conversation. This correspondence between human and chimpanzee face-to-face communication points to shared underlying rules in communication. These structures could be derived from shared ancestral mechanisms or convergent strategies that enhance coordinated interactions or manage competition for communicative ‘space’. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: In mammals, robust connection between mothers and offspring plays pivotal roles in physiological and socioemotional development. Our study investigated the consequences of early maternal deprivation on social play behaviour in immature chimpanzees, examining expected and unexpected findings. In line with the predicted hypothesis, orphaned individuals exhibited lower frequencies of social play than mother-reared chimpanzees, supporting traditional notions of the indispensable role of maternal influence in the correct expression of social behaviours. However, the absence of discernible differences in the variability and roughness of playful patterns, tested for the first time in orphan and mother-reared chimpanzees, suggests that the presence of adult models may not be fundamental for expanding and regulating immature playful behavioural repertoire. Escalation into overt aggression did not differ between orphan and mother-reared chimpanzees, challenging the idea of the crucial role of maternal investment in developing self-restrain abilities during play. Orphans engaged in shorter sessions compared with mother-reared subjects; this strategy is naturally adopted by wild and captive chimpanzees when they need to cope with the risk of escalation during play fighting. Although maternal deprivation has been linked to anxiety-related and depressive behaviours in primates, our results reveal a degree of behavioural resilience in orphans that are still able to adhere to social rules during play, particularly when having contact with their peers. Although play behaviour development can arise from the multifaceted interconnection between early experiences, social dynamics and individual propensity to interact socially, our findings support the view, emerging from a plethora of studies on many social mammals, that play has an irreplaceable role in an individual's life history. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Fission–fusion social systems allow individuals to make flexible choices about where, with whom, and in what contexts to spend their time in response to competing social and ecological pressures. The ability for fission–fusion societies to support individual behavioral strategies that vary across contexts has been suggested, but the potential function of such context-specific social choices remains largely understudied. We adopted the concept of social niche construction to explore possible differences in social complexity at the individual and group level across feeding contexts. Specifically, we examined patterns of co-attendance across two common ecological contexts in wild Central African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) in the Goualougo Triangle, Republic of Congo. From data compiled over 6 years, we used multidimensional social network analysis to study the patterns of co-attendance generated from 436 group scans at Ficus and 4527 visits to termite mounds. These two contexts were chosen, because they are both fixed spatial features across the landscape that serve as well-defined points to compare association patterns. We identified context-specific social niche construction in a fission–fusion chimpanzee society that produce different patterns of relationships and social complexity that are consistent in their expression over many years, and offer functional benefits. While enhancing our understanding of chimpanzee behavioral strategies, culture, and conservation, our investigation also indicates that the social niche construction framework aids in elucidating the evolutionary advantages of fission–fusion sociality by accounting for intra- and interindividual variability, cognition, and choice in newfound ways. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: The comparative analysis between humans and non-human primates is an instrumental approach for elucidating the evolutional traits and disease propensity of humans. However, in primates, cross-species analyses of their developmental events have encountered constraints because of the ethical and technical limitations in available sample collection, sequential monitoring, and manipulations. In an endeavor to surmount these challenges, in recent years, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have garnered escalating interest as an in vitro tool for cross-species analyses between humans and non-human primates. Meanwhile, compared to humans, there is less information on in vitro differentiation of non-human primate iPSCs, and their genetic diversity including subspecies may cause different eligibility to in vitro differentiation methods. Therefore, antecedent to embarking on a comparative analysis to humans, it is a prerequisite to develop the efficacious methodologies for in vitro differentiation regardless of the intraspecies genetic background in non-human primates. In this study, we executed the in vitro differentiation of cardiomyocytes from four chimpanzee iPSC lines with different subspecies and individual backgrounds. To induce cardiomyocytes from chimpanzee iPSCs, we evaluated our methodology for in vitro cardiac differentiation of human iPSCs. Eventually, with minor alterations, our cardiac differentiation method was applicable to all chimpanzee iPSC lines tested as assessed by the expression of cardiac marker genes and the beating ability. Hence, our in vitro differentiation method will advance iPSC-based research of chimpanzee cardiac development and also hold possible utility to cross-species analyses among primate species. © The Society for In Vitro Biology 2024.

ABSTRACT: One way mammalian mothers support offspring is by intervening on their behalf when they receive conspecific aggression. Maternal intervention protects offspring and facilitates mother–offspring rank correlation in several female-philopatric species. We tested the hypothesis that maternal intervention during development similarly facilitates mother–offspring rank correlation in one of our two male-philopatric closest living relatives: bonobos, Pan paniscus, for whom male ranks have been described as matrifocal but mechanisms of status transmission are unclear. We predicted mothers would intervene at higher rates in bonobos compared to chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, where sons earn adult ranks independently. We expected this difference would be especially pronounced for sons as they reached reproductive age (∼8 years) and when aggressors were adult males, which female bonobos, but not female chimpanzees, often dominate. However, for both sons and daughters of all ages (0.5–16 years) and against aggressors of varying age and sex, bonobo mothers in Kokolopori, DRC (N = 22 pairs, 210 conflicts) intervened less frequently than did chimpanzee mothers at Ngogo, Uganda (N = 66 pairs, 221 conflicts), doing so in 8% versus 49% of all conflicts. These differences persisted regardless of the severity of aggression offspring received and the distress they demonstrated. Our results provide no support for our hypothesis that conflict intervention facilitates mother–son rank correlation in bonobos. Nor are patterns explained by additional alternative hypotheses related to species variation in costs of retaliation, quality of female–female relationships or infanticide risk. We introduce two new hypotheses: (1) that success in aggressive competition is less important for male bonobos than for male chimpanzees and (2) proclivities for support are heightened in chimpanzees compared to bonobos because of increased ingroup protectiveness in chimpanzees. The latter hypothesis arises from our unexpected, preliminary observation that nonmother bonobo bystanders intervened less often than nonmother chimpanzee bystanders during these events. © 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ABSTRACT: Objectives: Self-domestication theory and preliminary data suggest that western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) could have smaller brains than eastern chimpanzees (P. t. schweinfurthii), but no large-scale studies of chimpanzee endocranial volume (ECV) have tested this. This study compares ECV of wild adult P. t. verus and P. t. schweinfurthii, along with femoral head diameter (FHD; an index of body size), bizygomatic breadth (BZB) and palate length (PAL). Materials and Methods: Adult crania of P. t. schweinfurthii (60 females, 90 males, from Uganda and Democratic Republic of Congo) and P. t. verus (43 females, 37 males, from Liberia and Ivory Coast) were sampled. ECV was measured using 3 mm diameter glass beads, and FHD, PAL, and BZB with digital calipers. Quantities of interest were estimated using Bayesian inference. Results: No meaningful differences were found between subspecies on average in ECV, FHD, or the relationship between ECV and FHD. Within countries and subspecies, ECV varied widely among individuals, partly because males had higher ECV on average than females. When sex was controlled for, ECV was unrelated to FHD. Within subspecies there was no evidence of meaningful differences in average ECV among countries. PAL was the only measure that differed between subspecies on average, being shorter in P. t. verus females. Discussion: Current data show that within sexes, mean ECV is similar between P. t. verus and P. t. schweinfurthii. This suggests that average brain size in chimpanzees has remained unchanged for ~0.7 million years, in contrast to orangutans (Pongo) and humans. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT: Living organisms throughout the animal kingdom habitually communicate with multi-modal signals that use multiple sensory channels. Such composite signals vary in their communicative function, as well as the extent to which they are recombined freely. Humans typically display complex forms of multi-modal communication, yet the evolution of this capacity remains unknown. One of our two closest living relatives, chimpanzees, also produce multi-modal combinations and therefore may offer a valuable window into the evolutionary roots of human communication. However, a currently neglected step in describing multi-modal systems is to disentangle non-random combinations from those that occur simply by chance. Here we aimed to provide a systematic quantification of communicative behaviour in our closest living relatives, describing non-random combinations produced across auditory and visual modalities. Through recording the behaviour of wild chimpanzees from the Kibale forest, Uganda we generated the first repertoire of non-random combined vocal and visual components. Using collocation analysis, we identified more than 100 vocal-visual combinations which occurred more frequently than expected by chance. We also probed how multi-modal production varied in the population, finding no differences in the number of visual components produced with vocalisations as a function of age, sex or rank. As expected, chimpanzees produced more visual components alongside vocalizations during longer vocalization bouts, however, this was only the case for some vocalization types, not others. We demonstrate that chimpanzees produce a vast array of combined vocal and visual components, exhibiting a hitherto underappreciated level of multi-modal complexity. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Primate social organizations, or grouping patterns, vary significantly across species. Behavioral strategies that allow for flexibility in grouping patterns offer a means to reduce the costs of group living. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) have a fission-fusion social system in which temporary subgroups (“parties”) change in composition because of local socio-ecological conditions. Notably, western chimpanzees (P. t. verus) are described as showing a higher degree of bisexual bonding and association than eastern chimpanzees, and eastern female chimpanzees (P. t. schweinfurthii) are thought to be more solitary than western female chimpanzees. However, reported comparisons in sociality currently depend on a small number of study groups, particularly in western chimpanzees, and variation in methods. The inclusion of additional communities and direct comparison using the same methods are essential to assess whether reported subspecies differences in sociality hold in this behaviorally heterogeneous species. We explored whether sociality differs between two communities of chimpanzees using the same motion-triggered camera technology and definitions of social measures. We compare party size and composition (party type, sex ratio) between the western Gahtoy community in the Nimba Mountains (Guinea) and the eastern Waibira community in the Budongo Forest (Uganda). Once potential competition for resources such as food and mating opportunities were controlled for, subspecies did not substantially influence the number of individuals in a party. We found a higher sex-ratio, indicating more males in a party, in Waibira; this pattern was driven by a greater likelihood in Gahtoy to be in all-female parties. This finding is the opposite of what was expected for eastern chimpanzees, where female-only parties are predicted to be more common. Our results highlight the flexibility in chimpanzee sociality, and caution against subspecies level generalizations. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The motivational value of visual infant stimuli in humans is considered to encourage parental behavior. To explore the evolutionary roots of this preference for infants, we examined the reward value of conspecific infant videos compared to adult ones in nine chimpanzees. We employed a novel approach, a simultaneous discrimination task with differential sensory reinforcement. In Experiments 1 and 2, we tested if watching conspecific infant videos is more rewarding than watching adult ones. Participants were required to discriminate between two visual stimuli by a touch panel task. In video reward trials, a video clip featuring a chimpanzee infant followed a correct choice, while one featuring an adult followed an incorrect choice. However, the percentage of correct choices did not significantly differ from chance except in one chimpanzee, indicating that chimpanzees did not exhibit a preference for watching infant videos over those of adult. In Experiment 3, we tested if chimpanzees prefer conspecific videos over a blank screen; however, we did not find evidence either at a group level. These results suggest that the incentive salience of infant stimuli may not be universally compelling across species. Additionally, we discuss the limitations of the task using sensory reinforcement. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT: We report a record made in 1682, in Sierra Leone, West Africa, of local people showing a European visitor evidence of ‘apes’ using sticks to obtain oysters as food. Circumstantial evidence suggests that the observation can only refer to the western chimpanzee Pan troglodytes verus and the West African mangrove oyster Crassostrea tulipa. This appears to be the only known record of wild chimpanzees eating marine bivalves, and of using tools to obtain any aquatic animal prey. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Full-length hepatitis B virus (HBV) transcripts of chimpanzees and patients treated with multidose (MD) HBV siRNA ARC-520 and entecavir (ETV) were characterized by single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing, identifying multiple types of transcripts with the potential to encode HBx, HBsAg, HBeAg, core, and polymerase, as well as transcripts likely to be derived from dimers of dslDNA, and these differed between HBeAg-positive (HBeAg+) and HBeAg-negative (HBeAg−) individuals. HBV transcripts from the last follow-up ~30 months post-ARC-520 treatment were categorized from one HBeAg+ (one of two previously highly viremic patients that became HBeAg− upon treatment and had greatly reduced cccDNA products) and four HBeAg− patients. The previously HBeAg+ patient received a biopsy that revealed that he had 3.4 copies/cell cccDNA (two to three orders of magnitude more cccDNA than HBeAg− chimpanzees) but expressed primarily truncated X and HBsAg from iDNA, like two patients that were HBeAg− at the start of the study and had one copy/cell cccDNA. No HBV transcripts were detected in two other HBeAg− patients that had ~0.3 copies/cell cccDNA, one of which had seroconverted for HBsAg. The paucity of cccDNA-derived transcripts in the presence of high cccDNA demonstrates the transcriptional silencing of HBV following MD siRNA treatment with ETV. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Three captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) were scheduled for diagnostic and surgical procedures under general anaesthesia. After premedication with oral midazolam (0.2 mg kg−1) and intramuscular medetomidine (20 µg kg−1) and ketamine (3 mg kg−1), anaesthesia was induced with intravenous propofol (1–4 mg kg−1). The animals were then maintained under general anaesthesia with propofol partial intravenous anaesthesia (0.10–0.17 mg kg−1 min−1) and isoflurane. On four occasions, the anaesthetised animals received fentanyl (1–3 µg kg−1 h−1) and ketamine (5–10 µg kg−1 min−1) infusions for analgesia. All animals recovered uneventfully. This case series details the anaesthetic protocols used, the challenges presented to the anaesthetist by this species and the peri-anaesthetic complications observed. It also introduces the use of propofol total intravenous anaesthesia as an option for safe transportation of captive chimpanzees between facilities. © 2024 British Veterinary Association.

ABSTRACT: Compassion fatigue (CF) refers to the exhaustion and distress caused by the demands of caring for others. CF occurs in a variety of helping professions, including physicians, nurses, educators, social workers and animal caregivers, and is known to adversely impact both caregivers’ quality of life and the care they provide. This study assessed the prevalence, risk and protective factors, coping strategies and support programs for CF in chimpanzee caregivers (N = 123) at accredited sanctuaries and zoos in the United States. Online survey results revealed that 91.06% of chimpanzee caregivers experienced CF at some point in their careers. Common CF symptoms were exhaustion, frustration, anxiety, depression, and apathy. Perceived factors influencing CF included being understaffed, lacking resources and training, poor relationships with coworkers and supervisors, and financial insecurity. Commonly reported coping strategies were talking to someone, having pets, self-care, and getting away from work. 20.33% of caregivers reported having institutional support programs available to them, however they were rarely viewed as helpful and 32.52% of respondents were unsure about program availability. Overall, our findings suggest that, like other caregiving professionals, chimpanzee caregivers are susceptible to CF and may benefit from new or updated support programs that continue to build a ‘culture of care’ that meets employee, animal, and facility needs. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are caught in snares set for other animals and sometimes injure or lose body parts. Snaring can compromise the health, growth, survival, and behavior of chimpanzees and, thus, represents a threat for the conservation of this endangered species. During a long-term study of chimpanzees at Ngogo in Kibale National Park, Uganda, we started a project to remove snares in and around their territory. We compared the number of times chimpanzees were snared during the 12.75 years after the start of this project with the number of times individuals were snared during the previous 14 years. Only one chimpanzee was snared after we began removing snares compared with 12 individuals caught during the period before. This represents a clear reduction in the risk created by snaring at this site and suggests that removing snares can be employed to protect chimpanzees. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Japan Monkey Centre 2024.

ABSTRACT: Morphological studies typically avoid using osteological samples that derive from captive animals because it is assumed that their morphology is not representative of wild populations. Rearing environments indeed differ between wild and captive individuals. For example, mechanical properties of the diets provided to captive animals can be drastically different from the food present in their natural habitats, which could impact cranial morphology and dental health. Here, we examine morphological differences in the maxillae of wild versus captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) given the prominence of this species in comparative samples used in human evolution research and the key role of the maxilla in such studies. Size and shape were analysed using three-dimensional geometric morphometric methods based on computed tomography scans of 94 wild and 30 captive specimens. Captive individuals have on average larger and more asymmetrical maxillae than wild chimpanzees, and significant differences are present in their maxillary shapes. A large proportion of these shape differences are attributable to static allometry, but wild and captive specimens still differ significantly from each other after allometric size adjustment of the shape data. Levels of shape variation are higher in the captive group, while the degree of size variation is likely similar in our two samples. Results are discussed in the context of ontogenetic growth trajectories, changes in dietary texture, an altered social environment, and generational differences. Additionally, sample simulations show that size and shape differences between chimpanzees and bonobos (Pan paniscus) are exaggerated when part of the wild sample is replaced with captive chimpanzees. Overall, this study confirms that maxillae of captive chimpanzees should not be included in morphological or taxonomic analyses when the objective is to characterise the species. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: We report the presence of habitual ground nesting in a newly studied East African chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) population in the Bugoma Central Forest Reserve, Uganda. Across a 2-year period, we encountered 891 night nests, 189 of which were classified as ground nests, a rate of ~21%. We find no preliminary evidence of socio-ecological factors that would promote its use and highlight local factors, such as high incidence of forest disturbance due to poaching and logging, which appear to make its use disadvantageous. While further study is required to establish whether this behavior meets the strict criteria for nonhuman animal culture, we support the argument that the wider use of population and group-specific behavioral repertoires in flagship species, such as chimpanzees, offers a tool to promote the urgent conservation action needed to protect threatened ecosystems, including the Bugoma forest. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Nematodes belonging to the genus Oesophagostomum frequently infect wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) across widely separated field sites. Nodular lesions (granulomas) containing Oesophagostomum are commonly seen in the abdomen of infected chimpanzees post-mortem. At Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire, previous studies have identified larvae of a variety of Oesophagostomum spp. in wild chimpanzee stool, based on sequencing of larval DNA, and nodular lesions associated with Oesophagostomum, identified morphologically to the genus level but not sequenced. Here we present three recent cases of parasitic granulomas found post-mortem in chimpanzees at Taï. We complement descriptions of gross pathology, histopathology and parasitology with PCR and sequencing of DNA isolated from the parasitic nodules and from adult worms found inside the nodules. In all three cases, we identify Oesophagostomum stephanostomum as the causative agent. The sequences from this study were identical to the only other published sequences from nodules in nonhuman primates—those from the wild chimpanzees of Gombe, Tanzania. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The Niokolo Koba National Park (NKNP) is the largest protected area in Senegal and lies at the northern limit of the chimpanzee’s range in West Africa. Recent information on nesting behavior and factors influencing nesting behavior is available for several sites outside NKNP. However, the information available for NKNP is obsolete. Considering that the adequate management of chimpanzee populations cannot be achieved without strong scientific knowledge, it is essential to update data on chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes verus, nesting behavior in NKNP. For this reason, we surveyed their habitat in Mt. Assirik and recorded 626 chimpanzee nests. The results of the study showed that chimpanzees nest more often in closed-canopy habitats such as gallery forests. The average nest height observed in this study was 8.07 ± 0.36 m, varying between 2 and 20 m, which is well below the heights described in most sites where chimpanzees cohabit with large carnivores. Botanical surveys confirmed that chimpanzees select tree species bearing their nests. In Assirik, 12 of the 37 tree species bearing nests are the most used. The nest decay rate (or the time it takes for a nest to go from the fresh to the skeletal stage) at Assirik averaged 68.8 ± 5.8 days. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Wild chimpanzees drum on tree buttresses during dominance displays and travel, generating low-frequency sounds that are audible over distances of more than 1 km. Western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) in the Nimba Mountains of Guinea selectively choose trees and buttresses when drumming, potentially based on their resonant properties, suggesting that these chimpanzees are optimizing their drumming signals. We investigated whether male eastern chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) from the Waibira community in the Budongo Forest, Uganda, also show preferences in tree and buttress choice, exploring whether selectivity is a species-wide feature. We tested chimpanzee preferences for tree species and diameter, number of buttresses, and buttress area and width, by comparing trees and buttresses used in drumming bouts with nearby unused trees and buttresses. Waibira chimpanzees drummed preferentially on two tree species: the tropical hardwood Cynometra alexandrii and the softwood Chrysophyllum albidum. Chimpanzees selected trees with a larger diameter over nearby trees with a smaller diameter, and buttresses were more likely to be used for drumming if they had a larger area or larger width. These results suggest that chimpanzees in the Waibira community select trees and buttresses based on physical properties, most likely related to acoustically relevant characteristics. These findings support the argument that buttress drumming is a goal-directed behavior and contributes to our understanding of chimpanzees' use and optimization of their long-distance acoustic signals. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Objectives: This study tests if femoral and humeral cross-sectional geometry (CSG) and cross-sectional properties (CSPs) in an ontogenetic series of wild-caught chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes ssp.) reflect locomotor behavior during development. The goal is to clarify the relationship between limb bone structure and locomotor behavior during ontogeny in Pan. Materials and Methods: The latex cast method was used to reconstruct cross sections at the midshaft femur and mid-distal humerus. Second moments of area (SMAs) (Ix, Iy, Imax, Imin), which are proportional to bending rigidity about a specified axis, and the polar SMA (J), which is proportional to average bending rigidity, were calculated at section locations. Cross-sectional shape (CSS) was assessed from Ix/Iy and Imax/Imin ratios. Juvenile and adult subsamples were compared. Results: Juveniles and adults have significantly greater femoral J compared to humeral J. Mean interlimb proportions of J are not significantly different between the groups. There is an overall decreasing trend in diaphyseal circularity between the juvenile phase of development and adulthood, although significant differences are only found in the humerus. Discussion: Juvenile chimpanzee locomotion includes forelimb- and hindlimb-biased behaviors. Juveniles and adults preferentially load their hindlimbs relative to their forelimbs. This may indicate similar locomotor behavior, although other explanations including a diversity of hindlimb-biased locomotor behaviors in juveniles cannot be ruled out. Different ontogenetic trends in forelimb and hindlimb CSS are consistent with limb bone CSG reflecting functional adaptation, albeit the complex nature of bone functional adaptation requires cautious interpretations of skeletal functional morphology from biomechanical analyses. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT: The use of broad tool repertoires to increase dietary flexibility through extractive foraging behaviors is shared by humans and their closest living relatives (chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes). However, comparisons between tool use in ancient human ancestors (hominins) and chimpanzees are limited by differences in their toolkits. One feature shared by primate and hominin toolkits is rock selection based on physical properties of the stones and the targets of foraging behaviors. Here, we document the selectivity patterns of stone tools used by wild chimpanzees to crack nuts at Bossou, Guinea, through controlled experiments that introduce rocks unknown to this population. Experiments incorporate specific rock types because previous studies document hominin selection of these lithologies at Kanjera South 2 Ma. We investigate decisions made by chimpanzees when selecting stones that vary in their mechanical properties—features not directly visible to the individual. Results indicate that the selection of anvils and hammers is linked to task-specific mechanical properties. Chimpanzees select harder stones for hammers and softer stones for anvils, indicating an understanding of specific properties for distinct functions. Selectivity of rock types suggests that chimpanzees assess the appropriate materials for functions by discriminating these ‘invisible’ properties. Adults identify mechanical properties through individual learning, and juveniles often reused the tools selected by adults. Selection of specific rock types may be transmitted through the reuse of combinations of rocks. These patterns of stone selection parallel what is documented for Oldowan hominins. The processes identified in this experiment provide insights into the discrete nature of hominin rock selection patterns in Plio-Pleistocene stone artifact production. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Spatial interactions among anatomical elements help to identify topological factors behind morphological variation and can be investigated through network analysis. Here, a whole-brain network model of the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes, Blumenbach 1776) is presented, based on macroanatomical divisions, and compared with a previous equivalent model of the human brain. The goal was to contrast which regions are essential in the geometric balance of the brains of the two species, to compare underlying phenotypic patterns of spatial variation, and to understand how these patterns might have influenced the evolution of human brain morphology. The human and chimpanzee brains share morphologically complex inferior-medial regions and a topological organization that matches the spatial constraints exerted by the surrounding braincase. These shared topological features are interesting because they can be traced back to the Chimpanzee-Human Last Common Ancestor, 7–10 million years ago. Nevertheless, some key differences are found in the human and chimpanzee brains. In humans, the temporal lobe, particularly its deep and medial limbic aspect (the parahippocampal gyrus), is a crucial node for topological complexity. Meanwhile, in chimpanzees, the cerebellum is, in this sense, more embedded in an intricate spatial position. This information helps to interpret brain macroanatomical change in fossil hominids. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT: Animal welfare research has increased dramatically in scope and prevalence, spanning zoos, aquariums, sanctuaries, and research facilities. Chimpanzees are the most common and well-studied great ape living in human care. This considerable focus on chimpanzee welfare provides the foundation for a timely review of new and relevant research from multiple facility types housing captive chimpanzees. We reviewed and prioritized six key areas of chimpanzee care and management including available space, social life, enrichment, diet, nesting, and human-animal relationships, and discuss their predictive relationship, if any, to chimpanzee welfare. Our review shows that social companionship remains unequivocally valuable for chimpanzee welfare as does enrichment, and the novelty, choice, and control that it offers. Individual differences in chimpanzee preferences and personalities underscore the emerging importance of providing choices to chimpanzees in our care to help support positive welfare. Areas that revealed a gap in our knowledge and require more inquiry include the absolute amount of space necessary for social and spatial autonomy, the nutritional needs of chimpanzees, sensory enrichment, and how chimpanzees’ relationship with their caretakers can be best structured (or unstructured) to support good welfare. Overall, there are a range of factors important for chimpanzee welfare and although more research is needed, there is the potential for an evidence-based tool leveraging the available research to ensure the best possible care is provided for this highly social and cognitively advanced species. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: A necropsy was performed on a 43-year-old female zoo chimpanzee, with cancer in the vulvar and perivulvar region. She was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma, the presence of this tumor in domestic animals and non-human primates is very rare in the vulvar region and there were no previous reports found on it in chimpanzee, due to which this report contributes to the knowledge on chimpanzee pathologies. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

ABSTRACT: Objectives: Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are patrilocal, with males remaining in their natal community and females dispersing when they reach sexual maturity. However, the details of female chimpanzee dispersal, such as their possible origin, are difficult to assess, even in habituated communities. This study investigates the utility of 87Sr/86Sr analysis for (1) assessing Sr baseline differences between chimpanzee territories and (2) identifying the status (immigrant or natal) of females of unknown origin within the territories of five neighboring communities in Taï National Park (Côte d'Ivoire). Materials and Methods: To create a local Sr isoscape for the Taï Chimpanzee Project (TCP) study area, we sampled environmental samples from TCP-established territories (n = 35). To assess dispersal patterns, 34 tooth enamel samples (one per individual) were selected from the Taï chimpanzee skeletal collection. 87Sr/86Sr analysis was performed on all 69 samples at the W.M. Keck Lab. The theoretical density and overlap of chimpanzee communities as well as generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) were used to test each question. Results: 87Sr/86Sr ratios for natal male chimpanzees ranged from 0.71662 to 0.72187, which is well within the corresponding environmental baseline range of 0.70774–0.73460. The local Sr isoscapes fit was estimated with the root-mean-square error value, which was 0.0048 (22% of the whole 87Sr/86Sr data range). GLMMs identified significant differences in 87Sr/86Sr ratios between natal and unknown North community origin groups, suggesting that after 1980, females of unknown origin could be immigrants to North community (n = 7, z-ratio = −4.08, p = 0.0001, power = 0.94). Discussion: This study indicates that 87Sr/86This study indicates that 87Sr/86Sr analysis can successfully identify immigrant females in skeletal collections obtained from wild chimpanzee communities, enabling the tracking of female dispersal patterns historically. There are, however, significant limitations within the scope of this study, such as (1) the absence of reliable maps for the TCP study area, (2) limited capacity for environmental sampling, (3) small sample sizes, and (4) tooth formation in wild chimpanzees. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT: Estimating the time of death after traumatic brain injury (TBI) in wildlife is a significant challenge in forensic veterinary medicine. The understanding of histopathological changes and predicting the survival time can prompt critical emergency measures and health management strategies for animals in managed care. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a well-established astrocytic biomarker for diagnosing, monitoring, and predicting TBI outcomes. Moreover, the buildup of Beta-Amyloid Precursor Protein (βAPP) resulting from axonal damage is an energetic process intricately connected to the survival period following the injury. To date, no study has explored the accumulation of GFAP and βAPP in TBI chimpanzees. In human studies, the earliest reported time for detecting axonal injury postmortem in TBI using βAPP is approximately 30 minutes. This study aimed to investigate whether GFAP and βAPP staining can be used to detect postmortem axonal injury within 30 minutes in TBI chimpanzees. Cerebral and cerebellar tissues from a postmortem TBI chimpanzee and control samples were screened for immunopositivity for GFAP and βAPP in neurons using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. The results suggested that neuronal immunopositivity for GFAP was likely a staining artifact, as negative controls also showed neuronal GFAP staining. However, it was not easy to assume the absence of post-traumatic neuronal GFAP. Conversely, the βAPP assay results indicated that axonal damage can be detected within 22 minutes after death, marking the fastest recorded time to date and aiding in diagnosing severe TBI with short survival times. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the axonal damage in captivated chimpanzee caused by severe and sudden concussion can be detected with βAPP staining within 22 minutes. © 2024 Peyman Mohammadzadeh et al., published by Sciendo.

ABSTRACT: Objectives: Many nonhuman primate diets are dominated by plant foods, yet plant tissues are often poor sources of sodium—a necessary mineral for metabolism and health. Among primates, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), which are ripe fruit specialists, consume diverse animal, and plant resources. Insects have been proposed as a source of dietary sodium for chimpanzees, yet published data on sodium values for specific foods are limited. We assayed plants and insects commonly eaten by chimpanzees to assess their relative value as sodium sources. Materials and Methods: We used atomic absorption spectroscopy to determine sodium content of key plant foods and insects consumed by chimpanzees of Gombe National Park, Tanzania. Dietary contributions of plant and insect foods were calculated using feeding observational data. Results: On a dry matter basis, mean sodium value of plant foods (n = 83 samples; mean = 86 ppm, SD = 92 ppm) was significantly lower than insects (n = 12; mean = 1549 ppm, SD = 807 ppm) (Wilcoxon rank sum test: W = 975, p < 0.001). All plant values were below the suggested sodium requirement (2000 ppm) for captive primates. While values of assayed insects were variable, sodium content of two commonly consumed insect prey for Gombe chimpanzees (Macrotermes soldiers and Dorylus ants) were four to five times greater than the highest plant values and likely meet requirements. Discussion: We conclude that plant foods available to Gombe chimpanzees are generally poor sources of sodium while insects are important, perhaps critical, sources of sodium for this population. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT: Using field observations from a sanctuary, Oña and colleagues (DOI: 10.7717/peerj. 7623) investigated the semantics of face-gesture combinations in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). The response of the animals to these signals was encoded as a binary measure: positive interactions such as approaching or grooming were considered affiliative; ignoring or attacking was considered non-affiliative. The relevant signals are illustrated in Fig. 1 (https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.7623/fig-1), together with the outcome in terms of average affiliativeness. The authors observe that there seems to be no systematicity in the way the faces modify the responses to the gestures, sometimes reducing affiliativeness, sometimes increasing it. A strong interpretation of this result would be that the meaning of a gesture-face combination cannot be derived from the meaning of the gesture and the meaning of the face, that is, the interpretation of chimpanzees’ face-gesture combinations are non compositional in nature. We will revisit this conclusion: we will exhibit simple compositional systems which, after all, may be plausible. At the methodological level, we argue that it is critical to lay out the theoretical options explicitly for a complete comparison of their pros and cons. © 2024 PeerJ Inc.. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) with teeth severely damaged by dental caries and/or periodontal disease are often managed with medication and/or tooth extraction. A common endodontic treatment for severely decayed teeth in a 26-year-old female chimpanzee is reported. The left maxillary central incisor tooth had lost its crown, probably due to trauma that was not recent, and it had a fistula most likely due to chronic apical periodontitis. The diagnosis was confirmed radiographically before treatment. To treat the infected root canal, endodontic treatment used in humans was adapted for a chimpanzee. After the treatment, the tooth was sealed using an adhesive resin composite. At 11-years post-treatment, there were no signs of recurrence of the lesion or of failure of the tooth seal. The results of this case report suggest that common endodontic treatments used in humans are also effective in chimpanzees. © The Author(s) 2023.

ABSTRACT: Human language is characterized by the integration of multiple signal modalities, including speech, facial and gestural signals. While language likely has deep evolutionary roots that are shared with some of our closest living relatives, studies of great ape communication have largely focused on each modality separately, thus hindering insights into the origins of its multimodal nature. Studying when multimodal signals emerge during great ape ontogeny can inform about both the proximate and ultimate mechanisms underlying their communication systems, shedding light on potential evolutionary continuity between humans and other apes. To this end, the current study investigated developmental patterns of multimodal signal production by 28 semiwild chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, ranging in age from infancy to early adolescence. We examined the production of facial expressions, gestures and vocalizations across a range of behavioural contexts, both when produced separately and as part of multimodal signal combinations (henceforth multimodal). Overall, we found that while unimodal signals were produced consistently more often than multimodal combinations across all ages and contexts, the frequency of multimodal combinations increased significantly in older individuals and most within the aggression and play contexts, where the costs of signalling ambiguity may be higher. Furthermore, older individuals were more likely to produce a multimodal than a unimodal signal and, again, especially in aggressive contexts. Variation in production of individual signal modalities across ages and contexts are also presented and discussed. Overall, evidence that multimodality increases with age in chimpanzees is consistent with patterns of developing communicative complexity in human infancy, revealing apparent evolutionary continuity. Findings from this study contribute novel insights into the evolution and development of multimodality and highlight the importance of adopting a multimodal approach in the comparative study of primate communication. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Populations on the edge of a species' distribution may represent an important source of adaptive diversity, yet these populations tend to be more fragmented and are more likely to be geographically isolated. Lack of genetic exchanges between such populations, due to barriers to animal movement, can not only compromise adaptive potential but also lead to the fixation of deleterious alleles. The south-eastern edge of chimpanzee distribution is particularly fragmented, and conflicting hypotheses have been proposed about population connectivity and viability. To address this uncertainty, we generated both mitochondrial and MiSeq-based microsatellite genotypes for 290 individuals ranging across western Tanzania. While shared mitochondrial haplotypes confirmed historical gene flow, our microsatellite analyses revealed two distinct clusters, suggesting two populations currently isolated from one another. However, we found evidence of high levels of gene flow maintained within each of these clusters, one of which covers an 18,000 km2 ecosystem. Landscape genetic analyses confirmed the presence of barriers to gene flow with rivers and bare habitats highly restricting chimpanzee movement. Our study demonstrates how advances in sequencing technologies, combined with the development of landscape genetics approaches, can resolve ambiguities in the genetic history of critical populations and better inform conservation efforts of endangered species. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Comparative studies of great apes provide a window into our evolutionary past, but the extent and identity of cellular differences that emerged during hominin evolution remain largely unexplored. We established a comparative loss-of-function approach to evaluate whether human cells exhibit distinct genetic dependencies. By performing genome-wide CRISPR interference screens in human and chimpanzee pluripotent stem cells, we identified 75 genes with species-specific effects on cellular proliferation. These genes comprised coherent processes, including cell-cycle progression and lysosomal signaling, which we determined to be human-derived by comparison with orangutan cells. Human-specific robustness to CDK2 and CCNE1 depletion persisted in neural progenitor cells and cerebral organoids, supporting the G1-phase length hypothesis as a potential evolutionary mechanism in human brain expansion. Our findings demonstrate that evolutionary changes in human cells reshaped the landscape of essential genes and establish a platform for systematically uncovering latent cellular and molecular differences between species. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Comparative analyses of MHC gene diversity and evolution across different species could offer valuable insights into the evolution of MHC genes. Intra- and inter-species sequence diversity and conservation of 12 classical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes from cattle, chimpanzees, pigs, and humans was analyzed using 20 representative allelic groups for each gene. The combined analysis of paralogous loci for each species revealed that intra-locus amino-acid sequence variations in the peptide-binding region (PBR) of MHC I genes did not differ significantly between species, ranging from 8.44% for SLA to 10.75% for BoLA class I genes. In contrast, intraspecies differences in the non-PBRs of these paralogous genes were more pronounced, varying from 4.59% for SLA to 16.89% for HLA. Interestingly, the Shannon diversity index and rate of nonsynonymous substitutions for PBR were significantly higher in SLA and BoLA than those in Patr and HLA. Analysis of peptide-binding pockets across all analyzed MHC class I genes of the four species indicated that pockets A and E showed the lowest and highest diversity, respectively. The estimated divergence times suggest that primate and artiodactyl MHC class I genes diverged 60.41 Mya, and BoLA and SLA genes diverged 35.34 Mya. These results offer new insights into the conservation and diversity of MHC class I genes in various mammalian species. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: In the early twentieth century, 200,000 chimpanzees allegedly lived in French Guinea. This made it an ideal location for the bacteriologist and Pastorian Albert Calmette to found a laboratory based on the primate model. So the Pasteur Institute in Kindia, also called “Pastoria,” was established in1922. In Calmette’s eyes, apes were also a bargaining chip to attract foreign scientists and funding. Robert Yerkes and Henry Nissen, two major figures of American primatology, set foot in Pastoria in 1929 and 1930. Yerkes used it both as a platform to study chimpanzees in the wild and as a supplier for his laboratories in the US. This chapter explores the interactions between theories and practices of biomedical and psychological experiments on chimpanzees, while it sheds light on the ways in which the appropriation of knowledge on chimpanzees intermeshed with questions of race and colonialism. It also argues for an animal-centred history of science and seeks to reconstruct the lives of chimpanzees using the traces that they left in the archives. With the examples of Rose, subject of BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin) vaccination trials at Pastoria and Kambi, shipped to the US for psychological and toxicological studies, I argue that making animals visible in history helps to rethink the relationship between humans and animals and cast a different light on the history of colonial science. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

ABSTRACT: Background: Urinalysis is a rapid, non-invasive method used to obtain diagnostic information on primates. While several studies have investigated dipstick and specific gravity values in chimpanzees, urine sediment analysis is often excluded. Crystalluria, observed during urine sediment analysis, can be benign or indicate renal pathologies. Methods: In total, 665 urine samples from sanctuary-housed chimpanzees were analyzed over the course of 17 months for pH, specific gravity, time of collection, and crystalluria. Results and Conclusions: Calcium salt crystalluria was seen in 9.0% of the samples from 23.7% of the individuals in the study. Urinary pH and specific gravity were significantly higher in samples with crystalluria than in those lacking crystalluria, while time of collection did not differ between the two groups. While diet is the most likely cause of the crystalluria in this population, several medications could also cause urinary crystallization. Further exploration of the significance of calcium salt crystalluria in chimpanzees is warranted. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: A prerequisite for copying innovative behaviour faithfully is the capacity of observers' brains, regarded as ‘hierarchically mechanistic minds’, to overcome cognitive ‘surprisal’ (see 2.), by maximising the evidence for their internal models, through active inference. Unlike modern humans, chimpanzees and other great apes show considerable limitations in their ability, or ‘Zone of Bounded Surprisal’, to overcome cognitive surprisal induced by innovative or unorthodox behaviour that rarely, therefore, is copied precisely or accurately. Most can copy adequately what is within their phenotypically habitual behavioural repertoire, in which technology plays scant part. Widespread intra- and intergenerational social transmission of complex technological innovations is not a hall-mark of great-ape taxa. 3 Ma, precursors of the genus Homo made stone artefacts, and stone-flaking likely was habitual before 2 Ma. After that time, early Homo erectus has left traces of technological innovations, though faithful copying of these and their intra- and intergenerational social transmission were rare before 1 Ma. This likely owed to a cerebral infrastructure of interconnected neuronal systems more limited than ours. Brains were smaller in size than ours, and cerebral neuronal systems ceased to develop when early Homo erectus attained full adult maturity by the mid-teen years, whereas its development continues until our mid-twenties nowadays. Pleistocene Homo underwent remarkable evolutionary adaptation of neurobiological propensities, and cerebral aspects are discussed that, it is proposed here, plausibly, were fundamental for faithful copying, which underpinned social transmission of technologies, cumulative learning, and culture. Here, observers' responses to an innovation are more important for ensuring its transmission than is an innovator's production of it, because, by themselves, the minimal cognitive prerequisites that are needed for encoding and assimilating innovations are insufficient for practical outcomes to accumulate and spread intra- and intergenerationally. © 2023 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: AU Tactical : Pleaseconfirmthatallheadinglevelsarerepresentedcorrectly warfare is considered a driver of the evolution of human : cognition. One such tactic, considered unique to humans, is collective use of high elevation in territorial conflicts. This enables early detection of rivals and low-risk maneuvers, based on information gathered. Whether other animals use such tactics is unknown. With a unique dataset of 3 years of simultaneous behavioral and ranging data on 2 neighboring groups of western chimpanzees, from the Taï National Park, Côte d’Ivoire, we tested whether chimpanzees make decisions consistent with tactical use of topography to gain an advantage over rivals. We show that chimpanzees are more likely to use high hills when traveling to, rather than away from, the border where conflict typically takes place. Once on border hills, chimpanzees favor activities that facilitate information gathering about rivals. Upon leaving hills, movement decisions conformed with lowest risk engagement, indicating that higher elevation facilitates the detection of rivals presence or absence. Our results support the idea that elevation use facilitated rival information gathering and appropriate tactical maneuvers. Landscape use during territorial maneuvers in natural contexts suggests chimpanzees seek otherwise inaccessible information to adjust their behavior and points to the use of sophisticated cognitive abilities, commensurate with selection for cognition in species where individuals gain benefits from coordinated territorial defense. We advocate territorial contexts as a key paradigm for unpicking complex animal cognition. © 2023 Lemoine et al.

ABSTRACT: Observations of early vocal behaviours in non-human primates (hereafter primates) are important for direct comparisons between human and primate vocal development. However, direct observations of births and perinatal behaviour in wild primates are rare, and the initial stages of behavioural ontogeny usually remain undocumented. Here, we report direct observations of the birth of a wild chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) in Budongo Forest, Uganda, including the behaviour of the mother and other group members. We monitored the newborn’s vocal behaviour for approximately 2 hours and recorded 70 calls. We categorised the vocalisations both qualitatively, using conventional call descriptions, and quantitatively, using cluster and discriminant acoustic analyses. We found evidence for acoustically distinct vocal units, produced both in isolation and in combination, including sequences akin to adult pant hoots, a vocal utterance regarded as the most complex vocal signal produced by this species. We concluded that chimpanzees possess the capacity to produce vocal sequences composed of different call types from birth, albeit in rudimentary forms. Our observations are in line with the idea that primate vocal repertoires are largely present from birth, with fine acoustic structures undergoing ontogenetic processes. Our study provides rare and valuable empirical data on perinatal behaviours in wild primates. © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Objectives: To understand the function of food sharing among our early hominin ancestors, we can turn to our nonhuman primate relatives for insight. Here, we examined the function of meat sharing by Fongoli chimpanzees, a community of western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) in southeastern Sénégal. Materials and Methods: We tested three non-mutually exclusive hypotheses that have been used to explain patterns of food sharing: kin selection, generalized reciprocity, and meat-for-mating opportunities. We analyzed meat sharing events (n = 484) resulting from hunts, along with data on copulations, age-sex class, and kinship to determine which variables predict the likelihood of meat sharing during this study period (2006–2019). Results: We found full or partial support for kin selection, direct reciprocity, and meat-for-mating-opportunities. However, the analyses reveal that reciprocity and a mother/offspring relationship were the strongest predictors of whether or not an individual shared meat. Conclusions: The results of this study emphasize the complexity of chimpanzee meat sharing behaviors, especially at a site where social tolerance offers increased opportunities for meat sharing by individuals other than dominant males. These findings can be placed in a referential model to inform hypotheses about the sensitivity of food sharing to environmental pressures, such as resource scarcity in savanna landscapes. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT: Like humans, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are well known for their vertebrate and invertebrate hunting, but they rarely scavenge. In contrast, while hunting and meat consumption became increasingly important during the evolution of the genus Homo, scavenging meat and marrow from carcasses of large mammals was also likely to be an important component of their subsistence strategies. Here, we describe a confrontational scavenging interaction between an adult male chimpanzee from the Issa Valley and a crowned eagle (Stephanoaetus coronatus), which resulted in the chimpanzee capturing and consuming the carcass of a juvenile bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus). We describe the interaction and contextualize this with previous scavenging observations from chimpanzees. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Japan Monkey Centre.

ABSTRACT: Computational musculoskeletal modeling represents a valuable approach to examining biological systems in physical anthropology. Probabilistic modeling builds on computational musculoskeletal models by associating mathematical distributions of specific musculoskeletal features within known ranges of biological variability with functional outcomes. The purpose of this study was to determine if overlap in rotator cuff muscle force predictions would occur between species during the performance of an evolutionarily relevant horizontal bimanual arm suspension task. This necessitated creating novel probabilistic models of the human and chimpanzee glenohumeral joint through augmentation of previously published deterministic models. Glenohumeral musculoskeletal features of anthropological interest were probabilistically modeled to produce distributions of predicted human and chimpanzee rotator cuff muscle force that were representative of the specific anatomical manipulations. Musculoskeletal features modeled probabilistically included rotator cuff origins and deltoid insertion, glenoid inclination, and joint stability. Predicted human rotator cuff muscle force distributions were mostly limited to alternating between infraspinatus and teres minor, with both 100% and 0% muscle force predicted for both muscles. The chimpanzee model predicted low-to-moderate muscle force across all rotator cuff muscles. Rotator cuff muscle force predictions were most sensitive to changes of muscle origins and insertions. Results indicate that functional rotator cuff overlap is unlikely between chimpanzees and humans without greater modifications of the glenohumeral musculoskeletal phenotypes. The results also highlight the low efficacy of the human upper extremity in overhead, weight-bearing tasks, and propensity for rotator cuff injury. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Honest signalling theory suggests that humans and chimpanzees can extract socially relevant information relating to personality from the faces of their conspecifics. Humans are also able to extract information from chimpanzees’ faces. Here, we examine whether personality characteristics of chimpanzees, including measures of psychopathy, can be discerned based purely on facial morphology in photographs. Twenty-one chimpanzees were given naïve and expert personality ratings on the Ten Item Personality Inventory (TIPI) and the Chimpanzee Triarchic Model of Psychopathy (CHMP-Tri) before and following behavioural observations. Characteristics relating to openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, and disinhibition could be distinguished from the faces of chimpanzees. Individuals higher on disinhibition have lower scores on conscientiousness and emotional stability and higher scores on extraversion, while those higher on meanness have lower conscientiousness and agreeableness. Facial expressions are linked to personality traits present in the TIPI and CHMP-Tri models: the Relaxed Face and the Grooming Face were displayed more by chimpanzees higher on agreeableness, whereas the Compressed Lips Face was observed more in those individuals higher on boldness, and the Full Open Grin was displayed more by chimpanzees higher on extraversion but lower on emotional stability and conscientiousness. Facial expressions were also found to be associated with particular behavioural contexts, namely the Grooming Face in affiliative contexts and the Relaxed and Relaxed Open Mouth Faces in neutral contexts. Dominant chimpanzees display higher levels of boldness and more Compressed Lips Faces, Relaxed Open Mouth Faces, and Grooming Faces than subordinate individuals. These findings support and extend evidence for an honest signalling system and a personality structure shared between humans and chimpanzees. Future research could further explore how personality is conveyed through the face, perhaps through more than just singular aspects of character, and maybe reflecting what chimpanzees themselves are able to do. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) originate from ancestral germline infections caused by exogenous retroviruses. Throughout evolution, they have become fixed within the genome of the animals into which they were integrated. As ERV elements coevolve with the host, they are normally epigenetically silenced and can become upregulated in a series of physiological and pathological processes. Generally, a detailed ERV profile in the host genome is critical for understanding the evolutionary history and functional performance of the host genome. We previously characterized and cataloged all the ERV-K subtype HML-8 loci in the human genome; however, this has not been done for the chimpanzee, the nearest living relative of humans. In this study, we aimed to catalog and characterize the integration of HML-8 in the chimpanzee genome and compare it with the integration of HML-8 in the human genome. We analyzed the integration of HML-8 and found that HML-8 pervasively invaded the chimpanzee genome. A total of 76 proviral elements were characterized on 23/24 chromosomes, including detailed elements distribution, structure, phylogeny, integration time, and their potential to regulate adjacent genes. The incomplete structure of HML-8 proviral LTRs will undoubtedly affect their activity. Moreover, the results indicated that HML-8 integration occurred before the divergence between humans and chimpanzees. Furthermore, chimpanzees include more HML-8 proviral elements (76 vs. 40) and fewer solo long terminal repeats (LTR) (0 vs. 5) than humans. These results suggested that chimpanzee genome activity is less than the human genome and that humans may have a better ability to shape and screen integrated proviral elements. Our work is informative in both an evolutionary and a functional context for ERVs. Copyright © 2024 Wang, Zhai, Wang, Zhang, Yang, Song, Li, Liu, Han, Wang, Li, Chen, Jia and Li.

ABSTRACT: The population of West African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) is declining rapidly mostly due to the impact of human activities and habitat loss. Sierra Leone harbors the third largest population of this subspecies, recently reclassified as Critically Endangered in the 2016 IUCN Red List. Population monitoring provides crucial data for planning and evaluating conservation and management policies. Therefore, to assess the status of the population size inhabiting the Loma Mountains National Park (LMNP) in Sierra Leone, we performed a nest count survey and estimated chimpanzee density and abundance using distance sampling. In total, 34 × 2-km-line transects were surveyed, with transects being systematically distributed across the LMNP area (288.5 km2). Concurrently, we compiled environmental data, which were used to model nest distribution and infer the most relevant environmental and anthropogenic drivers of the observed nest abundances. We encountered 10.03 nests/km and estimated a density of 3.47 ± standard error (SE) 0.92 individuals/km2 (i.e., 1002 ± SE 266 individuals in total). Compared to the figures obtained from a systematic literature review, our results suggest that the density and abundance of chimpanzees in the LMNP is among the highest across Africa. Contrary to expectation, no specific anthropogenic features predicted nest distribution and abundance. However, the nest distribution model indicated preference for elevated and steep areas covered by closed evergreen forest, which could be an indication of human avoidance. Based on these results, we highlight the value of LMNP for the conservation of the chimpanzees in Sierra Leone and the urgent necessity of guarantying long-term funding for this park's management to ensure the survival of this critically endangered subspecies in West Africa. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Case study on the bone density pattern of subaxial vertebral column in African apes. Introduction: African apes have been noted to experience fewer back ailments than humans and to have higher vertebral bone density. Yet, research on the subject is quite limited and has usually included only one or few vertebrae. However, to understand vertebral column as whole and how posture and locomotion might have affected it, we need to know how bone density varies between adjacent vertebrae. Materials and Methods: Bone density in the vertebral body was measured for all subaxial vertebrae of five specimens including two Pan troglodytes (1 male and 1 female) and three Gorilla gorilla (2 males and 1 female) using peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT). Results: The results tentatively indicated differences between species, especially in the trabecular density of the cervical segment and support the need for further studies on this subject. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

ABSTRACT: Accurate and up-to-date data on longevity and mortality are essential for describing, analyzing, and managing animal populations in captivity. We assembled a comprehensive demography data set and analyzed survival and mortality patterns in a population of captive former biomedical research chimpanzees. The study synthesized over 51,000 life-years of demographic data collected on 2349 individuals between 1923 and 2014. Our goal was to assess the population's current age–sex composition, estimate rates of survivorship, mortality and life expectancy, and compare findings with other chimpanzee populations of interest. Results indicated an increasingly geriatric contemporary population declining in size. The median life expectancy (MLE) of the entire population was 32.6 years (males 29.1, females 36.1). For chimpanzees who reached 1 year of age, the MLE increased to 34.9 years (males 31.0, females 38.8). Survival probability was influenced by both sex and birth type. Females exhibited greater survivorship than males (β1 = −0.34, z = −5.74, p < 0.001) and wild-born individuals exhibited greater survivorship than captive-born individuals (β2 = −0.55, z = −5.89, p < 0.001). There was also a seasonal trend in mortality, wherein more individuals died during the winter months (December–February) compared with other seasons. Analyses of life expectancy over time showed continual increases in both median age of living individuals and median age at death, suggesting that these chimpanzees have yet to reach their full aging potential in a postresearch environment. As they continue to age, ongoing monitoring and analysis of demographic changes will be necessary for science-based population and program management until extinction occurs some decades in the future. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT: Background: Vitamin D is essential for skeletal health, calcium homeostasis and general health. The major and more stable form of vitamin D in circulation is 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-D); this is the most valuable indicator of vitamin D status. There are studies on laboratory and zoo-housed chimpanzees; however, serum vitamin D status has not been documented in chimpanzees in range countries. Objectives: (1) Determine the range of circulating 25-OH-D concentrations in chimpanzees in range countries. (2) Assess the influence of age, sex, and sun exposure on 25-OH-D serum concentrations. Methods: Opportunistic blood samples were obtained from 127 clinically healthy chimpanzees. Serum 25-OH-D concentration was measured with a commercially available competitive ELISA. Results: The median overall 25-OH-D concentration for chimpanzees in range countries was 46.24 nmol/L (range: 17.10–109.23 nmol/L). Males had a significantly lower concentration (40.15 nmol/L) than females (49.61 nmol/L), and infants (37.99 nmol/L) had a significantly lower concentration than adults (46.04 nmol/L). Concentrations of 25-OH-D in chimpanzees in sunnier habitats were significantly higher compared to thick tropical forest habitat. Conclusion: The present constitutes a large dataset of serum 25-OH-D concentrations in range country sanctuary chimpanzees and contributes to document normal ranges. Age, sex, and sun exposure influenced serum concentrations of 25-OH-D in sanctuary chimpanzees. © 2023 The Authors. Veterinary Medicine and Science published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Lavender administration in humans has been shown to promote calmness without the side effects often observed with benzodiazepines. Studies in both humans and rodents have found that ingestion of oral lavender capsules resulted in significantly decreased anxiety. Additionally, mice developed an anti-conflict effect and humans increased socially inclusive behaviors. Given the safety of oral lavender oil and the observed benefits, we administered daily lavender capsules to six chimpanzees who exhibited conflict-instigating behaviors in an effort to further decrease our already low levels of wounding. We compared the total number of wounds in 25 chimpanzees housed with the six lavender-treated chimpanzees in five different social groups (1) prior to administration of daily oral lavender capsules to (2) total wounds during daily oral lavender capsule treatment. We hypothesized that lavender therapy treatment would reduce overall wounding in the social groups. Surprisingly, overall wounding was higher during the lavender treatment period (p = 0.01), yet the percentage of wounds requiring treatment significantly decreased during the lavender therapy period (36% vs. 21%, p = 0.02). © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Ticks and tick-borne pathogens significantly impact both human and animal health and therefore are of major concern to the scientific community. Knowledge of tick-borne pathogens is crucial for prescription of mitigation measures. In Africa, much research on ticks has focused on domestic animals. Little is known about ticks and their pathogens in wild habitats and wild animals like the endangered chimpanzee, our closest relative. Methods: In this study, we collected ticks in the forested habitat of a community of 100 chimpanzees living in Kibale National Park, Western Uganda, and assessed how their presence and abundance are influenced by environmental factors. We used non-invasive methods of flagging the vegetation and visual search of ticks both on human team members and in chimpanzee nests. We identified adult and nymph ticks through morphological features. Molecular techniques were used to detect and identify tick-borne piroplasmids and bacterial pathogens. Results: A total of 470 ticks were collected, which led to the identification of seven tick species: Haemaphysalis parmata (68.77%), Amblyomma tholloni (20.70%), Ixodes rasus sensu lato (7.37%), Rhipicephalus dux (1.40%), Haemaphysalis punctaleachi (0.70%), Ixodes muniensis (0.70%) and Amblyomma paulopunctatum (0.35%). The presence of ticks, irrespective of species, was influenced by temperature and type of vegetation but not by relative humidity. Molecular detection revealed the presence of at least six genera of tick-borne pathogens (Babesia, Theileria, Borrelia, Cryptoplasma, Ehrlichia and Rickettsia). The Afrotopical tick Amblyomma tholloni found in one chimpanzee nest was infected by Rickettsia sp. Conclusions: In conclusion, this study presented ticks and tick-borne pathogens in a Ugandan wildlife habitat whose potential effects on animal health remain to be elucidated.

ABSTRACT: Lack of data on the population size of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in the Yoko Council Forest (YCF), located in the Centre region of Cameroon has hindered the ability to develop conservation measures. The sustainable management of this species requires reliable knowledge of their ecology, habits and resource needs. This study was conducted from February–July 2022 to assess nesting ecology and to use nest decay rates to estimate population size. The retrospective method for studying the degradation of animal indices was used. The mean nest decay rate was 77.5 days and density was estimated at 69.3 [54.9 86.7] nests/ km2 to 113 chimpanzees per km2. We also found a high preference for nests in specific forest types, with 92% of nests in marantaceous forests, and a preference for nests to be on Khaya grandifolia (Meliaceae) (28.24%) or Uapaca guinensis (Euphorbiaceae) (27.06%) trees. The preferential position for construction of chimpanzee nests was on a branch (58.82%) as opposed to in a branch fork (40.39%), which is interesting since one would assume a fork would offer more nest stability. Our study offers crucial insights that can guide policymakers in formulating targeted conservation strategies for the substantial chimpanzee population in the YCF. © 2024 Biodiversity Conservancy International.

ABSTRACT: When evaluating the last 25 yr of morbidity and mortality from adult chimpanzees managed within the Association of Zoo and Aquarium Chimpanzee Species Survival Plan® for North American zoos, only two female chimpanzees were diagnosed with mammary neoplasia: one incidentally antemortem and one with a terminal metastatic neoplasia. When comparing this observation of prevalence of mammary neoplasia to humans, a substantial disparity is apparent. Mammary neoplasia is the second most common cancer in adult female humans, with a lifetime risk of 1:8 in the United States. The reason for the disparity between humans and chimpanzees, as closely related species, is unknown. The true prevalence in chimpanzees may be higher than currently noted, because routine examination of mammary tissue in chimpanzees is generally less complete than for other tissues postmortem, and antemortem assessment is generally limited to mammary palpation. This study was performed on intact, bilateral mammary glands harvested at postmortem examination of adult female chimpanzees (n = 7) from six institutions. With mammography, complete histopathologic sectioning, and genetic evaluation, the risk of mammary neoplasia was evaluated more thoroughly than during a typical postmortem exam in zoo populations during 2017-2019. No chimpanzees in the study were diagnosed with mammary neoplasia. Overall, this study supports the previous impression that chimpanzees do not develop mammary neoplasia at a similar rate as humans, even when comparable diagnostic modalities for evaluation are used.

ABSTRACT: Nipah virus (NiV) is a highly lethal zoonotic paramyxovirus that poses a severe threat to humans due to its high morbidity and the lack of viable countermeasures. Vaccines are the most crucial defense against NiV infections. Here, a recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus-based vaccine (AdC68-G) and a DNA vaccine (DNA-G) were developed by expressing the codon-optimized full-length glycoprotein (G) of NiV. Strong and sustained neutralizing antibody production, accompanied by an effective T-cell response, was induced in BALB/c mice by intranasal or intramuscular administration of one or two doses of AdC68-G, as well as by priming with DNA-G and boosting with intramuscularly administered AdC68-G. Importantly, the neutralizing antibody titers were maintained for up to 68 weeks in the mice that received intramuscularly administered AdC68-G and the prime DNA-G/boost AdC68-G regimen, without a significant decline. Additionally, Syrian golden hamsters immunized with AdC68-G and DNA-G via homologous or heterologous prime/boost immunization were completely protected against a lethal NiV virus challenge, without any apparent weight loss, clinical signs, or pathological tissue damage. There was a significant reduction in but not a complete absence of the viral load and number of infectious particles in the lungs and spleen tissue following NiV challenge. These findings suggest that the AdC68-G and DNA-G vaccines against NiV infection are promising candidates for further development. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: While cases of interspecies grooming have been reported in primates, no comprehensive cross-site review has been published about this behavior in great apes. Only a few recorded observations of interspecies grooming events between chimpanzees and other primate species have been reported in the wild, all of which have thus far been in Uganda. Here, we review all interspecies grooming events recorded for the Sonso community chimpanzees in Budongo Forest Reserve, Uganda, adding five new observations to the single, previously reported event from this community. A new case of interspecies play involving three juvenile male chimpanzees and a red-tailed monkey is also detailed. All events took place between 1993 and 2021. In all of the six interspecific grooming events from Budongo, the ‘groomer’ was a female chimpanzee between the ages of 4–6 years, and the ‘recipient’ was a member of the genus Cercopithecus. In five of these events, chimpanzee groomers played with the tail of their interspecific grooming partners, and except for one case, initiated the interaction. In three cases, chimpanzee groomers smelled their fingers after touching distinct parts of the receiver’s body. While a single function of chimpanzee interspecies grooming remains difficult to determine from these results, our review outlines and assesses some hypotheses for the general function of this behavior, as well as some of the costs and benefits for both the chimpanzee groomers and their sympatric interspecific receivers. As allogrooming is a universal behavior in chimpanzees, investigating the ultimate and proximate drivers of chimpanzee interspecies grooming may reveal further functions of allogrooming in our closest living relatives, and help us to better understand how chimpanzees distinguish between affiliative and agonistic species and contexts. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Locomotion in non-human primates, including walking, climbing, and brachiating among other types of movement (but not pacing), is a species-typical behavior that varies with age, social housing conditions, and environmental factors (e.g., season, food availability, physical housing conditions). Given that captive primates are typically observed to engage in lower levels of locomotor behaviors than their wild counterparts, increases in locomotion are generally considered to be indicative of improved welfare in captivity. However, increases in locomotion do not always occur with improvements in welfare, and sometimes occur under conditions of negative arousal. The use of time spent in locomotion as a welfare indicator in studies of well-being is relatively limited. We conducted focal animal observations on 120 captive chimpanzees across a series of studies and found higher percentages of time spent in locomotion (1) upon transfer to a new enclosure type, (2) in larger groups with wider within-group age ranges, and fewer males, and (3) with participation in an experimental medication choice paradigm. We also found that, among geriatric chimpanzees, those housed in nongeriatric groups exhibited more locomotion than those living in geriatric groups. Lastly, locomotion was significantly negatively correlated with several indicators of poor welfare and significantly positively correlated with behavioral diversity, one indicator of positive welfare. Overall, the increases in time spent in locomotion observed in these studies were part of an overall behavioral pattern indicative of enhanced welfare, suggesting that an increase in time spent in locomotion itself may be an indicator of enhanced welfare. As such, we suggest that levels of locomotion, which are typically assessed in most behavioral experiments, may be used more explicitly as indicators of welfare in chimpanzees. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The world energy structure dominated by fossil energy has brought about the depletion of fossil energy and a series of environmental pollution problems. The development of new energy has become the direction of joint efforts of China and other countries in the world. Wind energy is an important part of new energies. Accurate wind speed prediction can effectively reduce the adverse impact of wind farm fluctuation on power system. To solve the problem of low and poor accuracy of short-term wind speed prediction, a hybrid prediction model based on improved optimized extreme learning machine (ELM) is provided in this paper. The wind speed series are decomposed by using the Complementary Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN), the phase space of each modal component is reconstructed to obtain some new time series, and thus to enhance the stability of the wind speed series. Also, the improved chimpanzee optimization algorithm (CHOA) is used to determine the optimal value of the extreme learning machine (ELM) so as to predict the processed wind speed sequence. Through related empirical analysis and comparisons with other models, the hybrid prediction model reduces wind speed prediction error and improves the accuracy of wind speed prediction accuracy effectively. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Life history theory addresses how organisms balance development and reproduction. Mammals usually invest considerable energy into growth in infancy, and they do so incrementally less until reaching adult body size, when they shift energy to reproduction. Humans are unusual in having a long adolescence when energy is invested in both reproduction and growth, including rapid skeletal growth around puberty. Although many primates, especially in captivity, experience accelerated growth in mass around puberty, it remains unclear whether this represents skeletal growth. Without data on skeletal growth in nonhuman primates, anthropologists have often assumed the adolescent growth spurt is uniquely human, and hypotheses for its evolution have focused on other uniquely human traits. The lack of data is largely due to methodological difficulties of assessing skeletal growth in wild primates. Here, we use two urinary markers of bone turnover—osteocalcin and collagen—to study skeletal growth in a large, cross-sectional sample of wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda. For both bone turnover markers, we found a nonlinear effect of age, which was largely driven by males. For male chimpanzees, values for osteocalcin and collagen peaked at age 9.4 years and 10.8 years, respectively, which corresponds to early and middle adolescence. Notably, collagen values increased from 4.5 to 9 years, suggesting faster growth during early adolescence compared to late infancy. Biomarker levels plateaued at 20 years in both sexes, suggesting skeletal growth continues until then. Additional data, notably on females and infants of both sexes, are needed, as are longitudinal samples. However, our cross-sectional analysis suggests an adolescent growth spurt in the skeleton of chimpanzees, especially for males. Biologists should avoid claiming that the adolescent growth spurt is uniquely human, and hypotheses for the patterns of human growth should consider variation in our primate relatives. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Research in African ape sanctuaries has emerged as an important context for our understanding of comparative cognition and behavior. While much of this work has focused on experimental studies of cognition, these animals semi-free-range in forest habitats and therefore can also provide important information about the behavior of primates in socioecologically-relevant naturalistic contexts. In this “New Approaches” article, we describe a project where we implemented a synthetic program of observational data collection at Ngamba Island Chimpanzee Sanctuary in Uganda, directly modeled after long-term data collection protocols at the Kibale Chimpanzee Project in Uganda, a wild chimpanzee field site. The foundation for this project was a strong partnership between sanctuary staff, field site staff, and external researchers. We describe how we developed a data-collection protocol through discussion and collaboration among these groups, and trained sanctuary caregivers to collect novel observational data using these protocols. We use these data as a case study to examine: (1) how behavioral observations in sanctuaries can inform primate welfare and care practices, such as by understanding aggression within the group; (2) how matched observational protocols across sites can inform our understanding of primate behavior across different contexts, including sex differences in social relationships; and (3) how more robust collaborations between foreign researchers and local partners can support capacity-building in primate range countries, along with mentoring and training students more broadly. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: In primates, as well as in other mammals, play fighting (PF) is a complex form of playful activity that is structurally similar to real fighting (RF) and may also be used in a competitive way. Here, we verify the structural key differences that can distinguish PF from RF in adult chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). We collected 962 h of video recording on 30 adult individuals belonging to four chimpanzee groups (Mona Chimpanzee Sanctuary, Spain; La Vallée des Singes and ZooParc de Beauval, France). We applied different indices—two of which were borrowed from the ecological measures of biodiversity—to test for structural differences between PF (345 sessions) and RF (461 sessions) in the levels of behavior repetition (Repeatability of Same Behavior Index, RSBI), distribution uniformity (Pielou Index, J), variability (Shannon Index, H′) and, symmetry (i.e., reciprocal exchange of offensive/defensive behaviors; Asymmetry Index, AI). Moreover, we compared the session duration between PF and RF. We found that duration and RSBI were higher in PF than RF while AI was higher in RF than PF. No difference was found between J and H′. Interestingly, both females and males maintained similar ranking positions (determined via Normalized David's scores) in RF and PF. Our study indicates that session duration, behavior repetition, and symmetry can be distinctive structural key features of PF whereas dominance role-reversal, behavior variability, and distribution uniformity were not. PF in adult chimpanzees may have elements of serious contexts (e.g., absence of role-reversal as in RF) which is in line with the view that play is a blended, multifunctional behavior deriving from the re-combination of different behavioral systems. Our findings highlight the need to investigate play structure and manifestation in a nuanced way to better understand the actual motivation that underlies what appears to be play. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Chimp Haven is a sanctuary for chimpanzees retired from biomedical research, rescued from the pet trade, or re-homed after other organizations could no longer care for them. To provide optimal care for over 300 chimpanzees, Chimp Haven’s animal care team includes experts in behavioral science, veterinary treatment, and husbandry practices. To aid these teams in making routine welfare management decisions, a system of behavioral metrics provides objective data to guide decisions and track outcomes. Chimp Haven has built and piloted seven behavioral metric protocols over the past 5 years to provide staff with an objective and comprehensive picture of the chimpanzees’ behavioral welfare. The data from behavioral observations, staff surveys, and routine staff documentation are analyzed and processed through Google Forms, ZooMonitor, Microsoft Power Bi, Microsoft Excel, and R. Each metric assists staff in making data-based decisions regarding the management of captive chimpanzees related to abnormal behavior, hair loss, wounding, social relationships, positive reinforcement training and overall wellness. In this article, we explore examples of each metric and how they have been utilized to monitor and make decisions for both social groups of chimpanzees as well as individuals. These metrics can be collected and shared easily in an understandable format, which may provide an important framework for others to follow to enable the tracking of welfare for other sanctuaries, non-human primates, as well as other species. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Following discussion about formant measures, we amend the following aspects of the original paper. Note that the key results remain unchanged. For the first result, broad chimpanzee call types, hoos, grunts, screams and barks, though graded, can be discriminated using acoustic parameters or only lip and jaw articulatory measures. For the second result, the chimpanzee formant space appears expanded compared to African and Asian monkeys, embracing two of the three F1/F2 formant space extremities used in humans [1]. Specifically, chimpanzee compared to monkey vocalizations encompass both [u] and [a] extremities, rather than only one or no extremities. However, the third extremity [i], appears outside the capacity of the few primate species examined to date, and may represent a derived capacity in the hominin lineage. © 2023 Royal Society Publishing.

ABSTRACT: We sometimes perceive meaningful patterns or images in random arrangements of colors and shapes. This phenomenon is called pareidolia and has recently been studied intensively, especially face pareidolia. In contrast, there are few comparative-cognitive studies on face pareidolia with nonhuman primates. This study explored behavioral evidence for face pareidolia in chimpanzees using visual search and matching tasks. Faces are processed in a configural manner, and their perception and recognition are hampered by inversion and misalignment of top and bottom parts. We investigated whether the same effect occurs in a visual search for face-like objects. The results showed an effect of misalignment. On the other hand, consistent results were not obtained with the photographs of fruits. When only the top or bottom half of the face-like object was presented, chimpanzees showed better performance for the top-half condition, suggesting the importance of the eye area in face pareidolia. In the positive-control experiments, chimpanzees received the same experiment using human faces and human participants with face-like objects and fruits. As a result, chimpanzees showed an inefficient search for inverted and misaligned faces and humans for manipulated face-like objects. Finally, to examine the role of face awareness, we tested matching a human face to a face-like object in chimpanzees but obtained no substantial evidence that they saw the face-like object as a “face.” Based on these results, we discussed the extents and limits of face pareidolia in chimpanzees. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Human mothers interact with their infants in different ways. In Western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic (WEIRD) societies, face-to-face interactions and mutual gazes are especially frequent, yet little is known about their developmental trajectories and if they differ from those of other primates. Using a cross-species developmental approach, we compared mother-infant interactions in 10 dyads of urban humans from a WEIRD society (Homo sapiens) and 10 dyads of captive zoo-based chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), when infants were one, six and 12 months old. Results showed that face-to-face interactions with mutual gaze events were common in both groups throughout the infant's first year of life. The developmental trajectories of maternal and infants' looks partially differed between species, but mutual gaze events were overall longer in humans than in chimpanzees. Mutual gazes were also more frequent in humans, peaking at six months in humans, while increasing with age in chimpanzees. The duration and frequency of mutual gazes varied across contexts in both groups, with mutual gazes being longer during caring/grooming and feeding contexts. These findings confirm that some aspects of early socio-cognitive development are shared by humans and other primates, and highlight the importance of combining developmental and cross-species approaches to better understand the evolutionary roots of parenting behaviour.

ABSTRACT: Animal welfare researchers are committed to developing novel approaches to enhance the quality of life of chimpanzees living in professional care. To systematically monitor physical, mental, and emotional states, welfare scientists highlight the importance of integrating non-invasive, animal-based welfare indicators. This study aimed to create species-specific reference intervals for behavioral measures and physiological biomarkers. Specifically, we analyzed data from 40 adult chimpanzees (22 females, 18 males) residing at 16 zoological facilities to generate reference intervals for behavioral states and events, behavioral diversity, fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (GCMs), and fecal immunoglobulin-A (IgA). Comparisons of sex and age using linear regression models revealed significant differences for several behaviors. The proportion of time spent engaged in mutual/multiple social grooming significantly decreased as individuals aged. Furthermore, males spent a higher proportion of time performing aggressive contact behaviors and displaying to other chimpanzees when compared to females. Males also performed sexual examination behaviors at a higher rate than females. Behavioral diversity, fecal GCM, and fecal IgA did not vary by sex or age. In the future, values for individual chimpanzees can be compared to the ranges reported here for particular age/sex classes. Ultimately, animal care professionals can utilize reference intervals to make evidence-based decisions regarding management practices and environmental conditions. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Comparative gene expression studies in apes are fundamentally limited by the challenges associated with sampling across different tissues. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing of embryoid bodies to collect transcriptomic data from over 70 cell types in three humans and three chimpanzees. Results: We find hundreds of genes whose regulation is conserved across cell types, as well as genes whose regulation likely evolves under directional selection in one or a handful of cell types. Using embryoid bodies from a human-chimpanzee fused cell line, we also infer the proportion of inter-species regulatory differences due to changes in cis and trans elements between the species. Using the cis/trans inference and an analysis of transcription factor binding sites, we identify dozens of transcription factors whose inter-species differences in expression are affecting expression differences between humans and chimpanzees in hundreds of target genes. Conclusions: Here, we present the most comprehensive dataset of comparative gene expression from humans and chimpanzees to date, including a catalog of regulatory mechanisms associated with inter-species differences. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Speech and music are the two forms of acoustic communication that humans have developed uniquely. Researchers have been interested in the process by which they evolved. Primates, especially chimpanzees, are phylogenetically closest to humans among living animals and are considered to be a relevant species for speculating on the evolutionary process of human cognitive activity. In this sense, it appears significant to compare primate vocalization/acoustic communication when considering the origins of speech and music. However, most studies to date have focused on the functions of auditory communication, and there has been little discussion of the characteristics of the sounds themselves used by chimpanzees and to what extent they are sensitive to the types of sounds they use. In this chapter, I will review the characteristics of sound and sensitivity especially in chimpanzees. By clarifying their sensitivity to and use of sound beyond the distinction between speech and music, I will discuss the diversity and flexibility of auditory communication in chimpanzees. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023.

ABSTRACT: Object interactions play an important role in human communication but the extent to which nonhuman primates incorporate objects in their social interactions remains unknown. To better understand the evolution of object use, this study explored how objects are used in social interactions in semi-wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). We used an observational approach focusing on naturally occurring object actions where we examined their use and tested whether the production of object actions was influenced by the recipients’ visual attention as well as by colony membership. The results show that chimpanzees adjusted both the type of object used, and the modality of object actions to match the visual attention of the recipient, as well as colony differences in the use of targeted object actions. These results provide empirical evidence highlighting that chimpanzees use objects in diverse ways to communicate with conspecifics and that their use may be shaped by social factors, contributing to our understanding of the evolution of human nonverbal communication, language, and tool use. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees have been used in biomedical research for over a century. With the removal of chimpanzees from biomedical research in the European Union, Japan, and more recently, the USA, this topic is of public and scientific interest. This chapter will cover the use of chimpanzees in biomedical research from the early 1900s, including consideration of the impact of captive breeding and housing on welfare, the debate over chimpanzee use in research and the decision leading to their removal from mainstream biomedical research, and the potential repercussions this will have for both chimpanzees and humans. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

ABSTRACT: This work focuses on the nesting behavior of the West African chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) in the anthropized habitats of the village of Tikankali and its surroundings. Studies on chimpanzee nesting behavior are carried out at several sites of Senegal but never in Tikankaly. Thus, proximity with the Niokolo Koba National Park and the presence of a gold mining industry mean that data on chimpanzee nesting behavior and anthropogenic impacts in their habitats for decisions-making about chimpanzee conservation in this area. We recorded a total of 213 chimpanzee nests during two surveys over a distance of 47.81 km (i.e., 47.81 km x 2). Data were collected in October 2020 and October 2021. The majority of nests (63%) were found in wooded savannah, 19% in bamboo savannah, 09% in gallery forest and 07% in open forest. The results showed that 22 plant species belonging to 08 families are used for chimpanzee nests in and around Tikankali. However, half of the nests were in Pterocarpus erinaceus (53%); followed by Hexalobus monopetalus (8%); Diospyros mespiliformis (6%), Piliostigma thonningii (6%), Lannea acida (6%); and Grewia bicolor (4%). The average height of trees used as chimpanzee nest supports was 9.88 m (SD=3.60) and the average height of nests was 7.46 m (SD=3.23). Linear regression analysis (r=0.84; N=213; p< 0.05) suggested a preference for nesting at a particular height but also that nest height is a function of the supporting tree’s height. The current study contributes to the knowledge of chimpanzee nesting behavior in Tikankali, the anthropogenic disruption and will help in the implementation of a good chimpanzee management and conservation strategy in Senegal.

ABSTRACT: Adult chimpanzees Tatu and Loulis lived at the Fauna Foundation sanctuary. They had acquired signs of American Sign Language (ASL) while young and continued to use them as adults. Caregivers with proficiency in ASL maintained daily sign language records during interactions and passive observation. Sign checklists were records of daily vocabulary use. Sign logs were records of signed interactions with caregivers and other chimpanzees. This study reports sign use from eight years of these records. Tatu and Loulis used a majority of their base vocabularies consistently over the study period. They used signs that they had acquired decades earlier and new signs. Their utterances served a variety of communicative functions, including responses, conversational devices, requests, and descriptions. They signed to caregivers, other chimpanzees, including those who did not use signs, and to themselves privately. This indicates the importance of a stimulating and interactive environment to understand the scope of ape communication and, in particular, their use of sign language. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzee accumulative stone throwing at trees has been described by Kühl, H.S., Kalan, A.K., Arandjelovic, M., Aubert, F., D'Auvergne, L., Goedmakers, A., Jones, S., Kehoe, L., Regnaut, S., Tickle, A., et al. (2016). Chimpanzee accumulative stone throwing. Sci. Rep. 6: 1-8, but we lack important details about the social and ecological context for this rare behavior. Further observations may enhance future research, as the described observations have not yet been shared in the literature. We analyzed camera trap records from 2010 to 2020 of various research projects conducted in the Boé sector of Gabu Province in south-east Guinea Bissau, West-Africa, to identify ecological and social factors that might potentially influence chimpanzee accumulative stone throwing behavior (on a total of 298 records). From September 2019 until November 2019, we filmed five trees over 48 days to conduct a further exploratory study of this behavior. We discuss the importance of study design when investigating a little-described phenomenon, and the threat posed to chimpanzee populations in West-Africa by the expected expansion of mining activities. More knowledge on chimpanzee accumulative stone throwing is needed as the chimpanzee population is under stress because of increased mining activities in the area. With habitat rapidly being disturbed and destroyed, this population and its rare behavior are increasingly at risk of extermination.  © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

ABSTRACT: Recent studies identify a surprising coupling between evolutionarily new sulci and the functional organization of human posteromedial cortex (PMC). Yet, no study has compared this modern PMC sulcal patterning between humans and non-human hominoids. To fill this gap in knowledge, we first manually defined over 2500 PMC sulci in 120 chimpanzee (Pan Troglodytes) hemispheres and 144 human hemispheres. We uncovered four new sulci, and quantitatively identified species differences in sulcal incidence, depth, and surface area. Interestingly, some sulci are more common in humans and others, in chimpanzees. Further, we found that the prominent marginal ramus of the cingulate sulcus differs significantly between species. Contrary to classic observations, the present results reveal that the surface anatomy of PMC substantially differs between humans and chimpanzees—findings which lay a foundation for better understanding the evolution of neuroanatomical-functional and neuroanatomical-behavioral relationships in this highly expanded region of the human cerebral cortex. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Although biomarkers are often used for predicting morbidity and mortality in humans, similar data are lacking in our closest relatives. This study analyzed 16 biomarkers in zoo-housed chimpanzees and bonobos from serum samples collected during both routine and nonroutine veterinary immobilizations. Generalized linear and generalized linear mixed models were used to determine the efficacy of each biomarker to predict all-cause morbidity, defined as the presence of at least one chronic condition, or cardiac disease as a subset of all-cause morbidity. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine associations between biomarkers and mortality risk from any cause. Analyses were conducted using two data sets for each species, one with all values retained (chimpanzees: n = 148; bonobos: n = 33) and the other from samples collected during routine immobilizations only (chimpanzees: n = 95; bonobos: n = 23). Consistent results across both data sets in chimpanzees included associations of higher cortisol with all-cause morbidity risk, lower creatinine with cardiac disease risk, and higher creatinine with mortality risk, and in bonobos were increased cardiac disease risk with higher cortisol and lower dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate, fructosamine, and triglycerides. However, there were some inconsistencies between data sets, such as tumor necrosis factor-α predicting mortality risk positively in chimpanzees when all values were retained, but negatively for routine values only. Despite the close evolutionary relationships between chimpanzees and bonobos, the only result observed in both species was a negative association between albumin and mortality risk in the all values retained data sets. Thus, data suggest some biomarkers may be useful predictors of future health outcomes, although a better understanding of both individual and species variation in biomarkers and their contribution to health risks is needed. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT: Cardiovascular disease is common among chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), and serial blood pressure monitoring in conscious animals may improve disease surveillance and guide hypertension treatment strategies. The objective of this study was to compare the accuracy of a noninvasive, oscillometric blood pressure monitor using a finger blood pressure cuff with invasively measured blood pressure in anesthetized chimpanzees. Twelve chimpanzees were anesthetized with tiletamine-zolazepam intramuscularly, intubated, and maintained on inhaled isoflurane to effect. Blood pressure measurements, which included systolic arterial pressure (SAP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and diastolic arterial pressure (DAP), were collected simultaneously from an oscillometric blood pressure cuff placed on a forelimb digit (FBP) and a direct arterial catheter (IBP) every 5-10 min while anesthetized. One hundred paired samples were collected, and results were compared using Bland-Altman plots and analysis. FBP showed good agreement with IBP for SAP, MAP, and DAP but consistently overestimated values compared with IBP. FBP may be useful for serial blood pressure monitoring in conscious chimpanzees. © 2023 American Association of Zoo Veterinarians. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Great apes lose suitable habitats required for their reproduction and survival due to human activities across their distribution range in Africa. Little is known about habitat suitability of the Nigeria–Cameroon chimpanzee [Pan troglodytes ellioti (Matschie, 1914)], particularly for populations inhabiting forest reserves in North-West Cameroon. To address this knowledge gap, we employed a common species distribution model (MaxEnt) to map and predict suitable habitats for the Nigeria–Cameroon chimpanzee in Kom-Wum Forest Reserve, North-West Cameroon, based on environmental factors that potentially affect habitat suitability. We related these environmental factors to a dataset of chimpanzee occurrence points recorded during line transect and reconnaissance (recce) surveys in the forest reserve and surrounding forests. Up to 91% of the study area is unsuitable for chimpanzees. Suitable habitats only represented 9% of the study area, with a high proportion of highly suitable habitats located outside the forest reserve. Elevation, secondary forests density, distance to villages and primary forests density were the most important predictors of habitat suitability for the Nigeria–Cameroon chimpanzee. The probability of chimpanzee occurrence increased with elevation, secondary forest density and distance from villages and roads. Our study provides evidence that suitable chimpanzee habitat in the reserve is degraded, suggesting that efforts to maintain protected areas are insufficient. The reserve management plan needs to be improved to conserve the remaining suitable habitat and to avoid local extinction of this endangered subspecies. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Current COVID-19 vaccines are effective countermeasures to control the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic by inducing systemic immune responses through intramuscular injection. However, respiratory mucosal immunization will be needed to elicit local sterilizing immunity to prevent virus replication in the nasopharynx, shedding, and transmission. In this study, we first compared the immunoprotective ability of a chimpanzee replication–deficient adenovirus–vectored COVID-19 vaccine expressing a stabilized pre–fusion spike glycoprotein from the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain Wuhan–Hu–1 (BV-AdCoV-1) administered through either aerosol inhalation, intranasal spray, or intramuscular injection in cynomolgus monkeys and rhesus macaques. Compared with intranasal administration, aerosol inhalation of BV-AdCoV-1 elicited stronger humoral and mucosal immunity that conferred excellent protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in rhesus macaques. Importantly, aerosol inhalation induced immunity comparable to that obtained by intramuscular injection, although at a significantly lower dose. Furthermore, to address the problem of immune escape variants, we evaluated the merits of heterologous boosting with an adenovirus–based Omicron BA.1 vaccine (C68–COA04). Boosting rhesus macaques vaccinated with two doses of BV-AdCoV-1 with either the homologous or the heterologous C68–COA04 vector resulted in cross–neutralizing immunity against WT, Delta, and Omicron subvariants, including BA.4/5 stronger than that obtained by administering a bivalent BV-AdCoV-1/C68–COA04 vaccine. These results demonstrate that the administration of BV-AdCoV-1 or C68–COA04 via aerosol inhalation is a promising approach to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission and curtail the pandemic spread. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzee’s nocturnal sleep is a dynamic and complex process, still not fully understood. As in humans, not getting enough quality sleep due to frequent or lasting disruptions may affect their physical and mental health, hence wellbeing, which may be reflected in their daytime behavior. This study aims to understand the impact of abiotic factors, such as temperature and humidity on the nocturnal activity as well as the impact of nocturnal awakening events on daytime behavior in sanctuary-housed chimpanzees. We monitored noisy nocturnal activity through audio recordings for one year, documenting the number and duration of sound events produced by chimpanzees to indicate sleep fragmentation and disruption intensity, respectively. Our results indicate that indoor temperature and humidity indeed influence the chimpanzee’s nocturnal activity. Furthermore, sleep fragmentation and intensity of nocturnal events significantly influenced the following day’s behavior. After nights marked by frequent and/or intense sleep disruptions, higher levels of inactivity, and abnormal and self-directed behaviors were observed, and chimpanzees spent more time on affiliative interactions and in social proximity. These findings highlight the importance of controlling factors influencing nocturnal sleep quality. Furthermore, we demonstrated that economic audio recordings used to monitor nocturnal activity, provide insights into the chimpanzee’s behavior and wellbeing. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The study used the records of 188 chimpanzees that were immobilised with medetomidine and ketamine for annual health checks from 1998 to 2020. The initial dose for each animal was estimated as 5 mg/kg ketamine plus 0.05 mg/kg medetomidine administered intramuscularly. When necessary, additional intramuscular top-ups of 5 mg/kg ketamine plus 0.05 mg/kg medetomidine were given. Monitoring started from the moment the animals were on the examination table until they were placed back in their enclosure. All animals were positioned in dorsal recumbency. Physiologic parameters including heart rate (beats per minute), respiration rate (breaths per minute), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2, %) and rectal temperature (°C) were measured. Atipamezole was administered at five times the dose of medetomidine. Time to first sign of sedation, time to recumbency, time from darting to reversal, time to first sign of recovery, time to head up and sternal, and time to standing were also measured. © 2023 British Veterinary Association.

ABSTRACT: The impact of re-introduction of a temporally separated individual to a group on social integration and hormone levels is an important topic in terms of the management and welfare of captive animals. Using two cases in which a temporally separated male re-joined an all-male group of captive chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, we investigated how social reunion affected social interactions and salivary steroid hormone levels (C, cortisol; T, testosterone). In both cases, social reunion was conducted over three stages, separation, acclimation, and reunion. In both cases, behavioral observations revealed increased agonism and tension reduction after the reunion, suggesting that the reunion induced reformation of social relationships. In both cases, the separated male showed an increased C level at the acclimation stage, in which the separated male was moved to its original indoor room and released solely into an outdoor compound. The T level did not vary among males or stages, but increased for the re-joined male after reunion in one of the two cases. This study suggests that the relationships between hormones and behavior during a reunion could be affected by multiple factors and that special attention should be paid to the acclimation rather than characteristics of social reunion, to ensure the success of member reunion. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to ISPA, CRL.

ABSTRACT: Through syntax, i.e., the combination of words into larger phrases, language can express a limitless number of messages. Data in great apes, our closest-living relatives, are central to the reconstruction of syntax’s phylogenetic origins, yet are currently lacking. Here, we provide evidence for syntactic-like structuring in chimpanzee communication. Chimpanzees produce “alarm-huus” when surprised and “waa-barks” when potentially recruiting conspecifics during aggression or hunting. Anecdotal data suggested chimpanzees combine these calls specifically when encountering snakes. Using snake presentations, we confirm call combinations are produced when individuals encounter snakes and find that more individuals join the caller after hearing the combination. To test the meaning-bearing nature of the call combination, we use playbacks of artificially-constructed call combinations and both independent calls. Chimpanzees react most strongly to call combinations, showing longer looking responses, compared with both independent calls. We propose the “alarm-huu + waa-bark” represents a compositional syntactic-like structure, where the meaning of the call combination is derived from the meaning of its parts. Our work suggests that compositional structures may not have evolved de novo in the human lineage, but that the cognitive building-blocks facilitating syntax may have been present in our last common ancestor with chimpanzees. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Agriculture expansion is a major cause of habitat loss and exposure to phytochemical pollution for non-human primates. In addition to endocrine disruption, exposure to pesticides may have other sublethal physiological consequences for animals, such as generation of oxidative damage to macromolecules. In this study, we analyzed the pesticides contained in the river water across the home range of wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in Sebitoli area located on the Northern part of Kibale National Park (Uganda). We tested whether levels of three urinary markers of oxidative damage vary among individuals in relation to their ranging patterns, as a proxy for pesticide exposure intensity. To better characterize the foraging habitat use, the trophic level, and the energetic status of study individuals, we also quantified urinary levels of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope signatures and of C-peptide. Among the 511 pesticides screened, 18 compounds including herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides were found in the water sampled in the Western part of the home range of chimpanzees. In this area, chimpanzees used to feed on maize crops. By contrast, in the Eastern part where crop feeding was never observed, we found only seven pesticides. According to their ranging patterns and thus crop feeding frequency, the 139 urine samples collected from 43 Sebitoli chimpanzees were categorized as belonging to low, medium, and high exposure level. Chimpanzees from the high exposure zone had higher oxidative DNA damage (8-OHdG) than chimpanzees from both the low and medium exposure groups, who had similar levels of oxidative DNA damage. In addition, individuals with higher C-peptide tended to have significantly higher oxidative DNA damage and lipid peroxides. The three exposure groups had similar levels of urinary 8-isoprostanes and of urinary lipid peroxides. These results were robust for any potential confounding effect of other variables because neither age category nor sex or isotope levels were significantly associated with markers of oxidative damage. Our study points to genotoxic effects as one potential sublethal consequence of ranging in proximity of agricultural fields owing to exposure to pesticides or other unidentified sources of stress. Given our phylogenetic proximity, this information is relevant for the conservation of this species which is endangered and also sentinel for human health. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Humans and chimpanzees are genetically similar and share a number of life history, behavioral, cognitive and neuroanatomical similarities. Notwithstanding, our understanding of age-related changes in cognitive and motor functions in chimpanzees remains largely unstudied despite recent evident demonstrating that chimpanzees exhibit many of the same neuropathological features of Alzheimer's disease observed in human postmortem brains. Here, we examined age-related differences in cognition and cortical thickness measured from magnetic resonance images in a sample of 215 chimpanzees ranging in age between 9 and 54 years. We found that chimpanzees showed global and region-specific thinning of cortex with increasing age. Further, within the elderly cohort, chimpanzees that performed better than average had thicker cortex in frontal, temporal and parietal regions compared to chimpanzees that performed worse than average. Independent of age, we also found sex differences in cortical thickness in 4 brain regions. Males had higher adjusted cortical thickness scores for the caudal anterior cingulate, rostral anterior cingulate, and medial orbital frontal while females had higher values for the inferior parietal cortex. We found no evidence that increasing age nor sex was associated with asymmetries in cortical thickness. Moreover, age-related differences in cognitive function were only weakly associated with asymmetries in cortical thickness. In summary, as has been reported in humans and other primates, elderly chimpanzees show thinner cortex and variation in cortical thickness is associated with general cognitive functions. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: When chimpanzees search for hidden food, do they realize that their guesses may not be correct? We applied a post-decision wagering paradigm to a simple two-cup search task, varying whether we gave participants visual access to the baiting and then asking after they had chosen one of the cups whether they would prefer a smaller but certain reward instead of their original choice (experiment 1). Results showed that chimpanzees were more likely to accept the smaller reward in occluded than visible conditions. Experiment 2 found the same effect when we blocked visual access but manipulated the number of hiding locations for the food piece, showing that the effect is not owing to representation type. Experiments 3 and 4 showed that when given information about the contents of the unchosen cup, chimpanzees were able to flexibly update their choice behaviour accordingly. These results suggest that language is not a pre-requisite to solving the disjunctive syllogism and provides a valuable contribution to the debate on logical reasoning in non-human animals. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The expansion of agriculture in equatorial areas is fragmenting and reducing wildlife habitats. For primates, it also increases opportunities to consume crops as high-energy resources, exacerbates conflicts with farmers, and increases exposure to diseases and agrochemicals at the edge of protected areas. In species with sex differences in ranging behavior, individual exposure to such opportunities and threats may vary by sex. Chimpanzees show a great feeding flexibility and are territorial species with varied ranging patterns according to site, sex, or individuals. Within a community whose territory is crossed by a high-traffic road and partially bordered by maize gardens, we tested hypotheses of interindividual differences in access to crops based on age, sex, ranging behavior, and kinship. By analyzing the presence of Sebitoli chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, Kibale National Park, Uganda) on video clips from 16 camera traps, we estimated the individual dispersion range across the community's territory and the crop foraging frequency along maize gardens over 16 months. While all age and sex classes were represented at the forest-garden interface, large intrasex differences were observed: some mature males and females were not observed to participate. The crop foraging frequency of adult females in maize gardens was significantly correlated with the location of their ranging areas. Related individuals revealed similar range patterns within the forest territory without sharing crop foraging habits. However, social learning and energy and risks-benefits trade-offs as potential drivers of crop consumption are not excluded. © The Author(s) 2022.

ABSTRACT: Social learning is beneficial in almost every domain of a social animal's life, but it is particularly important in the context of predation and foraging. In both contexts, social animals tend to produce acoustically distinct vocalizations, alarms, and food calls, which have remained somewhat of an evolutionary conundrum as they appear to be costly for the signaller. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that food calls function to direct others toward novel food items, using a playback experiment on a group of chimpanzees. We showed chimpanzees novel (plausibly edible) items while simultaneously playing either conspecific food calls or acoustically similar greeting calls as a control. We found that individuals responded by staying longer near items previously associated with food calls even in the absence of these vocalizations, and peered more at these items compared with the control items, provided no conspecifics were nearby. We also found that once chimpanzees had access to both item types, they interacted more with the one previously associated with food calls than the control items. However, we found no evidence of social learning per se. Given these effects, we propose that food calls may gate and thus facilitate social learning by directing listeners' attention to new feeding opportunities, which if integrated with additional cues could ultimately lead to new food preferences within social groups. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Wild chimpanzees live in large, mixed-sex groups that display a fission–fusion social organization. To provide a social environment more like that of wild chimpanzees, Chimp Haven integrated smaller groups of 3–4 individuals into one large group of 18 individuals. This large group was introduced to a 20,234.28 m2 forested habitat and associated indoor areas. This space was designed to allow the individual chimpanzees to choose their proximity to social companions and provide the group with a more natural environment in which they could express more species-typical behavior. The study took place over a 7-month period that began two weeks prior to the first groups being integrated and ended 4 months after the chimpanzees were released into the habitat. We collected data on the chimpanzees’ arboreal, terrestrial, indoor, and outdoor spatial use. The chimpanzees’ proximity to their nearest neighbor was also recorded, noting whether they were touching or within arm’s reach. Data were collected during daytime and nighttime hours and were utilized to make management decisions about potential group formations. We examined the data using generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) with individual subjects as a random factor and months as a repeated measure for location and proximity results. There were significant differences in the use of arboreal and outside space over the 7-month time frame, with females more likely to use the arboreal space than males. The chimpanzees were more likely to utilize the habitat over time and increased their proximity to group mates. The results of this study indicate that the chimpanzees responded positively to living in large groups in a spacious naturalistic environment. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Testosterone promotes mating effort, which involves intraspecific aggression for males of many species. Therefore, males with higher testosterone levels are often thought to be more aggressive. For mammals living in multimale groups, aggression is hypothesized to link male social status (i.e. dominance rank) and testosterone levels, given that high status predicts mating success and is acquired partly through aggressive intragroup competition. In male chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, dominance rank has been repeatedly linked to interindividual variation in testosterone levels, but evidence directly linking interindividual variation in testosterone and aggression is lacking. In the present study, we test both aggression levels and lean muscle mass, as measured by urinary creatinine, as links between dominance rank and testosterone levels in a large sample of wild male chimpanzees. Multivariate analyses indicated that dominance rank was positively associated with total rates of intragroup aggression, average urinary testosterone levels and average urinary creatinine levels. Testosterone was positively associated with creatinine levels but negatively associated with total aggression rates. Furthermore, mediation analyses showed that testosterone levels facilitated an association between dominance rank and creatinine levels. Our results indicate that (1) adult male chimpanzees with higher average testosterone levels are often higher ranking but not more aggressive than males with lower testosterone and (2) lean muscle mass links dominance rank and testosterone levels in Ngogo males. We assert that aggression rates are insufficient to explain links between dominance rank and testosterone levels in male chimpanzees and that other social variables (e.g. male–male relationship quality) may regulate testosterone's links to aggression. © 2023

ABSTRACT: Serum sickness-like reaction from serum sickness is critical. Serum sickness-like reaction has comparable symptoms to serum sickness, but their underlying pathophysiology is distinct. This delayed hypersensitivity response was first characterized as a drug-induced reaction and is uncommon in adults; it is more common in children. COVID-19 vaccinations are now being routinely given in the COVID-19 period, and adverse reactions to immunization have been recorded. We present a case of COVID-19 vaccination-induced serum sickness-like reaction which developed after receiving the first dose of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Infectious bronchitis (IB) is an acute and highly contagious disease caused by avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), resulting in significant economic losses in the global poultry industry. In this study, we utilized a replication-incompetent adenovirus vector derived from chimpanzees for the first time to express the S gene of IBV. The adenovirus was successfully rescued and demonstrated convenient production, good growth performance, and stability on HEK293 A cells. Morphologically, the recombinant adenovirus (named PAD-S) appeared normal under transmission electron microscopy, and efficient expression of the exogenous gene was confirmed through immunofluorescence analysis and immunoblotting. Administration of PAD-S via ocular and nasal routes induced a strong immune response in the chicken population, as evidenced by specific antibody and cytokine measurements. PAD-S was unable to replicate within chickens and showed low pre-existing immunity, demonstrating high safety and environmental friendliness. The robust immune response triggered by PAD-S immunization effectively suppressed viral replication in various tissues, alleviating clinical symptoms and tissue damage, thus providing complete protection against viral challenges in the chicken population. In conclusion, this study successfully developed an IBV candidate vaccine strain that possesses biosafety, high protective efficacy, and ease of production. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Gene flow and incomplete lineage sorting are two distinct sources of phylogenetic conflict, i.e., gene trees that differ in topology from each other and from the species tree. Distinguishing between the two processes is a key objective of current evolutionary genomics. This is most often pursued via the so-called ABBA-BABA type of method, which relies on a prediction of symmetry of gene tree discordance made by the incomplete lineage sorting hypothesis. Gene flow, however, need not be asymmetric, and when it is not, ABBA-BABA approaches do not properly measure the prevalence of gene flow. I introduce Aphid, an approximate maximum-likelihood method aimed at quantifying the sources of phylogenetic conflict via topology and branch length analysis of three-species gene trees. Aphid draws information from the fact that gene trees affected by gene flow tend to have shorter branches, and gene trees affected by incomplete lineage sorting longer branches, than the average gene tree. Accounting for the among-loci variance in mutation rate and gene flow time, Aphid returns estimates of the speciation times and ancestral effective population size, and a posterior assessment of the contribution of gene flow and incomplete lineage sorting to the conflict. Simulations suggest that Aphid is reasonably robust to a wide range of conditions. Analysis of coding and non-coding data in primates illustrates the potential of the approach and reveals that a substantial fraction of the human/chimpanzee/gorilla phylogenetic conflict is due to ancient gene flow. Aphid also predicts older speciation times and a smaller estimated effective population size in this group, compared to existing analyses assuming no gene flow. © 2024, Centre Mersenne.

ABSTRACT: Questionnaires based on human models can be used to reliably assess personality also in non-human primates. In this study, we used an adapted version of Eysenck's Psychoticism-Extraversion-Neuroticism (PEN) model that focuses on three higher-order personality traits. Extending previous work on a small group of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), we tested 37 chimpanzees housed at Fundació Mona (Girona, Spain) and the Leipzig Zoo (Germany). We assessed personality with a 12-item questionnaire, which raters scored using a 7-point Likert scale. To identify the personality traits, we conducted data reduction with Principal Components Analysis and Robust Unweighted Least Squares. The ICCs for the single (3, 1) and average (3, k) ratings indicated substantial agreement between raters. Parallel analyses identified two factors to retain, whereas the scree plot inspection and eigenvalues larger than one rule identified three factors. Factor 1 and 2 in our study were identical to the ones previously described for this species (labelled Extraversion and Neuropsychoticism, respectively) and we also obtained a third factor that could be related to Dominance (Fearless Dominance). Thus, our results confirm the potential of the PEN model to describe chimpanzee personality structure. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Effective species conservation management relies on detailed species distribution data. For many species, such as chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), distribution data are collected during ground surveys. For chimpanzees, such ground surveys usually focus on detection of the nests they build instead of detection of the chimpanzees themselves due to their low density. However, due to the large areas they still occur in, such surveys are very costly to conduct and repeat frequently to monitor populations over time. Species distribution models are more accurate if they include presence as well as absence data. Earlier studies used drones to determine chimpanzee presence using nests. In this study, therefore, we explored the use of drones to determine the absence of chimpanzee nests in areas we flew over on the edge of the chimpanzee distribution in western Tanzania. We conducted 13 flights with a fixed-wing drone and collected 3560 images for which manual inspection took 180 h. Flights were divided into a total of 746 25 m2 plots for which we determined the absence probability of nests. In three flights, we detected nests, in eight, absence was assumed based on a 95% probability criterion, and in two flights, nest absence could not be assumed. Our study indicates that drones can be used to cover relatively large areas to determine the absence of chimpanzees. To fully benefit from the usage of drones to determine the presence and absence of chimpanzees, it is crucial that methods are developed to automate nest detection in images. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Available COVID-19 vaccine only provide protection for a limited time due in part to the rapid emergence of viral variants with spike protein mutations, necessitating the generation of new vaccines to combat SARS-CoV-2. Two serologically distinct replication-defective chimpanzee-origin adenovirus (Ad) vectors (AdC) called AdC6 and AdC7 expressing early SARS-CoV-2 isolate spike (S) or nucleocapsid (N) proteins, the latter expressed as a fusion protein within herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D (gD), were tested individually or as a mixture in a hamster COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 challenge model. The S protein expressing AdC (AdC-S) vectors induced antibodies including those with neutralizing activity that in part cross-reacted with viral variants. Hamsters vaccinated with the AdC-S vectors were protected against serious disease and showed accelerated recovery upon SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Protection was enhanced if AdC-S vectors were given together with the AdC vaccines that expressed the gD N fusion protein (AdC-gDN). In contrast hamsters that just received the AdC-gDN vaccines showed only marginal lessening of symptoms compared to control animals. These results indicate that immune response to the N protein that is less variable than the S protein may potentiate and prolong protection achieved by the currently used S protein based genetic COVID-19 vaccines. © 2022 Institut Pasteur

ABSTRACT: Optimal foraging theory has guided much of the research on foraging behaviour in the past five decades, with the notion of optimality deeply embedded in most models today. However, assuming that all foragers strive to maximize a certain predefined currency, such as amount of food per unit time, restricts what can be learned about the factors influencing foraging decisions. Here we applied a different approach: the discrete-choice model, which does not assume an optimal strategy as the starting point, but instead examines foraging decisions directly, modelling interpatch movements as the consequence of a choice of destination from a limited set of options. We analysed a set of foraging decisions by both adult male and female chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, from two habituated communities in the Budongo forest, Uganda, to investigate the influence of foraging variables including food patch characteristics and interpatch distance on patch choice, with a view to identifying the strategy underlying these decisions. Despite differences in habitat between communities, we found that foraging strategies were remarkably similar across both communities and sexes, with chimpanzees exhibiting a clear preference for closer and novel (not previously visited) food patches. Individuals of both communities frequently chose to forage on food patches providing young leaves, highlighting the importance of this food type in their diet. Contrary to expectation, patch size did not predict foraging decisions, except for adult males of one community that chose larger patches, while both sexes aimed to minimize travel distance between consecutive patches. This study provides the first direct evidence that chimpanzees consider travel distance and whether they have recently visited a patch when choosing between potential foraging sites and demonstrates that new insights can be gained (even in a well-studied system) from integrating several important variables describing feeding ecology into a coherent model of patch choice. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: – Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in Senegal may use nocturnality to mitigate hyperthermia risk in semi-arid environments but the degree of nocturnality for such chimpanzees also in sympatry with large carnivores remains uncertain. We compared diel activity among chimpanzees and their potential predators at Assirik in Niokolo-Koba National Park and contextualized these findings relative to other unit-groups in savanna landscapes. From 2015-2018, we generated a predator inventory using multi-modal methods and monitored the diel activity of chimpanzees and predators with camera traps [N = 2092 camera trap (CT) days]. From 2015-2023, we also surveyed for evidence of predation during recce walks. Six potential nonhuman predators occur at Assirik, including lions (Panthera leo), leopards (Panthera pardus), spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta), African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus), Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus), and rock pythons (Python sebae). We documented one suspected case of a predator killing a chimpanzee. Nocturnality comprised 12.7% of CT events for chimpanzees and these events were more concentrated at twilight. Chimpanzees were more active during the day, predators were more active at night, and there was substantial temporal overlap among chimpanzees and potential predators during twilight intervals. Our findings support the hypothesis that savanna chimpanzees in Senegal are active at night in response to the extremely hot environment. We hypothesize that Assirik chimpanzees experience a tension between decreasing hyperthermia and increasing predation risk during nocturnality. © STACY LINDSHIELD ET AL., 2024.

ABSTRACT: In social species, individuals may be able to overcome competitive constraints on cooperation by leveraging relationships with familiar, tolerant partners. While strong social ties have been linked to cooperation in several social mammals, it is unclear the extent to which weak social ties can support cooperation, particularly among non-kin. We tested the hypothesis that weakly affiliative social relationships support cooperative coalition formation using 10 years of behavioural data on wild female chimpanzees. Female chimpanzees typically disperse and reside with non-kin as adults. Their social relationships are differentiated but often relatively weak, with few dyads sharing strong bonds. Females occasionally form aggressive coalitions together. Three measures of relationship quality - party association, five-metre proximity and whether a dyad groomed - positively predicted coalitions, indicating that relationship quality influenced coalition partnerships. However, dyads that groomed frequently did not form more coalitions than dyads that groomed occasionally, and kin did not cooperate more than expected given their relationship quality. Thus, strong bonds and kinship did not bolster cooperation. We conclude that cooperative coalitions among female chimpanzees depend on social tolerance but do not require strong bonds. Our findings highlight social tolerance as a distinct pathway through which females can cultivate cooperative relationships.

ABSTRACT: We must ensure the welfare of captive chimpanzees. One way to do so is by building environments that enable chimpanzees to express evolved cognitive abilities and skills. These environments must therefore include "cognitive enrichment" that resemble daily challenges that chimpanzees in the wild must meet if they are to survive and reproduce. In the Kumamoto Sanctuary of Kyoto University, Japan, we introduced fission-fusion emulation, a dynamic group management system in which the spatiotemporal cohesion within a group in terms of space, group size, and group membership was changed by human caretakers. Kumamoto Sanctuary also instituted a new experimental system that balances the needs of human experimenters and the chimpanzee participants by ensuring that the chimpanzees do not experience stress during experimental procedures. Moreover, because conservation has become an increasingly important consideration, the cognitive challenges at Kumamoto Sanctuary are designed to allow captive chimpanzees to engage in decision making on a daily basis. Conservation activities also need to consider the needs of local people and their chimpanzee neighbors. A plantation project in a fragmented habitat with anthropogenic activity can be regarded as environmental enrichment on a large scale, in chimpanzees' natural habitat. These enrichment designs, one in Kumamoto Sanctuary and one in chimpanzees' natural habitat, not only maximize chimpanzee welfare, but also enable chimpanzees to express their natural behaviors to the fullest extent possible. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

ABSTRACT: Within this evolutionary framework, we can reasonably assume that feeding-related features observed in extant primates should be, at least in theory, demonstrably the result of natural selection. It is the demonstrable aspect of this important assumption that those concerned with dietary adaptations in the present and in the evolutionary past must confront. In addition to information derived from morphology, it is a truism that scientists studying extant primates have the luxury of observing the function of diet-related anatomy via direct observation of a feeding animal, while those scientists evaluating fossil species do so in the absence of such data (Kay, 1984). Yet, both scientists confront a similar challenge, and in evolutionary terms yield comparably synchronic interpretations; the ghost of selection past haunts us all. Hence, our use of the powerful combination of comparative models, extant species analogs, and correlative evaluations as tools for interpreting changes in form and function over evolutionary time. © 2007 by Oxford University Press, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The sequence of Arabic numerals from 1 to 19 was taught to six chimpanzees, three pairs of mother and child. Each chimpanzee participant sat facing a touchscreen on which the numerals appeared in random positions within an imaginary 5-by-8 matrix. They had to touch the numerals in ascending order. Baseline training involved touching the adjacent numerals from 1 to X or from the numeral X to 19. Systematic tests revealed the following results: (1) The range 1 to 9 was easier than 1 to 19. (2) Adjacent numerals were easier than nonadjacent ones. (3) The “masking” (memory task) caused deterioration of performance. All these factors depended on the number of numerals simultaneously presented on the screen. A chimpanzee named Pal mastered the skill of ordering two-digit numerals with 100% accuracy. Human participants were tested in the same experiment with the same procedure. Both species showed relative difficulty in handling two-digit numerals. Global–local information processing is known to be different between humans and other primates. The assessment of chimpanzee performance and comparison with humans were discussed in terms of the possible difference in the global–local dual information processing of two-digit numerals. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) are Critically Endangered and Guinea is a key stronghold for this subspecies. However, Guinea is also rich in minerals with some of the highest-grade iron-ore deposits in the world. Specifically, the Nimba Mountains, home to western chimpanzees, is one of the sites under consideration for mining activities. To assess the impact of mining activities in the area, we used non-invasive genetic sampling to estimate chimpanzee population size, sex ratio, community composition, and range boundaries on the western flank of the massif. The level of genetic diversity and affinity between communities was estimated and recommendations for future genetic censusing provided. Between 2003 and 2018, we collected 999 fecal samples of which 663 were analyzed using a panel of 26 microsatellites. We identified a minimum of 136 chimpanzees in four communities, with evidence of migratory events, a high level of shared ancestry and genetic diversity. We assessed sampling intensities and capture rates for each community. Saturation was reached in two communities with sampling between 3.2 and 4.3 times the estimated number of chimpanzees. Our findings highlight the utility of genetic censusing for temporal monitoring of ape abundance, as well as capturing migratory events and gauging genetic diversity and population viability over time. We recommend genetic sampling, combined with camera trapping, for use in future Environmental and Social Impact Assessments, as these methods can yield robust baselines for implementing the mitigation hierarchy, future biomonitoring and conservation management. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Introduction: The killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) play a pivotal role in modulating the NK cell responses, for instance, through interaction with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. Both gene systems map to different chromosomes but co-evolved during evolution. The human KIR gene family is characterized by abundant allelic polymorphism and copy number variation. In contrast, our knowledge of the KIR repertoire in chimpanzees is limited to 39 reported alleles, with no available population data. Only three genomic KIR region configurations have been mapped, and seventeen additional ones were deduced by genotyping. Methods: Previously, we documented that the chimpanzee MHC class I repertoire has been skewed due to an ancient selective sweep. To understand the depth of the sweep, we set out to determine the full-length KIR transcriptome – in our MHC characterized pedigreed West African chimpanzee cohort – using SMRT sequencing (PacBio). In addition, the genomic organization of 14 KIR haplotypes was characterized by applying a Cas9-mediated enrichment approach in concert with long-read sequencing by Oxford Nanopore Technologies. Results: In the cohort, we discovered 35 undescribed and 15 already recorded Patr-KIR alleles, and a novel hybrid KIR gene. Some KIR transcripts are subject to evolutionary conserved alternative splicing events. A detailed insight on the KIR region dynamics (location and order of genes) was obtained, however, only five new KIR region configurations were detected. The population data allowed to investigate the distribution of the MHC-C1 and C2-epitope specificity of the inhibitory lineage III KIR repertoire, and appears to be skewed towards C2. Discussion: Although the KIR region is known to evolve fast, as observed in other primate species, our overall conclusion is that the genomic architecture and repertoire in West African chimpanzees exhibit only limited to moderate levels of variation. Hence, the ancient selective sweep that affected the chimpanzee MHC class I region may also have impacted the KIR system.

ABSTRACT: Wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) live in flexible fission–fusion societies with frequent changes in both group size and composition. These changes depend mostly on resource availability and individual social preferences yet in captivity are determined by housing organizations. During a period of seven years, we observed a group of sanctuary chimpanzees, focusing on how they adapted to changes in the group composition over time. Using linear mixed models (LMMs), factors such as group size, sex ratio, seasonality, and the individuals’ sex and origin (wild caught vs. captive born) were considered in order to evaluate the impact on the chimpanzees’ activity levels, the occurrence of undesired behaviors (abnormal and self-directed behaviors) and the social grooming networks. Our results indicate that the activity levels and the occurrence of undesired behaviors were impacted by changes in group composition and the individuals’ biographic background. The colder season was marked by higher levels of activity and more time spent grooming. Moreover, it was the individuals’ origin but not changes in group composition that affected social grooming, with wild-caught chimpanzees grooming far less frequently. Long-term observations are essential to evaluate, predict and detect potential benefits and/or issues of housing conditions while considering the social and physical environment. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Human culture thrives by virtue of communication, yet whether communication plays an influential role in the cultural lives of other animals remains understudied. Here, we investigated whether chimpanzees use communication to engage in a cultural practice by analysing grooming handclasp (GHC) interactions-a socio-cultural behaviour requiring interindividual coordination for successful execution. Previous accounts attributed GHC initiations to behavioural shaping, whereby the initiator physically moulds the partner's arm into the desired GHC posture. Using frame-by-frame analysis and matched-control methodology, we find that chimpanzees do not only shape their partner's posture (22%), but also use gestural communication to initiate GHC (44%), which requires an active and synchronized response from the partner. Moreover, in a third (34%) of the GHC initiations, the requisite coordination was achieved by seemingly effortless synchrony. Lastly, using a longitudinal approach, we find that for GHC initiations, communication occurs more frequently than shaping in experienced dyads and less in mother-offspring dyads. These findings are consistent with ontogenetic ritualization, thereby reflecting first documentation of chimpanzees communicating to coordinate a cultural practice. We conclude that chimpanzees show interactional flexibility in the socio-cultural domain, opening the possibility that the interplay between communication and culture is rooted in our deep evolutionary history. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Intercommunity (lethal) aggression is a familiar component of the behavioural repertoire of many forest-dwelling chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) communities. However, until now, the absence of intercommunity attacks – including killings – in communities that live in open, mosaic environments has supported hypotheses of reduced resource competition in drier habitats, and informed referential models of early hominin social dynamics in a similar habitat. In June 2020, we observed the first instance of intercommunity lethal aggression, a male-committed infanticide, by the Issa chimpanzee community, which live in a savannah-mosaic habitat in the Issa Valley, western Tanzania. The carcass was recovered by researchers after it was abandoned by the attackers. Here, we give a detailed account of the events leading up to and including the infanticide, and contextualise our observations with what has been described for other chimpanzee communities. Notably, in contrast to the majority of reported intercommunity infanticides, the infant male victim was castrated (and not cannibalised), making this the youngest reported castration. This observation of intercommunity aggression disproves its hypothesised absence in savannah-dwelling chimpanzees, which by extension, has implications for early hominin evolution. We suggest that the near absence of observations of intercommunity aggression in savannah chimpanzee communities is most likely due to the lack of long-term study communities, and in some cases geographic isolation. We hypothesise that food-rich areas within a habitat with otherwise widely distributed food sources may select for intense intercommunity aggression despite the low population density characteristic of savannah communities. Anecdotes such as this add to the comparative database available on intercommunity killings in chimpanzee society, improving our ability to draw inferences about their evolutionary significance. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Studying animal behaviour allows us to understand how different species and individuals navigate their physical and social worlds. Video coding of behaviour is considered a gold standard: allowing researchers to extract rich nuanced behavioural datasets, validate their reliability, and for research to be replicated. However, in practice, videos are only useful if data can be efficiently extracted. Manually locating relevant footage in 10,000 s of hours is extremely time-consuming, as is the manual coding of animal behaviour, which requires extensive training to achieve reliability. Machine learning approaches are used to automate the recognition of patterns within data, considerably reducing the time taken to extract data and improving reliability. However, tracking visual information to recognise nuanced behaviour is a challenging problem and, to date, the tracking and pose-estimation tools used to detect behaviour are typically applied where the visual environment is highly controlled. Animal behaviour researchers are interested in applying these tools to the study of wild animals, but it is not clear to what extent doing so is currently possible, or which tools are most suited to particular problems. To address this gap in knowledge, we describe the new tools available in this rapidly evolving landscape, suggest guidance for tool selection, provide a worked demonstration of the use of machine learning to track movement in video data of wild apes, and make our base models available for use. We use a pose-estimation tool, DeepLabCut, to demonstrate successful training of two pilot models of an extremely challenging pose estimate and tracking problem: multi-animal wild forest-living chimpanzees and bonobos across behavioural contexts from hand-held video footage. With DeepWild we show that, without requiring specific expertise in machine learning, pose estimation and movement tracking of free-living wild primates in visually complex environments is an attainable goal for behavioural researchers. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Sleep is an important aspect of great ape life; these animals build sleeping platforms every night. In a community of chimpanzees, each subgroup selects a sleeping site where each individual builds a sleeping platform, mostly on a tree. Previous studies have measured the heights of sleeping platforms and sleeping trees to test the predation avoidance and thermoregulation hypotheses of sleeping site selection. However, it remains unclear how components of vegetation structure (vertical and horizontal) together determine the selection of sleeping sites by chimpanzees. Using botanical inventories around sleeping sites in a tropical rainforest of Cameroon, we found that chimpanzees preferentially sleep in trees measuring 40–50 cm in diameter. Regarding height, on average, sleeping trees measured 26 m and sleeping platforms were built at 16 m. To build sleeping platforms, chimpanzees preferred four tree species, which represent less than 3% of tree species in the study area. We demonstrate that the variation in abundance of tree species and the vertical and horizontal structure of the vegetation drive chimpanzee sleeping site selection. It was previously thought that preference for vegetation types was the driver of sleeping site selection in chimpanzees. However, results from this study indicate that the importance of vegetation types in sleeping site selection depends on their botanical characteristics including the variation in tree size, the abundance of all trees, the abundance of sleeping trees, and the occurrence of preferred sleeping tree species, which predict sleeping site selection. The height and diameter of trees are considered by chimpanzees when selecting a particular tree for sleeping and when selecting a site with a specific vertical structure. In addition to tree height, the abundance of smaller neighboring trees may also play a role in the chimpanzee antipredation strategy. Our results demonstrate that chimpanzees consider several vegetation parameters to establish sleeping sites. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT: Investigations into the role of selection in the origin of human bipedalism using ape models have relied heavily on behavioral frequency data. However, analysis of video of wild apes has the advantage of capturing the details of the entirety of each rare, brief bipedal bout witnessed, not just the moment detected in observational studies. We used video to explore the behavioral context and effects of several variables on bipedalism across all ages in wild forest-dwelling chimpanzees from Ngogo, Uganda. We found, as in earlier studies, that adult chimpanzees used bipedalism in the context of foraging; however, unlike earlier studies, we found that while foraging was the predominant behavioral context during arboreal bipedalism, terrestrial bipedalism was more varied in contextual composition. We also found that these different behavioral contexts of bipedalism were associated with different variables. Specifically, foraging was associated with arboreality, hand assistance, and adulthood; antagonism was associated with adulthood, locomotion, and males; play was associated with terrestriality and subadulthood; and travel was associated with locomotion and females. Given that several variables influence bipedalism across multiple behavioral contexts in chimpanzees, it is likely that the early evolution of human bipedalism occurred under the influence of numerous factors. This exploratory study thus suggests that more comprehensive models should be used when reconstructing the transition to bipedalism from the Last Common Ancestor of humans and chimpanzees.

ABSTRACT: Reports of primate violence frequently note wounds to the genital region, raising the possibility that attackers target genitals to eliminate the reproductive capacity of rivals. Alternatively, in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and other species with prominent genitals, injuries may occur simply because large size makes genitals easy targets. To test these hypotheses, we compiled records of wounds suffered by chimpanzees in four communities at three long-term study sites (Gombe, Tanzania; Kibale, Uganda; Fongoli, Senegal), including both nonlethal (N = 1,268 wounds; N = 891 male wounds; N = 377 female wounds) and lethal attacks (N = 258 wounds), to determine whether genital wounding occurred more frequently than expected by chance. In nonfatal cases, wounds occurred in the genital region more often than expected for females (Kasekela: N = 9/80 wounds, Mitumba: N = 8/61 wounds, Fongoli: N = 11/84 wounds, Kanyawara: N = 31/152 wounds), but only in Kasekela did males suffer genital wounds more often than expected by chance (Kasekela: N = 3/80 wounds, Mitumba: N = 2/48 wounds, Fongoli: N = 6/413 wounds, Kanyawara: N = 4/350 wounds). In contrast, killings of males involved genital wounds more often than expected (N = 12/258 wounds). Increased genital wounding may occur when genitals are more accessible, such as when females flee from male aggression, exposing their hindquarters, or when victims are immobilized during fatal attacks. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

ABSTRACT: Wild chimpanzees live in large and complex social communities, but their complexity is determined by the number of potential social partners as well as the frequent changes in group composition due to fission–fusion dynamics. Alternatively, captive housed chimpanzee groups are usually much smaller and less complex. However, studies have shown that groups can be housed in adjacent habitats, potentially increasing the number of social partners, i.e., granting additional relationship opportunities and enhanced social complexity. While most social network studies analyze social groups as closed systems, this study assessed the impact of social interactions between two neighboring groups of chimpanzees, based on two social network indices (Vertex strength centrality and Deviation from edge weight disparity). Furthermore, Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) were employed to assess whether gender, age, and intra-/intergroup directionality influenced these indices. We recorded occurrences of social behaviors, social proximity and whether chimpanzees observed individuals in the other group as a measure of interest. Most social behaviors were directed towards group members; however, 13% were directed towards the neighboring group. Although enclosure barriers constrained the chimpanzee’s capacity to physically interact, it does not necessarily impede social interactions with the outside world. Hence, the presence of neighboring chimpanzees potentially provides additional relationship opportunities, increasing social stimulation and complexity leading to an enriching social environment. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Mechanisms of inheritance remain poorly defined for many fitness-mediating traits, especially in long-lived animals with protracted development. Using 6,123 urinary samples from 170 wild chimpanzees, we examined the contributions of genetics, non-genetic maternal effects, and shared community effects on variation in cortisol levels, an established predictor of survival in long-lived primates. Despite evidence for consistent individual variation in cortisol levels across years, between-group effects were more influential and made an overwhelming contribution to variation in this trait. Focusing on within-group variation, non-genetic maternal effects accounted for 8% of the individual differences in average cortisol levels, significantly more than that attributable to genetic factors, which was indistinguishable from zero. These maternal effects are consistent with a primary role of a shared environment in shaping physiology. For chimpanzees, and perhaps other species with long life histories, community and maternal effects appear more relevant than genetic inheritance in shaping key physiological traits. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: When facing uncertainty, humans often build mental models of alternative outcomes. Considering diverging scenarios allows agents to respond adaptively to different actual worlds by developing contingency plans (covering one's bases). In a pre-registered experiment, we tested whether chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) prepare for two mutually exclusive possibilities. Chimpanzees could access two pieces of food, but only if they successfully protected them from a human competitor. In one condition, chimpanzees could be certain about which piece of food the human experimenter would attempt to steal. In a second condition, either one of the food rewards was a potential target of the competitor. We found that chimpanzees were significantly more likely to protect both pieces of food in the second relative to the first condition, raising the possibility that chimpanzees represent and prepare effectively for different possible worlds.  © 2023 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees were once thought to sleep primarily in the trees, but recent studies indicate that some populations also construct terrestrial night nests. This behavior has relevance not only to understanding the behavioral diversity of Pan troglodytes, but also to the conservation of the species, given that nest encounter rates are often used to estimate great ape population densities. A proper estimate of decay rates for ground nests is necessary for converting the encounter rate of nests to the density of weaned chimpanzees. Here we present the results of the first systematic comparative study between the decay rates of arboreal and terrestrial chimpanzee nests, from the Bugoma Central Forest Reserve in western Uganda. We followed the decay of 56 ground and 51 tree nests in eight nest groups between April 2020 and October 2021. For 15 of the ground and 19 of the tree nests, we collected detailed information on the condition of the nests every two weeks; we checked the remaining 73 nests only twice. On average, ground nests lasted 238 days versus 276 days for tree nests (p = 0.05). Of the 107 total nests surveyed, 51% of tree and 64% of ground nests had disappeared after six months. Based on our results, we propose a modification of the formula used to convert nest density into chimpanzee density. Our results highlight the importance of taking into account potential differences in decay rates between ground versus tree nests, which will likely influence our understanding of the distribution of ground nesting behavior in chimpanzee across tropical Africa, as well as our estimations of the densities of ground nesting populations. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are avid tool users, although tool uses and functions vary among communities. Some chimpanzees use stones or wood in extractive foraging to crack open nuts, whereas others use long stems to consume termites or ants. Leaf sponges are versatile and widespread tools used by chimpanzees, created by crumpling leaves in the mouth and then using the hands to immerse the tool to procure liquids from difficult-to-access locations. Here we describe leaf sponge use by two female chimpanzees in Kibale National Park, Uganda, documenting for the first time tool use in the Buraiga chimpanzee community. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Localizing wildlife contributes in multiple ways to species conservation. Data on animal locations can reveal elements of social behavior, habitat use, population dynamics, and be useful in calculating population density. Acoustic localization systems (ALS) are a non-invasive method widely used in the marine sciences but not well established and rarely employed for terrestrial species. We deployed an acoustic array in a mountainous environment with heterogeneous vegetation, comprised of four custom-built GPS synchronized acoustic sensors at about 500 m intervals in Issa Valley, western Tanzania, covering an area of nearly 2 km2. Our goal was to assess the precision and error of the estimated locations by conducting playback tests, but also by comparing the estimated locations of wild chimpanzee calls with their true locations obtained in parallel during follows of individual chimpanzees. We assessed the factors influencing localization error, such as wind speed and temperature, which fluctuate during the day and are known to affect sound transmission. We localized 282 playback sounds and found that the mean localization error was 27 ± 21.8 m. Localization was less prone to error and more precise during early mornings (6:30 h) compared to other periods. We further localized 22 wild chimpanzee loud calls within 52 m of the location of a researcher closely following the calling individuals. We demonstrate that acoustic localization is a powerful tool for chimpanzee monitoring, with multiple behavioral and conservation applications. Its applicability in studying social dynamics and revealing density estimation among many others, especially but not exclusively for loud calling species, provides an efficient way of monitoring populations and informing conservation plans to mediate species loss. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Investment in social interaction and affiliative behaviour is often related to variation in sex-specific dispersal patterns among species but can also vary within species in response to local environmental conditions and feeding competition. Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) association patterns have been studied primarily in low and mid-elevation tropical forests. This study adds to our understanding of association patterns in chimpanzees by presenting the first data on association patterns in a high-elevation population at Nyungwe in equatorial Rwanda. Using data on co-occurrence in social parties (party association) and calculating gregariousness indices, we quantified levels of associations among age-sex classes relative to food (fruit) distribution and the presence of oestrous females. Overall, adult females in Nyungwe are less gregarious than males. Female but not male gregariousness increased when feeding on clumped foods, indicating that resource characteristics impact female association tendencies more intensely than males. Despite high elevation forests representing a habitat with relatively fewer fruit resources for chimpanzees, at an edge of range location, we found that gregariousness patterns were driven by similar factors as those in mid and low elevation chimpanzee populations. © 2022 Dipartimento di Biologia, Università di Firenze, Italia.

ABSTRACT: Vertebrate-mediated seed dispersal is vital to the maintenance of diversity in tropical ecosystems, and seed-dispersing animals are increasingly thought to provide ecosystem services by dispersing the seeds of plant species utilized by people. However, few studies have demonstrated a link between vertebrate frugivores and plants used by people, thus limiting the generalizability of the seed-disperser-as-ecosystem-service-provider concept. We examined the effectiveness of western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) as seed dispersers (i.e., their influence on seedling recruitment) of an economically important fruit resource, Saba senegalensis, at the site of Fongoli, a savanna-woodland environment in southeastern Senegal. The fruit from the Saba vine is commonly harvested from the wild by local people and is also an important food item for chimpanzees. We conducted germination experiments on gut-passed seeds alongside non-gut-passed seeds and analyzed the germination success of chimpanzee-dispersed seeds in situ. We also analyzed the effect of habitat type and canopy cover at each seed dispersal site to determine which sites are most suitable for Saba germination. Germination trials showed that chimpanzee gut passage and manual pulp removal increased the likelihood of germination over seeds left intact. Nearly a quarter of chimpanzee-dispersed seeds germinated in situ and Saba seeds were distributed nonrandomly throughout Fongoli, with more dispersed seeds found in habitats most suitable for Saba germination. These results suggest that chimpanzees aid in the early stages of Saba recruitment and thus provide an ecosystem service via seed dispersal that may contribute to the well-being of local people.

ABSTRACT: Background: Cataract is the major cause of visual impairment in humans. Phacoemulsification with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation is the standard technique for cataract treatment with a high success rate. In a few cases, the surgical cataract procedure and lens implantation have been applied in non-human primates. Case Description: A +/− 40-year-old female chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) in captivity was diagnosed with mature cataract optical density (OD) and posterior subcapsular cataract combined with cortical opacities OS after ophthalmic examination. To restore vision and facilitate far- and near sight, phacoemulsification OU with +22.5 diopter (D) IOL implantation OD and + 24 D OS were performed. Despite complicated surgery OD due to posterior capsular rupture, the outcome was successful during 1-year follow-up. The chimpanzee regained adequate vision, normal behavior, and was successfully re-introduced to her group of chimpanzees. Conclusion: This is the first case report of a simultaneous bilateral cataract surgery with IOL implantations in both eyes, targeting emmetropia OS and near vision OD resulting in monovision, in a chimpanzee. Vision was restored without postoperative complications. © 2023 The Authors. Veterinary Ophthalmology published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists.

ABSTRACT: Central and eastern chimpanzees are infected with Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) in the wild, typically without developing acute immunodeficiency. Yet the recent zoonotic transmission of chimpanzee SIV to humans, which were naïve to the virus, gave rise to the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), which causes AIDS and is responsible for one of the deadliest pandemics in human history. Chimpanzees have likely been infected with SIV for tens of thousands of years and have likely evolved to reduce its pathogenicity, becoming semi-natural hosts that largely tolerate the virus. In support of this view, central and eastern chimpanzees show evidence of positive selection in genes involved in SIV/HIV cell entry and immune response to SIV, respectively. We hypothesise that the population first infected by SIV would have experienced the strongest selective pressure to control the lethal potential of zoonotic SIV, and that population genetics will reveal those first critical adaptations. With that aim we used population genetics to investigate signatures of positive selection in the common ancestor of central-eastern chimpanzees. The genes with signatures of positive selection in the ancestral population are significantly enriched in SIV-related genes, especially those involved in the immune response to SIV and those encoding for host genes that physically interact with SIV/HIV (VIPs). This supports a scenario where SIV first infected the central-eastern ancestor and where this population was under strong pressure to adapt to zoonotic SIV. Interestingly, integrating these genes with candidates of positive selection in the two infected subspecies reveals novel patterns of adaptation to SIV. Specifically, we observe evidence of positive selection in numerous steps of the biological pathway responsible for T-helper cell differentiation, including CD4 and multiple genes that SIV/HIV use to infect and control host cells. This pathway is active only in CD4+ cells which SIV/HIV infects, and it plays a crucial role in shaping the immune response so it can efficiently control the virus. Our results confirm the importance of SIV as a selective factor, identify specific genetic changes that may have allowed our closest living relatives to reduce SIV’s pathogenicity, and demonstrate the potential of population genomics to reveal the evolutionary mechanisms used by naïve hosts to reduce the pathogenicity of zoonotic pathogens.

ABSTRACT: Objectives: In the present study, we have analyzed the anatomy of the radiocarpal joint ligaments and muscles in Pan troglodytes and Homo sapiens in order to identify similarities and differences between the two species that may be related to differences in hand use and function. Materials and Methods: Anatomical dissections of the ligaments and muscles of the radiocarpal joint were performed in six adult chimpanzees and 12 humans. The mass of each ligament and of the functional ligament groups were calculated relative to the total ligament mass and compared between the two species. The mass of the functional muscle groups relative to the total mass of the muscles of the radiocarpal joint was also calculated and compared between the two species. Results: The ligaments of the radiocarpal joint had similar anatomical characteristics in chimpanzees and humans. The relative mass of the palmar ligaments was greater in humans, while that of the dorsal radiocarpal ligament was greater in chimpanzees. In both species, the relative mass of the palmar and dorsal muscle groups was inversely related to that of the corresponding ligament groups. Discussion: The greater relative mass of the palmar ligaments in humans may be related to the importance of wrist extension during manipulative tasks. The greater relative mass of the dorsal radiocarpal ligament in chimpanzees may be related to the need to stabilize the radiocarpal joint in flexion, mainly during arboreal locomotion. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT: Using choline acetyltransferase immunohistochemistry, we describe the nuclear parcellation of the cholinergic system in the brains of two apes, a lar gibbon (Hylobates lar) and a chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes). The cholinergic nuclei observed in both apes studied are virtually identical to that observed in humans and show very strong similarity to the cholinergic nuclei observed in other primates and mammals more generally. One specific difference between humans and the two apes studied is that, with the specific choline acetyltransferase antibody used, the cholinergic pyramidal neurons observed in human cerebral cortex were not labeled. When comparing the two apes studied and humans to other primates, the presence of a greatly expanded cholinergic medullary tegmental field, and the presence of cholinergic neurons in the intermediate and dorsal horns of the cervical spinal cord are notable variations of the distribution of cholinergic neurons in apes compared to other primates. These neurons may play an important role in the modulation of ascending and descending neural transmissions through the spinal cord and caudal medulla, potentially related to the differing modes of locomotion in apes compared to other primates. Our observations also indicate that the average soma volume of the neurons forming the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT) is larger than those of the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPT) in both the lar gibbon and chimpanzee. This variability in soma volume appears to be related to the size of the adult derivatives of the alar and basal plate across mammalian species. © 2021 American Association for Anatomy.

ABSTRACT: Audience effects are key in studies of animal social cognition and are typically investigated during directed social interactions. Male chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, regularly perform aggressive displays in the presence of others, often targeting a specific group member, and combine this agonistic behaviour with acoustic signals. Here, we were interested in whether the production and structure of pant hoots, a long-distance signal, were influenced by audience composition (i.e. presence and absence of specific individuals). We investigated pant hoots produced during displays by adult and subadult males of Budongo Forest, Uganda. We found that males overall called more often when their preferred social partners and females were absent from the party, as well as when more dominant males were present. We then separately analysed the four phases of pant hoots, introduction, build-up, climax and let-down, and found that audience composition and social context could often explain the presence or absence of each phase. In addition, displays were often accompanied by drumming, especially by older males and when male audiences were small. Our study adds to the growing body of literature on audience effects and other social factors and shows their impact on the structure of a sophisticated vocal sequence, which enhances the communicative capacity in a species with limited vocal control. © 2022 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: In conservation biology, flagship species are defined as species that can raise support for biodiversity conservation in a given place or social context. In the newly established Gishwati–Mukura National Park in Rwanda, the Eastern chimpanzee was considered such an ambassador. To test whether the flagship species concept was effective in the park, we studied species richness, relative abundance, and species distribution (occupancy) of medium- to large-sized, ground-dwelling mammals using camera trapping technology. The impact of three environmental and three anthropogenic variables on species distribution was investigated and the ecological diversity of the fauna in the national park assessed. Over a period of 9 months, two 4 × 4 camera trapping grids were deployed in Gishwati and Mukura Forest. Sampling effort in each forest equated to 32 and 29 camera trapping locations, yielding 258 and 242 independent photographic events of eight and six species, respectively. In both forests, the Emin's giant poached rat was the most frequently encountered species, while all other species showed high relative abundance only in Gishwati Forest. The relative abundance of the endangered Eastern chimpanzee in Gishwati Forest was 0.54, the estimated occupancy was 0.31. Single-species, single-season occupancy models revealed that forest cover, altitude and distance to forest edge influenced the detectability of L'Hoest's monkey and squirrel species, while no effect was found on their occupancy. Notably, no larger herbivore or carnivore species were observed in the park, while the flagship species, i.e., the Eastern chimpanzee, was relatively abundant. Moreover, in both forests, all detected carnivores were small- to medium-sized, suggesting a meso-predator release phenomenon, i.e., populations of medium-sized predators increased after the removal of larger, top carnivores, due to relaxed competition. It appears that the prioritization of the flagship species resulted in the neglect of other mammalian species, leading eventually into the demise of entire functional guilds. Based on these results, the Gishwati–Mukura NP was categorized as a ‘depleted forest’. We, therefore, strongly object chimpanzees as a suitable flagship species—at least in the Gishwati–Mukura NP—and recommend collating more knowledge on the release of meso-predators and the loss of forest ungulates to improve their future conservation in Afro-montane forest habitats. © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Access to resources shapes species’ physiology and behaviour. Water is not typically considered a limiting resource for rainforest-living chimpanzees; however, several savannah and savannah-woodland communities show behavioural adaptations to limited water. Here, we provide a first report of habitual well-digging in a rainforest-living group of East African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) and suggest that it may have been imported into the community’s behavioural repertoire by an immigrant female. We describe the presence and frequency of well-digging and related behaviour, and suggest that its subsequent spread in the group may have involved some degree of social learning. We highlight that subsurface water is a concealed resource, and that the limited spread of well-digging in the group may highlight the cognitive, rather than physical, challenges it presents in a rainforest environment. © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background. Dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate is the most abundant circulating androgen in humans and other catarrhines. It is involved in several biological functions, such as testosterone production, glucocorticoid antagonist actions, neurogenesis and neuroplasticty. Although the role of dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEAS) in cognition remains elusive, the DHEAS/cortisol ratio has been positively associated with a slower cognitive age-decline and improved mood in humans. Whether this relationship is found in nonhuman primates remains unknown. Methods. We measured DHEAS and cortisol levels in serum of 107 adult chimpanzees to investigate the relationship between DHEAS levels and age. A subset of 21 chimpanzees was used to test the potential associations between DHEAS, cortisol, and DHEAS/cortisol ratio in cognitive function, taking into account age, sex, and their interactions. We tested for cognitive function using the primate cognitive test battery (PCTB) and principal component analyses to categorize cognition into three components: spatial relationship tasks, tool use and social communication tasks, and auditory-visual sensory perception tasks. Results. DHEAS levels, but not the DHEAS/cortisol ratio, declined with age in chimpanzees. Our analyses for spatial relationships tasks revealed a significant, positive correlation with the DHEAS/cortisol ratio. Tool use and social communication had a negative relationship with age. Our data show that the DHEAS/cortisol ratio, but not DHEAS individually, is a promising predictor of spatial cognition in chimpanzees. Copyright © 2022 Takeshita et al.

ABSTRACT: It has been suggested that non-human primates can respond to deceased conspecifics in ways that suggest they experience psychological states not unlike humans, some of which could indicate they exhibit a notion of death. Here, we report long-term demographic data from two East African chimpanzee groups. During a combined 40-year observation period, we recorded 191 births of which 68 died in infancy, mostly within the first year. We documented the post-mortem behaviour of the mothers and describe nine occasions where Budongo chimpanzee mothers carried infants for 1–3 days after their death, usually until the body started to decompose. We also observed three additional cases of extended carrying lasting for more than 2 weeks, one of which was followed by the unusual extended carrying of an object and another which lasted 3 months. In each case, the corpses mummified. In addition, we report four instances of recurring dead-infant carrying by mothers, three of whom carried the corpse for longer during the second instance. We discuss these observations in view of functional hypotheses of dead-infant carrying in primates and the potential proximate mechanisms involved in this behaviour. © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Negative early experiences can have detrimental effects on social functioning in later life, both in humans as well as in other socially-living animals. In zoo-housed chimpanzees, recent evidence suggests that there may be a lingering signature of early trauma on individuals’ social interaction tendencies as measured by social proximity and grooming. Here, we address whether a similar effect would be observable in chimpanzees living under semi-wild conditions in an African sanctuary. By analysing party size, close proximity and social grooming, we show that in this specific sanctuary, chimpanzees that suffered early trauma (n = 42) were socially indistinguishable from chimpanzees who were born and raised by their mothers in the sanctuary (n = 36). Our findings indicate that chimpanzees may not be irreversibly affected by early social trauma, possibly owing to rehabilitation in stable social groups in a semi-natural environment. Beyond identifying sanctuaries as valuable rehabilitation centres for orphaned chimpanzees, this study demonstrates a remarkable social flexibility in one of our closest living relatives. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Every evening, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) build a sleeping platform so called “nest” by intertwining branches of tree. Most of chimpanzees’ communities studied have a preference for tree species in which they nest. As female mosquitoes are feeding on the blood of their host at nighttime, chimpanzees may prevent being disturbed and bitten by mosquitoes by selecting tree species having properties to repel them. Methods: To test the hypothesis that chimpanzees choose tree species for their aromatic properties, data related to 1,081 nesting trees built between 2017 and 2019 in the Sebitoli community of Kibale National Park (Uganda) were analysed. The 10 most used trees were compared to the 10 most common trees in the habitat that were not preferred for nesting. Leaves from the 20 trees species were collected and hydro-distillated to obtain essential oils and one of the by-products for behavioural bioassays against females of the African mosquito, Anopheles gambiae. Results: Sebitoli chimpanzees showed tree preferences: 10 species correspond to more than 80% of the nesting trees. Out of the essential oil obtained from the 10 nesting trees, 7 extracts for at least one concentration tested showed spatial repellency, 7 were irritant by contact and none were toxic. In the other hand, for the abundant trees in their habitat not used by chimpanzees, only 3 were repellent and 5 irritants. Discussion and conclusion: This study contributes to evidence that chimpanzees, to avoid annoying mosquitoes, may select their nesting trees according to their repellent properties (linked to chemical parameters), a potential inspiration for human health. © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: In behavioural contexts like fighting, eating, and playing, acoustically distinctive vocalisations are produced across many mammalian species. Such expressions may be conserved in evolution, pointing to the possibility of acoustic regularities in the vocalisations of phylogenetically related species. Here, we test this hypothesis by comparing the degree of acoustic similarity between human and chimpanzee vocalisations produced in 10 similar behavioural contexts. We use two complementary analysis methods: Pairwise acoustic distance measures and acoustic separability metrics based on unsupervised learning algorithms. Cross-context analysis revealed that acoustic features of vocalisations produced when threatening another individual were distinct from other types of vocalisations and highly similar across species. Using a multimethod approach, these findings demonstrate that human vocalisations produced when threatening another person are acoustically similar to chimpanzee vocalisations in the same situation as compared to other types of vocalisations, likely reflecting a phylogenetically ancient vocal signalling system. © 2023 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Understanding causes of death allows adjustment of health management strategies for animals in managed care. From 224 documented chimpanzee deaths occurring from 1995 to 2019 in 42 accredited U.S. zoos, post-mortem records and necropsy reports were analyzed for the primary cause of death, which were available for 214 individuals. In total, 37 cases of stillbirth and neonatal deaths were assessed (16.5%); however, the focus was otherwise placed on the remaining 177 cases in which the death occurred in individuals aged greater than 1 month. There were no sex-related differences in etiology; however, age variation in the cause of death was statistically significant (p < 0.001). Elderly (35 years and older) chimpanzees tended to die of intrinsic, often degenerative, etiologies, whereas infants, juveniles, and adolescents (less than 15 years) were more likely to be involved in fatal trauma. Overall, there were 27 deaths (15.3% of all post-neonatal deaths) related to trauma and 13 of these were directly or indirectly related to conspecific aggression. Understanding causes of mortality and the interrelation with management can benefit managed populations of chimpanzees. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The evolution of language has fascinated anthropologists, psychologists and biologists for centuries, seeking to infer language origins from the communication of primates, our closest living relatives. Capacity for intentional signalling is a key feature of transition to language in our hominin ancestors, facilitating complex social dynamics in complex social groups. However whether vocal, gestural and bimodal signals are differentiated according to intentional use and hence complex sociality has not been studied, making unclear the modality of language evolution. We addressed this question in wild chimpanzees. We found that larger social network size was associated with a larger network of gestural but not vocal or bimodal signals. Response waiting was more common in association with gestures than vocalizations, but elaborations were more common in vocal than gestural or bimodal signals. Overall, chimpanzees were more likely to manage weak social bonds through vocalizations, whereas strong social bonds were managed through gestures and bimodal signals. However, when social bonds were weak, gestures accompanied by response waiting were more likely to elicit approaches than vocalizations accompanied by elaboration, which elicited avoidance. This suggests that gestures were the primary modality of language evolution and that the use of more sophisticated gestural signalling led to evolution of complex social groups of hominin ancestors.

ABSTRACT: Although primates have long been regarded as microsmatic, recent studies indicate that olfaction is an important sensory mode of primate communication, e.g., in the context of reproduction. However, large gaps remain in our understanding of primate olfactory traits, especially in the great apes. Female chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) possess an exaggerated sexual swelling, which is an imprecise signal of fertility that is thought to serve to confuse paternity. However, some high-ranking males that copulate most frequently on the days when females are most fertile seem to have more precise information on the timing of ovulation, which suggests the existence of an olfactory fertility trait. In order to examine, and provide evidence for, fertility-related chemical information in female chimpanzees, we used gas chromatography—mass spectrometry to analyze the chemical composition of female body odor collected across the menstrual cycle during various stages of sexual swelling (97 samples of six females). The chemical composition was significantly affected by swelling stage, and eight substances were detected that were strongly related to the latter. The existence of an additional, olfactory, fertility trait may help males to fine-tune their sexual behavior or allow females to strengthen concealment of the exact timing of ovulation, and needs to be further investigated in follow-up studies. The results of our study provide much-needed evidence for the existence of an olfactory cue related to reproduction in chimpanzees, and form a basis for future studies on the interplay between visual and olfactory information on female fertility. © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The anatomical and functional characteristics of the elbow extensor muscles (triceps brachii and anconeus) have not been widely studied in non-human hominoid primates, despite their great functional importance. In the present study, we have analyzed the muscle architecture and the expression of the myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms in the elbow extensors in humans and chimpanzees. Our main objective was to identify differences in these muscles that could be related to the different uses of the upper extremity in the two species. In five humans and five chimpanzees, we have analyzed muscle mass (MM), muscle fascicle length (MFL), and the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA). In addition, we have assessed the expression of the MHC isoforms by RT-PCR. We have found high MM and PCSA values and higher expression of the MHC-IIx isoform in the triceps brachii of chimpanzees, while in humans, the triceps brachii has high MFL values and a higher expression of the MHC-I and MHC-IIa isoforms. In contrast, there were no significant differences between humans and chimpanzees in any of the values for the anconeus. These findings could be related to the participation of the triceps brachii in the locomotion of chimpanzees and to the use of the upper extremity in manipulative functions in humans. The results obtained in the anconeus support its primary function as a stabilizer of the elbow joint in the two species. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees feed on driver ants (Dorylus sp.) using different tools and predation techniques that vary among populations and can be affected by availability of ant species as well as ecological and sociallearning factors. At the Kom-Wum Forest Reserve (KWFR) in Cameroon, we investigated tool use behavior in Nigerian-Cameroon chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes ellioti), examining the characteristics of tools used in driver ant predation, looking for possible seasonal patterns and comparing our results to those from other study sites. We recovered 83 tools along line transects and recces (reconnaissance) during two seasons. We found that chimpanzees used tools with blunting and dirty ends (possible digging and probing tools) and tools without (dipping tools), in driver ant predation. Tools with dirty ends tended to be thicker (N = 52), and thinner tools were less likely to have dirt (N = 31). Tools recovered in the wet season (N = 62), were significantly shorter and thicker than those recovered in the dry season (N = 21). Furthermore, driver ant tools recovered at KWFR are on average the longest yet recorded insect dipping tools for chimpanzees comparable to those used in North Uele. We found no evidence of nut-cracking, tool use for honey bee nor termite consumption and did not observe the potential prey remains in chimpanzee faeces despite their presence in the reserve. Our results suggest that seasonality significantly contributes to a divergence in the form of tools selected for driver ant predation.  © KONINKLIJKE BRILL NV, LEIDEN, 2022.

ABSTRACT: Objectives: In the human brain, the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) is comprised of three morphological regions, which include the pars opercularis, pars triangularis, and pars orbitalis. These brains regions are implicated in a number of cognitive and linguistic functions, and the pars opercularis and pars triangularis of the language dominant hemisphere are collectively referred to as Broca's area. Evolution of the morphology of the IFG has been a topic of study in comparative neuroscience. Materials and Methods: Using magnetic resonance images (MRI) from 294 chimpanzees with known pedigrees, we quantified the folding patterns, surface area, and depth of three sulci and their subdivisions that define the IFG. Results: Chimpanzees show considerable individual variation in IFG sulci. A higher proportion of males and chimpanzees with better orofacial motor control had a bifurcation in the dorsal limb of the fronto-orbital sulcus. For surface area and depth, chimpanzees with better orofacial motor control had greater leftward asymmetries in surface area and increased gyrification for the fronto-orbital sulcus and greater rightward biases for the inferior precentral sulcus. Quantitative genetic analyses revealed that the average surface area and depth for three of the five sulci subdivisions were significantly heritable. By contrast, we found no evidence for heritability in asymmetries for any of the sulci. Discussion: These findings provide context to understanding evolutionary selection for increasing motor, cognitive and linguistic functions among primates, and contribute an essential comparative framework for interpreting IFG evolution in the human lineage. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT: In the deltoid muscles of Pan troglodytes and Homo sapiens, we have analyzed the muscle architecture and the expression of the myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms. Our aim was to identify differences between the two species that could be related to their different uses of the upper limb. The deltoid muscle of six adult Pan troglodytes and six adult Homo sapiens were dissected. The muscle fascicle length (MFL) and the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) of each muscle were calculated in absolute and normalized values. The expression pattern of the MHC-I, MHC-IIa and MHC-IIx isoforms was analyzed in the same muscles by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Only the acromial deltoid (AD) presented significant architectural differences between the two species, with higher MFL values in humans and higher PCSA values in chimpanzees. No significant differences in the expression pattern of the MHC isoforms were identified. The higher PCSA values in the AD of Pan troglodytes indicate a greater capacity of force generation in chimpanzees than in humans, which may be related to a greater use of the upper limb in locomotion, specifically in arboreal locomotion like vertical climbing. The functional differences between chimpanzees and humans in the deltoid muscle are more related to muscle architecture than to a differential expression of MHC isoforms. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT: In the current study, we detail, through the analysis of immunohistochemically stained sections, the morphology and nuclear parcellation of the serotonergic neurons present in the brainstem of a lar gibbon and a chimpanzee. In general, the neuronal morphology and nuclear organization of the serotonergic system in the brains of these two species of apes follow that observed in a range of Eutherian mammals and are specifically very similar to that observed in other species of primates. In both of the apes studied, the serotonergic nuclei could be readily divided into two distinct groups, a rostral and a caudal cluster, which are found from the level of the decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncle to the spinomedullary junction. The rostral cluster is comprised of the caudal linear, supralemniscal, and median raphe nuclei, as well as the six divisions of the dorsal raphe nuclear complex. The caudal cluster contains several distinct nuclei and nuclear subdivisions, including the raphe magnus nucleus and associated rostral and caudal ventrolateral (CVL) serotonergic groups, the raphe pallidus, and raphe obscurus nuclei. The one deviation in organization observed in comparison to other primate species is an expansion of both the number and distribution of neurons belonging to the lateral division of the dorsal raphe nucleus in the chimpanzee.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees were used in hepatitis research for over three decades with the aim to identify and develop treatments for the virus, a leading cause of chronic liver disease in humans. We used a dataset of 120 chimpanzees housed at a single institution in Japan, 22 of whom became chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), to examine whether HCV infection results in a reduced lifespan as reported in humans. Survival analysis showed that HCV carriers experienced a higher mortality risk compared with non-carriers. Although no chimpanzee died from hepatic disease, carriers showed higher gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (γGTP) levels compared with non-carriers suggesting that HCV infection negatively affected their liver condition. These results provide evidence that special attention is necessary to monitor the long-term condition of ex-biomedical primates.  © 2022 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Personality is both a reflection of the bio-behavioral profile of individuals and a summary of how they typically interact with their physical and social world. Personality is usually defined as having distinct behavioral characteristics, which are assumed to be consistent over time and across contexts. Like other mammals, primates have individual differences in personality. Although temporal consistency is sometimes measured in primates, and contextual consistency is sometimes measured across experimental contexts, it is rare to measure both in the same individuals and outside of experimental settings. Here, we aim to measure both temporal and contextual consistency in chimpanzees, assessing their personality with behavioral observations from naturally occurring contexts (i.e., real-life settings). We measured personality-based behaviors in 22 sanctuary chimpanzees, in the contexts of feeding, affiliation, resting, and solitude, across two time periods, spanning 4 years. Of the 22 behaviors recorded, about 64% were consistent across two to four contexts and 50% were consistent over time. Ten behaviors loaded significantly onto three trait components: explorativeness, boldness-sociability, and anxiety-sociability, as revealed by factor analysis. Like others, we documented individual differences in the personality of chimpanzees based on reliably measured observations in real-life contexts. Furthermore, we demonstrated relatively strong, but not absolute, temporal, and contextual consistency in personality-based behaviors. We also found another aspect of individual differences in personality, specifically, the extent to which individual chimpanzees show consistency. Some individuals showed contextual and temporal consistency, whereas others show significant variation across behaviors, contexts, and/or time. We speculate that the relative degree of consistency in personality may vary within chimpanzees. It may be that different primate species vary in the extent to which individuals show consistency of personality traits. Our behavioral-based assessment can be used with wild populations, increasing the validity of personality studies, facilitating comparative studies and potentially being applicable to conservation efforts. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: When a row of objects surrounded by a frame suddenly shifts a certain distance so that part of the row is occluded by the frame, humans perceive ambiguous apparent motion either to the left or the right. However, when the objects have “directionality,” humans perceive them as moving forward in the direction in which they are pointing, which is termed forward-facing motion bias. In the present study, five experiments were conducted to address whether, and if so how, physical properties or prior knowledge about the objects affected the perception of their apparent motion in two juvenile chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). In experiment 1, the chimpanzees did not show a clear forward-facing bias in judging the direction of motion when directed triangles were presented, whereas the human participants did. In contrast, when pictures of the lateral view of chimpanzees with quadrupedal postures were shown, there was a clear bias for going “forward” with regards to the side with the head (experiment 2). We presented pictures of dogs looking back to explore what features caused the forward-facing motion bias (experiment 3). Chimpanzees did not show any bias for these stimuli, suggesting that the direction of the head and body interactively affected the perceptual bias. Experiment 4 tested the role of the head and found that only the lateral view of the heads of chimpanzees or humans caused the bias (experiment 4). Additional tests also showed that the chimpanzees could not solve the task based only on the direction of the stimuli without motion (experiment 5). These results indicate that the perception of motion in the chimpanzees was affected by the biological features of the stimuli, suggesting their prior knowledge of the “body” from a biological (morphological and kinetic) perspective. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Japan Monkey Centre.

ABSTRACT: This study explores the extent to which habitat characteristics are affecting nest-group encounter rates of Chimpanzees in the southeast part of the BNP. We carried out a reconnaissance recce survey at a sampling intensity of 85% of 1×1sq km per grid cell. Accordingly, field operations included accessing the data collection zone within the Southeast section from the East to the South and then to the North. Reconnaissance recce walks were done within a 1km×1km grid cell. Compass, secateurs, GPSs, and Cyber trackers were used to orientate field operations. All nests irrespective of the distance from the reconnaissance recce walks, feeding signs, tree nest-group count, tree height, and water points were recorded in the cyber tracker. GPS ID and waypoints collected irrespective of the distance within the recce survey cell were recorded. For 28 surveyed grid cells, four nest sites of mixed ages containing 34 recent and eight old nests were recorded. Chimpanzee presence/signs were only recorded in the montane forest (encounter rate of 1.2/Km), and in areas of close (visibility of 5 – 10m) to open (visibility of 10 – 15m) canopies, with no sign observed in areas of highly open canopies (visibility of >15m). Also, these areas fall within an altitude of 1235 to 1325 m asl. with the presence of available water especially from waterfalls. The presence of available food for chimpanzees was also recorded in this area, and all the nests observed were tree nests. This indicates that the montane forest area provides favorable habitat conditions for chimpanzees than the sub-montane forest and montane grassland where no sign of this specie was observed. © 2022, Department of Environmental Sciences, Arak University.

ABSTRACT: Visitor effect studies have had inconsistent results, due in part to the inability to control for all confounding variables such as time of day, seasonal weather patterns, and so forth. This study represents the first instance where chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) wounding frequencies were investigated across extensive time periods in the presence and complete absence of visitors, thus eliminating many visitor-related variables. Additional variables were eliminated through the zoo selection process, based on institutional responses to a 29-question survey, providing a novel approach to the question of visitor effects. The aim of this study was to determine if visitors were associated with a change in chimpanzee wound event frequencies across four 51-day time conditions, three of which occurred prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and one during the first wave of pandemic-related zoo closures. We analyzed the archival records of 21 chimpanzees housed at three U.S. zoos. Due to the small number of wound events across all study windows, frequencies of “no wound” events were analyzed. A chi-square goodness of fit test was performed to determine whether the frequency of “no wound” events was equal between the “open” and “closed” trials. Results indicate that the frequencies did not differ, suggesting that chimpanzee welfare, as it relates to wounding, may not be adversely affected by zoo visitors. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in 2019 has rapidly expanded into a serious global pandemic. Due to the high morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, there is an urgent need to develop safe and effective vaccines. AdC68-19S is an investigational chimpanzee adenovirus serotype 68 (AdC68) vector-based vaccine which encodes the full-length spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we evaluated the immunogenicity, biodistribution and safety profiles of the candidate vaccine AdC68-19S in Sprague Dawley (SD) rat and rhesus macaque under GLP conditions. To characterize the biodistribution profile of AdC68-19S, SD rats were given a single intramuscular injection of AdC68-19S 2 × 1011 VP/dose. Designated organs were collected on day 1, day 2, day 4, day 8 and day 15. Genomic DNA was extracted from all samples and was further quantified by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). To characterize the toxicology and immunogenicity profiles of AdC68-19S, the rats and rhesus macaques were injected intramuscularly with AdC68-19S up to 2 × 1011vp/dose or 4 × 1011vp/dose (2 and fourfold the proposed clinical dose of 1 × 1011vp/dose) on two or three occasions with a 14-day interval period, respectively. In addition to the conventional toxicological evaluation indexes, the antigen-specific cellular and humoral responses were evaluated. We proved that multiple intramuscular injections could elicit effective and long-lasting neutralizing antibody responses and Th1 T cell responses. AdC68-19S was mainly distributed in injection sites and no AdC68-19S related toxicological reaction was observed. In conclusion, these results have shown that AdC68-19S could induce an effective immune response with a good safety profile, and is a promising candidate vaccine against COVID-19. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Introduction: Investigation into chimpanzee termite-fishing behavior has provided invaluable insights into the evolution of animal tool use and culture. However, research to date often overlooks how the ecology of termites may shape the nature of this predator–prey interaction. Though anecdotal links between meteorological factors, termite dispersal flights and the ability of chimpanzees to termite-fish have been made, these relationships were never empirically tested. In this study, we examined if and how the reproductive ecology of mound building termites (Macrotermes subhyalinus) affects the availability of this resource to termite-fishing chimpanzees in the Issa Valley, Tanzania. Methods: We utilized in-person termite-fishing experiments, remote camera trap footage, as well as meteorological data to model both the availability of termite prey across seasons for chimpanzees as well as the timing of dispersal flights of the termite reproductive caste (alates). Additionally, we describe the predator diversity that characterizes alate swarming events during their seasonal dispersal flights. Results: We identify strong relationships between meteorological factors, Macrotermes alate dispersal flights and vulnerability of the colony to predation. As rainfall accumulates, Macrotermes become more abundant in their flight holes and are thus more vulnerable to researcher termite-fishing experiments. This increased accessibility to Macrotermes continues until alate dispersal flights which we also find are linked to cumulative rainfall as well as negatively correlated to wind speed. Discussion: This type of baseline data on Macrotermes ecology is fundamental when forming hypotheses and designing studies into topics such as chimpanzee culture, tool-use, and foraging cognition.

ABSTRACT: Foraging devices are effective enrichment tools for non-human primates, as they provide both cognitive and manipulative stimulation that may enhance these animals’ welfare. We assessed the behavioral effects of a novel tool-based enrichment on 14 chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) housed at Fundació Mona (Girona, Spain). The device consisted of a vertical maze filled with food rewards, which chimpanzees could extract by using tools. We conducted behavioral observations in two conditions over an approximately 2.5-month period: when the food maze was loaded (12 enrichment days), and when it was empty (12 baseline days). Data were collected using 2-min scan sampling and untimed-event focal sampling during two daily sessions of 80 min each. We expected that the chimpanzees’ interest in the enrichment would decrease over time, but that its use would be linked to an increase in the occurrence of species-typical behaviors, a reduction in negative indicators of welfare, and changes in social behaviors. We found that participation widely varied among subjects, being higher in females and decreasing through time. Furthermore, participation was linked to an increase in tool use and a decrease in inactivity, but also to an increase in aggression-related behaviors. In contrast, participation had no effect on the occurrence of abnormal behaviors, social proximity or affiliation-related behaviors. Finally, we detected an increase in self-directed behaviors only when subjects actively interacted with the device. We conclude that, in future studies, these types of devices should be evaluated for longer periods of time and more attention should be paid to individuals’ preferences and abilities. © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: This study investigated chimpanzee body representation by testing whether chimpanzees detect strangeness in body parts. We tested six chimpanzees with edited chimpanzee body pictures in eye-tracking tasks. The target body parts were arms or legs. For either target, there were four conditions: “normal” condition as control, where all bodies were normal; “misplaced” condition, where one arm or one leg was misplaced to an incorrect body location in each picture; “replaced by a chimpanzee part” condition, where one arm or one leg was replaced by a chimpanzee leg or arm, respectively, in its original place in each picture; and “replaced by a human part” condition, where one arm or one leg was replaced by a human arm or leg in each picture. Compared to the looking times toward the normal parts, chimpanzees had significantly longer looking times toward the human arms or legs. The looking times toward the misplaced parts were also longer than the normal parts, but the difference just failed to meet significance. These results indicate more interests toward strange body parts, compared to typical parts, suggesting that chimpanzees might have a body representation that is sufficiently sensitive to detect these aspects of strangeness. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Previous research has found that oxytocin (OT) is associated with intergroup behaviour in humans as well as wild chimpanzees, and that exogenous OT affects Pan social attention. The two Pan species, bonobos and chimpanzees, differ drastically from one another in their intensity of intergroup competition, with lethal intergroup aggression often led by males in chimpanzees and more tolerant associations often centered around females in bonobos. However, it remains unclear how exogenous OT changes the two species' responses to ingroup and outgroup individuals. In this study, after intranasal administration of nebulized OT or placebo control, chimpanzees and bonobos viewed image pairs of ingroup and outgroup conspecifics while their eye movements were tracked with an eye-tracker. Although the overall effect of OT was small, we found that OT shifted bonobos' and chimpanzees' attention to outgroup images of the sex primarily involved in intergroup encounters in each species. Specifically, OT selectively shifted attention towards outgroup photos of female conspecifics in bonobos, and those of outgroup male conspecifics in chimpanzees. This suggests that OT generally promotes outgroup attention in both bonobos and chimpanzees but this effect is restricted to the sex most relevant in intergroup relations. These results suggest that, although OT may have a generally conserved role in hominid intergroup behaviour, it may act in species-relevant ways under the influence of their socio-ecological backgrounds. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The origins of human language remains a major question in evolutionary science. Unique to human language is the capacity to flexibly recombine a limited sound set into words and hierarchical sequences, generating endlessly new sentences. In contrast, sequence production of other animals appears limited, stunting meaning generation potential. However, studies have rarely quantified flexibility and structure of vocal sequence production across the whole repertoire. Here, we used such an approach to examine the structure of vocal sequences in chimpanzees, known to combine calls used singly into longer sequences. Focusing on the structure of vocal sequences, we analysed 4826 recordings of 46 wild adult chimpanzees from Taï National Park. Chimpanzees produced 390 unique vocal sequences. Most vocal units emitted singly were also emitted in two-unit sequences (bigrams), which in turn were embedded into three-unit sequences (trigrams). Bigrams showed positional and transitional regularities within trigrams with certain bigrams predictably occurring in either head or tail positions in trigrams, and predictably co-occurring with specific other units. From a purely structural perspective, the capacity to organize single units into structured sequences offers a versatile system potentially suitable for expansive meaning generation. Further research must show to what extent these structural sequences signal predictable meanings. © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) mature earlier in body mass and have a greater growth rate compared to wild individuals. However, relatively little is known about how growth parameters compare between chimpanzees living in different captive environments. To investigate, body mass was measured in 298 African sanctuary chimpanzees and was acquired from 1030 zoological and 442 research chimpanzees, using data repositories. An analysis of covariance, adjusting for age, was performed to assess same-sex body mass differences between adult sanctuary, zoological, and research populations. Piecewise linear regression was performed to estimate sex-specific growth rates and the age at maturation, which were compared between sexes and across populations using extra-sum-of-squares F tests. Adult body mass was greater in the zoological and resarch populations compared to the sanctuary chimpanzees, in both sexes. Male and female sanctuary chimpanzees were estimated to have a slower rate of growth compared with their zoological and research counterparts. Additionally, male sanctuary chimpanzees were estimated to have an older age at maturation for body mass compared with zoological and research males, whereas the age at maturation was similar across female populations. For both the zoological and research populations, the estimated growth rate was greater in males compared to females. Together, these data contribute to current understanding of growth and maturation in this species and suggest marked differences between the growth patterns of chimpanzees living in different captive environments. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Knowledge on the population history of endangered species is critical for conservation, but whole-genome data on chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) is geographically sparse. Here, we produced the first non-invasive geolocalized catalog of genomic diversity by capturing chromosome 21 from 828 non-invasive samples collected at 48 sampling sites across Africa. The four recognized subspecies show clear genetic differentiation correlating with known barriers, while previously undescribed genetic exchange suggests that these have been permeable on a local scale. We obtained a detailed reconstruction of population stratification and fine-scale patterns of isolation, migration, and connectivity, including a comprehensive picture of admixture with bonobos (Pan paniscus). Unlike humans, chimpanzees did not experience extended episodes of long-distance migrations, which might have limited cultural transmission. Finally, based on local rare variation, we implement a fine-grained geolocalization approach demonstrating improved precision in determining the origin of confiscated chimpanzees. © 2022 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Personality traits in many taxa correlate with fitness. Several models have been developed to try to explain how variation in these traits is maintained. One model proposes that variation persists because it is linked to trade-offs between current and future adaptive benefits. Tests of this model’s predictions, however, are scant in long-lived species. To test this model, we studied male chimpanzees living in Gombe National Park, Tanzania. We operationalized six personality traits using ratings on 19 items. We used 37 years of behavioral and genetic data to assemble (1) daily rank scores generated from submissive vocalizations and (2) records of male siring success. We tested whether the association between two personality traits, Dominance and Conscientiousness, and either rank or reproductive success, varied over the life course. Higher Dominance and lower Conscientiousness were associated with higher rank, but the size and direction of these relationships did not vary over the life course. In addition, independent of rank at the time of siring, higher Dominance and lower Conscientiousness were related to higher siring success. Again, the size and direction of these relationships did not vary over the life course. The trade-off model, therefore, may not hold in long-lived and/or slowly reproducing species. These findings also demonstrate that ratings are a valid way to measure animal personality; they are related to rank and reproductive success. These traits could therefore be used to test alternative models, including one that posits that personality variation is maintained by environmental heterogeneity, in studies of multiple chimpanzee communities.

ABSTRACT: Vocal learning, the ability to modify the acoustic structure of vocalizations based on social experience, is a fundamental feature of speech in humans (Homo sapiens). While vocal learning is common in taxa such as songbirds and whales, the vocal learning capacities of nonhuman primates appear more limited. Intriguingly, evidence for vocal learning has been reported in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), for example, in the form of regional variation (“dialects”) in the “pant-hoot” calls. This suggests that some capacity for vocal learning may be an ancient feature of the Pan-Homo clade. Nonetheless, reported differences have been subtle, with intercommunity variation representing only a small portion of the total acoustic variation. To gain further insights into the extent of regional variation in chimpanzee vocalizations, we performed an analysis of pant-hoots from chimpanzees in the neighboring Kasekela and Mitumba communities at Gombe National Park, Tanzania, and the geographically distant Kanyawara community at Kibale National Park, Uganda. We did not find any statistically significant differences between the neighboring communities at Gombe or among geographically distant communities. Furthermore, we found differences among individuals in all communities. Hence, the variation in chimpanzee pant-hoots reflected individual differences, rather than group differences. Thus, we did not find evidence of dialects in this population, suggesting that extensive vocal learning emerged only after the lineages of Homo and Pan diverged. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Understanding the affective lives of animals has been a long-standing challenge in science. Recent technological progress in infrared thermal imaging has enabled researchers to monitor animals' physiological states in real-time when exposed to ecologically relevant situations, such as feeding in the company of others. During social feeding, an individual's physiological states are likely to vary with the nature of the resource and perceptions of competition. Previous findings in chimpanzees have indicated that events perceived as competitive cause decreases in nasal temperatures, whereas the opposite was observed for cooperative interactions. Here, we tested how food resources and audience structure impacted on how social feeding events were perceived by wild chimpanzees. Overall, we found that nasal temperatures were lower when meat was consumed as compared to figs, consistent with the idea that social feeding on more contested resources is perceived as more dangerous and stressful. Nasal temperatures were significant affected by interactions between food type and audience composition, in particular the number of males, their dominance status, and their social bond status relative to the subject, while no effects for the presence of females were observed. Our findings suggest that male chimpanzees closely monitor and assess their social environment during competitive situations, and that infrared imaging provides an important complement to access psychological processes beyond observable social behaviours.

ABSTRACT: In mammalian species, olfactory cues are important for within and between species communication. These cues can be part of multimodal signals indicating, for example, female fertility potentially perceived by male conspecifics. However, a large gap exists in our understanding of multimodal signaling in non-human catarrhines. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) live in fission-fusion societies, mate promiscuously and express high levels of male-male competition. Females show a striking visual signal, an exaggerated sexual swelling, known to be a proxy of ovulation, while the maximum swelling is not matching the exact time of ovulation. The question remains if males use additional olfactory cues when being able to approach females closely. This would allow males to pinpoint the exact timing of ovulation and could be one reason why high-ranking males sire offspring more successfully than other males. Here, we present the first systematic test of such multimodal signaling by investigating male sniffing behavior directed to females in relation to their fertility in a group of 13 captive chimpanzees. Our results show that male sniffing behavior significantly increased with female swelling size, with female age as well as when fewer male competitors were present. Hence, odors might be part of a multimodal fertility cue, supporting the idea that males monitor both visual and olfactory cues to gain comprehensive information on female fertility.

ABSTRACT: Protected areas are crucial to safeguard Sub-Saharan Africa's extraordinary and abundant megafauna. In many of these areas, instability has derailed conservation efforts and impeded adequate wildlife monitoring. Discovered in 2004, Eastern chimpanzees are found in the Central Uele Basin in northern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) within the Bili-Uéré Protected Areas Complex (BUPAC), the largest contiguous protected area in the country. BUPAC is threatened by habitat destruction, mining, wild meat trade, and insecurity. BUPAC chimpanzees are part of the largest remaining continuous population of the species in Africa; they are also being behaviourally unique. Forest elephants were frequent in the 1960′s in the BUPAC but have declined significantly up to 2004–2007. We used line transects to estimate Eastern chimpanzee and forest elephant density in the BUPAC core area in 2016 and 2019 and compared these with the 2004–2007 surveys. A total of 37 and 137 two km long line transects were systematically placed in 5,841 km2 and 6,176 km2 survey areas in 2016 and 2019, respectively. We found that chimpanzee density did not change during the two survey periods but indicators for forest elephant density decreased eight-fold. Human activities were detected mainly along the core area periphery in both survey years, where they overlapped with centres of animal activity. The stable high density of chimpanzees is a positive outcome for the core BUPAC. However, despite being a conservation priority area that has received relatively intensified protection, declining forest elephant numbers are likely to reflect the high number of human conflict hotspots in vicinity as well as the increasing human population density around the core area. We propose by elevating the core area to National Park whilst strengthening on the ground enforcement and management structures as well as legal measures against poaching might ensure the long-term survival of such an important area in Africa. © 2022 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Social play is ubiquitous in the development of many animal species and involves players adapting actions flexibly to their own previous actions and partner responses. Play differs from other behavioural contexts for which fine-scale analyses of action sequences are available, such as tool use and communication, in that its form is not defined by its function, making it potentially more unpredictable. In humans, play is often organised in games, where players know context-appropriate actions but string them together unpredictably. Here, we use the sequential nature of play elements to explore whether play elements in chimpanzees are structured hierarchically and follow predictable gamelike patterns. Based on 5,711 play elements from 143 bouts, we extracted individual-level play sequences of 11 Western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) of different ages from the Bossou community.Wedetected transition probabilities between play elements that exceeded expected levels and show that play elements form hierarchically clustered and interchangeable groups, indicative of at least six games that can be identified from transition networks, some with different roles for different players. We also show that increased information about preceding play elements improved predictability of subsequent elements, further indicating that play elements are not strung together randomly but that flexible action rules underlie their usage. Thus, chimpanzee play is hierarchically structured in short games which limit acceptable play elements and allow players to predict and adapt to partners' actions. This "grammar of action"approach to social interactions can be valuable in understanding cognitive and communicative abilities within and across species.  © 2022 Mielke and Carvalho.

ABSTRACT: Fig. 2: It has recently been pointed out to us that the Western blot strip images of chimpanzee fecal samples UG27 and UG37 appear identical. Inspection of the original immunoblot revealed that the strip representing sample UG27 was inadvertently inserted twice during artwork preparation. We have identified the correct strip for sample UG37 and used it to replace the duplicated strip in the corrected version of Fig. 2 below. The original uncropped Western blots are provided as supplemental material (Fig. S1). All other data as reported in figures, tables, and text of the paper are correct and thus remain unchanged. © 2022 American Society for Microbiology. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Humans are unique among apes and other primates in the musculoskeletal design of their lower back, pelvis, and lower limbs. Here, we describe the three-dimensional ground reaction forces and lower/hindlimb joint mechanics of human and bipedal chimpanzees walking over a full stride and test whether: 1) the estimated limb joint work and power during the stance phase, especially the single-support period, is lower in humans than bipedal chimpanzees, 2) the limb joint work and power required for limb swing is lower in humans than in bipedal chimpanzees, and 3) the estimated total mechanical power during walking, accounting for the storage of passive elastic strain energy in humans, is lower in humans than in bipedal chimpanzees. Humans and bipedal chimpanzees were compared at matched dimensionless and dimensional velocities. Our results indicate that humans walk with significantly less work and power output in the first double-support period and the single-support period of stance, but markedly exceed chimpanzees in the second double-support period (i.e., push-off). Humans generate less work and power in limb swing, although the species difference in limb swing power was not statistically significant. We estimated that total mechanical positive ‘muscle fiber’ work and power were 46.9% and 35.8% lower, respectively, in humans than in bipedal chimpanzees at matched dimensionless speeds. This is due in part to mechanisms for the storage and release of elastic energy at the ankle and hip in humans. Furthermore, these results indicate distinct ‘heel strike’ and ‘lateral balance’ mechanics in humans and bipedal chimpanzees and suggest a greater dissipation of mechanical energy through soft tissue deformations in humans. Together, our results document important differences between human and bipedal chimpanzee walking mechanics over a full stride, permitting a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanics and energetics of chimpanzee bipedalism and the evolution of hominin walking. © 2022 The Authors

ABSTRACT: After stone tools, bone tools are the most abundant artefact type in the Early Pleistocene archaeological record. That said, they are still relatively scarce, which limits our understanding of the behaviours that led to their production and use. Observations of extant primates constitute a unique source of behavioural data with which to construct hypotheses about the technological forms and repertoires exhibited by our hominin ancestors. We conducted two different experiments to investigate the behavioural responses of two groups of captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes; n = 33 and n = 9) to disarticulated, defleshed, ungulate bones while participating in a foraging task aimed at eliciting excavating behaviour. Each chimpanzee group was provided with bone specimens with different characteristics, and the two groups differed in their respective experience levels with excavating plant tools. We found that several individuals from the inexperienced group used the provided bones as tools during the task. In contrast, none of the individuals from the experienced group used bones as excavating tools, but instead continued using plant tools. These chimpanzees also performed non-excavating bone behaviours such as percussion and tool-assisted extraction of organic material from the medullary cavity. Our findings serve as a proof-of-concept that chimpanzees can be used to investigate spontaneous bone tool behaviours such as bone-assisted excavation. Furthermore, our results raise interesting questions regarding the role that bone characteristics, as well as previous tool-assisted excavating experience with other raw materials, might have in the expression of bone tool-assisted excavation. © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Continuing a survey of the chemistry of species of the largely continental African genus Vepris, we investigate a species previously referred to as Vepris sp. 1 of Congo. From the leaves of Vepris sp. 1 we report six compounds. The compounds were three furoquinoline alkaloids, kokusaginine (1), maculine (2), and flindersiamine (3), two acridone alkaloids, arborinine (4) and 1-hydroxy-3-methoxy-10-methylacridone (5), and the triterpenoid, ß-amyrin (6). Compounds 1–4 are commonly isolated from other Vepris species, compound 5 has been reported before once, from Malagasy Vepris pilosa, while this is the first report of ß-amyrin from Vepris. This combination of compounds has never before been reported from any species of Vepris. We test the hypothesis that Vepris sp. 1 is new to science and formally describe it as Vepris teva, unique in the genus in that the trifoliolate leaves are subsessile, with the median petiolule far exceeding the petiole in length. Similar fleshy-leathery four-locular syncarpous fruits are otherwise only known in the genus in Vepris glaberrima (formerly the monotypic genus Oriciopsis Engl.), a potential sister species, but requiring further investigation to confirm this phylogenetic position. We briefly characterise the unusual and poorly documented Atlantic coast equatorial ecosystem, where Vepris teva is restricted to evergreen thicket on white sand, unusual in a genus usually confined to evergreen forest. This endemic-rich ecosystem with a unique amphibian as well as plants, extends along the coastline from the mouth of the Congo River to southern Rio Muni, a distance of about 1,000 km, traversing five countries. We map and illustrate Vepris teva and assess its extinction risk as Endangered (EN B1ab(iii)+B2ab(iii)) using the IUCN, 2012 standard. Only three locations are known, and threats include port and oil refinery construction and associated activities, with only one protected location, the Jane Goodall Institute’s Tchimpounga Reserve. Initial evidence indicates that the seeds of Vepris teva are dispersed by chimpanzees, previously unreported in the genus. © 2022 PeerJ Inc.. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Many social animals travel in cohesive groups but some species, including chimpanzees, form flexible fission–fusion systems where individuals have some control over group cohesion and proximity to others. Here, we explored how male chimpanzees of the Sonso community of Budongo Forest, Uganda, use communication signals during resting, a context where the likelihood of group fission is high due to forthcoming travel. We focused on a context-specific vocalisation, the ‘rest hoo’, to investigate its function and determine whether it is produced intentionally. We found that this call was typically given towards the end of typical silent resting bouts, i.e., the period when individuals need to decide whether to continue travelling after a brief stop-over or to start a prolonged resting bout. Subjects rested longer after producing ‘rest hoos’ and their resting time increased with the number of calls produced. They also rested longer if their calls were answered. Furthermore, focal subjects’ resting time was prolonged after hearing others’ ‘rest hoos’. Subjects called more when with top proximity partners and in small parties and rested longer if a top proximity partner called. We also found an interaction effect between rank and grooming activity, with high-ranking males with a high grooming index calling less frequently than other males, suggesting that vocal communication may serve as a cohesion strategy alternative to tactile-based bonding. We discuss these different patterns and conclude that chimpanzee ‘rest hoos’ meet key criteria for intentional signalling. We suggest that ‘rest hoos’ are produced to prolong resting bouts with desired partners, which may function to increase social cohesion. © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: A growing body of evidence suggests the capacity for animals to combine calls into larger communicative structures is more common than previously assumed. Despite its cross-taxa prevalence, little is known regarding the evolutionary pressures driving such combinatorial abilities. One dominant hypothesis posits that social complexity and vocal complexity are linked, with changes in social structuring (e.g., group size) driving the emergence of ever-more complex vocal abilities, such as call sequencing. In this paper, we tested this hypothesis through investigating combinatoriality in the vocal system of the highly social chimpanzee. Specifically, we predicted combinatoriality to be more common in socially-driven contexts and in females and lower-ranked males (socially challenging contexts and socially challenged individuals respectively). Firstly, through applying methods from computational linguistics (i.e., collocation analyses), we built an objective repertoire of combinatorial structures in this species. Second, we investigated what potential factors influenced call combination production. We show that combinatoriality is predominant in 1) social contexts vs. non-social contexts, 2) females vs. males, and 3) negatively correlates with male rank. Together, these results suggest one function of combinatoriality in chimpanzees may be to help individuals navigate their dynamic social world. More generally, we argue these findings provide support for the hypothesized link between social and vocal complexity and can provide insight into the evolution of our own highly combinatorial communication system, language.  © 2022 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: A survey was sent to zoos, research facilities, and sanctuaries which housed chimpanzees. Data collected included information about 1122 chimpanzees’ age, sex, social group-size, rearing history, and enclosure. Respondents were also asked to indicate if certain behaviors had been observed in each chimpanzee over the prior two years. Species- typical behaviors (STBs) were queried, including copulation, tool-use, nest-building, and social grooming. Tool-use was reported present for 94.3% of the sample (n = 982), active social grooming for 85.7% (n = 1121), copulation for 68.3% (n = 863) and nest-building for 58.9% (n = 982). Of the subjects for whom we had data regarding all four STBs (n = 860), 45.6% were reported to engage in all four. Logistic regression analyses using forward Wald criteria were conducted to determine the best model for each STB based on the predictors of age, sex, rearing history, group-size, facility-type, and a sex-by-rearing interaction. The best model for copulation (χ2(6) = 124.62, p < 0.001) included rearing, group-size, facility-type, and the sex-by-rearing interaction. Chimpanzees were more likely to copulate if they were mother-reared, in larger groups, living in research facilities, and, if not mother-reared (NOTMR), more likely to copulate if they were female. The best model for tool-use retained the predictors of age category, facility-type, and sex-by-rearing (χ2(5) = 55.78, p < 0.001). Chimpanzees were more likely to use tools if they were adult, living in research facilities, and if NOTMR, were female. The best model for nest-building included facility-type and rearing (χ2(3) = 205.71, p < 0.001). Chimpanzees were more likely to build nests if they were MR and if they were living in zoos or in sanctuaries. The best model for active social grooming retained the predictors of age, sex, rearing, and type of facility (χ2(6) = 102.15, p < 0.001). Chimpanzees were more likely to engage in active social grooming if they were immature, female, mother-reared, and living in zoos. This research provides a basic behavioral profile for many chimpanzees living under human care in the United States and allows us to determine potential methods for improving the welfare of these and future chimpanzees in this population. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Humans, like many other animals, live in groups and coordinate actions with others in social settings.1 Such interpersonal coordination may emerge unconsciously and when the goal is not the coordination of movements, as when falling into the same rhythm when walking together.2 Although one of our closest living relatives, the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), shows the ability to succeed in complex joint action tasks where coordination is the goal,3 little is known about simpler forms of joint action. Here, we examine whether chimpanzees spontaneously synchronize their actions with conspecifics while walking together. We collected data on individual walking behavior of two groups of chimpanzees under semi-natural conditions. In addition, we assessed social relationships to investigate potential effects on the strength of coordination. When walking with a conspecific, individuals walked faster than when alone. The relative phase was symmetrically distributed around 0° with the highest frequencies around 0, indicating a tendency to coordinate actions. Further, coordination was stronger when walking with a partner compared with two individuals walking independently. Although the inter-limb entrainment was more pronounced between individuals of similar age as a proxy for height, it was not affected by the kinship or bonding status of the walkers or the behaviors they engaged in immediately after the walk. We conclude that chimpanzees adapt their individual behavior to temporally coordinate actions with others, which might provide a basis for engaging in other more complex forms of joint action. This spontaneous form of inter-individual coordination, often called entrainment, is thus shared with humans. © 2022

ABSTRACT: Objectives: This study examines the sensitivity of the development of the dorsal metacarpal ridge (DMR) to the frequency of knuckle-walking during ontogeny in chimpanzees, and compares the prevalence and prominence of the DMR in hominoids and baboons. Materials and Methods: We characterized the type and frequency of quadrupedalism of wild chimpanzees of different ages from the Ngogo community, Uganda. Using museum specimens, we quantified third metacarpal DMR angle and height in Pan individuals of different developmental stages, and in adult Gorilla, Pongo, Hylobates, and Papio. Results: When terrestrial, all quadrupedalism consisted of knuckle-walking, although older individuals knuckle-walked more than younger. The total amount of quadrupedalism engaged in by different age groups while arboreal was consistent; however, knuckle usage while arboreally quadrupedal increased with age. The DMR ridge did not emerge in Pan until older infancy, after the onset of knuckle-walking, and reached prominence by the juvenile stage. The DMR angle increased significantly after juvenility but relative height did not. Adult Pan and Gorilla have more prevalent and prominent DMRs than Papio; the DMR was rare in Pongo and absent in Hylobates. Discussion: The timing of development of the DMR in chimpanzees supports it as a knuckle walking character, as does its occurrence in gorillas, and virtual absence in suspensory orangutans and gibbons. The DMR in baboons differs in appearance and frequency from DMRs in African apes, and so differentiates knuckle-walking from digitigrady in catarrhines. The relationship between the DMR and loading of a vertical hand while terrestrial deserves further study. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT: Examining how different primate species cope with forest fragmentation is important for the development of effective conservation strategies. Fragmentation can lead to decreases in food availability and increase the frequency of human–primate interactions. In Gishwati, a remnant forest in western Rwanda, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) leave the forest to forage in maize fields. We examined factors affecting this behavior and its influence on habitat use. We measured maize field size and distance to the forest (N = 157) and recorded crop foraging events (N = 197). We also recorded chimpanzee nests (N = 74) in a regenerating area of Gishwati in and out of the maize season. We found that chimpanzees were more likely to crop forage in larger maize fields and those closer to the forest. Crop foraging varied between years, coinciding with farmers moving their maize fields further from the forest and forest regeneration increasing access to previously distant fields. Party size of crop foraging chimpanzees was larger in fields near the core forest vs a corridor region of the regenerating area. However, habitat use of the corridor region increased during the maize season, likely due to chimpanzees monitoring and accessing nearby fields. Our results suggest that crop foraging mitigation efforts, such as moving maize further from the forest, can be effective. However, to maintain efficacy, this movement of crops must follow shifts in habitat use. This research highlights the importance of developing flexible conservation strategies, particularly for landscapes that are undergoing extensive change. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: As an integral part of the immune response, testosterone secretion is inhibited when an individual is confronted with an immune challenge. Testosterone-mediated physiological, morphological, and behavioral traits are compromised at times of impaired health. Nevertheless, males of some species seem to maintain high levels of testosterone when confronted with an immune challenge, upholding competitive strength but compromising their immune response. It has been argued that this phenomenon will occur only in species living in social systems with high degrees of male-male competition over mating opportunities. Male chimpanzees contest over access to fertile females and dominants sire the majority of offspring. This male mating pattern makes chimpanzees a candidate species where we could expect males to maintain high testosterone levels, compromising their immune response, to ensure immediate reproductive success. We measured blood testosterone levels in male and female chimpanzees, who expressed clinical symptoms (symptomatic) or showed no evidence of clinical disease on assessment (asymptomatic). For females, we expected to find lower testosterone levels in symptomatic individuals than in asymptomatic subjects. In males, we would predict lower testosterone levels in symptomatic individuals than in asymptomatic males, if the immune response leads to a decrease in testosterone secretion. Alternatively, males could have equal levels of testosterone when symptomatic and asymptomatic, upholding competitive strength. Our results show that male chimpanzees exhibit lower levels of testosterone when confronted with an immune challenge than when being asymptomatic. This suggests that male testosterone secretion is suppressed as part of the immune response, which potentially increases survival and lifetime reproductive success. It will, however, negatively impact momentary competitive ability. Also, males may employ different mating strategies, some of which are less testosterone-driven (e.g., affiliative strategies). Consequently, in some individuals, the costs of maintaining high testosterone levels may not outweigh the potential gain in reproductive success. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Long-term balancing selection (LTBS) can maintain allelic variation at a locus over millions of years and through speciation events. Variants shared between species in the state of identity-by-descent, hereafter “trans-species polymorphisms”, can result from LTBS, often due to host–pathogen interactions. For instance, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus contains TSPs present across primates. Several hundred candidate LTBS regions have been identified in humans and chimpanzees; however, because many are in non-protein-coding regions of the genome, the functions and potential adaptive roles for most remain unknown. Results: We integrated diverse genomic annotations to explore the functions of 60 previously identified regions with multiple shared polymorphisms (SPs) between humans and chimpanzees, including 19 with strong evidence of LTBS. We analyzed genome-wide functional assays, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) for all the regions. We identify functional annotations for 59 regions, including 58 with evidence of gene regulatory function from GTEx or functional genomics data and 19 with evidence of trait association from GWAS or PheWAS. As expected, the SPs associate in humans with many immune system phenotypes, including response to pathogens, but we also find associations with a range of other phenotypes, including body size, alcohol intake, cognitive performance, risk-taking behavior, and urate levels. Conclusions: The diversity of traits associated with non-coding regions with multiple SPs support previous hypotheses that functions beyond the immune system are likely subject to LTBS. Furthermore, several of these trait associations provide support and candidate genetic loci for previous hypothesis about behavioral diversity in human and chimpanzee populations, such as the importance of variation in risk sensitivity. © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The hippocampus is associated with essential brain functions, such as learning and memory. Human hippocampal volume is significantly greater than expected compared with that of non-human apes, suggesting a recent expansion. Intermediate progenitors, which are able to undergo multiple rounds of proliferative division before a final neurogenic division, may have played a role in evolutionary hippocampal expansion. To investigate the evolution of gene regulatory networks underpinning hippocampal neurogenesis in apes, we leveraged the differentiation of human and chimpanzee induced pluripotent stem cells into TBR2 (or EOMES)-positive hippocampal intermediate progenitor cells (hpIPCs). We found that the gene networks active in hpIPCs are significantly different between humans and chimpanzees, with ~2500 genes being differentially expressed. We demonstrate that species-specific transposonderived enhancers contribute to these transcriptomic differences. Young transposons, predominantly endogenous retroviruses and SINE-Vntr-Alus (SVAs), were co-opted as enhancers in a speciesspecific manner. Human-specific SVAs provided substrates for thousands of novel TBR2-binding sites, and CRISPR-mediated repression of these SVAs attenuated the expression of ~25% of the genes that are upregulated in human intermediate progenitors relative to the same cell population in the chimpanzee.  © 2022.

ABSTRACT: Humans' extensive use of fire is one behavior that sets us apart from all other animals. However, our ancestors' reliance on controlled forms of fire—i.e., for cooking—was likely preceded by a long familiarity with fire beginning with passive exploitation of naturally burned landscapes and followed by intermediate steps including active ecological modification via intentional burning. Here we explore our pyrophilic beginnings using observational data from savanna-dwelling chimpanzees. These data highlight the extent to which anthropogenic burning impacts the behavior and ecology of sympatric primates and provides an opportunity to study the ways in which apes living in a fire-altered world exploit opportunities presented by burning. Using monthly burn scar data and daily range use data we quantify the impact of burning episodes on chimpanzee habitat. Over the course of one dry season, approximately 74% of the total estimated range of the Fongoli community of savanna-dwelling chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) was impacted by fire. We combine fire occurrences with behavioral data to test for relationships between burning and rate of encounter with food items and duration of subsequent patch residence time. Results show more frequent encounters and shorter patch residence times in burned areas. These data can be leveraged as a frame of reference for conceptualizing our extinct relatives’ behavior around fire. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Albinism—the congenital absence of pigmentation—is a very rare phenomenon in animals due to the significant costs to fitness of this condition. Both humans and non-human individuals with albinism face a number of challenges, such as reduced vision, increased exposure to ultraviolet radiation, or compromised crypticity resulting in an elevated vulnerability to predation. However, while observations of social interactions involving individuals with albinism have been observed in wild non-primate animals, such interactions have not been described in detail in non-human primates (hereafter, primates). Here, we report, to our knowledge, the first sighting of an infant with albinism in wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii), including social interactions between the infant, its mother, and group members. We also describe the subsequent killing of the infant by conspecifics as well as their behavior towards the corpse following the infanticide. Finally, we discuss our observations in relation to our understanding of chimpanzee behavior or attitudes towards individuals with very conspicuous appearances. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Recent discoveries of semantic compositionality in Japanese tits have enlivened the discussions on the presence of this phenomenon in wild animal communication. Data on semantic compositionality in wild apes are lacking, even though language experiments with captive apes have demonstrated they are capable of semantic compositionality. In this paper, I revisit the study by Boesch (Hum. Evol. 6:81–89, 1991) who investigated drumming sequences by an alpha male in a chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) community in the Taï National Park, Côte d’Ivoire. A reanalysis of the data reveals that the alpha male produced semantically compositional combined messages of travel direction change and resting period initiation. Unlike the Japanese tits, the elements of the compositional expression were not simply juxtaposed but displayed structural reduction, while one of the two elements in the expression coded the meanings of both elements. These processes show relative resemblance to blending and fusion in human languages. Also unlike the tits, the elements of the compositional expression did not have a fixed order, although there was a fixed distribution of drumming events across the trees used for drumming. Because the elements of the expression appear to carry verb-like meanings, the compositional expression also resembles simple verb-verb constructions and short paratactic combinations of two clauses found across languages. In conclusion, the reanalysis suggests that semantic compositionality and phenomena resembling paratactic combinations of two clauses might have been present in the communication of the last common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans, not necessarily in the vocal modality. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Maintaining water balance is essential for organismal health, and lactating females must balance individual needs with milk production and offspring hydration. Primate milk is dilute and presumed to be the primary source for infant hydration for a considerable time period. Few studies have investigated the hydration burden that lactation may place on female primates. In this study, we investigated sources of variation in female and offspring drinking frequency among wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). We hypothesized females would experience seasonal and lactation hydration burdens and adjust their drinking behavior to accommodate these, but this hydration burden would vary between females of different dominance ranks. We also predicted that parity would relate to maternal drinking frequency since primiparous females are still investing in their own growth. Finally, we predicted that offspring would drink more in the dry season and as they aged and lost milk as a water source, but that offspring of high-ranking females would be buffered from these effects. Using 41 years of long-term data on the behavior of mothers and offspring of Gombe National Park, we found that mothers drank more in the dry season, but there was no significant difference between mothers of different ranks during this period. Low-ranking females drank significantly more than mid- and high-ranking females during late lactation. Offspring also drank more in the dry season and as they aged, but there was no evidence of buffering for those with high-ranking mothers. While chimpanzees in our study population drank infrequently, they do demonstrate noticeable shifts in drinking behavior that suggests seasonal and reproductive hydration burdens. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT: HIV-1 and its SIV precursors share a broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAb) epitope in variable loop 2 (V2) at the envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer apex. Here, we tested the immunogenicity of germ line-targeting versions of a chimpanzee SIV (SIVcpz) Env in human V2-apex bNAb heavy-chain precursor-expressing knock-in mice and as chimeric simian-chimpanzee immunodeficiency viruses (SCIVs) in rhesus macaques (RMs). Trimer immunization of knock-in mice induced V2-directed NAbs, indicating activation of V2-apex bNAb precursor-expressing mouse B cells. SCIV infection of RMs elicited high-titer viremia, potent autologous tier 2 neutralizing antibodies, and rapid sequence escape in the canonical V2-apex epitope. Six of seven animals also developed low-titer heterologous plasma breadth that mapped to the V2-apex. Antibody cloning from two of these animals identified multiple expanded lineages with long heavy chain third complementarity determining regions that cross-neutralized as many as 7 of 19 primary HIV-1 strains, but with low potency. Negative stain electron microscopy (NSEM) of members of the two most cross-reactive lineages confirmed V2 targeting but identified an angle of approach distinct from prototypical V2-apex bNAbs, with antibody binding either requiring or inducing an occluded-open trimer. Probing with conformation-sensitive, nonneutralizing antibodies revealed that SCIV-expressed, but not wild-type SIVcpz Envs, as well as a subset of primary HIV-1 Envs, preferentially adopted a more open trimeric state. These results reveal the existence of a cryptic V2 epitope that is exposed in occluded-open SIVcpz and HIV-1 Env trimers and elicits cross-neutralizing responses of limited breadth and potency.  © 2023 Bibollet-Ruche et al.

ABSTRACT: Chimp Haven is a sanctuary for chimpanzees being retired from biomedical research and from facilities that can no longer care for them. Chimpanzees often live in smaller groups in captive settings; however, Chimp Haven integrates them into larger, more species-typical groups. Social integrations, the process of introducing unfamiliar chimpanzees to one another, are often complex in terms of logistics and can be stressful due to the territorial nature of the animals, reduced space in captivity, and the fact that these situations are engineered by humans. From 2005 to 2015, Chimp Haven conducted 225 social integrations including 282 chimpanzees (male: n = 135; female: n = 147). Each integration involved 2 to 26 chimpanzees (mean = 9) and their age ranged from < one year old to 59 years old (mean = 30). We collected data ad libitum during the first 60 min after doors were opened between unfamiliar chimpanzees. The chimpanzees’ affiliative, aggressive, and submissive behaviors were examined, comparing the subject’s sex, rearing history, location/enclosure type, and group size impacts on these behaviors. The subject’s sex, location, and group size were associated with the frequency of affiliative behaviors observed during social integration. All variables except for group size were associated with the frequency of aggressive behavior. The frequency of submissive behavior differed based on the subject’s sex, rearing history, and group size. We were unable to make comparisons between successful and unsuccessful integrations, as most of these integrations were successful. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Across a period of 54 months, several changes were made to the feeding protocols of 32 adult chimpanzees living at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center Field Station. Before implementing any changes in diet, baseline data were collected for 6 months. During Baseline (BS), the chimpanzees received unlimited amounts of primate biscuits twice a day and a limited amount of produce as enrichment. Treatment One (T1) dietary modifications included an increased amount of vegetables, primarily leafy greens, and biscuit feedings scheduled to occur an hour after vegetables were provided to the chimpanzees. T1 lasted for 1 year. At the end of T1, most of the chimpanzees had gained weight. Treatment Two (T2) occurred over the span of 3 years, during which all the chimpanzees were switched from unlimited, group-distributed primate biscuits to individually prescribed amounts of biscuits, fed in\dividually, and increased daily feedings of leafy greens. By the end of T2, 10 of 15 chimpanzees who were overweight or obese at the start of the project were within range of ideal body condition, and 4 of the remaining 5 were improved. All the chimpanzees who started the project within ideal range were still within ideal range. Significantly more time was invested in eating, foraging, and processing food during T2 (p <.05), more appropriately replicating the natural time budget for a chimpanzee. There were not any increases in abnormal, stress-related, or agonistic behaviors as a function of dietary modifications. Inactivity, however, was significantly higher (p <.05) during the later protocol, and locomotion was concurrently lower (p <.05). © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT: With age, primates’ activity levels and ease of movement may decline and changes in locomotory behaviour may reflect changes in health. Thus, developing quick and reliable measures of movement has important applications for measuring recovery from disease, injury, or any age-related mobility declines. While behavioural observations can offer a rich understanding of primates’ activity budgets and rates of locomotory behaviours, such data are often time consuming to collect, require trained personnel, and may not capture aspects of primates’ movement that relate to welfare, such as fluency of movement. Here, we assessed the reliability and utility of a published chimpanzee mobility rating scale (Mobility Scoring System) with a new population of sanctuary-housed chimpanzees. We also developed a novel movement measure: the Fluency Scoring Scale. The Mobility Scoring System is comprised of six questions that staff can use to rate individual chimpanzee's mobility. The Fluency Score Scale is used in conjunction with behavioural observations to rate the fluency with which a chimpanzee performs locomotory behaviour. We studied 30 chimpanzees at Chimp Haven with no known disease or injury that would impact their movement in order to assess typical mobility by age. By studying individuals aged 21–53 years old, we assessed if chimpanzees’ mobility scores (as rated by care staff using the Mobility Scoring System) and movement fluency scores (as scored independently by an observer collecting observational data) correlated with age as well as rates of locomotory behaviour. The raters showed strong agreement in their scores for all six mobility measures, both in the pre- and post-study phases. We found that the chimpanzees’ mobility scores and movement fluency scores were significantly correlated with age, such that older individuals had poorer mobility and movement fluency. We also found that the chimpanzees’ mobility scores were correlated with their movement fluency scores. However, we did not find that either the mobility scores nor movement fluency scores correlated with chimpanzees’ rates of locomotory behaviour. Furthermore, we did not find that older chimpanzees performed less locomotory behaviour than younger individuals. Thus, the Mobility Scoring System and Fluency Scoring Scale appear to capture chimpanzees’ ease of movement rather than rates of movement. Such mobility metrics may be of use to managers seeking to evaluate enclosure suitability for aging chimpanzees and future work should assess how well these scales can capture changes in mobility over time and their sensitivity to measuring the movement of chimpanzees with known mobility impairments. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Data on space-use patterns are essential for understanding species ecology and conservation. Individual chimpanzee communities are known to vary in home range size and habitat use dynamics, reflecting site-specific strategies to differences in resource availability on different landscapes. Here we present home range estimates for the Buraiga chimpanzees of Kibale National Park, Uganda, a community of eastern chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) living within the largest remaining population fragment in Uganda. The Buraiga chimpanzees are currently undergoing habituation for research and tourism under the direction of the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA). We analyzed 15 months of GPS data (August 2019 – March 2020, and January – July 2022), calculating overall and seasonal home range and core area estimates with two methods, minimum convex polygon (MCP) and kernel density estimates (KDE). Home range was estimated to cover an area of 15.77 km2 (95% KDE), and 24.90 km2 (100% MCP). Additionally, we found that 15.82% of the Buraiga chimpanzee’s home range overlaps with community-managed land, primarily the Kanyanchu Swamp corridor and adjacent agricultural land. Seasonally, we found that Buraiga chimpanzees used a larger area during dry season months, compared with rainy season months. Documenting how great ape populations utilize increasingly anthropogenically influenced landscapes is important in order to facilitate long-term survival in the face of climate change, habitat fragmentation, and other ongoing threats.

ABSTRACT: In order to achieve a better understanding of the factors that might have led our hominin ancestors to transition to a more terrestrial niche, including sleeping on the ground, we have conducted a study on the ground nesting behavior of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Chimpanzees, like all other species of great apes, build nests in which to sleep each night, but little is known about regional differences in their nesting habits. Previously, nesting on the ground was considered typical of gorillas, but rare in most populations of chimpanzees. Using data acquired during our extensive chimpanzee nesting survey conducted between 2004 and 2013 across a > 50 000 km2 region in northern Democratic Republic of the Congo, we report a distinctive ground nesting behaviour of eastern chimpanzees (P. t. schweinfurthii). We have mapped the geographical distribution of ground nesting and compared its frequency at 20 survey areas on both sides of a large river, the Uele. We found that ground nests made up more than 1% of total nests at 15 of the 20 survey regions. For a subset of 16 of these regions, we utilized statistical models to investigate whether forest type and structure, as well as the abundance of carnivores and large herbivores, and the activities of humans impacted the frequency of ground nesting and nest height. We predicted that higher encounter rates of human and dangerous animal signs would be associated with lower rates of ground nesting as well as increased nest height. Overall, 10.4% of the Bili-Uéré chimpanzee nests were terrestrial, but the frequency of ground nesting varied extensively between the survey areas (0-29% of nests). The occurrence of ground nests was positively associated with denser forests (p = 0.004), herb patches (p < 0.001), and light gaps (p < 0.001). Light gaps (p < 0.001), herb patches (p = 0.044), and vine tangles (p = 0.016) also had a strong negative effect on nest height. Hunting by humans had a negative effect on the probability of the occurrence of ground nests (p = 0.001) and a positive one on nest height (p = 0.013), with a similar but likely marginal effect of large herbivores on nest height (p = 0.023). In addition, the chimpanzees nested at significantly lower heights with increasing distance from roads and settlements (p < 0.001). Carnivore encounter rates, however, had no significant impact on ground nest frequency or nest height. Our results indicate that ground nesting can no longer be considered a rare and patchily-occurring phenomenon in Pan troglodytes, but is instead a major component of the chimpanzee behavioural repertoire across a considerable fraction of the range of the Eastern subspecies. Our study highlights that neither the large body size of gorillas nor the taming of fire are necessary conditions for hominids to sleep overnight on the ground, even in areas inhabited by multiple species of large carnivore. Human hunting, however, appears to reduce the probability of ground nesting, or eliminate the behavior altogether. © TONI ROMANI ET AL., 2023.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees live in fission-fusion social organizations, which means that party size, composition, and spatial distribution are constantly in flux. Moreover, chimpanzees use a remarkably extensive repertoire of vocal and nonvocal forms of communication, thought to help convey information in such a socially and spatially dynamic setting. One proposed form of nonvocal communication in chimpanzees is buttress drumming, in which an individual hits a tree buttress with its hands and/or feet, thereby producing a low-frequency acoustic signal. It is often presumed that this behavior functions to communicate over long distances and is, therefore, goal-oriented. If so, we would expect chimpanzees to exhibit selectivity in the choice of trees and buttresses used in buttress drumming. Selectivity is a key attribute of many other goal-directed chimpanzee behaviors, such as nut-cracking and ant dipping. Here, we investigate whether chimpanzees at the Seringbara study site in the Nimba Mountains, Guinea, West Africa, show selectivity in their buttress drumming behavior. Our results indicate that Seringbara chimpanzees are more likely to use larger trees and select buttresses that are thinner and have a greater surface area. These findings imply that tree buttress drumming is not a random act, but rather goal-oriented and requires knowledge of suitable trees and buttresses. Our results also point to long-distance communication as a probable function of buttress drumming based on selectivity for buttress characteristics likely to impact sound propagation. This study provides a foundation for further assessing the cognitive underpinnings and functions of buttress drumming in wild chimpanzees. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Observations of drawing behaviour in chimpanzees have often focused on the completed drawings. Here, we compared drawing behaviour using fingers or tools on a touch-sensitive monitor between five chimpanzees from the Kumamoto Sanctuary (KS) and two from the Primate Research Institute (PRI), both located at Kyoto University, Japan. Regarding drawing duration, both PRI females drew relatively longer than the other, with the exception of one KS female. However, a long drawing duration did not correspond with a decrease in the number of pauses, which can be interpreted as a lack of concentration or interest. Therefore, to better understand the engagement of individuals, we recorded the time spent looking at the touchscreen. Pan, one of the two PRI females, had the longest drawing periods and spent the most time looking at the screen. We compared her with Ai, the other PRI female, to better understand their individual marking techniques and behaviours. By adapting to each onea AAs specific behaviour and previous experience with tool-Assisted drawing on paper, we offered the females appropriate tools for making marks on the touchscreen. Our results indicate that electronic devices are not limiting in the expression of drawing behaviour. The females did not have the same drawing technique and also showed different types of engagement as motivation, which could not have been detected by only studying the completed drawings. By focusing more on the process rather than on the drawings themselves, we try to show inter-individual differences in drawing behaviour of chimpanzees and the relevance to adapt to it as experimenters. © 2023 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.

ABSTRACT: A large body of literature demonstrates the adaptive benefits of social relationships between kin, including fitness and survival. Given that most social mammals are characterized by male-biased dispersal, the majority of research on kin selection and associated advantages focuses on social relationships between female kin. Meanwhile, research on social relationships between adult male and female kin has primarily focused on inbreeding avoidance or the benefit to adult sons, with less attention on potential advantages these social relationships may provide females. The general pattern of male dominance over females in most mammal species suggests that females may benefit from protective associations with adult male kin. Using 43 years of behavioural data on the wild chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, of Gombe National Park, Tanzania, we examined association patterns between females and their adult maternal male kin. We specifically focused on how these associations may represent a trade-off between inbreeding avoidance and protection for females, particularly against infanticide. In accordance with inbreeding avoidance, we predicted that females’ association with adult kin would decrease when they were maximally tumescent, signalling sexual receptivity. To determine whether female–male kin associations provide protection to females, we examined female associations with adult male kin during their first year postpartum when infants are most vulnerable to infanticide. We predicted that during this first year postpartum, females would have a higher association with male kin than with unrelated males. We found that females associated more with adult sons and brothers than with unrelated males when they did not have a sexual swelling. Female association increased with all males across tumescence but females associated less with their brothers than they did with their sons and unrelated males when they were maximally tumescent, providing equivocal support for the inbreeding avoidance hypothesis. Furthermore, females associated more with both sons and brothers than with unrelated males in the first 6 months of the postpartum period. Higher association with brothers, relative to unrelated males, persisted throughout the first year postpartum. Together, these results speak to the cost–benefit trade-off in female and adult male kin associations, highlighting the potential protective advantage for females, especially during the postpartum period. © 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ABSTRACT: Adequate nutrition is essential for individual well-being, survival and reproductive fitness. Yet, in wild animals, including great apes, scoring nutrition or health comes with many challenges. Here, we have two aims: first, broadly review the scientific literature regarding nutritional data on wild chimpanzee foods to get a better understanding what nutrients foods comprise of, and second, highlight important findings on wild chimpanzee nutrition and welfare pertaining to diet. We discuss variation in macro and micronutrients in food items consumed and their role in chimpanzee health across chimpanzee subspecies from multiple study sites. We found a lack of information pertaining to nutritional consumption rates of daily diets. Second, we call for a fresh, in-depth discussion on wild chimpanzee welfare issues is of foremost importance to inform conservation projects and particularly settings where humans and chimpanzees may interact, because such conversation can reveal how specific or general welfare measures can (a) inform our knowledge of an individual’s, group’s, and population’s welfare, (b) provide additional measures from the study of wild chimpanzee ecology that can guide the welfare of captive chimpanzees, and (c) can enable comparative study of welfare across wild populations. A summary of the current literature on approaches to measuring wild chimpanzee health and welfare status, to our knowledge, has yet to be done. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Environmental enrichment is essential for the well-being of zoo animals. Recent advances in sensor and video technologies may contribute to improvements in enrichment in terms of their flexibilities and time constraints. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether interactive movie art can be used as a form of environmental enrichment. We implemented interactive movies designed by a professional artist, a visual art aiming to reflect naturalistic forest habitat, in an indoor chimpanzee enclosure at Kyoto City Zoo in Japan. Motion-tracking sensors embedded in buoys were installed at several locations around the indoor enclosure; the chimpanzees could change the movie contents by physically interacting with these objects. We recorded behaviors by observing entire troop of chimpanzees (six) between March 16 and 20, 2020 (control condition), then recorded behaviors when the interactive movie was presented (experimental condition) between March 21 and 29, 2020. Behaviors were recorded via direct observations and video recordings to examine any changes after the installation of interactive art. The chimpanzees spent more time in the indoor enclosures during the experimental condition than during the control condition. Activity budgets did not change substantially during the study period. There was no evidence of habituation to the movie during the study period. Three chimpanzees, including two young chimpanzees, interacted with the movie more frequently than the others; these young chimpanzees occasionally showed playful expressions when interacting with the movie and exhibited different reactivities to the movie scenes. These results demonstrate, first, that the interactive art did not negatively affect chimpanzee behavior, and second, that some of the chimpanzees indeed showed positive responses to the art. This study, therefore, introduces a novel possibility for environmental enrichment in zoos, involving a collaboration between science and art. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT: In human fission–fusion societies, ritualized non-linguistic signal exchanges that include gestures, vocalizations, and facial expressions are regularly observed at both arrivals (greetings) and departures (leave-takings). These communicative events play an important role in the formation and maintenance of social relationships. Wild chimpanzees also form large communities that split into smaller fluid parties during daily activities, with individuals moving freely between them. However, in chimpanzees only greetings have been reported. This study explores signal exchanges in the Bossou chimpanzee community during fissions (departures) and fusions (arrivals) given an individual’s social rank, kinship, position as traveller or party-member, the level of potential threat, and the party size and presence of mature males. We analysed three time periods (1993–1994; 2003–2004; 2013–2014) during which the composition and social hierarchy of the community varied. We show that the occurrence and form of communication during fission and fusion events are mediated by social factors, including rank, kinship, and party size and composition. Individuals were more likely to communicate during fusions than during fissions, communication was more likely to be produced towards a higher-ranking individual and to non-kin individuals, but the tendency to communicate in general increased with an increase in social rank. The presence of more individuals, and in particular mature males, decreased the likelihood of communication. Communication during fusions supported patterns reported in previous studies on greetings, and our results support the argument that, if present, leave-takings are not a common feature of chimpanzee social interactions. Current methodological difficulties regarding the function of declarative signals hinder our ability to discriminate potential parting rituals within communication before departures. Given similar methodological difficulties, we also provide a note of caution in the interpretation of all signals produced during fusions as ‘greetings’. © 2021, Japan Monkey Centre.

ABSTRACT: Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a ubiquitous pediatric pathogen causing serious lower respiratory tract disease worldwide. No licensed vaccine is currently available. In this work, the coding gene for mDS-Dav1, the full-length and prefusion conformation RSV fusion glycoprotein (F), was designed by introducing the stabilized prefusion F (preF) mutations from DS-Cav1 into the encoding gene of wild-type RSV (wtRSV) F protein. The recombinant adenovirus encoding mDS-Cav1, rChAd63-mDS-Cav1, was constructed based on serotype 63 chimpanzee adenovirus vector and characterized in vitro. After immunizing mice via intranasal route, the rChAd63-mDS-Cav1 induced enhanced neutralizing antibody and F-specific CD8+ T cell responses as well as good immune protection against RSV challenge with the absence of enhanced RSV disease (ERD) in BALB/c mice. The results indicate that rChAd63-mDS-Cav1 is a promising mucosal vaccine candidate against RSV infection and warrants further development.

ABSTRACT: The knowledge of what separates us genetically from our less-evolved relatives is crucial for gaining new biomedical insight about the human-chimpanzee relatedness that could influence the development of new treatments and diagnostic aids for various ailments. Especially, more than 300 diseases have been mapped to the X chromosome, which has unique and complicated characteristics than other chromosomes in the human genome. Although the genomes of humans and chimpanzees share 99% similarity, significant differences exist between the two species in their non-coding intronic regions. Therefore, this evolutionary-based genome annotation study attempted to computationally compare, contrast, and annotate the homologous miRNAs and their gene regulatory mechanisms in the intronic regions of the PHEX gene on the human X chromosome of the two species. From our results, we identified a total of 1296 human miRNAs and 46, 957 gene targets. Similarly, 30, 563 targets of homologous chimp miRNAs were predicted. miRNAs like hsa-miR-17–5p showed a maximum number of interactions while miRNAs like hsa-miR-107 with the least number of interactions in the human/chimp gene networks. A few top-ranked miRNAs such as hsa-miR-24, hsa-miR-145, hsa-miR-34a, and hsa-miR-378 were observed to be common between the two genera. The cooperativity and multiplicity of certain miRNAs were predicted to regulate the expression of diverse cancer-associated genes such as Cyclin D1, Notch1, CDK-6, E2F3, ALK4, CKDN2A, DHFR, and MAPK14. Nevertheless, further in vitro and in vivo experimental validations of these gene candidates are required before they could be used as potential diagnostic markers and drug targets. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Background: Appropriate space is considered paramount for good captive animal welfare. There has been a concerted effort by captive institutions, particularly zoos, to provide captive animals with relatively large, naturalistic enclosures which havehad demonstrated welfare benefits for animals. However, post-occupancy assessments of these enclosures tend to focus on short-term welfare-centredbehavioural effects or human perceptions of the enclosures and their effects and seldom consider spaceuse. We examined the space use of a group of eight captive chimpanzees 5 years after large-scale enclosure modification at the Johannesburg Zoo, South Africa. Methods: Instantaneous scan sampling was used to record behaviour and location of each chimpanzee at 5 min intervals in the new enclosure. From these 6.8 h of data, space-use patterns and subgroup (two or more chimpanzees within 10 m of each other) spacing were considered relative to local environmental variables, social conditions and the location and size of the previous smaller enclosures in which they had been kept. Results: Space use was heterogeneous, with some enclosure zones being used more than others, and 97.5% of subgroups restricted their spacing to the dimensions of the previous housing (10 m × 10 m). Conclusions: This pattern was not explained by individual behaviour, time of day, location, available space, weather, temperature or shade availability, inter-individual spacing or subgroup composition. We suggest the learned helplessness phenomenon may explain these observations and discuss the implications for both animal welfare and endangered species conservation.Regardless of the mechanism, we suggest that such effects could be avoided through the provision of large enclosures for captive animals. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: How animals grow and when they stop growing are key variables for understanding life history evolution. Although theoretically straightforward, it is logistically difficult to take body size measurements of wild animals, especially endangered and arboreal primates. Here we employ a method that has gained popularity over the past decade: digital photography combined with parallel lasers. Two laser pointers are set at a known distance apart and then projected on the animal to act as a scale in the photograph. We used this method to estimate limb length and width in a large, cross-sectional sample of mid- to late-adolescent and young adult male chimpanzees at Ngogo in Kibale National Park, Uganda. After several years of modifying our methods, we present a protocol for estimating limb length and width in wild chimpanzees. We found that by mid- to late-adolescence, male chimpanzees have reached adult height, as chimpanzees between 12 and 20 years of age did not differ in their forearm or lower leg lengths. However, mid- to late-adolescent male chimpanzees appear to continue gaining mass, as we found a weak but positive correlation between age and limb width for both forearms and lower legs. Although our method proved relatively precise, we encountered several sources of error throughout this study, such as ensuring that the lasers were indeed parallel and in identifying anatomical landmarks in the photographs. We discuss these challenges with the hope of increasing transparency and collaboration in future studies of primate body size. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Japan Monkey Centre.

ABSTRACT: Employing orexin-A immunohistochemical staining we describe the nuclear parcellation of orexinergic neurons in the hypothalami of a lar gibbon and a chimpanzee. The clustering of orexinergic neurons within the hypothalamus and the terminal networks follow the patterns generally observed in other mammals, including laboratory rodents, strepsirrhine primates and humans. The orexinergic neurons were found within three distinct clusters in the ape hypothalamus, which include the main cluster, zona incerta cluster and optic tract cluster. In addition, the orexinergic neurons of the optic tract cluster appear to extend to a more rostral and medial location than observed in other species, being observed in the tuberal region in the anterior ventromedial aspect of the hypothalamus. While orexinergic terminal networks were observed throughout the brain, high density terminal networks were observed within the hypothalamus, medial and intralaminar nuclei of the dorsal thalamus, and within the serotonergic and noradrenergic regions of the midbrain and pons, which is typical for mammals. The expanded distribution of orexinergic neurons into the tuberal region of the ape hypothalamus, is a feature that needs to be investigated in other primate species, but appears to correlate with orexin gene expression in the same region of the human hypothalamus, but these neurons are not revealed with immunohistochemical staining in humans. Thus, it appears that apes have a broader distribution of orexinergic neurons compared to other primate species, but that the neurons within this extension of the optic tract cluster in humans, while expressing the orexin gene, do not produce the neuropeptide. © 2021 American Association for Anatomy.

ABSTRACT: We evaluated the immunogenicity and protective ability of a chimpanzee replication-deficient adenovirus vectored COVID-19 vaccine (BV-AdCoV-1) expressing a stabilized pre-fusion SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein in golden Syrian hamsters. Intranasal administration of BV-AdCoV-1 elicited strong humoral and cellular immunity in the animals. Furthermore, vaccination prevented weight loss, reduced SARS-CoV-2 infectious virus titers in the lungs as well as lung pathology and provided protection against SARS-CoV-2 live challenge. In addition, there was no vaccine-induced enhanced disease nor immunopathological exacerbation in BV-AdCoV-1-vaccinated animals. Furthermore, the vaccine induced cross-neutralizing antibody responses against the ancestral strain and the B.1.617.2, Omicron(BA.1), Omicron(BA.2.75) and Omicron(BA.4/5) variants of concern. These results demonstrate that BV-AdCoV-1 is potentially a promising candidate vaccine to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to curtail pandemic spread in humans.

ABSTRACT: The facial differences between recent Pan troglodytes and Homo sapiens can be used as a proxy for the reduction of facial prognathism that happened during evolutionary transition between Australopithecines and early Homo. The projecting nasal morphology of Homo has been considered both a passive consequence of anatomical reorganization related to brain and integrated craniofacial evolution as well as an adaptation related to air-conditioning during physiological and behavioral shifts in human evolution. Yet, previous research suggested impaired air-conditioning in Homo challenging respiratory adaptations based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and airflow simulations. Here we improved CFD model at the inflow region and also carried out three-dimensional (3D) geometric morphometrics to address the hypothesis of impaired air-conditioning in humans and species differences in airway shape. With the new CFD model we simulated pressure, velocity, and temperature changes in airflow of six adult humans and six chimpanzees and analyzed 164 semi-landmarks of 10 humans and 10 chimpanzees for 3D size and shape comparisons. Our finding shows significantly different internal 3D nasal airways. Also, species means of pressure, velocity, and temperature differed statistically significantly. However, form-related differences in temperature exchanges seem subtle and may question adaptive disadvantages. We rather support a hypothesis of craniofacial changes in the Australopithecus-Homo transition that are related to brain evolution and craniofacial integration with facial and nasal modifications that contribute to maintain respiratory adaptations related to air conditioning. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: While low serotonergic activity is often associated with psychological disorders such as depression, anxiety, mood, and personality disorders, variations in serotonin also contribute to normal personality differences. In this study, we investigated the role of blood DNA methylation levels at individual CpG sites of two key serotonergic genes (serotonin receptor gene 1A, HTR1A; serotonin transporter gene, SLC6A4) in predicting the personalities of captive chimpanzees. We found associations between methylation at 9/48 CpG sites with four personality dimensions: Dominance, Reactivity/Dependability, Agreeableness, and Openness. Directionality of effects were CpG location-dependent and confirmed a role of serotonergic methylation in reducing anxiety (Dominance) and aggression-related personality (Reactivity/Undependability) while simultaneously promoting prosocial (Agreeableness) and exploratory personalities (Openness). Although early-life adversity has been shown to impact serotonergic methylation patterns in other species, here, atypical early social rearing experiences only had a modest impact on CpG methylation levels in this chimpanzee sample. The precise environmental factors impacting serotonergic methylation in chimpanzees remain to be identified. Nevertheless, our study suggests a role in shaping natural variation in animal personalities. The results of this study offer a basis for future hypothesis-driven testing in additional populations and species to better understand the impact of ecology and evolution on complex behavioral traits. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Using tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry, we describe the nuclear parcellation of the catecholaminergic system in the brains of a lar gibbon (Hylobates lar) and a chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes). The parcellation of catecholaminergic nuclei in the brains of both apes is virtually identical to that observed in humans and shows very strong similarities to that observed in mammals more generally, particularly other primates. Specific variations of this system in the apes studied include an unusual high-density cluster of A10dc neurons, an enlarged retrorubral nucleus (A8), and an expanded distribution of the neurons forming the dorsolateral division of the locus coeruleus (A4). The additional A10dc neurons may improve dopaminergic modulation of the extended amygdala, the enlarged A8 nucleus may be related to the increased use of communicative facial expressions in the hominoids compared to other primates, while the expansion of the A4 nucleus appears to be related to accelerated evolution of the cerebellum in the hominoids compared to other primates. In addition, we report the presence of a compact division of the locus coeruleus proper (A6c), as seen in other primates, that is not present in other mammals apart from megachiropteran bats. The presence of this nucleus in primates and megachiropteran bats may reflect homology or homoplasy, depending on the evolutionary scenario adopted. The fact that the complement of homologous catecholaminergic nuclei is mostly consistent across mammals, including primates, is advantageous for the selection of model animals for the study of specific dysfunctions of the catecholaminergic system in humans. © 2021 American Association for Anatomy.

ABSTRACT: Several studies have examined factors that regulate fission–fusion dynamics (FFD) in chimpanzee communities, such as receptive females, predation risks, and food availability. However, the effects of these factors vary between populations. In this study, we conducted focal animal observations of adult males in the M group in Kalinzu to examine the influence of male dominance rank, aggression from other males, the presence of females exhibiting maximum sexual swelling (MS), and fruit abundance on male tendencies of party attendance. We found that low-ranking males spent more time alone than other males when females with MS were absent. In contrast, when females with MS were present, males of all ranks showed a similar tendency of party attendance. We also found that the aggressive interactions increased with the number of males irrespective of the presence or absence of females with MS, and low-ranking males attracted aggression more frequently than higher-ranking males. These results suggest that low-ranking males frequently ranged alone to avoid aggression from other males unless they attended parties to seek mating opportunities. We conclude that low-ranking males have alternative tactics to balance the costs and benefits incurred or gained when attending parties. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) harbor rich assemblages of malaria parasites, including three species closely related to P. falciparum (sub-genus Laverania), the most malignant human malaria parasite. Here, we characterize the ecology and epidemiology of malaria infection in wild chimpanzee reservoirs. We used molecular assays to screen chimpanzee fecal samples, collected longitudinally and cross-sectionally from wild populations, for malaria parasite mitochondrial DNA. We found that chimpanzee malaria parasitism has an early age of onset and varies seasonally in prevalence. A subset of samples revealed Hepatocystis mitochondrial DNA, with phylogenetic analyses suggesting that Hepatocystis appears to cross species barriers more easily than Laverania. Longitudinal and cross-sectional sampling independently support the hypothesis that mean ambient temperature drives spatiotemporal variation in chimpanzee Laverania infection. Infection probability peaked at ~24.5 °C, consistent with the empirical transmission optimum of P. falciparum in humans. Forest cover was also positively correlated with spatial variation in Laverania prevalence, consistent with the observation that forest-dwelling Anophelines are the primary vectors. Extrapolating these relationships across equatorial Africa, we map spatiotemporal variation in the suitability of chimpanzee habitat for Laverania transmission, offering a hypothetical baseline indicator of human exposure risk. © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Objective: To report the treatment and outcome of a a captive chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) undergoing 3-portal laparoscopic hysterectomy. Additionally, the technique used for successful urinary catheterization is described. Animals: A 29-year-old female intact chimpanzee with uterine bleeding. Study design: Clinical case report. Methods: Uterine changes consistent with adenomyosis and/or endometriosis were noted on abdominal ultrasonographic and computed tomographic examinations. A urinary catheter was placed before a 3-portal laparoscopic hysterectomy with a uterine manipulator (VCare) and a vessel sealer (Ligasure). The uterus was submitted for histopathology. Results: Preoperative urinary catheterization was achieved with several modifications and prevented bladder protrusion into the surgical field. Laparoscopy provided excellent visualization of the pelvic structures and VCare effectively maneuvered the uterus for a safe and efficient dissection. The use of the vessel sealer was effective, and bleeding was minimal. Anesthesia and surgery lasted 240 and 150 minutes, respectively. No complications were encountered. Histopathological changes of the uterus were consistent with adenomyosis and myometrial hyperplasia. The chimpanzee recovered uneventfully and returned to normal behavior with no recurrence of uterine bleeding 5 months after surgery. Conclusion: The 3-portal laparoscopic technique reported here allowed hysterectomy without complication in this chimpanzee. Urinary catheterization was technically challenging but successful. © 2022 American College of Veterinary Surgeons.

ABSTRACT: Compassion fatigue is defined as “traumatization of helpers through their efforts at helping others”. It has negative effects on clinicians including reduced satisfaction with work, fatigue, irritability, dread of going to work, and lack of joy in life. It is correlated with patients’ decreased satisfaction with care. Compassion fatigue occurs in a variety of helping professions including educators, social workers, mental health clinicians, and it also appears in nonhuman animal care workers. This study surveyed caregivers of chimpanzees using the ProQOL-V to assess the prevalence of compassion fatigue among this group. Compassion satisfaction is higher than many other types of animal care workers. Conversely, this group shows moderate levels of burnout and secondary traumatic stress; higher levels than other types of animal care workers and many medical professions. While compassion fatigue has an effect on the caregiver’s experience, it has potential to affect animal welfare. Caregivers are an integral part of the chimpanzee social network. Compassion fatigue affects the caregiver’s attitude, this could in turn affect the relationship and degrade the experience of care for captive chimpanzees. Compassion fatigue can be mitigated with professional development, mindfulness training, interrelationships among staff, and specialized training. This preliminary assessment indicates the work ahead is educating caregivers about compassion fatigue and implementing procedures in sanctuaries to mitigate burnout and secondary traumatic stress. © 2022 by the author.

ABSTRACT: Environmental enrichment provides mental stimulation and minimizes abnormal behaviors in captive animals. In captive chimpanzees, individual animals may vary in the ways in which they benefit from enrichment or use enrichment devices, so investigating nuances in enrichment use may improve the welfare of captive chimpanzees. In the current study, three ethograms measuring distinct features of enrichment use (i.e., enrichment object, manipulation behavior, and social context) were evaluated by coding videos of captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) at Chimpanzee Sanctuary Northwest in Cle Elum, WA. A total of 732 min and 58 s of video footage was coded from a larger video archive (i.e., 2054 videos) of enrichment use that spanned a decade. A principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that different categories of enrichment objects were more often associated with specific manipulation behaviors and social contexts, suggesting that enrichment objects might fulfill different behavioral and social needs in captivity. Specifically, toy objects were associated with active tactile behaviors in affiliative contexts while oral behaviors were used with foraging objects in solitary contexts. Additionally, individual chimpanzees showed unique preferences for enrichment objects, indicating that caregivers of captive chimpanzees should consider individual needs instead of a “one size fits all” approach to enrichment provisions. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Introduction: It is well known that the common chimpanzee, as both the closest living relative to humans and a facultative bipedal, has the capability of bipedal standing but cannot do so fully upright. Accordingly, they have been of exceeding significance in elucidating the evolution of human bipedalism. There are many reasons why the common chimpanzee can only stand with its hips–knees bent, such as the distally oriented long ischial tubercle and the almost absent lumbar lordosis. However, it is unknown how the relative positions of their shoulder–hip–knee–ankle joints are coordinated. Similarly, the distribution of the biomechanical characteristics of the lower-limb muscles and the factors that affect the erectness of standing as well as the muscle fatigue of the lower limbs remain a mystery. The answers are bound to light up the evolutional mechanism of hominin bipedality, but these conundrums have not been shed much light upon, because few studies have comprehensively explored the effects of skeletal architecture and muscle properties on bipedal standing in common chimpanzees. Methods: Thus, we first built a musculoskeletal model comprising the head-arms-trunk (HAT), thighs, shanks, and feet segments of the common chimpanzee, and then, the mechanical relationships of the Hill-type muscle-tendon units (MTUs) in bipedal standing were deduced. Thereafter, the equilibrium constraints were established, and a constrained optimization problem was formulated where the optimization objective was defined. Finally, thousands of simulations of bipedal standing experiments were performed to determine the optimal posture and its corresponding MTU parameters including muscle lengths, muscle activation, and muscle forces. Moreover, to quantify the relationship between each pair of the parameters from all the experimental simulation outcomes, the Pearson correlation analysis was employed. Results: Our results demonstrate that in the pursuit of the optimal bipedal standing posture, the common chimpanzee cannot simultaneously achieve maximum erectness and minimum muscle fatigue of the lower limbs. For uni-articular MTUs, the relationship between muscle activation, relative muscle lengths, together with relative muscle forces, and the corresponding joint angle is generally negatively correlated for extensors and positively correlated for flexors. For bi-articular MTUs, the relationship between muscle activation, coupled with relative muscle forces, and the corresponding joint angles does not show the same pattern as in the uni-articular MTUs. Discussion: The results of this study bridge the gap between skeletal architecture, along with muscle properties, and biomechanical performance of the common chimpanzee during bipedal standing, which enhances existing biomechanical theories and advances the comprehension of bipedal evolution in humans.

ABSTRACT: A fundamental aspect of human communication is our ability to refer to external objects and events through both words and gestures (such as pointing), yet the evolutionary origins of such signals remain obscure. Apes, living in their natural environments, rarely or never point, but it has been claimed that male chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, from the Ngogo community, Uganda, habitually use exaggerated loud scratches (ELSs) to refer to specific body locations where they wish to be groomed (Pika & Mitani, 2006, Current Biology, 16(6), 191–192). This study suggested continuity between referential abilities in humans and our closest living relatives, making it an important finding to replicate in other populations. Hence here, we compared whether ELSs are used in a referential manner across four wild communities of eastern chimpanzees (Ngogo, Kanyawara, Sonso and Waibira). Our data show that scratchers were significantly more likely to receive grooming in the scratched location at Ngogo compared to the other three sites. At the latter sites this response occurred at low rates and signallers did not seem to pursue this goal. This suggests that ELSs do not function referentially at these sites, and the published findings from Ngogo were not replicated. Further exploration into alternative functions of ELSs in the Kanyawara community revealed that, in this community, this signal functions to initiate grooming bouts and to reengage partners during grooming pauses. Individuals who produced the signal to initiate grooming were likely to offer grooming. In contrast, during grooming bouts, groomers produced ELSs to request reciprocation of grooming from their partner. Our study demonstrates that chimpanzees do not ubiquitously use the ELS in a referential manner, but that they can use this gesture in a highly flexible fashion, with signal function depending on the intricate details of the social contexts in which they are produced. © 2022 The Authors

ABSTRACT: SARS-CoV-2 infection is a global public health threat. Vaccines are considered amongst the most important tools to control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. As expected, deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection have dropped dramatically with widespread vaccination. However, there are concerns over the duration of vaccine-induced protection, as well as their effectiveness against emerging variants of concern. Here, we constructed a recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus vectored vaccine expressing the full-length spike of SARS-CoV-2 (AdC68-S). Rapid and high levels of humoral and cellular immune responses were observed after immunization of C57BL/6J mice with one or two doses of AdC68-S. Notably, neutralizing antibodies were observed up to at least six months after vaccination, without substantial decline. Single or double doses AdC68-S immunization resulted in lower viral loads in lungs of mice against SARS-CoV-2 challenge both in the short term (21 days) and long-term (6 months). Histopathological examination of AdC68-S immunized mice lungs showed mild histological abnormalities after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Taken together, this study demonstrates the efficacy and durability of the AdC68-S vaccine and constitutes a promising candidate for clinical evaluation. © 2022 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Many animal species use vocal and nonvocal acoustic signals to communicate over large distances. Wild chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, drum on the buttress roots of trees, generating low-frequency sounds that can reach distances of over 1 km. Buttress drumming is produced in bouts of beats and is often accompanied by pant hoots, the species-typical long-distance vocalization. We investigated whether individual differences exist in the acoustic structure of drumming bouts produced by male chimpanzees of the Waibira community in the Budongo Forest in Uganda, and whether individual, contextual and social factors affected their use of drumming. We found individual differences in drumming bouts produced by seven male chimpanzees during travel events as well as in their timing within the pant hoot, and discriminated specific patterns of beats for some chimpanzees. In contrast, we found no evidence for individual differences in the acoustic structure of drumming bouts produced by four males during displays. Together these findings suggest that chimpanzees may be able to choose to encode identity within individual drumming ‘signatures’. Chimpanzees drummed less frequently as their party size increased. We found no evidence that the age of the signaller or the presence of preferred social partners, higher-ranking males or females in oestrus affected the use of drumming. These findings suggest there may be flexibility in buttress drumming across social and behavioural contexts and provide support for the hypothesis that, by encoding individual identity, long-distance drumming may be used to facilitate chimpanzee fission–fusion social dynamics. © 2022 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: The hippocampus is associated with essential brain functions, such as learning and memory. Human hippocampal volume is significantly greater than expected compared with that of non-human apes, suggesting a recent expansion. Intermediate progenitors, which are able to undergo multiple rounds of proliferative division before a final neurogenic division, may have played a role in evolutionary hippocampal expansion. To investigate the evolution of gene regulatory networks underpinning hippocampal neurogenesis in apes, we leveraged the differentiation of human and chimpanzee induced pluripotent stem cells into TBR2 (or EOMES)-positive hippocampal intermediate progenitor cells (hpIPCs). We found that the gene networks active in hpIPCs are significantly different between humans and chimpanzees, with ∼2500 genes being differentially expressed. We demonstrate that species-specific transposon-derived enhancers contribute to these transcriptomic differences. Young transposons, predominantly endogenous retroviruses and SINE-Vntr-Alus (SVAs), were co-opted as enhancers in a species-specific manner. Human-specific SVAs provided substrates for thousands of novel TBR2-binding sites, and CRISPR-mediated repression of these SVAs attenuated the expression of ∼25% of the genes that are upregulated in human intermediate progenitors relative to the same cell population in the chimpanzee. © 2022.

ABSTRACT: Checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) therapies provide limited benefit to patients with tumors of low immune reactivity. T cell-inducing vaccines hold promise to exert long-lasting disease control in combination with CPI therapy. Safety, tolerability and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of an individualized, heterologous chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAd68) and self-amplifying mRNA (samRNA)-based neoantigen vaccine in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab were assessed as primary endpoints in an ongoing phase 1/2 study in patients with advanced metastatic solid tumors (NCT03639714). The individualized vaccine regimen was safe and well tolerated, with no dose-limiting toxicities. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) >10% included pyrexia, fatigue, musculoskeletal and injection site pain and diarrhea. Serious TRAEs included one count each of pyrexia, duodenitis, increased transaminases and hyperthyroidism. The RP2D was 1012 viral particles (VP) ChAd68 and 30 µg samRNA. Secondary endpoints included immunogenicity, feasibility of manufacturing and overall survival (OS). Vaccine manufacturing was feasible, with vaccination inducing long-lasting neoantigen-specific CD8 T cell responses. Several patients with microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer (MSS-CRC) had improved OS. Exploratory biomarker analyses showed decreased circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in patients with prolonged OS. Although small study size limits statistical and translational analyses, the increased OS observed in MSS-CRC warrants further exploration in larger randomized studies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.

ABSTRACT: We performed a comparative analysis of human and 12 non-human primates to identify sequence variations in known cancer genes. We identified 395 human-specific fixed non-silent substitutions that emerged during evolution of human. Using bioinformatics analyses for functional consequences, we identified a number of substitutions that are predicted to alter protein function; one of these mutations is located at the most evolutionarily conserved domain of human BRCA2. © 2022 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Validation of agent-based models is underappreciated in scientific studies even though this process is an important part of ensuring that a model is a reliable research tool. Here we propose modifications to a model validation framework and illustrate this framework with a case study of territorial behavior. In species that defend territories, larger territories provide obvious benefits, such as increased access to food, shelter, and mates. An additional potential benefit is that larger territories could provide protection from intergroup conflict. Considerations from geometry indicate that per capita risk of death from intergroup violence should decrease with increasing territory size, insofar as conflict occurs mainly at the periphery. We tested this inference using computer simulations and data from chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and gray wolves (Canis lupus). We designed an agent-based model that allows territories to vary freely in size and shape. We present a framework for model validation and apply it to our agent-based model to substantiate its accuracy. Simulations from the validated model confirmed the predictions from geometry. Under a broad range of parameter values, per capita mortality rate decreased in larger territories. Similarly, using published data on rates of death from intercommunity aggression in 16 chimpanzee communities, as well as new data from 38 wolf packs, we found that per capita mortality rate correlated negatively with a measure of territory size. These findings indicate that in species with lethal intergroup aggression, one simple aspect of territory geometry – size – has strong effects on mortality. Several lines of evidence indicate that the per capita rates of mortality from warfare have decreased in many human societies over time. One factor contributing to this decrease may be the increasing geographic extent of political entities. © 2022

ABSTRACT: Species conservation and management require reliable information about animal distribution and population size. Better management actions within a species' range can be achieved by identifying the location and timing of population changes. In the Greater Mahale Ecosystem (GME), western Tanzania, deforestation due to the expansion of human settlements and agriculture, annual burning, and logging are known threats to wildlife. For one of the most charismatic species, the endangered eastern chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii), approximately 75% of the individuals are distributed outside national park boundaries, requiring monitoring and protection efforts over a vast landscape of various protection statuses. These efforts are especially challenging when we lack data on trends in density and population size. To predict spatio-temporal chimpanzee density and abundance across the GME, we used density surface modeling, fitting a generalized additive model to a 10-year time-series data set of nest counts based on line-transect surveys. The chimpanzee population declined at an annual rate of 2.41%, including declines of 1.72% in riparian forests (from this point forward, forests), 2.05% in miombo woodlands (from this point forward, woodlands) and 3.45% in nonforests. These population declines were accompanied by ecosystem-wide declines in vegetation types of 1.36% and 0.32% per year for forests and woodlands, respectively; we estimated an annual increase of 1.35% for nonforests. Our model predicted the highest chimpanzee density in forests (0.86 chimpanzees/km2, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 0.60–1.23; as of 2020), followed by woodlands (0.19, 95% CI 0.12–0.30) and nonforests (0.18, 95% CI 0.10–1.33). Although forests represent only 6% of the landscape, they support nearly one-quarter of the chimpanzee population (769 chimpanzees, 95% CI 536–1103). Woodlands dominate the landscape (71%) and therefore support more than a half of the chimpanzee population (2294; 95% CI 1420–3707). The remaining quarter of the landscape is represented by nonforests and supports another quarter of the chimpanzee population (750; 95% CI 408–1381). Given the pressures on the remaining suitable habitat in Tanzania, and the need of chimpanzees to access both forest and woodland vegetation to survive, we urge future management actions to increase resources and expand the efforts to protect critical forest and woodland habitat and promote strategies and policies that more effectively prevent irreversible losses. We suggest that regular monitoring programs implement a systematic random design to effectively inform and allocate conservation actions and facilitate interannual comparisons for trend monitoring, measuring conservation success, and guiding adaptive management. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: We studied the feeding strategies of savanna chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) at Nguye in Ugalla, Western Tanzania (05°13'S, 30°28'E). Among the driest most open chimpanzee habitats, Ugalla is covered mainly by woodlands. We analysed undigested contents in chimpanzee faeces, and conducted a vegetation survey and a 1-year phenology survey every 2 weeks. The fruits of some trees with the highest biomass had high appearance rates in faeces (e.g. Parinari curatellifolia and Diplorhynchus condylocarpon). Herbaceous Aframomum mala fruits grew in large patches in savanna woodland near forest edges along rivers and had the highest appearance frequency over the longest seasonal period in faeces. Other species with higher appearance rates in faeces for long seasonal periods included Grewia mollis at the forest edge and Thespesia garckeana growing on termite mounds at the forest edge. These two tree species had low biomass. Thus, savanna chimpanzees fed on some tree foods with higher biomass, herbaceous fruits instead of scarcer tree fruits, and fruits at forest edges and in forests which occupy a small portion of the study area, in addition to woodlands which occupy a large proportion. The forest edge and interior run continuously for long distances along rivers. Forest occupies 2% of this area, but chimpanzees can continuously obtain food by moving along riverine forest. To compensate for fruit scarcity in the non-fruiting (early rainy) season, chimpanzees ate fibrous, low-quality plant parts. Chimpanzees formed smaller parties when ripe fruits and unripe legumes were scarcer. Using these feeding strategies, chimpanzees adapted to savanna woodlands. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Japan Monkey Centre.

ABSTRACT: Greeting behaviors have been reported in several primate species, although their forms and context may vary across species. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) greet each other in various ways when they meet; however, many recent studies of greetings in chimpanzees have mostly focused on pant grunt vocalizations, which are often viewed as equivalent to submissive signals. As most greetings in chimpanzees are directed toward adult males, either from other males or females, relatively few studies have focused on female–female greetings. Thus, the primary aim of this study was to describe the greetings (not limited to pant grunts) between chimpanzee females in the Mahale Mountains National Park based on long-term observational data. I observed 405 female–female greeting events (10.9 instances per 100 observation hours [obsn. h]) between 1994 and 2018, of which 242 were pant grunts (6.5 instances per 100 obsn. h); 42.3% of greetings were nonaudible, such as tactile or gestural greetings. Most pant grunts were directed toward older females; females under 20 years of age were generally responsible for this trend, as they were the most frequent greeters among females and tended to perform pant grunts toward older females. Nonetheless, among females 20 years of age or older, pant grunts from an older to a younger female were not rare (37%). Compared to previous studies in Mahale, pant grunts between females were an order of magnitude less than those directed toward males. There may also be a large difference in the frequencies of female–female pant grunts across study sites, which may be attributed to differences in female gregariousness. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT: As our closest living relatives, non-human primates uniquely enable explorations of human health, disease, development, and evolution. Considerable effort has thus been devoted to generating induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from multiple non-human primate species. Here, we establish improved culture methods for chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and pig-tailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina) iPSCs. Such iPSCs spontaneously differentiate in conventional culture conditions, but can be readily propagated by inhibiting endogenous WNT signaling. As a unique functional test of these iPSCs, we injected them into the pre-implantation embryos of another non-human species, rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Ectopic expression of gene BCL2 enhances the survival and proliferation of chimpanzee and pig-tailed macaque iPSCs within the pre-implantation embryo, although the identity and long-term contribution of the transplanted cells warrants further investigation. In summary, we disclose transcriptomic and proteomic data, cell lines, and cell culture resources that may be broadly enabling for non-human primate iPSCs research. © 2022 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Infectious disease is a major concern for both wild and captive primate populations. Primate sanctuaries in Africa provide critical protection to thousands of wild-born, orphan primates confiscated from the bushmeat and pet trades. However, uncertainty about the infectious agents these individuals potentially harbor has important implications for their individual care and long-term conservation strategies. We used metagenomic next-generation sequencing to identify viruses in blood samples from chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in three sanctuaries in West, Central, and East Africa. Our goal was to evaluate whether viruses of human origin or other “atypical” or unknown viruses might infect these chimpanzees. We identified viruses from eight families: Anelloviridae, Flaviviridae, Genomoviridae, Hepadnaviridae, Parvoviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Picornaviridae, and Rhabdoviridae. The majority (15/26) of viruses identified were members of the family Anelloviridae and represent the genera Alphatorquevirus (torque teno viruses) and Betatorquevirus (torque teno mini viruses), which are common in chimpanzees and apathogenic. Of the remaining 11 viruses, 9 were typical constituents of the chimpanzee virome that have been identified in previous studies and are also thought to be apathogenic. One virus, a novel tibrovirus (Rhabdoviridae: Tibrovirus) is related to Bas-Congo virus, which was originally thought to be a human pathogen but is currently thought to be apathogenic, incidental, and vector-borne. The only virus associated with disease was rhinovirus C (Picornaviridae: Enterovirus) infecting one chimpanzee subsequent to an outbreak of respiratory illness at that sanctuary. Our results suggest that the blood-borne virome of African sanctuary chimpanzees does not differ appreciably from that of their wild counterparts, and that persistent infection with exogenous viruses may be less common than often assumed. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Calls of several species of nonhuman animals are considered to be functionally referential. However, the cognitive mechanisms underlying audience behaviors remain unclear. This study used an audiovisual cross-modal preferential-looking paradigm to examine whether captive chimpanzees spontaneously associated a conspecific call with images of a corresponding item. Chimpanzees were presented with videos of snakes and fruit side-by-side while hearing playbacks of alarm calls, food-associated calls, or no sound (as a baseline condition). Chimpanzees looked at videos of snakes for longer when hearing alarm calls compared with food calls or baseline. However, chimpanzees did not look at videos of fruit for longer when hearing food calls compared with baseline. An additional experiment tested whether chimpanzees’ gaze bias to the snake videos was driven by negative affective states in general via affect-driven attention biases. When chimpanzees were presented with the same snake and fruit videos while hearing playbacks of conspecific screams or no sound, they exhibited no gaze bias for snake videos. These results suggest that chimpanzees spontaneously associated alarm calls with images of a potential threat in a preferential-looking experiment and that this response was not simply driven by an affective state matching process. These findings should be interpreted in consideration of a procedural limitation related to pseudoreplication in the experimental stimuli. © 2021 American Psychological Association

ABSTRACT: Group territory defence poses a collective action problem: individuals can freeride, benefitingwithout payingthe costs. Individual heterogeneity has been proposed to solve such problems, as individuals high in reproductive success, rank, fighting ability or motivation may benefit from defending territories even if others free-ride. To test this hypothesis,we analysed 30 years of data fromchimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in the Kasekela community, Gombe National Park, Tanzania (1978 2007).We examinedthe extent towhichindividualparticipation in patrols varied according to correlates of reproductive success (mating rate, rank, age), fighting ability (hunting), motivation (scores from personality ratings), costs of defecting (the number of adult males in the community) and gregariousness (sighting frequency). By contrast to expectations from collective action theory, males participated in patrols at consistently high rates (mean ± s.d. = 74.5 ± 11.1% of patrols, n = 23males). The best predictors of patrol participation were sighting frequency, age and hunting participation. Current and former alpha males did not participate at a higher rate than males that never achieved alpha status. These findings suggest that the temptation to free-ride is low, and that a mutualistic mechanism such as group augmentation may better explain individual participation in group territorial behaviour. © 2022 Royal Society Publishing.

ABSTRACT: Although rare among group-living primates, infanticide by females has been reported in several chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes, populations. We examined 13 infanticidal attacks over 47 years at Gombe National Park, Tanzania to evaluate three adaptive hypotheses. (1) Exploitation of the infant as a food resource – by eating a vulnerable neonate, attackers gain calories that may be important during periods of food scarcity or energetic stress. (2) Resource competition – Gombe females concentrate their foraging in overlapping core areas and dominance rank influences foraging success. By killing the infant of a female with high core area overlap, the perpetrator removes a current and future competitor, improving her access to food. (3) Low cost – female chimpanzees mature and reproduce slowly, and longevity increases reproductive success. Physical aggression causes risk of severe injury or death, so females will only mount attacks when risks to the perpetrator are low. In support of hypothesis 1, females usually consumed the carcass. However, attacks were not more likely in times of resource or energy scarcity. In support of hypothesis 2, females attacked others with whom they shared core areas, but attacks did not cause shifts in ranging patterns. In support of hypothesis 3, one or more attackers always outranked the victim, the attacks often involved coalitions and victims usually lacked kin support. Attacks were more likely to be successful when attackers were not hindered by clinging infants and victims could not retreat. Our results provide further evidence for female competition and the adaptive value of female-led infanticide in this species. © 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees used as pets and in the entertainment industry endure detrimental living conditions from early infancy onwards. The preferred option for ending their existence as pet or circus chimpanzees is their rescue and transfer to a primate sanctuary that will provide them with optimal living and social conditions, so that they can thrive. In this case study, we had the rare opportunity to compare the activity budgets of three chimpanzees from their time as pets in 2004 to their time living at the MONA sanctuary in 2020, after almost a decade in the centre. We found their behaviour patterns changed in accordance with the sanctuaries’ rehabilitation objectives. Resting periods increased considerably while vigilance simultaneously declined sharply. Moreover, the chimpanzees’ social competence increased as allogrooming became the predominant social behaviour, and agonistic interactions diminished even though they were living within a larger social group at the sanctuary. All three chimpanzees expanded their allogrooming and proximity networks at the sanctuary, which included new group members, but they maintained the closest relationships to those conspecifics who they were rescued with. In conclusion, these findings suggest that the sanctuary environment and social group setting made it possible for these three chimpanzees to improve their social competence and increase their well-being over time. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Behavioural diversity may serve as a positive indicator of animal welfare that can be applied in long-term monitoring schemes in managed settings (eg zoos, laboratories, farms). Behavioural diversity is often higher when animals live in stimulating environments and experience positive events. Unfortunately, welfare researchers have not adopted consistent, standardised approaches to measuring behavioural diversity.The goal of this exploratory study was to utilise data from 41 adult chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) housed across 16 zoological institutions to examine various models of Shannon's Diversity Index. Specifically, we investigated the impact of: combining versus splitting behaviours, including only positive behaviours, including human interaction, and considering recipient behaviours. We evaluate how the inclusion or exclusion of different behaviours impacts the relationship of behavioural diversity with: (i) concentrations of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (GCM), a common indicator of adrenal activity; (ii) concentrations of immunoglobulin-A (IgA), an indicator of immune function and potential indicator of positive welfare; and (iii) stereotypic behaviour, a validated indicator of poor welfare. Most indices had significant negative relationships with faecal GCM. Animals that express a variety of behaviours from their species-typical repertoire have lower average faecal GCM concentrations and are likely experiencing better welfare.We did not find significant relationships between the behavioural diversity indices and IgA concentrations.Two indices were inversely associated with stereotypic behaviour. Our findings provide additional support for using Shannon's Diversity Index to calculate behavioural diversity as a robust, valid measure of positive welfare. However, future publications must justify the process for including or excluding behaviours from calculations. © 2021 Universities Federation for AnimalWelfare The Old School, Brewhouse Hill,Wheathampstead, Hertfordshire AL4 8AN, UK

ABSTRACT: Humans walk with an upright posture on extended limbs during stance and with a double-peaked vertical ground reaction force. Our closest living relatives, chimpanzees, are facultative bipeds that walk with a crouched posture on flexed, abducted hind limbs and with a single-peaked vertical ground reaction force. Differences in human and bipedal chimpanzee three-dimensional (3D) kinematics have been well quantified, yet it is unclear what the independent effects of using a crouched posture are on 3D gait mechanics for humans, and how they compare with chimpanzees. Understanding the relationships between posture and gait mechanics, with known differences in morphology between species, can help researchers better interpret the effects of trait evolution on bipedal walking. We quantified pelvis and lower limb 3D kinematics and ground reaction forces as humans adopted a series of upright and crouched postures and compared them with data from bipedal chimpanzee walking. Human crouched-posture gait mechanics were more similar to that of bipedal chimpanzee gait than to normal human walking, especially in sagittal plane hip and knee angles. However, there were persistent differences between species, as humans walked with less transverse plane pelvis rotation, less hip abduction, and greater peak anterior–posterior ground reaction force in late stance than chimpanzees. Our results suggest that human crouched-posture walking reproduces only a small subset of the characteristics of 3D kinematics and ground reaction forces of chimpanzee walking, with the remaining differences likely due to the distinct musculoskeletal morphologies of humans and chimpanzees. © 2022.

ABSTRACT: Facial orientation (projection and degree of prognathism) and form in hominins is highly variable, likely related to evolutionary modifications of the microscopic process of bone modeling (the simultaneous cellular activities of bone formation and resorption) during ontogeny. However, in anteriorly projected faces such as those of early hominins, little is known about the link between bone modeling and facial developmental patterns. Similarly, these aspects have been infrequently investigated in extant great apes. In this study, quantitative methods were applied to a cross-sectional ontogenetic sample of 33 chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) and 59 modern humans (Homo sapiens) to compare the development of maxillary prognathism to orthognathism at both microscopic and macroscopic (or morphological) scales using surface histology and geometric morphometric techniques. Chimpanzees express on average lower amounts of bone resorption than humans on the maxillary periosteum throughout ontogeny; however, the premaxilla is consistently resorbed from early stages on. The presence of bone resorption in the chimpanzee premaxilla, such as that seen in some early hominins, suggests a more ape-like pattern of maxillary bone modeling in these specimens. However, this shows that similarities in bone modeling patterns can lead to variations in shape, suggesting that other aspects of facial growth (such as modifications of rates and timings of development, as well as sutural growth) also played a crucial role in facial evolution. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) have a complex mating system in which both sexes use multiple tactics. Most copulations occur in group contexts, and high-ranking males can gain high mating and reproductive success, but females typically mate with multiple males and the potential for sperm competition is high. Also, male-female dyads sometimes form temporary exclusive mating associations (consortships). Male aggression to receptive females is common. Several studies have supported the hypothesis that this is sexual coercion, but debate exists regarding the importance of coercion relative to that of female choice. The number of adult males in a community can influence the balance between these processes. In the large Ngogo community, male dominance ranks and rates of aggression to fully-swollen females were positively related to mating success as estimated by copulation rates and by proportions of copulations achieved. Aggression rates were higher than at other sites, overall and per male, especially during periovulatory periods, and increased with the number of males associating with a female. Aggression impaired female foraging efficiency. Males initiated most copulations and females rarely refused mating attempts. Male-to-female grooming was positively associated with male mating success and with the proportion of copulations that females initiated, but the amount of grooming was typically small and whether grooming-for-mating trading occurs is uncertain. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that sexual coercion is an important component of male chimpanzee mating strategies in many sociodemographic circumstances, but also show that male tactics vary both in response to and independently of those circumstances. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC

ABSTRACT: Artificial termite‐fishing tasks are a common enrichment for captive great apes, promoting species‐typical behaviors. Nonetheless, whether these activities are linked to changes in other behaviors and whether these changes persist over time has seldom been investigated. We assessed whether the use of an artificial termite‐fishing task was linked to changes in the solitary behavior and social dynamics in two groups of sanctuary‐housed chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Specifically, we compared chimpanzee behavior during eight enrichment sessions distributed over a two‐month period, with similar periods before and after the introduction of the enrichment. Data were collected from combined interval and continuous sampling methods and were analyzed using generalized linear mixed models. We found that participation increased across sessions and that both enrichment and participation predicted an increase in tool use and feeding and a decrease in inactivity, which were all maintained throughout the sessions. Furthermore, participation was positively associated with social proximity, revealing a gathering effect of the task. However, neither enrichment nor participation were linked to changes in abnormal, self-directed, affiliation‐related or aggression‐related behaviors. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that artificial termite‐fishing is a suitable enrichment for captive chimpanzees, maintaining the subjects’ interest and promoting species‐typical behaviors, with no negative effects on social activities. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Adenovirus vectored vaccines have entered global use during the COVID-19 pandemic, and are in development for multiple other human and veterinary applications. An attraction of the technology is the suitability of the vaccines for storage at 2–8◦C for months. Widely used COVID-19 vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (University of Oxford/AstraZeneca) is based on a species E simian adenovirus. Species E simian serotypes have been used in a wide range of other development programs, but the stability of such vectors has not been extensively described in the peer-reviewed literature. Here, we explore the stability of two candidate vaccines based on two species E serotypes: a Rift Valley fever vaccine based upon the ChAdOx1 vector (Y25 serotype) used in ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, and a rabies vaccine based upon a ChAdOx2 vector (AdC68 serotype). We describe each vector’s stability in liquid and lyophilised formulations using in vitro and in vivo potency measurements. Our data support the suitability of liquid formulations of these vectors for storage at 2–8◦C for up to 1 year, and potentially for nonrefrigerated storage for a brief period during last-leg distribution (perhaps 1–3 days at 20◦C—the precise definition of acceptable last-leg storage conditions would require further product-specific data). Depending upon the level of inprocess potency loss that is economically acceptable, and the level of instorage loss that is compatible with maintenance of acceptable end-of-storage potency, a previously reported lyophilised formulation may enable longer term storage at 20◦C or storage for a number of days at 30◦C. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The efficacy of many coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines has been shown to decrease to varying extents against new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 variants, which are responsible for the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. Combining intramuscular and intranasal vaccination routes is a promising approach for achieving more potent immune responses. We evaluated the immunogenicity of prime-boost protocols with a chimpanzee adenovirus serotype 68 vector-based vaccine, ChAdTS-S, administered via both intranasal and intramuscular routes in BALB/c mice. Intramuscular priming followed by an intranasal booster elicited the highest levels of IgG, IgA, and pseudovirus neutralizing antibody titres among all the protocols tested at day 42 after prime immunization compared with the intranasal priming/intramuscular booster and prime-boost protocols using only one route. In addition, intramuscular priming followed by an intranasal booster induced high T-cell responses, measured using the IFN-γ ELISpot assay, that were similar to those observed upon intramuscular vaccination. All ChAdTS-S vaccination groups induced Th1-skewing of the T-cell response according to intracellular cytokine staining and Meso Scale Discovery cytokine profiling assays on day 56 after priming. This study provides reference data for assessing vaccination schemes of adenovirus-based COVID-19 vaccines with high immune efficacy. © 2022 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Numerical chromosomal aberrations in sperm are considered to be a major factor in infertility, early pregnancy loss and syndromes with developmental and cognitive disabilities in mammals, including primates. Despite numerous studies in human and farm animals, the incidence and importance of sperm aneuploidies in non-human primate remains mostly undetermined. Here we investigated the incidence and distribution of sperm aneuploidy in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), the species closest to human. We identify evolutionary conserved DNA sequences in human and chimpanzee and selected homologous sub-telomeric regions for all chromosomes to build custom probes and perform sperm-FISH analysis on more than 10,000 sperm nuclei per chromosome. Chimpanzee mean autosomal disomy rate was 0.057 ± 0.02%, gonosomes disomy rate was 0.198% and the total disomy rate was 1.497%. The proportion of X or Y gametes was respectively 49.94% and 50.06% for a ratio of 1.002 and diploidy rate was 0.053%. Our data provide for the first time an overview of aneuploidy in non-human primate sperm and shed new insights into the issues of aneuploidy origins and mechanisms. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The distal femoral metaphyseal surface presents dramatically different morphologies in juvenile extant hominoids - humans have relatively flat metaphyseal surfaces when compared with the more complex metaphyseal surfaces of apes. It has long been speculated that these different morphologies reflect different biomechanical demands placed on the growth plate during locomotor behaviour, with the more complex metaphyseal surfaces of apes acting to protect the growth plate during flexed-knee behaviours like squatting and climbing. To test this hypothesis, we built subject-specific parametric finite-element models from the surface scans of the femora of five Pan and six Homo juveniles. We then simulated the loading conditions of either a straight-leg or flexed-knee gait and measured the resulting stresses at the growth plate. When subjected to the simulated flexed-knee loading conditions, both the maximum and mean von Mises stresses were significantly lower in the Pan models than in the Homo models. Further, during these loading conditions, von Mises stresses were strongly negatively correlated with ariaDNE, a measure of complexity of the metaphyseal surface. These results indicate that metaphyseal surface morphology has a robust effect on growth plate mechanics. © 2021 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Judgements of wrongdoing in humans often hinge upon an assessment of whether a perpetrator acted out of free choice: whether they had more than one option. The classic inhibitors of free choice are constraint (e.g. having your hands tied together) and ignorance (e.g. being unaware that an alternative exists). Here, across two studies, we investigate whether chimpanzees consider these factors in their evaluation of social action. Chimpanzees interacted with a human experimenter who handed them a non-preferred item of food, either because they were physically constrained from accessing the preferred item (Experiment 1) or because they were ignorant of the availability of the preferred item (Experiment 2). We found that chimpanzees were more likely to accept the non-preferred food and showed fewer negative emotional responses when the experimenter was physically constrained compared with when they had free choice. We did not, however, find an effect of ignorance on chimpanzee's evaluation. Freedom of choice factors into chimpanzees' evaluation of how they are treated, but it is unclear whether mental state reasoning is involved in this assessment.  © 2022 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Physicochemical tests represent important tools for the analytical control strategy of biotherapeutics. For adenoviral modalities, anion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography (AEX-HPLC) represents an important methodology, as it is able to simultaneously provide information on viral particle concentration, product purity and surface charge in a high-throughput manner. During product development of an adenoviral-based therapeutic, an accelerated stability study was performed and showed changes in each of the AEX-HPLC reportable attributes. These changes also correlated with a decrease in product infectivity prompting a detailed characterization of the impurity and mechanism of the surface charge change. Characterization experiments identified the impurity to be free hexon trimer, suggesting that capsid degradation could be contributing to both the impurity and reduced particle concentration. Additional mass spectrometry characterization identified deamidation of specific hexon residues to be associated with the external surface charge modification observed upon thermal stress conditions. To demonstrate a causal relationship between deamidation and surface charge changes observed by AEX-HPLC, site-directed mutagenesis experiments were performed. Through this effort, it was concluded that deamidation of asparagine 414 was responsible for the surface charge alteration observed in the AEX-HPLC profile but was not associated with the reduction in infectivity. Overall, this manuscript details critical characterization efforts conducted to enable understanding of a pivotal physicochemical test for adenoviral based therapeutics.

ABSTRACT: Giardia duodenalis is one of the most common intestinal parasites of humans, with a worldwide distribution. Giardia duodenalis has been reported in both wild and captive populations of non-human primates, namely chimpanzees. In this study we investigated an entire troop of clinically healthy chimpanzees (n = 21) for the presence of G. duodenalis and its association with faecal microbiota profile. Faecal samples (n = 26) were collected from the chimpanzee exhibit from a zoo in Sydney, Australia. Diagnosis of G. duodenalis was made using a Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) as a point-of-care-test and compared to a reference standard real-time PCR test. Approximately half of the chimpanzee faecal samples tested positive for G. duodenalis by both RAT (13/26, 50%) and real-time PCR (14/26, 53.85%). The RAT sensitivity was 85.7% (95% CI: 63.8%–96%) and specificity was 91.7% (95% CI: 68.3%–99%) when compared to the in-house real-time PCR. Genotyping of the samples revealed the presence of zoonotic assemblage B. Microscopic analysis revealed the presence of Troglodytella spp. (14/26), Balantioides sp. (syn. Balantidium sp.) (8/26) as well as Entamoeba spp. (3/26). Microbiota profile based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that the community was significantly different between G. duodenalis positive and negative samples if RAT results were taken into an account, but not real-time PCR diagnostics results. Proteobacteria and Chloroflexi were the significant features in the dataset that separated G. duodenalis positive and negative samples using LEfSe analysis. Being able to rapidly test for G. duodenalis in captive populations of primates assists in point-of-care diagnostics and may better identify animals with subclinical disease. Under the investigated conditions of the zoo setting, however, presence of G. duodenalis either detected by RAT or real-time PCR was not associated with clinically apparent disease in captive chimpanzees. © 2022 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Intercommunity competition in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) has been widely studied in eastern (P. t. schweinfurthii) and western (P. t. verus) communities. Both subspecies show hostility towards neighboring communities but differ in rates of lethal attacks and female involvement. However, relatively little is known about the territorial behavior of the two other subspecies, central (P. t. troglodytes) and Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzees (P. t. ellioti). Here, we present the first insights into intercommunity interactions of individuals of a community of central chimpanzees living in the Loango National Park in Gabon. The presence of individuals of neighboring communities in the Rekambo home range was assessed using 27 camera traps. Information was compiled on intergroup interactions recorded before (2005–2016) and after (January 2017–June 2019) the habituation of the community. Individuals from neighboring communities entered the core area, where nine out of 16 recorded intercommunity encounters occurred. Males were the main participants in territorial patrols and intercommunity aggressions. Females were part of all six territorial patrols recorded and dependent offspring participated in five patrols. Females were involved in intercommunity aggression in five out of twelve recorded encounters in which there was visual contact between communities. While the intercommunity encounter rate was lower than that reported across most other long-term chimpanzee sites, the annual intercommunity killing rate was among the highest. These results suggest that the frequency of lethal attacks at Loango is comparable to that reported for the eastern subspecies. In contrast, female involvement in intercommunity interactions mirrors that of the western subspecies. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees are knuckle walkers, with forelimbs contacting the ground by the dorsum of the finger's middle phalanges. As these muscular apes are given to high-velocity motions, the question arises of how the ground reaction forces are buffered so that no damage ensues in the load-bearing fingers. In the literature, it was hypothesized that the finger flexors help buffer impacts because in knuckle stance the metacarpophalangeal joints (MCPJs) are strongly hyperextended, which would elongate the finger flexors. This stretching of the finger flexor muscle-tendon units would absorb impact energy. However, EMG studies did not report significant finger flexor activity in knuckle walking. Although these data by themselves question the finger flexor impact buffering hypothesis, the present study aimed to critically investigate the hypothesis from a biomechanical point of view. Therefore, various aspects of knuckle walking were modeled and the finger flexor tendon displacements in the load-bearing fingers were measured in a chimpanzee cadaver hand, of which also an MRI was taken in knuckle stance. The biomechanics do not support the finger flexor impact buffering hypothesis. In knuckle walking, the finger flexors are not elongated to lengths where passive strain forces would become important. Impact buffering by large flexion moments at the MCPJs from active finger flexors would result in impacts at the knuckles themselves, which is dysfunctional for various biomechanical reasons and does not occur in real knuckle walking. In conclusion, the current biomechanical analysis in accumulation of previous EMG findings suggests that finger flexors play no role in impact buffering in knuckle walking. © 2021 Company of Biologists Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Wildlife is increasingly exposed to environmental pollution, but data illustrating to what extent this exposure can impact health and survival of endangered species is missing. In humans, hair matrix analysis is a reliable tool for assessing cumulative exposure to organic pollutants such as pesticides but has rarely been used in other primates for this purpose. LC/MS-MS and GC/MS-MS multi-residue methods were used to screen the presence of 152 organic pollutants and their metabolites belonging to 21 different chemical families in hair samples from our closest relative, the chimpanzee. Samples were collected from 20 wild chimpanzees in Sebitoli, Kibale National Park, Uganda and 9 captive chimpanzees in the Réserve Africaine de Sigean, France. In total, 90 chemicals were detected, 60 in wild chimpanzees and 79 in captive chimpanzees. The median concentrations of detected chemicals in captive individuals were significantly higher than those in wild chimpanzees. Hair from the captive individuals at RAS was sampled a second time after 6 months in an environment of reduced exposure to these pollutants (diet of organic food, decreased use of plastic food and water containers). The number of chemicals detected in captive chimpanzees reduced from 79 to 63, and their concentrations were also significantly reduced. In the present study we report for the first time the use of hair analysis to detect organic pollutants in primate hair. We conclude that both wild and captive chimpanzees are exposed to a large range of different chemicals through their diet. Our study provides surprising and alarming evidence that besides the direct threats of poaching, deforestation and diseases, wild chimpanzees might be endangered by indirect consequences of anthropic activities. As chimpanzees are our closest relatives, our results should be considered as an alert for human health as well. © 2022 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Viral infection is a major cause of ill health in wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), but most evidence to date has come from conspicuous disease outbreaks with high morbidity and mortality. To examine the relationship between viral infection and ill health during periods not associated with disease outbreaks, we conducted a longitudinal study of wild eastern chimpanzees (P. t. schweinfurthii) in the Kanyawara and Ngogo communities of Kibale National Park, Uganda. We collected standardized, observational health data for 4 years and then used metagenomics to characterize gastrointestinal viromes (i.e., all viruses recovered from fecal samples) in individual chimpanzees before and during episodes of clinical disease. We restricted our analyses to viruses thought to infect mammals or primarily associated with mammals, discarding viruses associated with nonmammalian hosts. We found 18 viruses (nine of which were previously identified in this population) from at least five viral families. Viral richness (number of viruses per sample) did not vary by health status. By contrast, total viral load (normalized proportion of sequences mapping to viruses) was significantly higher in ill individuals compared with healthy individuals. Furthermore, when ill, Kanyawara chimpanzees exhibited higher viral loads than Ngogo chimpanzees, and males, but not females, exhibited higher infection rates with certain viruses and higher total viral loads as they aged. Post-hoc analyses, including the use of a machine-learning classification method, indicated that one virus, salivirus (Picornaviridae), was the main contributor to health-related and community-level variation in viral loads. Another virus, chimpanzee stool-associated virus (chisavirus; unclassified Picornavirales), was associated with ill health at Ngogo but not at Kanyawara. Chisavirus, chimpanzee adenovirus (Adenoviridae), and bufavirus (Parvoviridae) were also associated with increased age in males. Associations with sex and age are consistent with the hypothesis that nonlethal viral infections cumulatively reflect or contribute to senescence in long-lived species such as chimpanzees. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Maternal lactational investment can affect female reproductive rates and offspring survival in mammals and can be biased towards infants of one sex. We compared estimates of lactation effort among mothers, assessed as their potential milk contribution to age-specific infant diets (mother-infant differences in fecal stable nitrogen isotopes, δ15N), to the timing of weaning (infant age at last nursing bout) and to maternal inter-birth interval lengths for male and female infant chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) at Ngogo, Uganda. Infant males had greater proportions of milk in their age-specific diets, indicated by higher mother-infant differences in δ15N (Generalized Estimating Equation, GEE: p < 0.01). This may mean that mothers of sons showed greater lactation effort than mothers of daughters. Infant males stopped nursing at older ages than infant females (Kaplan–Meier product limit estimate, Breslow estimator: p < 0.05). Mothers of sons showed longer interbirth intervals than mothers of daughters (GEE: p < 0.01). All three measures indicated maternal lactational investment was higher for sons. Male infants may cost mothers more to ensure infant survival than female infants because males are more vulnerable and/or because maternal genetic returns on investment are greater for sons than daughters, as male philopatry means that chimpanzee mothers can have more influence on the reproductive success of sons. Chimpanzee females may trade off growth-related benefits of high lactational investment in male offspring against reduced reproductive rates. Significance statement: Maternal investment via lactation affects the reproductive success of female mammals and their offspring and can be biased towards infants of one sex. We investigated lactational variation among wild chimpanzees in relation to infant sex using three proxies for maternal lactational investment: fecal stable nitrogen isotopes, a physiological biomarker that may provide an estimate of lactation effort; observations of nursing, which we used to establish weaning ages; and the lengths of intervals between births of surviving infants. Chimpanzee mothers biased lactational investment toward sons on all three indicators and showed reduced fecundity due to longer inter-birth intervals for mothers of sons than for mothers of daughters. These results would be expected if greater maternal investment toward sons leads to better condition and higher reproductive success for sons later in life, thus to greater inclusive fitness for mothers. © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The western chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus), a subspecies of the common chimpanzee, is currently listed as Critically Endangered. Human-driven habitat loss and infectious diseases are causing dramatic chimpanzee population declines and range contractions that are bringing these primates to the brink of extinction. Little information is currently available on the occurrence of diarrhoea-causing enteric protist species in chimpanzees in general, and in western chimpanzees in particular, or on the role of humans as a potential source of these infections. In this prospective molecular epidemiological study, we investigated the presence, genetic variability, and zoonotic potential of enteric protists in faecal samples from western chimpanzees (n = 124) and humans (n = 9) in Comoé National Park, Côte d'Ivoire. Parasite detection and genotyping were conducted by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Sanger sequencing. The protist species found in the chimpanzee samples were Entamoeba dispar (14.5%), Blastocystis sp. (11.3%), Giardia duodenalis (5.8%), Troglodytella abrassarti (2.5%) and Cryptosporidium hominis (0.8%). The protist species found in the human samples were G. duodenalis (22.2%) and Blastocystis sp. (11.1%). Entamoeba histolytica, Enterocytozoon bieneusi, and Balantioides coli were undetected in both chimpanzee and human samples. Sequence analyses revealed the presence of Blastocystis subtype (ST) 1 (alleles 4 and 8) and ST3 (allele 24) in chimpanzees, and ST3 (allele 52) in humans. ST1 allele 8 represents a chimpanzee-adapted Blastocystis genetic variant. Cross-species transmission of pathogenic enteric protists between chimpanzees and humans might be possible in Comoé National Park, although the frequency and extent of zoonotic events remain to be fully elucidated. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Japan Monkey Centre.

ABSTRACT: Background. Patterns of vocal communication have implications for species conservation: A change in calling behaviour can, for instance, reflect a disturbed habitat. More importantly, call rate is a parameter that allows conservation planners to convert call density into animal density, when detecting calls with a passive acoustic monitoring system (PAM). Methods. We investigated chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) call rate during the late dry season in the Issa Valley, western Tanzania by conducting focal follows. We examined the socio-ecological factors that influence call production rate of savanna woodland chimpanzees. Results. We found that sex, proportion of time spent in a vegetation type, proportion of time spent travelling, time of the day, party size and swollen parous female presence had a significant effect on the call rate. Call rate differed among the different demographic classes with subadult and adult males vocalising twice as often as the subadult and adult females and three times as often as the juveniles. Applications. The use of PAM and recent statistical developments to estimate animal density is promising but relies on our knowing individual call rate, often not available for many species. With the improvement in automatic call detection, we anticipate that PAM will increasingly be broadly applied to primates but also across taxa, for conservation. © 2021 PeerJ Inc..

ABSTRACT: Caring for others is a key feature of human behavior. Mothers, fathers, siblings, grandparents, and other group members provide care in the form of provisioning, protection, and first aid. To what extent is other-regarding behavior present in our primate relatives? Here we describe an unusual incident of other-regarding behavior toward an injured juvenile female chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) at Ngogo in Kibale National Park, Uganda. After the juvenile received a mild head wound from an adult female, several adolescent and juvenile chimpanzees gathered to touch, lick, and peer at the wound. One adolescent male wiped a leaf across the cut. Another adolescent male later groomed the injured female and briefly carried her. Across a 5-year period, we observed only three other instances of other-directed wound care in chimpanzees, occurring in 4% (4/100) of cases in which we observed individuals with fresh wounds, and 57 other instances of allomaternal carrying. Despite the infrequency of such behaviors, our study adds another chimpanzee field site to the list of those where other-directed wound care has been observed. Observations from wild chimpanzees provide insight into empathy and may inform our understanding of the evolution of other-regarding behavior in humans. © 2021, Japan Monkey Centre.

ABSTRACT: Abnormal behaviour in captive animals is both pervasive and ambiguous. Although individual differences are central to the field of animal welfare, studies on abnormal behaviour predominantly employ quantitative, population-level approaches. For example, whereas previous studies on chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) abnormal behaviour have reported significant variation between groups or individuals in the quantity (eg frequency and duration) of abnormal behaviour, much less is known about qualitative differences. Individual abnormal behavioural repertoires may be highly idiosyncratic, where certain behaviours are over-represented (ie individually specific abnormal behavioural ‘signatures’).The present study investigated qualitative individual variation in the abnormal behaviour of chimpanzees (n = 15) housed at Royal Burgers’ Zoo in Arnhem,The Netherlands. Substantial variation was found between individuals in the diversity (size and evenness) and overall composition of their abnormal behavioural repertoires. Factors including age, sex, and rank did not significantly account for dissimilarity of individuals’ abnormal behavioural repertoires, but kin dyads showed more similar abnormal behaviour than non-kin dyads. Further exploratory analyses examined whether individual variation in one abnormal behaviour (coprophagy) predicted variation in stress-related behaviour (self-scratching). This allowed us to tentatively conclude that there were also individual differences in the link between a given abnormal behaviour and the behavioural expression of stress. Qualitative individual variation in abnormal behaviour provides a novel angle to a literature traditionally focused on quantifying abnormal behaviour at the group- or species-level and may thus represent an important yet previously overlooked source of variation in the extent to which abnormal behaviour reflects the state of individual welfare. © 2022 Universities Federation for AnimalWelfare

ABSTRACT: Great ape manual gestures are described as communicative, flexible, intentional, and goal-oriented. These gestures are thought to be an evolutionary pre-cursor to human language. Conversely, facial expressions are thought to be inflexible, automatic, and derived from emotion. However, great apes can make a wide range of movements with their faces, and they may possess the control needed to gesture with their faces as well as their hands. We examined whether chimpanzee facial expressions possess the four important gesture properties and how they compare to manual gestures. To do this, we quantified variables that have been previously described through largely qualitative means. Chimpanzee facial expressions met all four gesture criteria and performed remarkably similar to manual gestures. Facial gestures have implications for the evolution of language. If other mammals also show facial gestures, then the gestural origins of language may be much older than the human/great ape lineage. © 2021 PeerJ Inc.. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Studying hand preferences in chimpanzees can provide insights into the evolutionary origins of human hemispheric specialization. Research on chimpanzee hand preference requires careful examination of important factors such as between-task consistency, temporal stability and posture although few studies have investigated all of these factors in combination. We investigated hand preference in simple reach and fishing behaviours in a group of 19 chimpanzees at Chester Zoo in the UK. Simple reach was defined as extending a hand to grasp a small object, then flexing the limb in a continuous motion, and was examined in quadrupedal, sitting and climbing postures. Fish in hole was defined as inserting a stick into a hole in the wall with one hand and then extracting it with the same hand. Between-task consistency of hand preference was assessed by comparing simple reach and fish in hole, while temporal stability was assessed by comparing simple reach from two points in time: 2017 and 2019. The data showed no significant influence of posture on the strength of hand preference, which contrasts with previous research. The findings of this study show temporal stability in simple reach, although only partial between-task consistency. Overall, the results indicate that simple reach elicits laterality at the individual level and is consistent across postures and stable over time, which is consistent with the literature. These results suggest that posture stability may be important in affecting hand preference. Further, whilst there was overall stability in hand preference across time periods, some individuals changed their preferred hand, suggesting there may be individual-level temporal instability of hand preference for certain tasks. © 2021 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Detailed, long-term datasets on the life histories of long-lived species such as great apes are necessary to understand their survival patterns but are relatively rare. Such information requires prolonged and consistent record-keeping over many generations, so for chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), this equates to many decades of input. As life history variables can be altered by differences in environmental influences (whether natural or artificial), there is substantial value to being able to compare across populations. Here, we present the first comparative analysis of life history data for two ex situ chimpanzee populations residing in North America (1975-2020; n = 730) and Japan (1980-2020; n = 660). Overall, survival patterns were similar between regions, and the median life expectancy from birth is estimated at 35.7 (95% CI = [32.4-40.0]) years for females and 30.1 (27.3-34.3) years for males across both populations. Females who survive to their first birthday are estimated to survive 42.4 (40.0-46.3) years and males 35.5 (32.6-38.0) years. We found that birth type (wild-born or captive-born) did not influence survival patterns in either population, but there were differential effects of sex on longevity. In the America population, males had higher mortality rates than females, whereas in the Japan population we found no differences between the sexes. First year mortality did not differ between populations for males (18-20%), but for females it was lower in America (15%) compared to Japan (25%). Survival patterns of chimpanzees in the present study will be useful for future investigation into potential causes of regional differences and cross-species comparisons.

ABSTRACT: A growing body of observational and experimental data in nonhuman primates has highlighted the presence of rudimentary call combinations within the vocal communication system of monkeys. Such evidence suggests the ability to combine meaning-bearing units into larger structures, a key feature of language also known as syntax, could have its origins rooted within the primate lineage. However, the evolutionary progression of this trait remains ambiguous as evidence for similar combinations in great apes, our closest-living relatives, is sparse and incomplete. In this study, we aimed to bridge this gap by analysing the combinatorial properties of the pant hoot–food call combination in our closest-living relative, the chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes. To systematically investigate the syntactic-like potential of this structure, we adopted three levels of analysis. First, we applied collocation analyses, methods traditionally used in language sciences, to confirm the combination of pant hoots with food calls was not a random co-occurrence, but instead a consistently produced structure. Second, using acoustic analyses, we confirmed pant hoots and food calls comprising the combination were acoustically indistinguishable from the same calls produced in isolation, indicating the pant hoot–food call combination is composed of individually occurring meaning-bearing units, a key criterion of linguistic syntax. Finally, we investigated the context-specific nature of this structure, demonstrating that the call combination was more likely to be produced when feeding on larger patches and when a high-ranking individual joined the feeding party. Together our results converge to provide support for the systematic combination of calls in chimpanzees. We highlight that playback experiments are vital to robustly disentangle both the function this combination might serve and the similarities with combinations of meaning-bearing units (i.e. syntax) in language. © 2021 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Among the growing list of novel tools with which to assess animal welfare is the use of thermal (infrared) imaging. The technology has already been utilized to identify emotional arousal in several nonhuman primate species, though most of these approaches have necessitated the use of relatively controlled settings. Here, we were interested to determine the feasibility of such techniques in a sanctuary setting in which chimpanzees were unrestrained and able to move freely around their enclosures. Furthermore, we sought to evaluate how such thermal images could be paired with corresponding long-term behavioral data and contribute to a multifactorial welfare monitoring system. Over a 6-month period, we simultaneously collected both behavioral and thermographic data on 29 chimpanzees living in four social groups. While we took a thermal image with every behavioral data point, we found that only a small proportion (6.38%) of the thermal images we captured were of sufficient quality to analyze. Most of these usable thermal images (55%) corresponded with a behavioral observation scored as “inactive,” and thus other, less frequent behaviors are not so well represented in our final data set. From our data set, we were able to determine that nasal temperatures were relatively lower when chimpanzees were categorized in active behaviors compared to inactive behaviors, providing some validity measures to our approach. While there are other potential applications for thermal imaging in the behavioral management of chimpanzees, managers should consider the practical limitations of developing long-term welfare monitoring programs that rely on thermographic data. © 2021, Japan Monkey Centre.

ABSTRACT: Global biodiversity loss is occurring at an alarming rate, with a growing consensus that we are entering a sixth mass extinction. Rapid human development and associated habitat loss, principally through agriculture, infrastructure and extractive industries, is a significant contributor. The critically endangered western chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) is at the nexus of the development-habitat loss conflict with 83% of the subspecies occurring outside protected areas. To protect its habitat, robust regulation of large-scale development, in particular through Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) procedures that adequately incorporate the Mitigation Hierarchy Principles (MHPs), is required. We developed a framework to review EIA and related legislation in all eight western chimpanzee range countries and assessed how well they incorporate MHPs, focusing specifically on mining activity. Costa Rica was selected as a benchmark of good practice, based on the recognised quality of its biodiversity laws. Overall performance of the eight countries fell substantially below that of Costa Rica. Whilst isolated good examples were identified, the overall approach legislates for broad concepts but fails to deliver on detailed provisions. As recommended by the current regional action plan for the conservation of western chimpanzees, all countries would benefit from urgent legislative reform to better incorporate MHPs within EIA procedures. This study provides recommendations in that regard together with a replicable tool for assessing EIA legislation in other jurisdictions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Wild chimpanzee populations in West Africa (Pan troglodytes verus) have dramatically decreased as a direct consequence of anthropogenic activities and infectious diseases. Little information is currently available on the epidemiology, pathogenic significance, and zoonotic potential of protist species in wild chimpanzees. This study investigates the occurrence and genetic diversity of intestinal and blood protists as well as filariae in faecal samples (n = 234) from wild chimpanzees in the Dindefelo Community Nature Reserve, Senegal. PCR‐based results revealed the presence of intestinal potential pathogens (Sarcocystis spp.: 11.5%; Giardia duodenalis: 2.1%; Cryptosporidium hominis: 0.9%), protist of uncertain pathogenicity (Blastocystis sp.: 5.6%), and commensal species (Entamoeba dispar: 18.4%; Troglodytella abrassarti: 5.6%). Entamoeba histolytica, Enterocytozoon bieneusi, and Balantioides coli were undetected. Blood protists including Plasmodium malariae (0.4%), Trypanosoma brucei (1.3%), and Mansonella perstans (9.8%) were also identified. Sanger sequencing analyses revealed host‐adapted genetic variants within Blastocystis, but other parasitic pathogens (C. hominis, P. malariae, T. brucei, M. perstans) have zoonotic potential, suggesting that cross‐species transmission between wild chimpanzees and humans is possible in areas where both species overlap. Additionally, we explored potential interactions between intestinal/blood protist species and seasonality and climate variables. Chimpanzees seem to play a more complex role on the epidemiology of pathogenic and commensal protist and nematode species than initially anticipated. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Food-associated calls have received much research attention due to their potential to refer to discovered food in a word-like manner. Studies have found that in many species, food-associated calls attract receivers to the food patch, suggesting these calls play roles in food sharing, cooperation and competition. Additionally, in various species, these calls play a role that has received much less attention: mediating social interactions among foragers that are already nearby or within the food patch, independently of whether they attract outside foragers. In order to increase understanding of the function of the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) food-associated rough grunt, we conducted captive playback studies testing whether rough grunt playbacks attract, repel or have no effect on the proximity of foragers already familiarized with the presence of food. We tested how acoustic playbacks of rough grunts (or control calls) from one of two known, identical feeding sites affected receivers’ approach and feeding behaviors. More often than expected, participants first approached the feeding site from which rough grunts, but not control calls, were broadcast. However, neither condition increased the likelihood that participants fed first from a given site. Our results support the hypothesis that rough grunts elicit an approach response in receivers, while providing no evidence that they repel. In addition, our study provides evidence that receivers may approach rough grunts even if they do not intend to feed. We discuss the information rough grunts may convey to receivers beyond information about discovered food and the potential benefits signalers may gain from this calling behavior. © 2021, Japan Monkey Centre.

ABSTRACT: The corpus callosum (CC) is the major white matter tract connecting the left and right cerebral hemispheres. It has been hypothesized that individual variation in CC morphology is negatively associated with forebrain volume (FBV) and this accounts for variation in behavioral and brain asymmetries as well as sex differences. To test this hypothesis, CC surface area and thickness as well as FBV was quantified in 221 chimpanzees with known pedigrees. CC surface area, thickness and FBV were significantly heritable and phenotypically associated with each other; however, no significant genetic association was found between FBV, CC surface area and thickness. The CC surface area and thickness measures were also found to be significantly heritable in both chimpanzee cohorts as were phenotypic associations with variation in asymmetries in tool use skill, suggesting that these findings are reproducible. Finally, significant phenotypic and genetic associations were found between hand use skill and region-specific variation in CC surface area and thickness. These findings suggest that common genes may underlie individual differences in chimpanzee tool use skill and interhemispheric connectivity as manifest by variation in surface area and thickness within the anterior region of the CC. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Objectives: Human identification systems based on STRs are widely used in human population genetics and forensic analysis. This study aimed to validate the cross-reactivity of three widely known human-specific STR identification systems i.e. GlobalFiler™ PCR Amplification Kit, Investigator 24plex QS Kit, and PowerPlex® Fusion 6C in chimpanzee. Results: The present study revealed the successful amplification of 18 loci using GlobalFiler™ PCR Amplification Kit, 18 loci using Investigator 24plex QS Kit, and 20 loci using PowerPlex® Fusion 6C system. The marker Amelogenin (AMEL) showed differential allele size between male and female revealing the gender identity of chimpanzees and thus validates their application concerning forensic examination, population estimation, and genetic analysis. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) build nests at night for sleeping and occasionally during daytime for resting. Over the course of seven years, forest fragments in Bulindi, Uganda, were reduced in size by about 80% when landowners converted forest to agricultural land. However, unlike other studies on nesting behavior in response to habitat disturbance, chimpanzees at Bulindi had no opportunity to retreat into nearby undisturbed forest. To understand behavioral adaptations to forest clearance, we compared Bulindi chimpanzees' nesting characteristics before and after this period of major deforestation. After deforestation, chimpanzees built nests at lower heights in shorter trees, and reused a larger proportion of their nests. Additionally, average nest group size increased after deforestation, even though community size declined by approximately 20% over the same period. The substantial decrease in available forest habitat may have caused the chimpanzees to aggregate for nesting. However, more cohesive nesting may also have been influenced by dietary shifts (increased reliance on agricultural crops) and a need for enhanced safety with increased human encroachment. Conversely, the chimpanzees selected similar tree species for nesting after deforestation, apparently reflecting a strong preference for particular species, nested less often in exotic species, and built integrated nests (constructed using multiple trees) at a similar frequency as before fragment clearance. Chimpanzees living in unprotected habitat in Uganda, as at Bulindi, face mounting anthropogenic pressures that threaten their survival. Nevertheless, our study shows that chimpanzees can adjust their nesting behavior flexibly in response to rapid, extensive habitat change. While behavioral flexibility may enable them to cope with deforestation, at least to a certain point, the long-term survival of chimpanzees in fast-changing human-modified landscapes requires intensive conservation efforts. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: To comparatively investigate the morphological adaptation of the human foot for achieving robust and efficient bipedal locomotion, we develop three-dimensional finite element models of the human and chimpanzee feet. Foot bones and the outer surface of the foot are extracted from computer tomography images and meshed with tetrahedral elements. The ligaments and plantar fascia are represented by tension-only spring elements. The contacts between the bones and between the foot and ground are solved using frictionless and Coulomb friction contact algorithms, respectively. Physiologically realistic loading conditions of the feet during quiet bipedal standing are simulated. Our results indicate that the center of pressure (COP) is located more anteriorly in the human foot than in the chimpanzee foot, indicating a larger stability margin in bipedal posture in humans. Furthermore, the vertical free moment generated by the coupling motion of the calcaneus and tibia during axial loading is larger in the human foot, which can facilitate the compensation of the net yaw moment of the body around the COP during bipedal locomotion. Furthermore, the human foot can store elastic energy more effectively during axial loading for the effective generation of propulsive force in the late stance phase. This computational framework for a comparative investigation of the causal relationship among the morphology, kinematics, and kinetics of the foot may provide a better understanding regarding the functional significance of the morphological features of the human foot.

ABSTRACT: Reconstructing diets from stable carbon isotopic signals in enamel bioapatite requires the application of a δ13C enamel-diet enrichment factor, or the isotopic offset between diet and enamel, which has not been empirically determined for any primate. In this study, an enamel-diet enrichment factor (ε∗enamel-diet) of 11.8 ± 0.3‰ is calculated for chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) at Ngogo in Kibale National Park, Uganda, based on a comprehensive isotopic assessment of previously analyzed dietary plant data and new isotopic analyses of enamel apatite. Different enamel sampling methods are evaluated to determine the potential influence of weaning on isotopic enamel values and dietary interpretations. The new chimpanzee enrichment factor and a sampling strategy that excludes teeth that formed before weaning completion are applied to all known chimpanzee δ13Cenamel data, either previously published or newly derived in this study, resulting in a dietary range of almost 6‰ across all chimpanzees sampled. This new chimpanzee enamel-diet enrichment factor is then used to reassess dietary reconstructions of 12 fossil hominin species whose isotopic enamel signatures have been determined. Results reveal hominin diets that are isotopically more positive than previously reconstructed, highlighting the widespread contribution of 13C-enriched C4/crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) resources in fossil hominin diets and emphasizing the broad use of these resources during human evolution. These findings stress the importance of ascertaining and employing an appropriate enrichment factor for dietary reconstructions of specific taxa as well as standardizing the sampling protocol for tooth enamel in isotopic paleodietary reconstructions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: This study aimed to evaluate the performance of hydrogen peroxide vapour (HPV) to inactivate the chimpanzee adenovirus AZD1222 vaccine strain used in the production of recombinant COVID-19 vaccine for application in cleaning validation in pharmaceutical industries production areas. Two matrixes were tested: formulated recombinant COVID-19 vaccine (FCV) and active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). The samples were dried on stainless steel and exposed to HPV in an isolator. One biological indicator with population >106 Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores was used to validate the HPV decontamination cycle as standard. HPV exposure resulted in complete virus inactivation in FVC (≥5·03 log10) and API (≥6·40 log10), showing HPV efficacy for reducing chimpanzee adenovirus AZD1222 vaccine strain. However, the optimum concentration and contact time will vary depending on the type of application. Future decontamination studies scaling up the process to the recombinant COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing areas are necessary to evaluate if the HPV will have the same or better virucidal effectivity in each specific production area. In conclusion, HPV showed efficacy for reducing AZD1222 chimpanzee adenovirus strain and can be a good choice for pharmaceutical industries facilities disinfection during recombinant COVID-19 vaccine production. © 2021 The Society for Applied Microbiology

ABSTRACT: The IUCN has recently updated its 2003 western chimpanzee conservation action plan for the period 2020–2030. Recent estimates find an 80% population reduction occurred between 1990 and 2014. Further, 83% of these chimpanzees are estimated to live outside any high-level protected area. Ivory Coast's drastic chimpanzee decline, within a commercial agriculture setting, has much inspired this new protected area-centered action plan. We discuss two contrasting mechanisms contributing to population decline within Ivory Coast in order to assess their relevance to address range-wide conservation issues. We then consider the role of rotational agriculture, which dominates the subsistence economy of neighboring countries, as either a threat or a part of the solution to this subspecies' conservation. We identify knowledge gaps in three critical areas. First, little is known about the habitat types that have experienced the greatest losses across the range of the western chimpanzee. Second, relatively little is known about chimpanzee use of fallowed agricultural fields. Finally, little is known about farmer's ecological knowledge about chimpanzees and their potential to coexist. Establishing new protected areas over the next decade will likely be as an offset to areas used in infrastructure development, implying that ever larger areas will be lost to subsistence farming. We propose to broaden conservation plans for the western chimpanzee. Specifically, we call for deeper consideration of habitat sharing of agricultural fallows within subsistence agricultural landscapes as a means to foster human-chimpanzee coexistence. A focus on coexistence could help mitigate conservation-subsistence farming conflicts. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Ranging behavior has been studied extensively in eastern (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) and western (P. t. verus) chimpanzees, but relatively little is known regarding home ranges of the other two subspecies (P. t. ellioti; P. t. troglodytes). In this study, we determined the home range size and space use of a habituated community (Rekambo) of central chimpanzees living in a habitat mosaic in Loango National Park, Gabon. Data on travel routes were collected during follows between January 2017 and April 2019 (N = 670,616 relocations, collected over 640 days and 5690 h of observation). We used three methods for calculating home range size (minimum convex polygon, kernel density estimation, and biased random bridges). We compare our estimates to those obtained from prior genetic and camera trap studies of the Rekambo community and contrast them with estimates from other chimpanzee communities of the four chimpanzee subspecies. Depending on the methodology used, the home range size of the Rekambo community ranged between 27.64 and 59.03 km2. The location of the center of the home range remained relatively stable over the last decade, while the overall size decreased. The Rekambo home range is, therefore, one of the largest documented so far for chimpanzees outside savannah-woodland habitats. We discuss several explanations, including the presence of savannah, interspecies competition, and intercommunity interactions. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The study here presented provides preliminary data regarding social compatibility of an all-male group of five chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), assessed by means of a social network analysis (SNA). The study was conducted at the Fundació Mona (Girona, Spain), where data on social behavior were collected in two consecutive 2-week periods using continuous focal animal sampling for a total of 72 h of observation. Our results show the study group is socially compatible: males showed high levels of affiliative behaviors (grooming) and low levels of aggressive behaviors (displacement, display, physical aggression, supplantation). In addition, these results remained stable during the two study periods. Likewise, the most central individuals in the affiliative and aggressive networks were identified, showing slight variations depending on the period of the study. Therefore, the information obtained suggests that placing male chimpanzees in all-male groups could be a potential option for the management of surplus males. The results also provide support regarding the positive contribution of social assessment to the management of captive primate groups. In this regard, SNA seems to be a useful tool to evaluate the groups’ social behavior and to identify its key individuals. In addition, these results allow us to draw up a set of recommendations before the formation of an all-male group, but also to assess their compatibility once groups have been formed. As a whole, the results of this study could improve the management of endangered species like chimpanzees. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

ABSTRACT: Gestural communication permeates all domains of chimpanzees' social life and is intentional in use. However, we still have only limited information on how young apes develop the sociocognitive skills needed for intentional communication. In this cross-sectional study, we document the development of behavioral adjustment to the recipient's visual attention—considered a hallmark of intentional communication—in wild immature chimpanzees' gestural communication. We studied 11 immature chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii): three infants, four juveniles, and four adolescents gesturing towards their mother. We quantified silent-visual, audible, and contact gestures indexed to maternal visual attention and inattention. We investigated unimodal adjustment, defined by the capacity of young chimpanzees to deploy fewer silent-visual signals when their mothers did not show full visual attention towards them as compared with when they did. We then examined cross-modal adjustment, defined as the capacity of chimpanzees to deploy more audible-or-contact gestures than silent-visual gestures in the condition where their mothers did not show full visual attention as compared to when they did. Our results show a gradual decline in the use of silent-visual gestures when the mother is not visually attentive with increasing age. The absence of silent-visual gesture production toward a visually inattentive recipient (complete unimodal adjustment) was not fully in place until adolescence. Immature chimpanzees used more audible-or-contact gestures than silent-visual ones when their mothers did not show visual attention and vice-versa when they did. This cross-modal adjustment was expressed in juveniles and adolescents but not in infants. Overall, this study shows that infant chimpanzees were limited in their sensitivity to maternal attention when gesturing, whereas adolescent chimpanzees adjusted their communication appropriately. Juveniles present an intermediate pattern with cross-modal adjustment preceding unimodal adjustment and with variability in the age of onset. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

ABSTRACT: Humans reason not only about actual events (what is), but also about possible events (what could be). Many key operations of human cognition involve the representation of possibilities, including moral judgment, future planning, and causal understanding1. But little is known about the evolutionary roots of this kind of thought. Humans’ closest relatives, chimpanzees, possess several cognitive abilities that are closely related to reasoning about alternatives: they plan for the future2, evaluate other's actions3, and reason causally4. However, in the first direct test of the ability to consider alternatives, Redshaw and Suddendorf5 claim that chimpanzees are not able to represent alternative possibilities. Here, using a novel method, we challenge this conclusion: our results suggest that, like human cognition, chimpanzee thought is not limited to what is, but also involves reasoning about what could be the case. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The western chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) is “Critically Endangered” due to a gradual decrease of its population and a continuous degradation of their habitats. Niokolo Koba National Park is considered an important biodiversity area in West Africa and has high conservation value for western chimpanzees. However, Niokolo Koba National Park has been inscribed on the World Heritage list as being in Danger since 2007 due to anthropogenic factors. Over the last 40 years, only sporadic and short-term studies on the ecology and behavior of chimpanzees in the park have occurred. For this reason, we studied the nesting ecology of a putative chimpanzee community in the Antenna zone. We also identified sympatric medium and large mammals using a camera trap. Chimpanzees mostly used Hexalobus monopetalus for nesting, followed by Pterocarpus erinaceus. Nest heights in the Antenna zone were lower than they are in Assirik, and outside the park at Fongoli and Diaguiri sites despite the presence of potential predators in the park. Predator presence influences nesting height behavior. These data deepen our knowledge about chimpanzees in Senegal, and are useful for the management plan of the park and will contribute to an action plan for their conservation there. © 2022, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.

ABSTRACT: Fission-fusion societies are social systems in which individuals belonging to the same community are rarely all together but rather spend most of their time in temporary parties. This flexible social organization is assumed to be an adaptation that balances advantages and costs of group living in a fluid way as resources and constraints shift through space and time. It has been argued that this flexibility freed hominins from the foraging constraints caused by living in large groups. Given their close genetic relationship to humans and because they represent the classic case of a fission-fusion society, chimpanzees have often been used as referential models to understand human social evolution. Determinants of chimpanzee party size have been widely studied for decades across several communities. However, we lack data from open and dry sites—which closely resemble those reconstructed for Plio-Pleistocene hominins—on communities that potentially face similar environmental constraints as early hominins did. We investigated chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) grouping patterns on a recently habituated community living in the savanna-woodland mosaic landscape of the Issa Valley, western Tanzania, by following chimpanzees daily and recording party size every hour. Our results revealed that party size at Issa 1) followed seasonal fluctuations in food availability, 2) increased in the presence of swollen females, and 3) was higher in open vegetation, which potentially presents a high predation risk. Furthermore, we found the Issa community to be highly cohesive compared with the majority of other communities, possibly due to a combination of its small size and potential threats characterizing its home range. Our study fills a gap in our knowledge of chimpanzee sociality by exploring grouping pattern determinants in an East African understudied biome and highlights what elements of early hominin social behavior may have evolved in Late Pliocene landscapes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The development of an effective vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a global priority. Here, we compare the protective capacity of intranasal and intramuscular delivery of a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine encoding a prefusion stabilized spike protein (chimpanzee adenovirus [ChAd]-SARS-CoV-2-S) in Golden Syrian hamsters. Although immunization with ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induces robust spike-protein-specific antibodies capable of neutralizing the virus, antibody levels in serum are higher in hamsters vaccinated by an intranasal compared to intramuscular route. Accordingly, against challenge with SARS-CoV-2, ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S-immunized hamsters are protected against less weight loss and have reduced viral infection in nasal swabs and lungs, and reduced pathology and inflammatory gene expression in the lungs, compared to ChAd-control immunized hamsters. Intranasal immunization with ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S provides superior protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and inflammation in the upper respiratory tract. These findings support intranasal administration of the ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S candidate vaccine to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, disease, and possibly transmission. © 2021 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: We observed differential infectivity and product yield between two recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus C68 constructs whose primary difference was genome length. To determine a possible reason for this outcome, we characterized the proportion and composition of the empty and packaged capsids. Both analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) and differential centrifugation sedimentation (DCS, a rapid and quantitative method for measuring adenoviral packaging variants) were employed for an initial assessment of genome packaging and showed multiple species whose abundance deviated between the virus builds but not manufacturing campaigns. Identity of the packaging variants was confirmed by charge detection mass spectrometry (CDMS), the first known application of this technique to analyze adenovirus. The empty and packaged capsid populations were separated via preparative ultracentrifugation and then combined into a series of mixtures. These mixtures showed the oft-utilized denaturing A260 adenoviral particle titer method will underestimate the actual particle titer by as much as three-fold depending on the empty/full ratio. In contrast, liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection proves to be a superior viral particle titer methodology. © Copyright © 2021 Mullins, Powers, Zobel, Clawson, Barnes, Draper, Zou, Binder, Dai, Zhang, Friese, Runnels, Jarrold and Thompson.

ABSTRACT: Automatic detection systems are important in passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) systems, as these record large amounts of audio data which are infeasible for humans to evaluate manually. In this paper we evaluated methods for compensating class imbalance for deep-learning based automatic detection of acoustic chimpanzee calls. The prevalence of chimpanzee calls in natural habitats is very rare, i.e. databases feature a heavy imbalance between background and target calls. Such imbalances can have negative effects on classifier performances. We employed a state-of-the-art detection approach based on convolutional recurrent neural networks (CRNNs). We extended the detection pipeline through various stages for compensating class imbalance. These included (1) spectrogram denoising, (2) alternative loss functions, and (3) resampling. Our key findings are: (1) spectrogram denoising operations significantly improved performance for both target classes, (2) standard binary cross entropy reached the highest performance, and (3) manipulating relative class imbalance through resampling either decreased or maintained performance depending on the target class. Finally, we reached detection performances of 33%F1 for drumming and 5%F1 for vocalization, which is a >7 fold increase compared to previously published results. We conclude that supporting the network to learn decoupling noise conditions from foreground classes is of primary importance for increasing performance. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Highly differentiated and affiliative social relationships are observed in a variety of mammals, including primates, cetaceans, and social carnivores. Although there has been a transformation in our understanding of the form and function of social bonds in the past two decades, the role of early life social experiences in the development of bonds remains less clear. Few studies have examined whether social relationships during infancy and juvenility (aside from those between mothers and offspring) persist into adulthood. In this study, we used longitudinal data on wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) at Gombe National Park, Tanzania, to investigate the effects of party-level association during infancy and juvenility (hereafter immaturity) on affiliative relationships among adult males (the philopatric sex). In total, we examined behavioral data from focal follows between 1970 and 2015 (N = 23 adult males). We used maternal associations as proxies for the associations of immature males, and we measured adult male social relationships using party-level associations and grooming activity. We found that immature males that associated with individual adult males at higher rates had stronger relationships with those same adult males later in life. By contrast, rates of association between pairs of immature males did not predict the strength of their dyadic relationships as adults. Overall, these findings emphasize the importance of early socialization in male chimpanzee social development. These results also reinforce studies in mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei) and bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.), suggesting that the persistence of social relationships that do not involve the mother may be more likely to evolve in long-lived species where young adult males face challenges entering an adult hierarchy composed of stronger and/or more socially experienced competitors. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Although trichromatic colour vision has been extensively studied as it grants significant advantages for Old World primates, it is unknown which selective pressures were behind the trait's evolution. The leading hypothesis would be that colour vision arose as a foraging adaptation because it allowed individuals to spot food more efficiently. To test this, we exposed 3 chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), 5 gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) and 3 mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx) to colour cardboard plates to assess whether colours related to diet were the most preferred. The experimental setting was divided into two phases. During the first, animals were provided with colour cardboard plates of only 1 colour per data collection session. The order of colour presentation was randomly determined: white, black, yellow, green and red. In phase 2, primates were simultaneously provided with cardboard plates of all colours. Behavioural interactions with plates were measured using a one-zero group focal sampling (10-s sampling intervals and 20-min observation periods). Results showed that when animals were exposed to only 1 colour at a time, they exhibited different colour preferences depending on the species considered. Chimpanzees preferred red and yellow, the colours linked to fruits, while gorillas selected red and white. Mandrills exhibited fewer differences between colour preferences, with red being the most selected. Furthermore, when all colours were simultaneously provided, individuals chose colours related to diet over black and white. Although there were clear individual differences, our results support that trichromatic colour vision is an advantage in detecting and selecting red items. In the wild, it could be important in the detection of reddish fruits and leaves.  © 2021 S. Karger AG, Basel. Copyright: All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Hallmark social activities of humans, such as cooperation and cultural learning, involve eye-gaze signaling through joint attentional interaction and ostensive communication. The gazesignaling and related cooperative-eye hypotheses posit that humans evolved unique external eye morphologies, including uniformly white sclera (the whites of the eye), to enhance the visibility of eye-gaze for conspecifics. However, experimental evidence is still lacking. This study tested the ability of human and chimpanzee participants to discriminate the eye-gaze directions of human and chimpanzee images in computerized tasks. We varied the level of brightness and size in the stimulus images to examine the robustness of the eye-gaze directional signal against simulated shading and distancing. We found that both humans and chimpanzees discriminated eye-gaze directions of humans better than those of chimpanzees, particularly in visually challenging conditions. Also, participants of both species discriminated the eye-gaze directions of chimpanzees better when the contrast polarity of the chimpanzee eye was reversed compared to when it was normal; namely, when the chimpanzee eye has human-like white sclera and a darker iris. Uniform whiteness in the sclera thus facilitates the visibility of eye-gaze direction even across species. Our findings thus support but also critically update the central premises of the gaze-signaling hypothesis. ‍© Kano et al.

ABSTRACT: Manufacturing has been the key factor limiting rollout of vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring rapid development and large-scale implementation of novel manufacturing technologies. ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222, Vaxzevria) is an efficacious vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, based upon an adenovirus vector. We describe the development of a process for the production of this vaccine and others based upon the same platform, including novel features to facilitate very large-scale production. We discuss the process economics and the “distributed manufacturing” approach we have taken to provide the vaccine at globally-relevant scale and with international security of supply. Together, these approaches have enabled the largest viral vector manufacturing campaign to date, providing a substantial proportion of global COVID-19 vaccine supply at low cost. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Frugivorous primates have developed several strategies to deal with wild fruit scarcity, such as modifying their activity budget or enlarging their diet. Agricultural expansion threatens primate habitats and populations (e.g., disease transmission, agrochemical exposure), but it also increases crop feeding opportunities. We aimed at understanding whether maize presence close to the natural habitat of chimpanzees, a threatened species, would lead to significant behavioral modifications. We monitored 20 chimpanzees over 37 months in Kibale National Park, Uganda, with maize gardens at the forest edge. Based on focal nest-to-nest data, we analyzed their diet, activity budget, and energy balance depending on wild fruit and maize availability. We found that the Sebitoli area is a highly nutritive habitat for chimpanzees, with large and caloric wild fruits available all year long. The chimpanzees opportunistically consume maize and exploit it by resting less during maize season. However, no significant variation was found in daily paths and energy expenditures according to maize availability. No behavioral or energy modification was observed regarding wild resources either. Despite the availability of nutritious domestic resources, chimpanzees still exploit wild fruits and do not limit their movements. Thus, their contribution to seed dispersal and forest regeneration in this area is not affected. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: The chimpanzee cytomegalovirus (CCMV) is the closest relative of human CMV (HCMV). Because of the high conservation between these two species and the ability of human cells to fully support CCMV replication, CCMV holds great potential as a model system for HCMV. To make the CCMV genome available for precise and rapid gene manipulation techniques, we captured the genomic DNA of CCMV strain Heberling as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). Selected BAC clones were reconstituted to infectious viruses, growing to similar high titers as parental CCMV. DNA sequencing confirmed the integrity of our clones and led to the identification of two polymorphic loci and a deletion-prone region within the CCMV genome. To re-evaluate the CCMV coding potential, we analyzed the viral transcriptome and proteome and identified several novel ORFs, splice variants, and regulatory RNAs. We further characterized the dynamics of CCMV gene expression and found that viral proteins cluster into five distinct temporal classes. In addition, our datasets revealed that the host response to CCMV infection and the de-regulation of cellular pathways are in line with known hallmarks of HCMV infection. In a first functional experiment, we investigated a proposed frameshift mutation in UL128 that was suspected to restrict CCMV’s cell tropism. In fact, repair of this frameshift re-established productive CCMV infection in endothelial and epithelial cells, expanding the options of CCMV as an infection model. Thus, BAC-cloned CCMV can serve as a powerful tool for systematic approaches in comparative functional genomics, exploiting the close phylogenetic relationship between CCMV and HCMV.

ABSTRACT: Intrinsic to several hypotheses explaining the evolution of foraging behavior complexity, such as proto-tool use, is the assumption that more complex ingestive behaviors are adaptations allowing individuals to access difficult to procure but nutritionally or energetically rewarding foods. However, nutritional approaches to understanding this complexity have been underutilized. The goal of this study was to evaluate potential nutritional determinants of two unusual foraging behaviors, fruit cracking with anvils and seed reingestion, by adult male western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) at Fongoli, Senegal during the baobab (Adansonia digitata) fruit season. We examined these behaviors in relation to nutrient and energy intake, and compared macronutrient and energy concentrations found in baobab fruits to other plant foods. Adult males ingested at least 31 distinct foods from 23 plant species. Baobab fruit comprised the majority of daily energy intake (68 ± 34%, range: 0%–98%). The energetic concentration of baobab fruit varied by phenophase and part ingested, with ripe and semi-ripe fruit ranking high in energy return rate. Males preferred ripe and semi-ripe baobab fruit but unripe fruit intake was higher overall. The seed kernels were high in protein and fat relative to fruit pulp, and these kernels were easier to access during the unripe stage. During the ripe stage, seed kernels were accessible by reingestion, after the seed coat was softened during gut passage. In addition to providing macronutrients and energy, baobab fruit was a relatively abundant food source. We conclude that baobab pulp and seed are high quality foods at Fongoli during the baobab season because they are nutritionally balanced, high in energy, and relatively abundant in the environment. These nutritional and abundance characteristics may explain, in part, why these chimpanzees use anvils and reingestion to access a mechanically challenging food. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

ABSTRACT: Objective: To evaluate the agreement of two noninvasive blood pressure devices: a human device with the cuff placed on the wrist (Omron R1) and a veterinary device with the cuff placed on the upper brachium (Surgivet Advisor Vital Signs Monitor) with invasive blood pressure (IBP) measurement in anaesthetized chimpanzees. Study design: Prospective clinical study. Animals: A convenience sample of 11 adult chimpanzees undergoing anaesthesia for translocation and routine health checks. Methods: Systolic (SAP) and diastolic arterial pressures (DAP) were continuously recorded via a transducer connected to a femoral artery cannula, and at 5 minute intervals from the two oscillometric devices. Agreement was explored using Bland-Altman analysis and bias defined as the mean difference between the two measurement methods. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated. Significance was set at p < 0.05. Results: Bias and standard deviation for the Surgivet compared with IBP were 8.6 ± 18 for SAP and 8.4 ± 9.9 for DAP, showing a significant underestimation of both variables. Limits of agreement (LOA) were from –27 to 44 for SAP and from –11 to 28 for DAP. Correlation coefficients between the Surgivet and IBP values were 0.86 for SAP and 0.85 for DAP (p < 0.0001). Bias and standard deviation for the Omron compared with the IBP were –21 ± 25 for SAP and –18 ± 15 for DAP, showing a significant overestimation of both variables. LOA were from –70 to –28 for SAP and from –47 to 11 for DAP. Spearman correlation coefficients between the Omron and IBP values were 0.64 for SAP and 0.72 for DAP (p < 0.0001). Conclusions and clinical relevance: Although neither device met all the criteria for device validation, the Surgivet presented better agreement with IBP values than the Omron in adult anaesthetized chimpanzees. © 2021 Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists and American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and Analgesia

ABSTRACT: The paracingulate sulcus -PCGS- has been considered for a long time to be specific to the human brain. Its presence/absence has been discussed in relation to interindividual variability of personality traits and cognitive abilities. Recently, a putative PCGS has been observed in chimpanzee brains. To demonstrate that this newly discovered sulcus is the homologue of the PCGS in the human brain, we analyzed cytoarchitectonic and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data in chimpanzee brains which did or did not display a PCGS. The results show that the organization of the mid-cingulate cortex of the chimpanzee brain is comparable to that of the human brain, both cytoarchitectonically and in terms of functional connectivity with the lateral frontal cortex. These results demonstrate that the PCGS is not human-specific but is a shared feature of the primate brain since at least the last common ancestor to humans and great apes ~6 mya. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Dependent on timing of assessment, anesthetic agents and specifically medetomidine negatively affect cardiac function in great apes. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of tiletamine-zolazepam (TZ) with and without medetomidine on cardiac structure and function in healthy chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) during a period of relative blood pressure stability. Twenty-four chimpanzees living in an African wildlife sanctuary undergoing routine health assessments were stratified by age, sex, and body mass and randomized to be anesthetized using either TZ (6 mg/kg; n = 13; seven males and six females) or a combination of TZ (2 mg/kg) and medetomidine (TZM; 0.02 mg/kg; n = 11; five males and six females). During health checks, regular heart rate and blood pressure readings were taken and a standardized echocardiogram was performed 20-30 min after induction. Data were compared between the two anesthetic groups using independent-samples t or Mann-Whitney U tests. Although heart rate (mean ± SD; TZ: 76 ± 10 bpm; TZM: 65 ± 14 bpm, P = 0.027), cardiac output (TZ: 3.0 ± 0.7 L/min; TZM: 2.4 ± 0.7 L/min, P = 0.032), and mitral A-wave velocities (TZ: 0.51 ± 0.16 cm/s; TZM: 0.36 ± 0.10 cm/s, P = 0.013) were lower in the TZM group, there were no statistically significant differences in cardiac structure or the remaining functional variables between groups. Furthermore, there were no statistical differences in systolic (TZ 114.6 ± 14.9 mmHg; TZM: 123.0 ± 28.1 mmHg; P = 0.289) or diastolic blood pressure (TZ: 81.8 ± 22.3 mmHg, TZM: 83.8 ± 20.1 mmHg; P = 0.827) between the groups during the echocardiogram. This study has shown that during a period of relative blood pressure stability, during the first 20-30 min after induction there are few differences in measures of cardiac structure and function between protocols using TZ with or without medetomidine in healthy chimpanzees. © 2021 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To evaluate the level of agreement (LOA) between direct and oscillometric blood pressure (BP) measurements and the ability of oscillometric measurements to accurately detect hypotension in anesthetized chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). ANIMALS 8 captive, adult chimpanzees. PROCEDURES During prescheduled annual examinations, each chimpanzee underwent general anesthesia and patient monitoring for their examination, echocardiography for a concurrent study, and measurement of direct BP with the use of tibial artery catheterization and oscillometry with the use of a cuff placed around a brachium and a cuff placed around the second digit of the contralateral forelimb for the present study. Bland-Altman plots were generated to compare results for direct and oscillometric BP measurements. Mean bias and 95% LOAs were calculated for oscillometric measurements of systolic arterial pressure (SAP), diastolic arterial pressure (DAP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) for each cuff site. Sensitivity and specificity in detecting hypotension were also determined for each cuff site. RESULTS There were 74 paired direct and brachial oscillometric measurements of each, SAP, MAP, and DAP and 66 paired direct and digit oscillometric measurements of each, SAP, MAP, and DAP. Only brachial oscillometric measurements of MAP had adequate sensitivity (78%) and specificity (95%) to accurately detect hypotension, and this technique also had the least mean bias (0.8 mm Hg; 95% LOA, –29 to 31 mm Hg). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results indicated that brachial oscillometric measurement of MAP provided reasonable agreement with tibial arterial direct MAP measurement and performed well in diagnosing hypotension in anesthetized chimpanzees. © 2021, American Veterinary Medical Association.

ABSTRACT: The field of environmental enrichment has grown considerably, but most enrichment is still focused on tasks where highly valued food rewards are directly visible. We designed a device which would instead make use of knowledge states, motivational structure, and physical reasoning skills and could use hidden, low-quality food items while remaining low in cost. Food items were hidden in small cardboard tubes and placed snugly inside another, larger, tube such that they were difficult to extract and presented a challenging dexterity and physical reasoning task. Rare favored food items were distributed so animals would be rewarded at irregular intervals. The devices were then presented to two groups of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) who either had experience extracting food from identical small cardboard tubes or had no such experience. We found that the chimpanzees with no prior experience with the small tubes used the device very little until one individual removed a small tube, revealing the food inside, at which point use time significantly increased. In the knowledgeable group, no change was observed after the first tube retrieval. Individuals in both groups used the devices for over 20 min each on average over a 1-h observation period, and in both facilities at least one device still contained all inner tubes. Our study suggests that enrichment can make use of animals' prior knowledge, that enrichment devices can thus be layered into one another, and reiterates the importance of considering animals' psychology in designing enrichment. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

ABSTRACT: Self-medication refers to the process by which a host suppresses or prevents the deleterious effects of parasitism and other causes of illness via behavioural means1. It has been observed across multiple animal taxa (e.g. bears, elephants, moths, starlings)2, with many case studies in great apes1,3. Although the majority of studies on self-medication in non-human primates concern the ingestion of plant parts or non-nutritional substances to combat or control intestinal parasites4, more recent examples also report topical applications of leaves or other materials (including arthropods) to skin integuments3. Thus far, however, the application of insects or insect parts to an individual's own wound or the wound of a conspecific has never been reported. Here, we report the first observations of chimpanzees applying insects to their own wounds (n = 19) and to the wounds of conspecifics (n = 3). © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Large animal species are most likely to survive human-induced rapid environmental change if they display high levels of behavioural flexibility. Examining social responses in species that form closely bonded social groups and display high fission–fusion dynamics, such as chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, will help determine their resilience to dynamic human activities and the potential for sustainable human–wildlife interactions. Coinciding with the seasonal availability of cultivated jackfruit, Artocarpus heterophyllus, a dominant food available in croplands and village gardens, we examined the social adjustments of wild chimpanzees to risks presented by a human-modified landscape at Bulindi, Uganda. Absolute party size decreased when chimpanzees moved from low-risk ‘natural’ habitat (forest fragments) to high-risk ‘anthropogenic’ habitat (croplands and other village areas), driven mainly by parties containing fewer females. Using social network analysis, we found that chimpanzee social structure showed partial flexibility in response to anthropogenic risk. The strength of social ties in a 5 m proximity network stayed similar and individual centrality measures were correlated between low- and high-risk habitats. Nevertheless, in high-risk habitat males were more central than females and exclusively dominated the core of the network's core–periphery structure. However, sex differences were not apparent when we corrected for party membership, indicating that differences were driven by changes to party membership between habitat types rather than changes in social proximity within parties. We suggest that perception of anthropogenic risk can drive continual adjustments to grouping dynamics in response to changing conditions that modify social lives of male and female chimpanzees in different ways. Consequently, changes in grouping patterns induced by continuing anthropogenic change could impact ecological and evolutionary processes influenced by social structure, including cultural evolution and the spread of infectious disease. © 2022

ABSTRACT: Environmental conditions and human activity influence the selection of nest sites by chimpanzees and may have serious conservation implications. We examined the characteristics of nesting trees preferred by chimpanzees, investigated the effect of vegetation composition and topography on nest site locations and seasonality on nesting heights of chimpanzees, and verified the effect of predator occurrence and human activity on the nesting behavior of the Nigeria–Cameroon chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes ellioti) in Kom-Wum Forest Reserve (KWFR) and surrounding unprotected forest in Cameroon. We recorded 923 nests, 502 signs of human activity, and 646 nesting trees along line transects and recces (reconnaissance) for two seasons. We found that chimpanzees constructed more arboreal nests on tall primary trees with high lowest branch height and large diameter at breast height. Moreover, they oriented their nests within trees in the slope direction when the nesting trees were located on slopes. Additionally, the occurrence of chimpanzee nests was positively related to increasing elevation and slope and decreased with distance to primary forest. In contrast, the number of nests increased with distance to secondary forest, open land, and villages, and nesting height was not influenced by seasons. While we recorded no signs of large nocturnal chimpanzee predators at nesting trees, we found signs of hunting activity at nesting locations. Nesting high in trees is likely a way of avoiding hunting, while nest orientation within trees in slope direction shortens escape routes from human hunters. Our findings suggest that chimpanzees select safe trees (tall trees with high lowest branch height) located in nesting areas (primary forest, high elevation, and steep slopes) that are not easily accessible by humans. Therefore, conservation efforts should focus on protecting primary forests at high elevation and steep slopes and reducing human impact. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Researchers frequently use focal individual sampling to study primate communication. Recent studies of primate gestures have shown that opportunistic sampling offers benefits not found in focal individual sampling, such as the collection of larger sample sizes. What is not known is whether the opportunistic method is biased towards certain signal types or signalers. Our goal was to assess the validity of the opportunistic method by comparing focal individual sampling to opportunistic sampling of facial and gestural communication in a group of captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). We compared: (1) the number of observed facial and gestural signals per signal type and (2) the number of observed facial and gestural signals produced by each signaler. Both methods identified facial signals, gesture signals, and gesture signalers at similar relative rates, but the opportunistic sampling method yielded a more even distribution of signalers and signal types than the focal individual sampling method. In addition, the opportunistic sampling method resulted in larger sample sizes for both facial and gestural communication. However, the opportunistic method did not allow us to calculate the signals per time for each individual, which is easily done with the focal individual method. These results suggest that the opportunistic sampling method is (1) comparable to the focal individual sampling method in multiple important measures, (2) associated with additional sampling benefits, and (3) limited in measuring some variables. Thus, we recommend that future studies use a mixed-methods approach, as focal individual and opportunistic sampling have distinct strengths that complement each other's limitations.  © 2021 S.

ABSTRACT: The origins of human speech are obscure; it is still unclear what aspects are unique to our species or shared with our evolutionary cousins, in part due to a lack of a common framework for comparison. We asked what chimpanzee and human vocal production acoustics have in common. We examined visible supra-laryngeal articulators of four major chimpanzee vocalizations (hoos, grunts, barks, screams) and their associated acoustic structures, using techniques from human phonetic and animal communication analysis. Data were collected from wild adult chimpanzees, Taï National Park, Ivory Coast. Both discriminant and principal component classification procedures revealed classification of call types. Discriminating acoustic features include voice quality and formant structure, mirroring phonetic features in human speech. Chimpanzee lip and jaw articulation variables also offered similar discrimination of call types. Formant maps distinguished call types with different vowel-like sounds. Comparing our results with published primate data, humans show less F1-F2 correlation and further expansion of the vowel space, particularly for [i] sounds. Unlike recent studies suggesting monkeys achieve human vowel space, we conclude from our results that supra-laryngeal articulatory capacities show moderate evolutionary change, with vowel space expansion continuing through hominoid evolution. Studies on more primate species will be required to substantiate this.

ABSTRACT: Paleoclimate reconstructions have enhanced our understanding of how past climates have shaped present-day biodiversity. We hypothesize that the geographic extent of Pleistocene forest refugia and suitable habitat fluctuated significantly in time during the late Quaternary for chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Using bioclimatic variables representing monthly temperature and precipitation estimates, past human population density data, and an extensive database of georeferenced presence points, we built a model of changing habitat suitability for chimpanzees at fine spatio-temporal scales dating back to the Last Interglacial (120,000 BP). Our models cover a spatial resolution of 0.0467° (approximately 5.19 km2 grid cells) and a temporal resolution of between 1000 and 4000 years. Using our model, we mapped habitat stability over time using three approaches, comparing our modeled stability estimates to existing knowledge of Afrotropical refugia, as well as contemporary patterns of major keystone tropical food resources used by chimpanzees, figs (Moraceae), and palms (Arecacae). Results show habitat stability congruent with known glacial refugia across Africa, suggesting their extents may have been underestimated for chimpanzees, with potentially up to approximately 60,000 km2 of previously unrecognized glacial refugia. The refugia we highlight coincide with higher species richness for figs and palms. Our results provide spatio-temporally explicit insights into the role of refugia across the chimpanzee range, forming the empirical foundation for developing and testing hypotheses about behavioral, ecological, and genetic diversity with additional data. This methodology can be applied to other species and geographic areas when sufficient data are available. © 2021 The Authors. American Journal of Primatology published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT: In some species, individuals form well-differentiated and affiliative social relationships that facilitate cooperation and confer adaptive benefits, but few studies of males have addressed the benefits of same-sex social bonds. Among mammals, adult male chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, form some of the strongest and most stable social bonds, and several studies have found that higher-ranking males attain short- and long-term benefits. No study in chimpanzees, however, has demonstrated a link between social bonds and dominance trajectories. To fill this gap, we used 37 years of data from Gombe National Park, Tanzania, to test the hypothesis that social bonds in adult male chimpanzees predict changes in dominance strength, which were measured by annual changes in mean Elo scores. Across 24 adult males, we found that social bonds, which were identified using both association in small groups and grooming activity, showed positive relationships with changes in dominance strength. From previous studies, the most likely mechanism for the observed relationship between adult male bond strength and dominance trajectories is the formation of cooperative coalitions, by which males with stronger bonds leverage established relationships to maintain or increase their position in the dominance hierarchy. Given the fission–fusion social structure of chimpanzees, both party-level associations and grooming relationships are essential components of male social bonding, and these results, in combination with prior studies, suggest that having strong social bonds is a valuable strategy for achieving higher rank. © 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ABSTRACT: A safe and effective vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is urgently needed to tackle the COVID-19 global pandemic. Here, we describe the development of chimpanzee adenovirus serotypes 6 and 68 (AdC6 and AdC68) vector-based vaccine candidates expressing the full-length transmembrane spike glycoprotein. We assessed the vaccine immunogenicity, protective efficacy, and immune cell profiles using single-cell RNA sequencing in mice. Mice were vaccinated via the intramuscular route with the two vaccine candidates using prime-only regimens or heterologous prime-boost regimens. Both chimpanzee adenovirus-based vaccines elicited strong and long-term antibody and T cell responses, balanced Th1/Th2 cell responses, robust germinal center responses, and provided effective protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in mouse lungs. Strikingly, we found that heterologous prime-boost immunization induced higher titers of protective antibodies, and more spike-specific memory CD8+ T cells in mice. Potent neutralizing antibodies produced against the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 lineage (also known as N501Y.V1) and B.1.351 lineage (also known as N501Y.V2) were detectable in mouse sera over 6 months after prime immunization. Our results demonstrate that the heterologous prime-boost strategy with chimpanzee adenovirus-based vaccines is promising for further development to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Spanning 1995–2019, this 25-year retrospective mortality assessment of Species Survival Plan (SSP) chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) (n = 218; 103.106.9) managed in Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) facilities (n = 42) serves as guide for antemortem diagnostic trends and intervention. Median life expectancy for this species is calculated as 32.5 years in males, and 40 years in females, although longevity of 61 and 79 years, respectively, were recorded in this time interval. As context, the living SSP population (n = 241; 89.152) is managed currently in 31 AZA facilities with 16% less than 17 years, 51% 17 to 35 years, and 32% greater than 35 years. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Several primate species have been shown to exhibit age-related changes in cognition, brain, and behavior. However, severe neurodegenerative illnesses, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), were once thought to be uniquely human. Recently, some chimpanzees naturally were documented to develop both neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques, the main characteristics of AD pathology. In addition, like humans and other primates, chimpanzees show similar declines in cognition and motor function with age. Here, we used voxel-based morphometry to examine the relationships among gray matter volume, age, and cognition using magnetic resonance imaging scans previously acquired from chimpanzees (N = 216). We first determined the relationship between age and gray matter volume, identifying the regions that declined with age. With a subset of our sample (N = 103), we also determined differences in gray matter volume between older chimpanzees with higher cognition scores than expected for their age, and older chimpanzees with lower than expected scores. Finally, we ran a conjunction analysis to determine any overlap in brain regions between these two analyses. We found that as chimpanzees age, they lose gray matter in regions associated with cognition. In addition, cognitively healthy older chimpanzees (those performing better for their age) have greater gray matter volume in many brain regions compared with chimpanzees who underperform for their age. Finally, the conjunction analysis revealed that regions of age-related decline overlap with the regions that differ between cognitively healthy chimpanzees and those who underperform. This study provides further evidence that chimpanzees are an important model for research on the neurobiology of aging. Future studies should investigate the effects of cognitive stimulation on both cognitive performance and brain structure in aging nonhuman primates. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

ABSTRACT: Farm and wild animals may serve as reservoirs of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria of human health relevance. We investigated the occurrence and genomic characteristics of extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)–producing bacteria in Ugandan chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) residing in two environments with or without close contact to humans. The ESBL-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were isolated from fecal material of chimpanzees from Budongo Forest and Ngamba Island Chimpanzee Sanctuary in Uganda and were more commonly isolated from chimpanzees in Ngamba Island Chimpanzee Sanctuary, where animals have close contact with humans. Selected ESBL isolates (E. coli n=9, K. pneumoniae n=7) were analyzed by whole-genome sequencing to determine the presence of resistance genes, as well as sequence type and virulence potential; the blaCTX-M-15 gene was present in all strains. Additionally, the ESBL genes blaSHV-11 and blaSHV-12 were found in strains in the study. All strains were found to be multidrug resistant. The E. coli strains belonged to four sequence types (ST2852, ST215, ST405, and ST315) and the K. pneumoniae strains to two sequence types (ST1540 and ST597). Virulence genes did not indicate that strains were of common E. coli pathotype, but strains with the same sequence types as isolated in the current study have previously been reported from clinical cases in Africa. The findings indicate that chimpanzees in close contact with humans may carry ESBL bacteria at higher frequency than those in the wild, indicating a potential anthropogenic transmission. © Wildlife Disease Association 2022.

ABSTRACT: As in many other species of nonhuman primates, chimpanzee mothers with a dead infant may continue to care for and transport the infant for days, weeks, or even longer. The bereaved females do this despite what humans perceive as the foul odour from the putrefying corpse. Putrescine is a major contributor to the “smell of death,” and it elicits behaviours aimed at getting rid of the source of the smell, or escape responses in mammals including humans. However, it has never been shown that the odour of putrescine is aversive to chimpanzees. To address this question, we visually presented six adult chimpanzees with the corpse of a small bird, or a stuffed glove, in association with putrescine, ammonia, or water, and recorded the chimpanzees’ reactions. The apes spent significantly less time near the object when it was paired with putrescine than the other substances, although they showed no signs of increased arousal or anxiety. We interpret the findings as evidence of an aversion to the smell of death in chimpanzees, discuss the implications for understanding the continued maternal-like behaviour of bereaved female chimpanzees, and suggest future research directions for the field of comparative evolutionary thanatology. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Much like humans, chimpanzees occupy diverse habitats and exhibit extensive behavioural variability. However, chimpanzees are recognized as a discontinuous species, with four subspecies separated by historical geographic barriers. Nevertheless, their range-wide degree of genetic connectivity remains poorly resolved, mainly due to sampling limitations. By analyzing a geographically comprehensive sample set amplified at microsatellite markers that inform recent population history, we found that isolation by distance explains most of the range-wide genetic structure of chimpanzees. Furthermore, we did not identify spatial discontinuities corresponding with the recognized subspecies, suggesting that some of the subspecies-delineating geographic barriers were recently permeable to gene flow. Substantial range-wide genetic connectivity is consistent with the hypothesis that behavioural flexibility is a salient driver of chimpanzee responses to changing environmental conditions. Finally, our observation of strong local differentiation associated with recent anthropogenic pressures portends future loss of critical genetic diversity if habitat fragmentation and population isolation continue unabated. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Epigenetic age has emerged as an important biomarker of biological ageing. It has revealed that some tissues age faster than others, which is vital to understanding the complex phenomenon of ageing and developing effective interventions. Previous studies have demonstrated that humans exhibit heterogeneity in pace of epigenetic ageing among brain structures that are consistent with differences in structural and microanatomical deterioration. Here, we add comparative data on epigenetic brain ageing for chimpanzees, humans’ closest relatives. Such comparisons can further our understanding of which aspects of human ageing are evolutionarily conserved or specific to our species, especially given that humans are distinguished by a long lifespan, large brain, and, potentially, more severe neurodegeneration with age. Specifically, we investigated epigenetic ageing of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and cerebellum, of humans and chimpanzees by generating genome-wide CpG methylation data and applying established epigenetic clock algorithms to produce estimates of biological age for these tissues. We found that both species exhibit relatively slow epigenetic ageing in the brain relative to blood. Between brain structures, humans show a faster rate of epigenetic ageing in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared to the cerebellum, which is consistent with previous findings. Chimpanzees, in contrast, show comparable rates of epigenetic ageing in the two brain structures. Greater epigenetic change in the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared to the cerebellum may reflect both the protracted development of this structure in humans and its greater age-related vulnerability to neurodegenerative pathology. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Social learning in non-human primates has been studied experimentally for over 120 years, yet until the present century this was limited to what one individual learns from a single other. Evidence of group-wide traditions in the wild then highlighted the collective context for social learning, and broader 'diffusion experiments' have since demonstrated transmission at the community level. In the present article, we describe and set in comparative perspective three strands of our recent research that further explore the collective dimensions of culture and cumulative culture in chimpanzees. First, exposing small communities of chimpanzees to contexts incorporating increasingly challenging, but more rewarding tool use opportunities revealed solutions arising through the combination of different individuals' discoveries, spreading to become shared innovations. The second series of experiments yielded evidence of conformist changes from habitual techniques to alternatives displayed by a unanimous majority of others but implicating a form of quorum decision-making. Third, we found that between-group differences in social tolerance were associated with differential success in developing more complex tool use to exploit an increasingly inaccessible resource. We discuss the implications of this array of findings in the wider context of related studies of humans, other primates and non-primate species.

ABSTRACT: Humans maintain extensive social ties of varying preferences, providing a range of opportunities for beneficial cooperative exchange that may promote collective action and our unique capacity for large-scale cooperation. Similarly, non-human animals maintain differentiated social relationships that promote dyadic cooperative exchange, but their link to cooperative collective action is little known. Here, we investigate the influence of social relationship properties on male and female chimpanzee participations in a costly form of group action, intergroup encounters. We find that intergroup encounter participation increases with a greater number of other participants as well as when participants are maternal kin or social bond partners, and that these effects are independent from one another and from the likelihood to associate with certain partners. Together, strong social relationships between kin and non-kin facilitate group-level cooperation in one of our closest living relatives, suggesting that social bonds may be integral to the evolution of cooperation in our own species. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: We present a case of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) induced by the chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine, without evidence of thrombosis, eight days after vaccine administration. The thrombocytopenia condition improved after administering steroid treatment. This adenovirus vaccine had been reported to induce rare side effects, such as immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia. This case report showed that it could also induce immune thrombocytopenia without the presence of thrombosis. Therefore, we should be cautious of this rare side effect as global vaccine administrations against coronavirus disease increase. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: Previous studies have revealed that non-human primates can differentiate the age category of faces. However, the knowledge about age recognition in non-human primates is very limited and whether non-human primates can process facial age information in a similar way to humans is unknown. As humans have an association between time and space (e.g., a person in an earlier life stage to the left and a person in a later life stage to the right), we investigated whether chimpanzees spatially represent conspecifics’ adult and infant faces. Chimpanzees were tested using an identical matching-to-sample task with conspecific adult and infant face stimuli. Two comparison images were presented vertically (Experiment 1) or horizontally (Experiment 2). We analyzed whether the response time was influenced by the position and age category of the target stimuli, but there was no evidence of correspondence between space and adult/infant faces. Thus, evidence of the spatial representation of the age category was not found. However, we did find that the response time was consistently faster when they discriminated between adult faces than when they discriminated between infant faces in both experiments. This result is in line with a series of human face studies that suggest the existence of an “own-age bias.” As far as we know, this is the first report of asymmetric face processing efficiency between infant and adult faces in non-human primates. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Parochial altruism, taking individual costs to benefit the in-group and harm the out-group, has been proposed as one of the mechanisms underlying the human ability of large-scale cooperation. How parochial altruism has evolved remains unclear. In this review paper, we formulate a parochial cooperation model in small-scale groups and examine the model in wild chimpanzees. As suggested for human parochial altruism, we review evidence that the oxytocinergic system and in-group cooperation and cohesion during out-group threat are integral parts of chimpanzee collective action during intergroup competition. We expand this model by suggesting that chimpanzee parochial cooperation is supported by the social structure of chimpanzee groups which enables repeated interaction history and established social ties between co-operators. We discuss in detail the role of the oxytocinergic system in supporting parochial cooperation, a pathway that appears integral already in chimpanzees. The reviewed evidence suggests that prerequisites of human parochial altruism were probably present in the last common ancestor between Pan and Homo. © 2022 Royal Society Publishing.

ABSTRACT: An ongoing debate in animal behaviour research is whether food calls function to cooperatively inform others or provide the caller with competitive advantages. When feeding, chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, produce two types of call: context-specific, close-range ‘rough grunts’ and context-general, long-range ‘pant hoots’. We investigated this dual signalling behaviour by wild male chimpanzees that were either actively joining others or passively being joined in food trees, considering the effects of the audience composition and the type of food encountered. For arriving individuals, we found that pant hoot production was best explained by the absence of socially important individuals (i.e. social bond partners and/or high-ranking males), suggesting that callers were cooperatively informing them about food availability, probably to strengthen social relationships. In contrast, rough grunts were mostly produced by low-ranking individuals, suggesting they were part of competitive interactions to avoid aggression. For individuals already in a tree, we found that both rough grunt and pant hoot production were most common in low-ranking individuals reacting to the arrival of high-ranking males and there was no significant effect of the presence, or absence, of social bond partners. We discuss these patterns and conclude that, when chimpanzees enter a food tree, their vocal behaviour functions to mediate both cooperative and competitive interactions. © 2022 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Objective: To investigate the association of dental and cardiac disease in a cohort of captive chimpanzees Design: 12 captive chimpanzees underwent periodontal and cardiac examinations under anaesthesia during a relocation to a new enclosure. Blood samples were taken for analysis of circulating markers of cardiac health, nutritional status and isolation of neutrophils for functional assays. They were then observed for three years for signs of heart disease. Results: Although the chimpanzees displayed large quantities of supragingival plaque, they had low bleeding scores. Peripheral blood neutrophils responded to innate and adaptive immune stimuli. In the follow up period two animals died and post mortem confirmed heart disease. Levels of NT-proBNP were found to be high in chimpanzees that died from heart disease. Conclusions: Whilst there appeared to be a correlation between probing depth and age, there appeared to be no correlation between dental data and heart data in this cohort. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: For primates, the ability to efficiently detect threatening faces is highly adaptive; however, it is not clear exactly how faces are detected. This study investigated whether chimpanzees show search asymmetries for conspecific threatening faces featuring scream and bared teeth expressions. Five adult female chimpanzees participated in a series of touchscreen matching-to-sample visual search tasks. In Experiment 1, search advantages for scream versus neutral targets and scream versus bared teeth targets were found. A serial search strategy indicated greater difficulty in disengaging attention from scream versus neutral distractors. In Experiments 2a and 2b, search advantages for scream versus neutral targets remained when the mouth was darkened, suggesting that the brightness contrast of the mouth was not critical for the efficient detection of scream targets. In Experiments 3a and 3b, search advantages for inverted scream versus neutral targets disappeared, indicating configural processing. Together, exclusion of the brightness contrast of the mouth as a low-level perceptual confound, and evidence of configural processing, suggested the scream faces may have been perceived as threatening. However, the search advantage for scream faces is most likely explained by the presence of teeth, independently of threat. The study provides further support that an attentional bias toward threatening faces is a homologous trait, which can be traced back to at least the last common ancestor of Old World monkeys and apes. © 2021 American Psychological Association

ABSTRACT: Bone strength and the incidence and severity of skeletal disorders vary significantly among human populations, due in part to underlying genetic differentiation. While clinical models predict that this variation is largely deleterious, natural population variation unrelated to disease can go unnoticed, altering our perception of how natural selection has shaped bone morphologies over deep and recent time periods. Here, we conduct the first comparative population-based genetic analysis of the main bone structural protein gene, collagen type I α 1 (COL1A1), in clinical and 1000 Genomes Project datasets in humans, and in natural populations of chimpanzees. Contrary to predictions from clinical studies, we reveal abundant COL1A1 amino acid variation, predicted to have little association with disease in the natural population. We also find signatures of positive selection associated with intron haplotype structure, linkage disequilibrium, and population differentiation in regions of known gene expression regulation in humans and chimpanzees. These results recall how recent and deep evolutionary regimes can be linked, in that bone morphology differences that developed among vertebrates over 450 million years of evolution are the result of positive selection on subtle type I collagen functional variation segregating within populations over time.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees have consistent individual differences in behaviour, also referred to as personality. Similar to human personality structure, five dimensions are commonly found in chimpanzee studies that show evidence for convergent and predictive validity (Dominance, Openness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Reactivity/Undependability). These dimensions are to some extent heritable, indicating a genetic component that explains part of the variation in personality scores, but are also influenced by environmental factors, such as the early social rearing background of the individuals. In this study, we investigated the role of epigenetic modification of the dopamine receptor D2 gene (DRD2) as a potential mechanism underlying personality variation in 51 captive chimpanzees. We used previously collected personality trait rating data and determined levels of DRD2 CpG methylation in peripheral blood samples for these same individuals. Results showed that DRD2 methylation is most strongly associated with Extraversion, and that varying methylation levels at specific DRD2 sites are associated with changes in Extraversion in nursery-reared, but not mother-reared, individuals. These results highlight the role of dopaminergic signalling in chimpanzee personality, and indicate that environmental factors, such as social experiences early in life, can have long-lasting behavioural effects, potentially through modification of the epigenome. These findings add to the growing evidence demonstrating the importance of the experience-dependent methylome for the development of complex social traits like personality. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Here we show that sexual signaling affects patterns of female spatial association differently in chimpanzees and bonobos, indicating its relevance in shaping the respective social systems. Generally, spatial association between females often mirrors patterns and strength of social relationships and cooperation within groups. While testing for proposed differences in female-female associations underlying female coalition formation in the species of the genus Pan, we find only limited evidence for a higher female-female gregariousness in bonobos. While bonobo females exhibited a slightly higher average number of females in their parties, there is neither a species difference in the time females spent alone, nor in the number of female party members in the absence of sexually attractive females. We find that the more frequent presence of maximally tumescent females in bonobos is associated with a significantly stronger increase in the number of female party members, independent of variation in a behavioural proxy for food abundance. This indicates the need to look beyond ecology when explaining species differences in female sociality as it refutes the idea that the higher gregariousness among bonobo females is driven by ecological factors alone and highlights that the temporal distribution of female sexual receptivity is an important factor to consider when studying mammalian sociality. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT) has been reported for males of only a few mammalian species, including humans, albeit this scarcity might be an artefact of the difficulty of documenting it. We investigated NPT in 12 adult male chimpanzees living in an all-male group at Kumamoto Sanctuary, Japan. Recorded non-invasively with infrared video cameras across 72 nights (6 per individual), we observed NPT in two thirds of the individuals (8/12), with N = 46 events in total. More than three quarters occurred during a transition from sleep to wakefulness, suggesting NPT may be associated with rapid eye movement sleep, similar to humans. Masturbation occurred in conjunction with NPT, including the likely consumption of ejaculate, in 4-6 individuals. While detailing nocturnal erections in chimpanzees may help us to better understand this robust physiological phenomenon in humans, further comparative research is necessary to reconstruct its phylogenetic history. At present, our findings support hypothetical functional explanations such as the facilitation of nocturnal emissions in order to increase ejaculate quality or an increase in tissue oxygenation to prevent erectile dysfunction. © KONINKLIJKE BRILL NV, LEIDEN, 2022.

ABSTRACT: Objectives: Craniofacial fluctuating asymmetry (FA) refers to the random deviations from symmetry exhibited across the craniofacial complex and can be used as a measure of developmental instability for organisms with bilateral symmetry. This article addresses the lack of data on craniofacial FA in nonhuman primates by analyzing FA magnitude and variation in chimpanzees, gorillas, and macaques. We offer a preliminary investigation into how FA, as a proxy for developmental instability, varies within and among nonhuman primates. Materials and Methods: We generated 3D surface models of 121 crania from Pan troglodytes troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla gorilla, and Macaca fascicularis fascicularis. Using geometric morphometric techniques, the magnitude of observed FA was calculated and compared for each individual, sex, and taxon, along with the variation of FA across cranial regions and for each bilateral landmark. Results: Gorillas and macaques exhibited higher and more similar magnitudes of FA to each other than either taxon did to chimpanzees; variation in magnitude of FA followed this same trend. No significant differences were detected between sexes using pooled data across species, but sex did influence FA magnitude within taxa in gorillas. Further, variation in FA variance across cranial regions and by landmark was not distributed in any particular pattern. Conclusion: Possible environmentally induced causes for these patterns of FA magnitude include differences in growth rate and physiological stress experienced during life. Developmental stability may be greatest in chimpanzees in this sample. Additionally, these results point to appropriate landmarks for future FA analyses and may help suggest more urgent candidate taxa for conservation efforts. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT: Human and animal infections with bacteria of the genus Sarcina (family Clostridiaceae) are associated with gastric dilation and emphysematous gastritis. However, the potential roles of sarcinae as commensals or pathogens remain unclear. Here, we investigate a lethal disease of unknown etiology that affects sanctuary chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) in Sierra Leone. The disease, which we have named “epizootic neurologic and gastroenteric syndrome” (ENGS), is characterized by neurologic and gastrointestinal signs and results in death of the animals, even after medical treatment. Using a case-control study design, we show that ENGS is strongly associated with Sarcina infection. The microorganism is distinct from Sarcina ventriculi and other known members of its genus, based on bacterial morphology and growth characteristics. Whole-genome sequencing confirms this distinction and reveals the presence of genetic features that may account for the unusual virulence of the bacterium. Therefore, we propose that this organism be considered the representative of a new species, named “Candidatus Sarcina troglodytae”. Our results suggest that a heretofore unrecognized complex of related sarcinae likely exists, some of which may be highly virulent. However, the potential role of “Ca. S. troglodytae” in the etiology of ENGS, alone or in combination with other factors, remains a topic for future research. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Unlike the acoustic features of calls, the temporal patterns of call usage in nonhuman primates are highly flexible. Our recent studies suggest that vocal patterns and species social needs coevolved. Different patterns, for example calling alone by producing one or several calls in a sequence or interacting vocally with more or less call overlap, may serve different functions. Vocal turn-taking in particular may be key to understanding the possible link between vocal behavior and social life. Turn-taking is used flexibly in many primate species, notably during affiliative encounters, and follows social and temporal rules that evoke similarities with human conversations. We tested the influence of caller characteristics and production context on the vocal behavior of a captive group of 15 chimpanzees using 48h30 of scan and focal sampling. 84% of the 516 recorded utterances were isolated calls. When there were vocal interactions, overlapping calls prevailed (63%), mostly involving adult males pant-hooting. Chimpanzees mostly produced calls in series, and the higher-ranked the caller, the faster the speed of call delivery. The social importance of consecutive calling was supported by a higher rate of audience reaction when the number of calls increased, suggesting strategic use of message redundancy. However, social integration, age, and sex weakly influenced call rates and interaction patterns. Although this study concerns a single study group, the rarity of turn-taking supports findings for wild chimpanzees. Why chimpanzees do not display this vocal behavior, which is commonly observed in primates, including other apes, is still puzzling. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Behavioral freedom is becoming an increasingly important issue bridging animal welfare and conservation biology. This study focused on range size and spatiotemporal variation in Western chimpanzees, creating a novel index for behavioral freedom. Direct observations were conducted on a group of seven free-ranging chimpanzees in Bossou, Guinea, during 10-hr observation periods over 10 days, and on a group of five captive individuals at the Kumamoto Sanctuary during 7-hr observation periods over 7 days. Bossou chimpanzees showed dynamic ranging patterns; their range size was larger, and their day and time-of-day ranges did not generally overlap. Additionally, the average time-of-day range was 5.2 times greater than the day range. In contrast, sanctuary chimpanzees showed a static ranging pattern, with a smaller range size and a time-of-day range to day range ratio of 1.0. Therefore, the time-of-day range to day range ratio is a suitable quantitative index of behavioral freedom in chimpanzees. © 2021 The Author.

ABSTRACT: Previous research demonstrated that a language-trained chimpanzee recognized familiar English words in sine-wave and noise-vocoded forms (Heimbauer et al. Curr Biol 21:1210–1214, 2011). However, those results did not provide information regarding processing strategies of the specific acoustic cues to which the chimpanzee may have attended. The current experiments tested this chimpanzee and adult humans using sine-wave and noise-vocoded speech manipulated using specific sine-waves and a different number of noise bands, respectively. Similar to humans tested with the same stimuli, the chimpanzee was more successful identifying sine-wave speech when both SW1 and SW2 were present – the components that are modeled on formants F1 and F2 in the natural speech signal. Results with noise-vocoded speech revealed that the chimpanzee and humans performed best with stimuli that included four or five noise bands, as compared to those with three and two. Overall, amplitude and frequency modulation over time were important for identification of sine-wave and noise-vocoded speech, with further evidence that a nonhuman primate is capable of using top-down processes for speech perception when the signal is altered and incomplete. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The description of the calculation of metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint abduction and adduction was incorrect. It was originally described as the angle between the metacarpal and the projection of the phalangeal vector onto the plane of best fit of the metacarpals. This was not the case. The MCP adduction/abduction angle was calculated as the 3-D angle between the phalangeal vector projected onto the sagittal metacarpal plane (gray plane of Fig. 2) and the vector describing the actual position of the phalanges. The originally described calculation is sensitive to changes in MCP flexion and extension, whereas the calculation actually used is not. No data, analyses or conclusions are changed as a result of this; only the description of the calculation used in the Materials and Methods and the representation of this in Fig. 2 were incorrect. The corrected text in Materials and Methods (third to last sentence in ‘Metacarpophalangeal motion’) reads: ‘Adduction and abduction were calculated as the 3-D angle between the vector projection of the phalangeal markers onto the sagittal metacarpal plane (vpp_proj in Fig. 2C,D) and the actual vector defining each phalanx. This calculation returns a value for abduction and adduction that is insensitive to the degree of MCP flexion and extension.’ The original and corrected versions of Fig. 2 are shown below.

ABSTRACT: The marginal value theorem is an optimal foraging model that predicts how efficient foragers should respond to both their ecological and social environments when foraging in food patches, and it has strongly influenced hypotheses for primate behavior. Nevertheless, experimental tests of the marginal value theorem have been rare in primates and observational studies have provided conflicting support. As a step towards filling this gap, we test whether the foraging decisions of captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) adhere to the assumptions and qualitative predictions of the marginal value theorem. We presented 12 adult chimpanzees with a two-patch foraging environment consisting of both low-quality (i.e., low-food density) and high-quality (i.e., high-food density) patches and examined the effect of patch quality on their search behavior, foraging duration, marginal capture rate, and its proxy measures: giving-up density and giving-up time. Chimpanzees foraged longer in high-quality patches, as predicted. In contrast to predictions, they did not depress high-quality patches as thoroughly as low-quality patches. Furthermore, since chimpanzees searched in a manner that fell between systematic and random, their intake rates did not decline at a steady rate over time, especially in high-quality patches, violating an assumption of the marginal value theorem. Our study provides evidence that chimpanzees are sensitive to their rate of energy intake and that their foraging durations correlate with patch quality, supporting many assumptions underlying primate foraging and social behavior. However, our results question whether the marginal value theorem is a constructive model of chimpanzee foraging behavior, and we suggest a Bayesian foraging framework (i.e., combining past foraging experiences with current patch sampling information) as a potential alternative. More work is needed to build an understanding of the proximate mechanisms underlying primate foraging decisions, especially in more complex socioecological environments. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC

ABSTRACT: To understand how animals select resources we need to analyze selection at different spatial levels or scales in the habitat. We investigated which physical characteristics of trees (dimensions and structure, e.g., height, trunk diameter, number of branches) determined nesting selection by chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) on two different spatial scales: individual nesting trees and nesting sites. We also examined whether individual tree selection explained the landscape pattern of nesting site selection. We compared the physical characteristics of actual (N = 132) and potential (N = 242) nesting trees in nesting sites (in 15 plots of 25 m × 25 m) and of all trees in actual and potential nesting sites (N = 763 in 30 plots of 25 m × 25 m). We collected data in May and June 2003 in Issa, a dry and open savanna habitat in Tanzania. Chimpanzees selected both the site they used for nesting in the landscape and the trees they used to build nests within a nesting site, demonstrating two levels of spatial selection in nesting. Site selection was stronger than individual tree selection. Tree height was the most important variable for both nesting site and tree selection in our study, suggesting that chimpanzees selected both safe sites and secure trees for sleeping. © 2020, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Although chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are ripe fruit specialists, they sometimes consume other plant parts including subterranean organs like roots and tubers. Such plant parts, which include underground storage organs (USOs), have been found to play a key role in the diets of some chimpanzee populations as well as, potentially, our hominin ancestors. We report the confirmed consumption of subterranean plant organs of three species — sweet potatoes (Ipomoea batatas), yams (Dioscorea alata) and peanuts (Arachis hypogaea), as well as unconfirmed consumption of cassava (Manihot esculenta) — by chimpanzees in a human-dominated landscape in western Uganda. These observations point toward the dietary flexibility of chimpanzees inhabiting anthropogenic landscapes, though mechanisms of novel food acquisition, particularly for subterranean fruits and tubers, are not well understood. Dietary flexibility may help chimpanzees survive as natural forest resources disappear, but simultaneously may bring them into greater conflict with their human neighbours, thereby further imperilling them. © KONINKLIJKE BRILL NV, LEIDEN, 2022

ABSTRACT: Large brains and behavioural innovation are positively correlated, species-specific traits, associated with the behavioural flexibility animals need for adapting to seasonal and unpredictable habitats. Similar ecological challenges would have been important drivers throughout human evolution. However, studies examining the influence of environmental variability on within-species behavioural diversity are lacking despite the critical assumption that population diversification precedes genetic divergence and speciation. Here, using a dataset of 144 wild chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) communities, we show that chimpanzees exhibit greater behavioural diversity in environments with more variability — in both recent and historical timescales. Notably, distance from Pleistocene forest refugia is associated with the presence of a larger number of behavioural traits, including both tool and non-tool use behaviours. Since more than half of the behaviours investigated are also likely to be cultural, we suggest that environmental variability was a critical evolutionary force promoting the behavioural, as well as cultural diversification of great apes. © 2020, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Predictability of social interactions can be an important measure for the social complexity of an animal group. Predictability is partially dependent on how consistent interaction patterns are over time: does the behavior on 1 day explain the behavior on another? We developed a consistency measure that serves two functions: detecting which interaction types in a dataset are so inconsistent that including them in further analyses risks introducing unexplained error; and comparatively quantifying differences in consistency within and between animal groups. We applied the consistency measure to simulated data and field data for one group of sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys atys) and to groups of Western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) in the Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire, to test its properties and compare consistency across groups. The consistency measures successfully identified interaction types whose low internal consistency would likely create analytical problems. Species-level differences in consistency were less pronounced than differences within groups: in all groups, aggression and dominance interactions were the most consistent, followed by grooming; spatial proximity at different levels was much less consistent than directed interactions. Our consistency measure can facilitate decision making of researchers wondering whether to include interaction types in their analyses or social networks and allows us to compare interaction types within and between species regarding their predictability. © Copyright © 2021 Mielke, Preis, Samuni, Gogarten, Lester, Crockford and Wittig.

ABSTRACT: Understanding how visitor engagement with interpretation impacts on their attitudes to conservation is necessary to develop effective zoo-based conservation education. We examined whether facilitating an emotional connection between a visitor and an individual chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) was more successful at enhancing attitudes than standard zoo interpretation. Attitudes were assessed post visit using a 12-item questionnaire on predisposition toward nature, attitudes to chimpanzees, and conservation. Visitors at two chimpanzee exhibits were allocated to an emotion enhancement condition (n = 227) or a control condition (n = 203). At one exhibit, visitors were also allocated to an interactive task (location) without emotional enhancement (n = 69). Participants were also recruited to an online control condition (n = 216). Principal component analyses identified two components labeled as Naturalistic, which refers to interest and affection for wildlife and nature, and Humanistic, which refers to interest and affection for individual animals or species with anthropomorphic characteristics. At one exhibit, both Naturalistic and Humanistic attitudes were significantly more positive following the emotion enhancement condition than for the control condition. At the other exhibit, Naturalistic and Humanistic components did not differ between conditions, and there was no overall difference between online and on-site conditions. While emotional enhancement may be effective in promoting pro-conservation attitudes, this is dependent on contextual factors (e.g., exhibit design and interpretation). Attitudes were also influenced by stable visitor characteristics (pet ownership and zoo membership) and are therefore likely to prove difficult to change, at least during a single zoo visit. Visitor and animal characteristics, and the interpretation of the exhibit all shape the visitor experience; understanding these interactions is important in facilitating effective zoo conservation education. © 2021 International Society for Anthrozoology (ISAZ).

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Socioecological theories predict that, in mammals, feeding and mating competitions affect male and female energetic conditions differently but energetic studies investigating both sexes simultaneously are rare. We investigated the effect of socioecological factors on the energetic conditions of male and female western chimpanzees, a long-lived species with high degrees of male-male competition. We used behavioural data collected on one chimpanzee community in the Taï National Park over 12 months, phenological data and urinary c-peptide (UCP) measures, a marker of energy balance. We found a positive effect of food availability on UCP levels in both sexes. Dominance rank also affected chimpanzee UCP levels. High-ranking females had higher UCP levels than low-ranking ones but only in periods when no oestrus females were present in the community. In contrast, high-ranking males had higher UCP levels than low-ranking males in the presence of oestrus females but lower UCP levels in their absence. Our results suggest that oestrus female presence lessened the competitive advantages of high-ranking females in feeding competition and that low-ranking males bore higher energetic costs related to mating competition than high-ranking ones. Yet caution should apply in interpreting these results since the statistical model was only close to significance. High-ranking male and female chimpanzees spent significantly less energy. Furthermore, all chimpanzees significantly spent less time feeding and spent more energy when food availability was high. Finally, our behavioural measure of energy intake and expenditure did not correlate with UCP levels highlighting the value of non-invasive hormonal markers for field studies. Significance statement: General socioecological theories hypothesize that the social grouping dynamic and energetics of females are highly influenced by food competition, whereas in males, competition for sexual partners is more influential for these factors. Recent studies in the non-invasive physiological assessment of energy balance in primates have begun to test the implied relationship between chimpanzee socioecology and individual energetic condition, with inconsistent results. However, only a few studies have investigated this relationship concurrently for both sexes. Here, using non-invasive measures of energy balance in wild western chimpanzees, we found that the energetics of both males and females are related to ecological factors, such as food availability. However, female energy balance appears also to be related to increased male mating competition, as this can result in increased aggression directed from males to females, with apparent energetic costs for females. © 2020, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Structural variation (SV), including insertions and deletions (indels), is a primary mechanism of genome evolution. However, the mechanism by which SV contributes to epigenome evolution is poorly understood. In this study, we characterized the association between lineage-specific indels and epigenome differences between human and chimpanzee to investigate how SVs might have shaped the epigenetic landscape. By intersecting medium-to-large human-chimpanzee indels (20 bp-50 kb) with putative promoters and enhancers in cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs) and repressed regions in induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs), we found that 12% of indels overlap putative regulatory and repressed regions (RRRs), and 15% of these indels are associated with lineage-biased RRRs. Indel-associated putative enhancer and repressive regions are approximately 1.3 times and approximately three times as likely to be lineage-biased, respectively, as those not associated with indels. We found a twofold enrichment of medium-sized indels (20-50 bp) in CpG island (CGI)-containing promoters than expected by chance. Lastly, from human-specific transposable element insertions, we identified putative regulatory elements, including NR2F1-bound putative CNCC enhancers derived from SVAs and putative iPSC promoters derived from LTR5s. Our results show that different types of indels are associated with specific epigenomic diversity between human and chimpanzee.  © 2021 Zhuo et al.

ABSTRACT: Long-term primate field research programs contribute to the protection of endangered primate species and their vanishing habitats by informing and fostering local and international conservation programs. The Kibale Chimpanzee Project (KCP) has studied the Kanyawara community of wild chimpanzees continuously since 1987, investigating a wide range of behavioral, ecological, and physiological questions. The study area includes the northwest boundary of Kibale National Park, Uganda, and has experienced habitat change driven by multiple causes, including forest regeneration, an increasingly warmer and wetter climate, and impacts from the neighboring human population. Here, we review the history of research on Kanyawara chimpanzees and examine how their demography, diet, and social behavior have changed over the last 30+ years. While Kanyawara chimpanzees were protected from the major threats of poaching and habitat loss, respiratory diseases of human origin were a major source of mortality. Many individuals were also injured by wire hunting snares. Nevertheless, the study community has grown modestly in size, individuals have become increasingly gregarious, and birth rates have increased. These results are likely attributable to improved habitat productivity that can be traced to decades-long efforts by wildlife authorities and the associated research and conservation programs in Kibale. Overall, research has contributed both to understanding interactions among nutritional ecology, social behavior, physiology, and health of an endangered species, and also to conservation activities in the Kibale community through direct interventions, positive economic impacts, and conservation education programs. © 2020

ABSTRACT: The common chimpanzee Pan troglodytes is the closest extant relative of modern humans and is often used as a model organism to help understand prehistoric human behavior and ecology. Originally presumed herbivorous, chimpanzees have been observed hunting 24 species of birds, ungulates, rodents, and other primates, using an array of techniques from tools to group cooperation. Using the literature on chimpanzee hunting behavior and diet from 13 studies, we aimed to determine the prey preferences of chimpanzees. We extracted data on prey-specific variables such as targeted species, their body weight, and their abundance within the prey community, and hunter-specific variables such as hunting method, and chimpanzee group size and sex ratio. We used these data in a generalized linear model to determine what factors drive chimpanzee prey preference. We calculated a Jacobs’ index value for each prey species killed at two sites in Uganda and two sites in Tanzania. Chimpanzees prefer prey with a body weight of 7.6 ± 0.4 kg or less, which corresponds to animals such as juvenile bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus) and adult ashy red colobus monkeys (Piliocolobus tephrosceles). Sex ratio in chimpanzee groups is a main driver in developing these preferences, where chimpanzees increasingly prefer prey when in proportionally male-dominated groups. Prey preference information from chimpanzee research can assist conservation management programs by identifying key prey species to manage, as well as contribute to a better understanding of the evolution of human hunting behavior. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Signalling plays an important role in mediating social interactions in many animal species. For example, during approaches certain species produce ‘greetings’, which can take the form of vocal or visual signals, which reduce the probability of aggressive interactions and/or facilitate affiliation when approaching each other. However, in species where greetings comprise both vocal and visual signals, little is known about how the vocal component relates to the visual component or, in species with fission–fusion dynamics, to the time spent together by the dyad in the same subgroup prior to the approach. Similarly, in species with several acoustic variants of greeting calls, it is unclear whether different variants have different functions. We looked at the production of two acoustically distinct greeting call variants, low-fundamental frequency pant grunts and high-fundamental frequency pant barks, during approaches between two individuals in five communities of wild chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, in Uganda and Ivory Coast. More specifically, we explored the relationship between greeting call production and (1) aggressive and submissive interactions during the approach and (2) preceding and subsequent proximity levels between the involved individuals. Calls were more likely to be produced during aggressive interactions and were associated with postures and gestures linked to submission; these patterns were stronger when the utterance contained a pant bark rather than a pant grunt alone. The production of greeting calls was more likely soon after party fusion and was negatively related to subsequent proximity levels between the caller and receiver. These results expand our knowledge of greeting calls and imply that these calls might be used to re-establish dominance relationships after a period of separation, and that the function of these calls can be modulated by their specific acoustic variants and by visual signals that often accompany them. © 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ABSTRACT: Many animals engage in aggression, but chimpanzees stand out in terms of fatal attacks against adults of their own species. Most lethal aggression occurs between groups, where coalitions of male chimpanzees occasionally kill members of neighboring communities that are strangers. However, the first observed cases of lethal violence in chimpanzees, which occurred at Gombe, Tanzania in the 1970s, involved chimpanzees that once knew each other. They followed the only observed case of a permanent community fission in chimpanzees. A second permanent fission recently transpired at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda. Members of a large western subgroup gradually ceased associating peacefully with the rest of the community and started behaving antagonistically toward them. Affiliation effectively ended by 2017. Here, we describe two subsequent lethal coalitionary attacks by chimpanzees of the new western community on males of the now separate central community, one in 2018 and the second in 2019. The first victim was a young adult male that never had strong social ties with his attackers. The second was a high-ranking male that had often associated with the western subgroup before 2017; he groomed regularly with males there and formed coalitions with several. Other central males present at the start of the second attack fled, and others nearby did not come to the scene. Several western females joined in the second attack; we suggest that female–female competition contributed to the fission. This event highlighted the limits on protection afforded by long-term familiarity and the constraints on costly cooperation among male chimpanzees. © 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are, along with bonobos, humans’ closest living relatives. The advent of diffusion MRI tractography in recent years has allowed a resurgence of comparative neuroanatomical studies in humans and other primate species. Here we offer, in comparative perspective, the first chimpanzee white matter atlas, constructed from in vivo chimpanzee diffusion-weighted scans. Comparative white matter atlases provide a useful tool for identifying neuroanatomical differences and similarities between humans and other primate species. Until now, comprehensive fascicular atlases have been created for humans (Homo sapiens), rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), and several other nonhuman primate species, but never in a nonhuman ape. Information on chimpanzee neuroanatomy is essential for understanding the anatomical specializations of white matter organization that are unique to the human lineage. Copyright: © 2020 Bryant et al.

ABSTRACT: Social tolerance in group-living animals can be viewed as a counterweight against competitive interests necessary to obtain coexistence equilibrium and maintain group cohesion. As such, it forms an interesting phenomenon to study at the group level, but how can this be done most informatively? Here, we use three group-level co-feeding assays and social network analysis to study social tolerance in two groups of chimpanzees living under similar circumstances within a sanctuary to i) reassess whether social tolerance may be a group-specific parameter in chimpanzees and derive inferences about its long-term stability, and ii) compare the characteristics and resultant patterns between two established and one new assay. We show that the three assays expose the same (predicted) group-level differences in social tolerance as in the previous study eight years ago, thereby providing preliminary evidence for stability in group-specific levels of social tolerance in chimpanzees, despite changing group compositions. Furthermore, from an experimental point of view, we identify the new assay as more valid than the two established ones based on the consideration that resources may deplete at different rates across groups, which would consequently alter the need for tolerance differentially. We discuss implications for the study of social tolerance and highlight the importance of taking into account intraspecific variation in social animals. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Like many animals, adult male chimpanzees often compete for a limited number of mates. They fight other males as they strive for status that confers reproductive benefits and use aggression to coerce females to mate with them. Nevertheless, small-bodied, socially immature adolescent male chimpanzees, who cannot compete with older males for status nor intimidate females, father offspring. We investigated how they do so through a study of adolescent and young adult males at Ngogo in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Adolescent males mated with nulliparous females and reproduced primarily with these first-time mothers, who are not preferred as mating partners by older males. Two other factors, affiliation and aggression, also influenced mating success. Specifically, the strength of affiliative bonds that males formed with females and the amount of aggression males directed toward females predicted male mating success. The effect of male aggression toward females on mating success increased as males aged, especially when they directed it toward females with whom they shared affiliative bonds. These results mirror sexual coercion in humans, which occurs most often between males and females involved in close, affiliative relationships.  © 2021 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Wild female chimpanzees typically migrate to a neighbouring community at the onset of sexual maturity, a process that can be dangerous and unpredictable. To mitigate the risk of rejection in the new community, immigrants may employ several behavioural strategies. During the integration of two chimpanzee females at Royal Burgers' Zoo (Arnhem, The Netherlands) one of the immigrant females rapidly copied a local tradition - the crossed-arm walk - which has been present in the group for over 20 years. She copied the behaviour after meeting only one resident female, and showed the behaviour frequently throughout a 6-month observation period following the introduction. The other immigrant female never adopted the crossed-arm walk, highlighting the variation in behaviour by immigrants upon integration, as well as the potential associated consequences: in a separate observation period 2 years later, the female who copied the local tradition appeared more socially integrated than the other immigrant female. © THE AUTHORS, 2021.

ABSTRACT: Ensuring the welfare of captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) is crucial, in part because they can act as a conservation resource in the case of wild populations becoming extinct. One strategy often adopted to ensure animal welfare is environmental enrichment. In this study, we investigated the impact of different nesting materials (leaves and branches, long grass, cotton sheets, and shredded newspaper) upon the welfare of chimpanzees housed at Tacugama Chimpanzee Sanctuary (Sierra Leone). Data was collected on 20 subjects (aged 4 to 15 years) between November 2019 and March 2020. Welfare was based on individuals’ relative frequency of affiliative, abnormal and agonistic behaviours, as well as their social and behavioural competence. We found that individuals’ welfare was higher when presented with nesting materials (compared to the control and post-treatment conditions), particularly when given shredded newspaper, regardless of whether the material was presented separately or in conjunction with another. In addition, welfare was highest: during the morning (vs evening); in groups of older individuals (vs younger); with females engaging in less agonistic behaviours compared to males; and males displaying relatively higher behavioural competence. Our results support previous research that captive chimpanzees be supplied with destructible nesting materials, and demonstrate that synthetic enrichments can indeed have a more positive impact upon welfare than their natural alternatives. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The diagnosis of psychopathologies in nonhuman primates has received increasing interest in the last decade. However, only a limited number of categories of pathology have been diagnosed in some chimpanzees exclusively by using adapted versions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). With this in mind, we have created a questionnaire for the assessment of psychopathologies in 23 rescued ex-performer and ex-pet chimpanzees, based on an inclusion-exclusion adaptation of the fifth edition of the DSM. A total of 70 items were retained for the Chimpanzee Psychopathology Questionnaire in accordance with 3 main criteria: deleting those that could not be applied to the subjects, retaining those that could be applied, and adapted when needed. Principal component analysis and regularized exploratory factor analysis revealed 9 statistically significant factors with acceptable standards of interrater reliability and validity, accounting for 70.78 % of the variance. The factors obtained were clear and similar to some of the main categories of diagnosis for humans. Nevertheless, the limitation of the sample, the subjectivity in the creation of the questionnaire, as well as the theoretical and methodological challenges of the adaptation of the DSM to chimpanzees, led to the fact that this research should be considered as a first contact study on the identification of disorder categories in a group of chimpanzees. The main purpose of this study is to start a debate to promote research on psychopathology in chimpanzees and other animals. Likewise, it is important to emphasize that the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in chimpanzees could be translated to important pragmatic aspects for the species related to awareness, legal implications, welfare, and comparative psychopathology. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Though human activities are postulated to be the main drivers of the worldwide biodiversity crisis, humans are also suggested by some to be an important part of the solution to the crisis. How can such a paradox be best solved? This paradox requires an adaptive, context-specific, dynamic solution, at a fine-grained scale that varies by location. The Wild Chimpanzee Foundation (WCF) works on the ground in three West African countries: In Côte d'Ivoire, where bushmeat consumption is a recurrent and generalized threat to wildlife, WCF used live theater performances in the villages to address this issue. Post-activity evaluations revealed that the more often individuals have been part of such awareness activities, the less they will consume bushmeat. In nearby Liberia, where illegal miners have invaded many protected areas and intact forests, the WCF supports Community Watch Teams (CWT) to patrol the Sapo National Park with Forestry Development Authority staff. Within 11 months of its creation, the CWT patrols around and in the Sapo National Park resulted in thousands of illegal miners progressively leaving the national park. In Guinea, where coexistence between humans and primates has prevailed based on religious traditions, the WCF developed a strategic approach, as the Moyen-Bafing National Park contains about 5000 chimpanzees as well as some 255 villages. Therefore, we adopted an “integrated landscape approach” whereby the community activities are planned in combination with initiatives increasing forest regeneration and connectivity in high conservation value areas. Communities in northern Guinea confronted with dramatic fluctuations due to climatic changes welcomed such activities that help them become more resilient and adaptable to those alterations. In conclusion, evidence-based information at the local level helps to resolve the conservation paradox by adapting with the local communities' context-specific dynamic approaches to enhance the conservation of great apes. © 2020 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Social isolation is a key risk factor for the onset and progression of age-related disease and mortality in humans. Nevertheless, older people commonly have narrowing social networks, with influences from both cultural factors and the constraints of senescence. We evaluate evolutionarily grounded models by studying social aging in wild chimpanzees, a system where such influences are more easily separated than in humans, and where individuals are long-lived and decline physically with age. Methodology: We applied social network analysis to examine age-related changes in social integration in a 7+ year mixed-longitudinal dataset on 38 wild adult chimpanzees (22 females, 16 males). Metrics of social integration included social attractivity and overt effort (directed degree and strength), social roles (betweenness and local transitivity) and embeddedness (eigenvector centrality) in grooming networks. Results: Both sexes reduced the strength of direct ties with age (males in-strength, females out-strength). However, males increased embeddedness with age, alongside cliquishness. These changes were independent of age-related changes in social and reproductive status. Both sexes maintained highly repeatable inter-individual differences in integration, particularly in mixed-sex networks. Conclusions and implications: As in humans, chimpanzees appear to experience senescence-related declines in social engagement. However, male social embeddedness and overall sex differences were patterned more similarly to humans in non-industrialized versus industrialized societies. Such comparisons suggest common evolutionary roots to ape social aging and that social isolation in older humans may hinge on novel cultural factors of many industrialized societies. Lastly, individual and sex differences are potentially important mediators of successful social aging in chimpanzees, as in humans.  © 2021 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Although the phenomenon of termite fishing by chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) has historical and theoretical importance for primatology, we still have a limited understanding of how chimpanzees accomplish this activity, and in particular, about details of skilled actions and the nature of individual variation in fishing techniques. We examined movements, hand positions, grips, and other details from remote video footage of seven adult and subadult female chimpanzees using plant probes to extract Macrotermes muelleri termites from epigeal nests. Six chimpanzees used exclusively one hand (left or right) to grip the probe during termite fishing. All chimpanzees used the same repertoire of actions to insert, adjust, and withdraw the probe but differed in the frequency of use of particular actions. Chimpanzees have been described as eating termites in two ways—directly from the probe or by sweeping them from the probe with one hand. We describe a third technique: sliding the probe between the digits of one stationary hand as the probe is extracted from the nest. The sliding technique requires complementary bimanual coordination (extracting with one hand and grasping lightly with the other, at the same time). We highlight the importance of actions with two hands—one gripping, one assisting—in termite fishing and discuss how probing techniques are correlated with performance. Additional research on digital function and on environmental, organismic, and task constraints will further reveal manual dexterity in termite fishing. © 2020 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Early-life experiences may considerably affect the behavioural patterns of adult primates. Particularly, atypical rearing practices might lead to abnormal behaviours and social-sexual deficiencies in captive, adult non-human primates. We conducted behavioural observations of mother-reared (n = 5) and hand-reared (n = 6) adult chimpanzees in a social group at Parco Natura Viva, Italy. We used continuous focal animal sampling to collect behavioural data focusing on individual and social behaviours. We found that all study subjects performed individual and social species-specific behaviours. However, mother-reared chimpanzees performed locomotion and affiliative behaviours significantly more than hand-reared subjects. In addition to these species-typical behaviours, hand-reared chimpanzees showed significantly more abnormal behaviours than mother-reared subjects. Therefore, these findings suggest that hand-rearing could have wide-reaching effects on the behavioural repertoire in adult zoo-housed chimpanzees. Hence, even if sometimes human intervention in rearing may be necessary to ensure the survival of captive infant chimpanzees, our results suggest that zoo-housed chimpanzees might benefit from minimised human-animal interactions and exposure to conspecifics throughout their development. These suggestions should be implemented in regular husbandry practices. © 2021 S. Karger AG. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: This paper documents a community of eastern chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii Giglioli, 1872) inhabiting three relict forest fragments situated on the Lake Albert escarpment, down the Ituri highlands, of eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The area explored had a combined forested surface of ±18.15 km2 in 2017, shrinking by 1.2% per year between 2010 and 2015. Between 2015 and 2017, we found 160 chimpanzee nests along 37.6 km of pilot walks, some up to 2,000 m altitude. Another 123 nests logged along 6.7 km transects led to an estimate of chimpanzee density of 4.62 weaned individuals per square kilometer of forest habitat. Camera-trap images and direct observations revealed that this community is comprised of a minimum of 42 weaned individuals, which translates into an estimated density of 2.3 chimpanzees per square kilometer. The increasing rate of forest degradation threatens to erode the cultural and genetic diversity of nonhuman primates in eastern DRC; the local people however exhibit willingness to establish a community managed reserve. We hope that this report will lead to the recognition of this site as a Chimpanzee Conservation Unit, facilitating further research in these “Relict Altitude Forests Fragments of the Albert Lake Escarpment” (or RAFALE landscape) and the Ituri highlands where other undocumented chimpanzee communities occur. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Urine contains multiple water-soluble hormones, which are valuable non-invasive biomarkers for the monitoring of reproductive status and health. An effective method for drying urine on filter paper was previously developed to preserve wildlife urine samples where electrical equipment was not available for this; however, the stability of samples preserved in this way remains to be verified. Here, we developed and validated a method to elute multiple water-soluble reproductive hormones from filter paper that had been stored for an extended period of time. Aliquots of urine from chimpanzees were adsorbed on filter papers, air dried and stored for 1 year at room temperature. Estrone-3-conjugate (E1C), pregnanediol-3-glucuronide (PdG), estriol-3-glucuronide (E3G), and chorionic gonadotropin (CG) were eluted into deionized water from the filter papers and measured using enzyme immunoassays (EIAs). The mean recoveries of E1C, PdG, and creatinine from filter papers stored for 1 year were 69.5%, 128.7%, and 83.8%, respectively. The profiles of E1C and PdG from preserved filter papers significantly correlated with those derived from a direct analysis of the frozen urine of menstruating chimpanzees. We detected E3G and CG from 1-year-old filter papers for urine collected during early pregnancy, but the recovery of E3G was low and CG profiles did not correlate with those of the original frozen urine samples. The method proposed here for the elution and measurement of reproductive hormones in urine preserved for a long period of time on filter paper provides a practical and simple way to monitor the reproductive status of chimpanzees. We propose that this method can also be utilized in field studies of other wild nonhuman primates. © 2020, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of pandemic coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), is a global priority. Here, we aim to develop novel SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on a derivative of less commonly used rare adenovirus serotype AdC68 vector. Three vaccine candidates were constructed expressing either the full-length spike (AdC68-19S) or receptor-binding domain (RBD) with two different signal sequences (AdC68-19RBD and AdC68-19RBDs). Single-dose intramuscular immunization induced robust and sustained binding and neutralizing antibody responses in BALB/c mice up to 40 weeks after immunization, with AdC68-19S being superior to AdC68-19RBD and AdC68-19RBDs. Importantly, immunization with AdC68-19S induced protective immunity against high-dose challenge with live SARS-CoV-2 in a golden Syrian hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccinated animals demonstrated dramatic decreases in viral RNA copies and infectious virus in the lungs, as well as reduced lung pathology compared to the control animals. Similar protective effects were also found in rhesus macaques. Taken together, these results confirm that AdC68-19S can induce protective immune responses in experimental animals, meriting further development toward a human vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. © Copyright © 2021 Li, Guo, Lu, Zhou, Shi, Shi, Cheng, Liang, Liu, Wang, Wang, Wang, Fu, Xing, Wang, Ju, Liu, Lau, Jia, Tong, Yuan, Guo, Qi, Zhang, Huang, Chen, Zhang, Chen, Peng, Zhou and Zhang.

ABSTRACT: Infectious disease is recognized as the greatest threat to the endangered chimpanzees made famous by the groundbreaking work of Dr. Jane Goodall at Gombe National Park (GNP), Tanzania. The permeable boundary of this small protected area allows for regular wildlife–human and wildlife–domestic animal overlap, which may facilitate cross-species transmission of pathogens and antimicrobial resistance. Few studies have examined the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in wild ape populations. We used molecular techniques to investigate the presence of genes conferring resistance to sulfonamides (often used to treat diarrheal illness in human settings in this region) and tetracycline (used in the past—though much less so now) in fecal specimens from humans, domestic animals, chimpanzees, and baboons in and around GNP. We also tested stream water used by these groups. Sulfonamide resistance was common in humans (74%), non-human primates (43%), and domestic animals (17%). Tetracycline resistance was less common in all groups: humans (14%), non-human primates (3%), and domestic animals (6%). Sul resistance genes were detected from 4/22 (18%) of streams sampled. Differences in sul gene frequencies did not vary by location in humans nor in chimpanzees. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Mothers provide indispensable care for infants in many mammalian species. In some long-lived species, the maternal-offspring bond persists after infancy with mothers continuing to provide resources and social support to their adult progeny. Maternal presence is associated with fitness benefits through adolescence for male chimpanzees despite the fact that mature males dominate females and form their strongest bonds with other males. How mothers support grown sons is unknown, because few studies have examined developmental shifts in mother-son relationships during adolescence and adulthood. We investigated social interactions between 29 adolescent (9–15 years) and young adult male (16–20 years) chimpanzees and their mothers at Ngogo in Kibale National Park, Uganda, over 3 years. All males under 12 years old had their mother as their top grooming and proximity partner, as did one-third of the young adult males. As males grew older, the amount of time they associated with, maintained proximity to, groomed with, and kept track of their mothers while traveling decreased. When males were together in the same party as their mothers, however, young adult males affiliated with their mothers as frequently as did adolescent males, with sons initiating the majority of these interactions. In contrast to adult sons, however, adolescent sons became distressed when separated from mothers and relied on their mothers for agonistic support and reassurance after conflicts. These findings indicate that the chimpanzee maternal-offspring bond continues but changes through adolescence and adulthood, with mothers remaining occasional social companions for most adult sons and frequent companions for some. Significance statement: Mammalian mothers protect and provision their infants, and in some species, mothers provide social support for their adult offspring. The importance of mothers in the lives of adult sons is clear in humans and in one of our closest relatives, bonobos. Here we show mothers are also important social partners for sons throughout adolescence and into young adulthood in chimpanzees. Despite prevailing knowledge that adult males are key alliance partners for male chimpanzees, we demonstrate that male chimpanzees maintain social bonds with their mothers into adulthood. We also suggest that social bonds reflect not only the total time spent together, but what animals do during those times, as many young adults rarely groomed their mothers, but at times when they were in the same subgroup with her, they did so frequently. Future research will assess the physiological, psychological, and reproductive benefits of such mother-son bonds. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Many animals engage in sociosexual behaviour, including that between same-sex pairs. Bonobos (Pan paniscus) are famous for their sociosexual behaviour, but chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) apparently do not engage in sociosexual behaviour frequently. However, sociosexual behaviour in chimpanzees may have been overlooked. We observed 584 instances of sociosexual behaviour in chimpanzees at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda during three years of study. All ages and sexes engaged in sociosexual behaviour, which included mounting, touching of genitals, and pressing genitals together. Most sociosexual behaviour was between adult males. Sociosexual behaviour was often during tense contexts, such as subgroup reunions and during territorial behaviour. Among males, grooming and dominance rank relationships do not explain patterns of sociosexual behaviour. Although sociosexual behaviour may be less frequent in chimpanzees than in bonobos, and bonobos remain distinct in their genito-genital rubbing, our findings suggest that sociosexual behaviour is a regular part of chimpanzee behaviour. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2021.

ABSTRACT: Across vertebrates, high social status affords preferential access to resources, and is expected to correlate positively with health and longevity. Increasing evidence, however, suggests that although dominant females generally enjoy reduced exposure to physiological and psychosocial stressors, dominant males do not. Here we test the hypothesis that costly mating competition by high-ranking males results in chronic, potentially harmful elevations in glucocorticoid production. We examined urinary glucocorticoids (n = 8029 samples) in a 20-year longitudinal study of wild male chimpanzees (n = 20 adults) in the Kanyawara community of Kibale National Park, Uganda. We tested whether glucocorticoid production was associated with dominance rank in the long term, and with mating competition and dominance instability in the short term. Using mixed models, we found that both male aggression and glucocorticoid excretion increased when the dominance hierarchy was unstable, and when parous females were sexually available. Glucocorticoid excretion was positively associated with male rank in stable and unstable hierarchies, and in mating and non-mating contexts. Glucorticoids increased with both giving and receiving aggression, but giving aggression was the primary mechanism linking elevated glucocorticoids with high rank. Glucocorticoids also increased with age. Together these results show that investment in male-male competition increases cumulative exposure to glucocorticoids, suggesting a long-term tradeoff with health that may constrain the ability to maintain high status across the life course. Our data suggest that the relationship between social rank and glucocorticoid production often differs in males and females owing to sex differences in the operation of sexual selection. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees, like all great ape species, have experienced a dramatic decline in global numbers during the past decades. The degradation, fragmentation and loss of suitable habitat impede chimpanzee movements, reducing the potential for dispersal and thus population viability. In Tanzania, 90% of the 2000–3000 remaining chimpanzees are found within the Greater Mahale Ecosystem (GME), the majority of which live at low densities outside of national park boundaries. Recent genetic analyses have identified potential boundaries between the northern and southern populations of the GME. Using landscape connectivity modelling, we aimed to clarify population connectivity across this vast ecosystem (>20,000 km2) and assess change over time. We developed habitat suitability models to create an index of habitat selection by chimpanzees and mapped connectivity using circuit theory. Our results suggest that, in recent history (1973), the entire ecosystem was linked by a series of corridors showing a high likelihood of chimpanzee movement. Our analysis also reveals a reduction of connectivity by 2017 impacting the two corridors linking the northern and southern GME. When projected to 2027, areas contributing to connectivity are predicted to continue to decline, threatening all available corridors between the northern and southern GME. By modelling connectivity across time, we were able to identify key areas to focus conservation efforts to maintain population viability within the largest chimpanzee population in Tanzania. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Uncertainty can arise in interactions with both social partners and nonliving objects. Previous research has shown that humans display higher aversion to uncertainty arising from social interactions than to uncertainty caused by interactions with objects such as gambling machines, and that this difference may be mediated by betrayal aversion. We investigated whether chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, differentiate between social and nonsocial forms of uncertainty. Subjects participated in two experiments, each involving a social and a nonsocial condition. In both experiments, choosing the safe option resulted in immediate access to low-value food. Choosing the uncertain option could result in access to high-value food, but only if the partner (social condition) or a machine (nonsocial condition) proved trustworthy. In experiment 1, where chimpanzees had no prior information on reciprocation rates (i.e. decided under uncertainty), chimpanzees were less likely to choose the uncertain option when they interacted with a partner than with a machine. When they did choose the uncertain option, chimpanzees also hesitated longer in the social condition. In experiment 2, where chimpanzees had learned the statistical probabilities on reciprocation rates (i.e. decided under risk), they did not distinguish between social and nonsocial situations and were generally risk averse. These results suggest that chimpanzees are more averse to engaging in uncertain choices when the source of uncertainty is a conspecific than when it is a machine; when confronted with risky choices, chimpanzees show no such tendency. © 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ABSTRACT: Human vocal ontogeny is considered to be a process whereby a large repertoire of discrete sounds seemingly emerges from a smaller number of acoustically graded vocalizations. While adult chimpanzee vocal behavior is highly graded, its developmental trajectory is poorly understood. In the present study, we therefore examined the size and structure of the chimpanzee vocal repertoire at different stages of ontogeny. Audio recordings were collected on infant (N = 13) and juvenile (N = 13) semi-wild chimpanzees at Chimfunshi Wildlife Orphanage, Zambia, using focal and ad libitum sampling. All observed call types were acoustically measured. These were predominantly grunts, whimpers, laughs, screams, hoos, and barks and squeaks. A range of spectral and temporal acoustic parameters were extracted, and fuzzy c-means clustering was used to quantify the size and structure of the repertoire. The infant and juvenile vocal repertoires were both best described with the same number of clusters. However, compared to infants, juvenile call clusters were less distinct from one another and could be extracted only when a low level of overlap between call clusters was permitted. Moreover, the acoustic overlap between call clusters was significantly higher for juveniles. Overall, this pattern shows greater acoustic overlap in juvenile vocalizations compared to infants, suggesting a trend toward increased acoustic gradation in chimpanzee vocal ontogeny. This may imply in contrast to humans, chimpanzees become increasingly proficient in using graded signals effectively rather than developing a larger repertoire of more discrete sounds in ontogeny. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The link between dietary antioxidants and oxidative status has been studied extensively in humans. Surprisingly, comparative data are not available from closely related species, such as chimpanzees, which evolved in environments characterized by strong fluctuations in the availability and quality of vegetable food sources. We tested the hypothesis that an abrupt decrease in dietary antioxidants would increase oxidative damages in captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), while a rapid increase in antioxidant intake would decrease oxidative damages accrued while on the low-antioxidant diet. An abrupt decline of dietary antioxidants increased urinary levels of lipid peroxides and of oxidative DNA damage but not of 8-isoprostanes. In contrast, an increased intake of dietary antioxidants did not affect the oxidative status. Chimpanzees that were both older and with a higher dominance rank had lower urinary levels of lipid peroxides and of DNA damage as compared with younger chimpanzees. Neither individual sex nor proportion of time being groomed explained any variation in all three markers of oxidative status. Finally, we found significant within-individual repeatability of all markers of oxidative status over the course of the experiment, suggesting a significant contribution of individual history to molding oxidative status. Our results show that antioxidant intake plays a nonnegligible role in the regulation of oxidative status homeostasis in our closest relatives, the chimpanzees. Our work also suggests that rapid short-term increases in antioxidant intake might not have the desired immediate impact on oxidative status, such as in the case of clinical interventions or training programs. © 2021 American Physiological Society.

ABSTRACT: While comparative functional genomic studies have shown that inter-species differences in gene expression can be explained by corresponding inter-species differences in genetic and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, co-transcriptional mechanisms, such as alternative polyadenylation (APA), have received little attention. We characterized APA in lymphoblastoid cell lines from six humans and six chimpanzees by identifying and estimating usage for 44,432 polyadenylation sites (PAS) in 9,518 genes. Although APA is largely conserved, 1,705 genes showed significantly different PAS usage (FDR 0.05) between species. Genes with divergent APA also tend to be differentially expressed, are enriched among genes showing differences in protein translation, and can explain a subset of observed inter-species protein expression differences that do not differ at the transcript level. Finally, we found that genes with a dominant PAS, which is used more often than other PAS, are particularly enriched for differentially expressed genes. © 2021, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

ABSTRACT: A safe and effective vaccine is urgently needed to control the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. Four adenovirus-vectored vaccines expressing spike (S) protein have been approved for use. Here, we generated several recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus (AdC7) vaccines expressing S, receptor-binding domain (RBD), or tandem-repeat dimeric RBD (RBD-tr2). We found vaccination via either intramuscular or intranasal route was highly immunogenic in mice to elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses. AdC7-RBD-tr2 showed higher antibody responses compared to either AdC7-S or AdC7-RBD. Intranasal administration of AdC7-RBD-tr2 additionally induced mucosal immunity with neutralizing activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Either single-dose or two-dose mucosal administration of AdC7-RBD-tr2 protected mice against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, with undetectable subgenomic RNA in lung and relieved lung injury. AdC7-RBD-tr2-elicted sera preserved the neutralizing activity against the circulating variants, especially the Delta variant. These results support AdC7-RBD-tr2 as a promising COVID-19 vaccine candidate. © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: The biological embedding model (BEM) suggests that fitness costs of maternal loss arise when early-life experience embeds long-term alterations to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity. Alternatively, the adaptive calibration model (ACM) regards physiological changes during ontogeny as short-term adaptations. Both models have been tested in humans but rarely in wild, long-lived animals. We assessed whether, as in humans, maternal loss had short-and long-term impacts on orphan wild chimpanzee urinary cortisol levels and diurnal urinary cortisol slopes, both indicative of HPA axis functioning. Immature chimpanzees recently orphaned and/or orphaned early in life had diurnal cortisol slopes reflecting heightened activation of the HPA axis. However, these effects appeared short-term, with no consistent differences between orphan and non-orphan cortisol profiles in mature males, suggesting stronger support for the ACM than the BEM in wild chimpan-zees. Compensatory mechanisms, such as adoption, may buffer against certain physiological effects of maternal loss in this species. © Girard-Buttoz et al.

ABSTRACT: Fission-fusion dynamics have evolved in a broad range of animal taxa and are thought to allow individuals to mitigate feeding competition. While this is the principal benefit of fission-fusion, few studies have evaluated its costs. We compared gregariousness, foraging budgets, and social budgets between lactating bonobos and chimpanzees from wild populations to evaluate potential costs. Both species exhibit fission-fusion dynamics, but chimpanzees, particularly in East African populations, appear to experience higher feeding competition than bonobos. We expected lactating chimpanzees to be less gregarious than lactating bonobos; reduced gregariousness should allow lactating chimpanzees to mitigate the costs of higher feeding competition without requiring more foraging effort. However, we expected the reduced gregariousness of lactating chimpanzees to limit their time available for affiliative interactions. Using long-Term data from LuiKotale bonobos and Gombe chimpanzees, we found that lactating chimpanzees were indeed less gregarious than lactating bonobos, while feeding and travel time did not differ between species. Contrary to our predictions, lactating females did not differ in social interaction time, and lactating chimpanzees spent proportionately more time interacting with individuals other than their immature offspring. Our results indicate that lactating chimpanzees can maintain social budgets comparable to lactating bonobos despite reduced gregariousness and without incurring additional foraging costs. We discuss potential explanations for why lactating bonobos are more gregarious.  © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

ABSTRACT: Gene conversion is GC-biased across a wide range of taxa. Large palindromes on mammalian sex chromosomes undergo frequent gene conversion that maintains arm-to-arm sequence identity greater than 99%, which may increase their susceptibility to the effects of GC-biased gene conversion. Here, we demonstrate a striking history of GC-biased gene conversion in 12 palindromes conserved on the X chromosomes of human, chimpanzee, and rhesus macaque. Primate X-chromosome palindrome arms have significantly higher GC content than flanking single-copy sequences. Nucleotide replacements that occurred in human and chimpanzee palindrome arms over the past 7 million years are one-and-a-half times as GC-rich as the ancestral bases they replaced. Using simulations, we show that our observed pattern of nucleotide replacements is consistent with GC-biased gene conversion with a magnitude of 70%, similar to previously reported values based on analyses of human meioses. However, GC-biased gene conversion since the divergence of human and rhesus macaque explains only a fraction of the observed difference in GC content between palindrome arms and flanking sequence, suggesting that palindromes are older than 29 million years and/or had elevated GC content at the time of their formation. This work supports a greater than 2:1 preference for GC bases over AT bases during gene conversion and demonstrates that the evolution and composition of mammalian sex chromosome palindromes is strongly influenced by GC-biased gene conversion. © The Author(s) 2021.

ABSTRACT: A key component of economic decisions is the integration of information about reward outcomes and probabilities in selecting between competing options. In many species, risky choice is influenced by the magnitude of available outcomes, probability of success and the possibility of extreme outcomes. Chimpanzees are generally regarded to be risk-seeking. In this study, we examined two aspects of chimpanzees' risk preferences: first, whether setting the value of the non-preferred outcome of a risky option to zero changes chimpanzees' risk preferences, and second, whether individual risk preferences are stable across two different measures. Across two experiments, we found chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes, n = 23) as a group to be risk-neutral to risk-avoidant with highly stable individual risk preferences. We discuss how the possibility of going empty-handed might reduce chimpanzees' risk-seeking relative to previous studies. This malleability in risk preferences as a function of experimental parameters and individual differences raises interesting questions about whether it is appropriate or helpful to categorize a species as a whole as risk-seeking or risk-avoidant.

ABSTRACT: Understanding the interactions between local people and chimpanzees is crucial to develop sustainable wildlife conservation strategies and management policy in the Mbam-Djerem National Park (MDNP). The MDNP covers about 416,512 ha and shelters the Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes ellioti) being the most endangered of all currently recognized chimpanzee subspecies. Close to 30,000 people live in the periphery of the MDNP and depend on the park’s resources for subsistence. We investigated the extent of, and factors leading to, the interactions between people and chimpanzees through a socio-economic survey focusing on households (124) and individual interviews (38) in 30% of villages around MDNP. About 95% of the respondents stated that human–wildlife conflict is an issue around MDNP. Access to resources (78.9%), crop damage (84%), and animal attack (11.3%) were the main sources of conflicts. The ground squirrel Xerus erythropus (59.7%), the green monkey Chlorocebus aethiops (20.2%), chimpanzees (7.3%) and baboons Papio anubis (5.6%) were identified as the main conflict animals and the destroyed crops included peanuts (70.2%), maize (15%) and cassava (5%). The population perceptions differed between the park’s four sectors and were significantly influenced by education and the main livelihood activity. The study also provided quantitative evidence on the role of personal and religious beliefs on the behavior towards chimpanzees. Our findings suggest that the improvement of income-generating activities and education will contribute to strengthening the conservation of chimpanzees. © The Author(s) 2021.

ABSTRACT: Survival in primates is facilitated by commensal gut microbes that ferment otherwise indigestible plant matter, resist colonization by pathogens, and train the developing immune system.1,2 However, humans are unique among primates in that we consume highly digestible foods, wean early, mature slowly, and exhibit high lifelong investments in maintenance.3–6 These adaptations suggest that lifetime trajectories of human-microbial relationships could differ from those of our closest living relatives. Here, we profile the gut microbiota of 166 wild chimpanzees aged 8 months to 67 years in the Kibale National Park, Uganda and compare the patterns of gut microbial maturation to those previously observed in humans. We found that chimpanzee gut microbial alpha-diversity, composition, density, interindividual variation, and within-individual change over time varied significantly with age. Notably, gut microbial signatures in infants <2 years old were distinct across all five metrics. Infant chimpanzee guts were enriched in some of the same taxa prevalent in infant humans (e.g., Bifidobacterium, Streptococcus, and Bacteroides), and chimpanzee gut microbial communities, like those of humans, exhibited higher interindividual variation in infancy versus later in life. However, in direct contrast to human infants, chimpanzee infants harbored surprisingly high-diversity rather than low-diversity gut bacterial communities compared with older conspecifics. These data indicate differential trajectories of gut microbiota development in humans and chimpanzees that are consistent with interspecific differences in lactation, diet, and immune function. Probing the phenotypic consequences of differential early-life gut microbial diversity in chimpanzees and other primates will illuminate the life history impacts of the hominid-microbiome partnership. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The description of the calculation of metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint abduction and adduction was incorrect. It was originally described as the angle between the metacarpal and the projection of the phalangeal vector onto the plane of best fit of the metacarpals. This was not the case. The MCP adduction/abduction angle was calculated as the 3-D angle between the phalangeal vector projected onto the sagittal metacarpal plane (gray plane of Fig. 2) and the vector describing the actual position of the phalanges. The originally described calculation is sensitive to changes in MCP flexion and extension, whereas the calculation actually used is not. No data, analyses or conclusions are changed as a result of this; only the description of the calculation used in the Materials and Methods and the representation of this in Fig. 2 were incorrect. The corrected text in Materials and Methods (third to last sentence in ‘Metacarpophalangeal motion’) reads: ‘Adduction and abduction were calculated as the 3-D angle between the vector projection of the phalangeal markers onto the sagittal metacarpal plane (vpp_proj in Fig. 2C,D) and the actual vector defining each phalanx. This calculation returns a value for abduction and adduction that is insensitive to the degree of MCP flexion and extension.’ The original and corrected versions of Fig. 2 are shown below.

ABSTRACT: Primates engage in a variety of complex social behaviors. Broadly speaking, these social behaviors can range from agonistic to affiliative depending on the context of a given interaction and a variety of other factors such as the sex, age, familiarity, and rank of individuals. Social interactions of any kind-whether cooperative or prosocial, as they is often termed, or conflict-and aggression-based, often termed antisocial-are based on the individual's personality and cognitive traits and are manifest in their communication and behaviors directed toward others. (Chapter 5 discusses the problems associated with this terminology.) In other words, similar to humans, within different primate groups there are individual differences in the frequency of behaviors that reflect the range of social behaviors that are expressed during social interactions. Understanding how or why this cluster of traits varies among individuals is therefore important for understanding social interactions. It is now clear that one source of individual variation in both competitive and cooperative behavior is genes. Two of the most widely studied are genes that regulate the receptor distribution of oxytocin (OXTR) and vasopressin (AVPRA, AVPR1B and AVPR2).

ABSTRACT: Background: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) data acquisition protocols are well-established on modern high-field clinical scanners for human studies. However, these protocols are not suitable for the chimpanzee (or other large-brained mammals) because of its substantial difference in head geometry and brain volume compared with humans. Therefore, an optimal dMRI data acquisition protocol dedicated to chimpanzee neuroimaging is needed. Methods: A multi-shot (4 segments) double spin-echo echo-planar imaging (MS-EPI) sequence and a single-shot double spin-echo EPI (SS-EPI) sequence were optimized separately for in vivo dMRI data acquisition of chimpanzees using a clinical 3T scanner. Correction for severe susceptibility-induced image distortion and signal drop-off of the chimpanzee brain was performed and evaluated using FSL software. DTI indices in different brain regions and probabilistic tractography were compared. A separate DTI data set from n=34 chimpanzees (13 to 56 years old) was collected using the optimal protocol. Age-related changes in diffusivity indices of optic nerve fibers were evaluated. Results: The SS-EPI sequence acquired dMRI data of the chimpanzee brain with approximately doubled the SNR as the MS-EPI sequence given the same scan time. The quality of white matter fiber tracking from the SS-EPI data was much higher than that from MS-EPI data. However, quantitative analysis of DTI indices showed no difference in most ROIs between the SS-EPI and MS-EPI sequences. The progressive evolution of diffusivity indices of optic nerves indicated mild changes in fiber bundles of chimpanzees aged 40 years and above. Conclusion: The single-shot EPI-based acquisition protocol provided better image quality of dMRI for chimpanzee brains and is recommended for in vivo dMRI study or clinical diagnosis of chimpanzees (or other large animals) using a clinical scanner. Also, the tendency of FA decrease or diffusivity increase in the optic nerve of aged chimpanzees was seen but did not show significant age-related changes, suggesting aging may have less impact on optic nerve fiber integrity of chimpanzees, in contrast to previous results for both macaque monkeys and humans. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees are the species most closely related to humans, yet age-related changes in brain and cognition remain poorly understood. The lack of studies on age-related changes in cognition in chimpanzees is particularly unfortunate in light of the recent evidence demonstrating that this species naturally develops Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology. Here, we tested 213 young, middle-aged, and elderly captive chimpanzees on the primate cognitive test battery (PCTB), a set of 13 tasks that assess physical and social cognition in nonhuman primates. A subset of these chimpanzees (n = 146) was tested a second time on a portion of the PCTB tasks as a means of evaluating longitudinal changes in cognition. Cross-sectional analyses revealed a significant quadratic association between age and cognition with younger and older chimpanzees performing more poorly than middle-aged individuals. Longitudinal analyses showed that the oldest chimpanzees at the time of the first test showed the greatest decline in cognition, although the effect was mild. The collective data show that chimpanzees, like other nonhuman primates, show age-related decline in cognition. Further investigations into whether the observed cognitive decline is associated with AD pathologies in chimpanzees would be invaluable in understanding the comparative biology of aging and neuropathology in primates. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC

ABSTRACT: The ultimatum game (UG) is widely used to investigate our sense of fairness, a key characteristic that differentiates us from our closest living relatives, bonobos and chimpanzees. Previous studies found that, in general, great apes behave as rational maximizers in the UG. Proposers tend to choose self-maximizing offers, while responders accept most non-zero offers. These studies do not rule out the possibility that apes can behave prosocially to improve the returns for themselves and others. However, this has never been well studied. In this study, we offer chimpanzee and bonobo proposers the possibility of taking into account the leverage of responders over the offers they receive. This leverage takes the form of access to alternatives for responders. We find that proposers tend to propose fairer offers when responders have the option to access alternatives. Furthermore, we find that both species use their leverage to reject unequal offers. Our results suggest that great apes mostly act as rational maximizers in an UG, yet access to alternatives can lead them to change their strategies such as not choosing the self-maximizing offer as proposers and not accepting every offer higher than zero as responders. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Great ape anesthesia is reported to carry a significant risk. Therefore, techniques aiming to reduce stress and increase welfare, such as hand injection of anesthesia induction agents, have received considerable attention in zoo, laboratory, and captive wildlife environments. However, there is little evidence to support the superiority of such techniques. To investigate this issue, anesthesia records of healthy zoo-housed chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) between 2012 and 2017 in which the animal was either darted or hand injected were analyzed (n¼ 50). Sex, age, induction, muscle relaxation, and overall anesthesia quality as well as recovery ratings, heart rate, systolic, mean and diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, end-tidal CO2, oxygen saturation (SpO2), and body temperature were analyzed. Chimpanzees that were darted showed statistically significantly higher heart rate, SpO2, and body temperature than those that were hand injected. It was found that darted chimpanzees were also significantly more likely to have poorer perianesthetic muscle relaxation and overall anesthesia rating scores. This study provides further evidence that the use of hand injection can reduce factors associated with stress and improve the quality of chimpanzee anesthesia. © 2021 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians

ABSTRACT: Diurnal primates spend around half of their lifetime sleeping or inactive. These nocturnal behaviors are considerably understudied compared to daytime activities. While it is well established that sleep quality diminishes with age in humans, little is known about the effects of advanced age on sleep in our closest primate relatives. We aimed to describe captive chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) sleep patterns and examine whether individual sleep quality changed over an 11-yr period. We recorded the individual night rooms of 12 chimpanzees for six nights using infrared video cameras and analyzed 72 nights (936 h) of video. To evaluate long-term changes, we compared our data from 2018–2019 with previously published data from 2007–2008 on the same individuals living under the same conditions. We used complete inactivity and a head-down, lying posture as a proxy measurement for sleep. Each night individuals slept a mean of 10.5 (± SD 1.8) h and woke up 15.1 (± 3.6) times. The mean duration of sleep bouts was 45.4 (± 16.8) and the mean duration of awake bouts was 10.2 (± 8.2) min. We found that as chimpanzees aged they experienced significantly more frequent awakenings and shorter sleep bouts (i.e., more fragmented sleep), but nightly sleep duration and the length of awake bouts did not differ significantly between the two study periods. Our results suggest that chimpanzees experience some changes in sleep with age similar to those in humans and other animals. © 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: In species with flexible grouping dynamics (i.e., fission-fusion), party (or subgroup) size is often shaped by available resources. Food resources are thought to limit party size in a range of mammalian species, reflecting a strategy of reducing feeding competition. In montane habitats, where food is highly seasonal, we may expect to see strong effects of ecological constraints on party size. In the montane forest of Nyungwe National Park, Rwanda, we quantified changes in chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) party size. We used path analysis to analyze the direct and indirect effects of (i) ecological variables and (ii) a reproductive variable (estrous females) on party size. Our path analysis adds precision and directionality to the hypothesis that food availability and estrous females influence party size. We found that the presence of estrous females had the strongest effect on party size. Interestingly, the availability and distribution of important and preferred fruits did not directly influence party size but did influence the presence of estrous females. These findings indicate that fruit distribution may be the ecological precondition that attracts estrous females, which is the main driver of larger parties. Party size was, however, positively correlated with patch size, indicating that specific fruit species may be of particular importance to the ecology of these chimpanzees. Significance statement: In montane habitats with lower fruit tree density and diversity than lowland sites, it may be expected that ecological factors play a more important role in fission-fusion grouping patterns than reproductive factors. This is because the cost of competition for food among group members may be higher in a more resource-limited (montane) environment. We investigated the ecological and reproductive factors that influence grouping patterns of chimpanzees in a montane forest that encompasses the upper limit of this species’ altitudinal range. Our results showed that the presence of estrous females had the strongest influence on party size. These results have implications for evaluating ecological and reproductive drivers of chimpanzee party size across differing habitats. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Sixty years of research on chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) at Gombe National Park, Tanzania have revealed many similarities with human behaviour, including hunting, tool use and coalitionary killing. The close phylogenetic relationship between chimpanzees and humans suggests that these traits were present in the last common ancestor of Pan and Homo (LCAPH). However, findings emerging from studies of our other closest living relative, the bonobo (Pan paniscus), indicate that either bonobos are derived in these respects, or the many similarities between chimpanzees and humans evolved convergently. In either case, field studies provide opportunities to test hypotheses for how and why our lineage has followed its peculiar path through the adaptive landscape. Evidence from primate field studies suggests that the hominin path depends on our heritage as apes: inefficient quadrupeds with grasping hands, orthograde posture and digestive systems that require high-quality foods. Key steps along this path include: (a) changes in diet; (b) increased use of tools; (c) bipedal gait; (d) multilevel societies; (e) collective foraging, including a sexual division of labour and extensive food transfers; and (f) language. Here I consider some possible explanations for these transitions, with an emphasis on contributions from Gombe. © The Author(s), 2021.

ABSTRACT: Coagulum in the semen of some primates plays different roles, depending on the species. In the present study, we examined sperm motility in the coagulum and liquid portions of semen collected from captive individuals from two great ape species: two adult Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) (n = 27) and three adult chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) (n = 14). The results revealed that orangutan sperm remained motile for significantly longer in the coagulum than in the liquid portion (> 18 h). By contrast, chimpanzee sperm motility did not differ significantly over time between the two portions of the semen, although motility was slightly higher in the liquid portion than in the coagulum. The evolution of the seminal coagulum is thought to be related to postcopulatory sperm competition; however, functions of seminal coagulum have not been completely elucidated. Our data from the orangutan semen suggest that in this species, seminal coagulum may strengthen own-sperm survival. This report is the first to provide evidence for this distinctive function of the seminal coagulum. This unique property of orangutan seminal coagulum might be attributable to their reproductive traits, e.g., difficulty in predicting ovulation due to a lack of genital swelling during estrus. The orangutan is a Critically Endangered species, and captive breeding, including artificial insemination (AI), is expected. However, worldwide, only one case of orangutan AI has been successful. Our findings may contribute to an understanding of their basic semen characteristics and help improve the AI method. © 2021, Japan Monkey Centre.

ABSTRACT: Probstmayria gombensis File, 1976 (Nematoda: Cosmocercoidea: Atractidae) individuals discharged in the feces of eastern chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, in Bulindi, Uganda, were examined morphologically. Adults and fourth-stage larvae, all females, found in the feces, and the third-stage larvae excised from the uterus of the gravid females were described. By close observation of the molting worms, it was considered that the uterine third-stage larvae attain molting phase, and then are laid to become fourth-stage larvae. Nutrients required for larval development in the uterus seem to be supplied by the mother after the eggshell is formed. After some growth in the host intestine, the fourth-stage larvae undergo the final molt to the adult stage. The genital primordium was very small in the early fourth-stage larvae but rapidly developed with embryonation in the pre-molt and molting phases. Such precocity suggests parthenogenetic reproduction without insemination by males. This style may enhance rapid autoinfection in the host intestine under the condition of male worm scarcity. Several ellipsoidal pseudocoelomocytes with granules of unknown function were found ventral to the intestine of the adults, fourth-stage larvae, and third-stage larvae. © American Society of Parasitologists 2021.

ABSTRACT: Culture is a hallmark of the human species, both in terms of the transmission of material inventions (e.g. tool manufacturing) and the adherence to social conventions (e.g. greeting mannerisms). While material culture has been reported across the animal kingdom, indications of social culture in animals are limited. Moreover, there is a paucity of evidencing cultural stability in animals. Here, based on a large dataset spanning 12 years, I show that chimpanzees adhere to arbitrary group-specific handclasp preferences that cannot be explained by genetics or the ecological environment. Despite substantial changes in group compositions across the study period, and all chimpanzees having several behavioural variants in their repertoires, chimpanzees showed and maintained the within-group homogeneity and between-group heterogeneity that are so characteristic of the cultural phenomenon in the human species. These findings indicate that human culture, including its arbitrary social conventions and long-term stability, is rooted in our evolutionary history.  © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The effects of a-2 agonists on echocardiographic findings in great apes are not well documented, and knowledge of these effects would expand the understanding of cardiac examinations of chimpanzees under anesthesia with protocols using these drugs. Ten adult chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), four males and six females, underwent echocardiographic examinations after anesthesia with dexmedetomidine, midazolam, and ketamine (phase 1). Four animals required isoflurane to achieve an adequate plane of anesthesia. Atipamezole was used to antagonize dexmedetomidine, and all remaining animals were placed on isoflurane (phase 2), and then a second echocardiogram was performed. Direct arterial blood pressure was monitored during the anesthetic event. Measurements and recordings were assessed for statistically significant differences between the two phases and sex. There were no significant differences between phases or sex for any two-dimensional echocardiographic measurement of systolic function, although interventricular septum thickness at end systole approached a significant decrease from phase 1 to phase 2 (P ¼ 0.058) when sex was considered a between-subject factor. Left ventricular outflow tract (P ¼ 0.017) and pulmonary artery (P ¼ 0.028) velocities increased after reversal of the dexmedetomidine. Diastolic transmitral flow was consistent with grade 3 diastolic dysfunction (median early to late ventricular filling velocities (E/A) of 2.02, interquartile range [IQR], 1.53-2.13) with a nonsignificant decrease of E velocity and increase in A velocity and decreased E/A after reversal. Trace mitral and tricuspid regurgitation were common findings in the sample population. Arterial blood pressure significantly decreased between phase 1 and phase 2 (P, 0.01). All chimpanzees entered a hypotensive state (mean arterial pressure, 60 mm Hg) during phase 2. Although limited by the small number of chimpanzees, this study showed an increase in afterload, potential diastolic dysfunction, and a decrease in blood pressure after the antagonism of dexmedetomidine. Additional studies to further assess the effects of a-2 agonists in chimpanzees are warranted. © 2021 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians

ABSTRACT: Wild chimpanzee tool use is highly diverse and, in many cases, exhibits cultural variation: tool-use behaviours and techniques differ between communities and are passed down generations through social learning. Honey dipping – the use of sticks or leaves to extract honey from hives – has been identified across the whole species’ range. Nonetheless, there seems to be marked variation in honey dipping at a species level, with most descriptions originating from central Africa, and involving the use of complex tool sets, or even multifunctional tools. In West Africa, while honey consumption is common, in most cases tools are not used. We document, for the first time, the use of honey dipping tools in unhabituated chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) communities at Cantanhez National Park (CNP), Guinea-Bissau. Over a 23-month period we employed a combination of direct (camera traps, n = 1944 camera trap days) and indirect (1000km of reconnaissance walks, collection of abandoned tools) methods to study four neighbouring communities in central CNP. Fluid dipping tools were found in three of the four communities; here we analyse 204 individual stick tools from the 70 tool-use ateliers found. In addition to documenting individual tool dimensions and raw materials, we adopt methods from primate archaeology to describe the typology of different tools based on use-wear patterns. We describe differences in tools used for different honey types, between communities, and tools and tool kits that show an unexpected degree of complexity. Our data also suggest the use of tool sets, i.e., tools with different functions used sequentially toward the same goal; as well as possible multifunction tools (pounding and dipping), never before described for western chimpanzees. Our study fills gaps in our knowledge of the wild chimpanzee cultural repertoire and highlights how chimpanzee tool manufacture and use can vary even at local scales. © Copyright © 2021 Bessa, Hockings and Biro.

ABSTRACT: Humans are distinctive in their dependence upon products of culture for survival, products that have evolved cumulatively over generations such that many cannot now be created by a single individual. Why the cultural capacity of humans appears unrivalled in the animal kingdom is a topic of ongoing debate. Here we explore whether innovation and/or social learning propensities may constrain the ability of one of our closest living relatives, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), to master an extractive foraging and tool-use task designed to afford opportunities for cumulative culture to develop. We further explore the potential demographic characteristics associated with novel task solutions. Chimpanzees (N = 53) were inventive, flexibly exploring the novel task, albeit complex inventions were rare and shaped by prior individual experience with similar tool-use tasks. However, they displayed no evidence of cumulative cultural learning. Communities displayed richer behavioral repertoires and had greater task success than chimpanzees tested in an asocial control condition, but their solution complexity did not surpass what individuals invented. The lack of social transmission of complex and beneficial solutions in contexts like those we studied provides one explanation for the limited cumulative culture observed in this species. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Between 1966 to 1969, Bernhard Grzimek (Frankfurt Zoological Society, FZS) introduced chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) previously held in European institutions to Rubondo Island in Lake Victoria in Tanzania. Earlier publications report various numbers of released animals and that all founders originated from West Africa. We revise these assumptions through consultation of archived FZS records and genetic analyses of surviving descendants. Accordingly, 17 chimpanzees were transported to Africa in four waves, with male–female ratios of 3:8, 1:0, 1:0 and 2:2; one female died in transit. Thus, 16 chimpanzees were released in total. FZS and studbook records allocate a West African provenance to only 19% of the founders and a generic “Africa” origin to 56%. Still, studbook records render it unlikely that any of the founders were captive-born. In addition, our genetic analyses based on biological samples from the current descendants trace the geographical origin of their ancestors back to West Africa (P. t. verus) and Central Africa (P. t. troglodytes). Based on counts of individuals and night nests, we estimate that the population, since 1969, grew to around 35 individuals in 2014 (annual increase 3.3%). Thus, chimpanzees released onto a large forested island free from predators or hunting pressure, habitat destruction and conspecific competition can form a self-sustaining island population without human support. © 2021, Japan Monkey Centre.

ABSTRACT: In a captive environment, it is challenging to ensure the highest level of social and psychological well-being for species with naturally complex social organizations and structures. There is a growing need to meet the social requirements for individuals of these species, especially chimpanzees, housed in zoos, sanctuaries, rehabilitation centers, and laboratories. Complex social interactions and broader social structures can be aptly described via social network analysis. We expand on the literature regarding captive chimpanzee social networks, but uniquely consider their human caregivers as potential social partners. We observed the social interactions between one group of seven chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and their caregivers in six behavioral contexts (nearest neighbor, play, aggression, grooming, grooming solicitation, and social vigilance) at Chimpanzee Sanctuary Northwest (USA). By constructing multiple chimpanzee and chimpanzee-caregiver social networks, our results indicate that caregivers are integrated partners in this group’s social structure. Additionally, we observed that the type and strength of chimpanzee-caregiver relationships varied between the chimpanzees. These results support the notion that caregivers offer additional opportunities (i.e., beyond those with conspecifics) for captive chimpanzees to construct and maintain meaningful social relationships. Our results show that considerations of captive primate social dynamics should include caregivers as potentially important social partners. Our results also highlight the importance of evaluating individual chimpanzee characteristics when developing philosophies of care and adopting husbandry practices that offer fulfilling social niches. Our findings bear influence on contemporary discussions of interspecies social relationships, captive welfare, health, translocation, and husbandry protocols for captive chimpanzees and other nonhuman primates. © 2020, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Increased risk of pathogen transmission through proximity and contact is a well-documented cost of sociality. Affiliative social contact, however, is an integral part of primate group life and can benefit health. Despite its importance to the evolution and maintenance of sociality, the tradeoff between costs and benefits of social contact for group-living primate species remains poorly understood. To improve our understanding of this interplay, we used social network analysis to investigate whether contact via association in the same space and/or physical contact measured through grooming were associated with helminth parasite species richness in a community of wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii). We identified parasite taxa in 381 fecal samples from 36 individuals from the Kasekela community of chimpanzees in Gombe National Park, Tanzania, from November 1, 2006, to October 31, 2012. Over the study period, eight environmentally transmitted helminth taxa were identified. We quantified three network metrics for association and grooming contact, including degree strength, betweenness, and closeness. Our findings suggest that more gregarious individuals—those who spent more time with more individuals in the same space—had higher parasite richness, while the connections in the grooming network were not related to parasite richness. The expected parasite richness in individuals increased by 1.13 taxa (CI: 1.04, 1.22; p = 0.02) per one standard deviation increase in degree strength of association contact. The results of this study add to the understanding of the role that different types of social contact play in the parasite richness of group-living social primates. Significance statement: Parasite infections reveal costs of group living among wild animal populations. We studied the relationship between sociality and parasite transmission by assessing whether variation in social behavior among wild chimpanzees is associated with the number of unique helminth parasites detected in individual fecal samples. Our findings revealed that associating in the same shared space, but not grooming contact, is related to higher parasite richness. These findings improve our understanding of the complex interplay of parasitism and sociality with important implications for parasite transmission patterns in host species with flexible grouping patterns. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Identifying ecological gradients at the range edge of a species is an essential step in revealing the underlying mechanisms and constraints that limit the species’ geographic range. We aimed to describe the patterns of variation in chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) density and habitat characteristics perpendicular to the northern edge of their range and to investigate potential environmental mechanisms underlying chimpanzee distribution in a savanna–mosaic habitat. We estimated chimpanzee densities at six sites forming a 126-km latitudinal gradient at the biogeographical range edge of the western chimpanzee in the savanna–mosaic habitats of southeastern Senegal. To accompany these data, we used systematically placed vegetation plots to characterize the habitats at each site for habitat heterogeneity, tree density and size, and floral assemblages, among other variables. We found that both biotic and abiotic factors are potential determinants of the chimpanzee range limit in this ecoregion. Specifically, chimpanzee-occupied landscapes at the limit had smaller available floral assemblages less habitat heterogeneity, and contained fewer closed canopy habitats in which chimpanzees could seek refuge from high temperatures than in landscapes farther from the range limit. This pattern was accompanied by a decline in chimpanzee density with increasing proximity to the range limit. Our results provide several indications of the potential limits of food species diversity, thermal refuge, and water availability to the chimpanzee niche and the implications of these limits for chimpanzee biogeography, especially in the face of climate change predictions, as well as for species distributional modeling more generally. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Viruses closely related to human pathogens can reveal the origins of human infectious diseases. Human herpes simplexvirus type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2) are hypothesized to have arisen via host-virus codivergence and cross-species transmission. We report the discovery of novel herpes simplexviruses during a large-scale screening of fecal samples from wild gorillas, bonobos, and chimpanzees. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that, contrary to expectation, simplexviruses from these African apes are all more closely related to HSV-2 than to HSV-1. Molecular clock-based hypothesis testing suggests the divergence between HSV-1 and the African great ape simplexviruses likely represents a codivergence event between humans and gorillas. The simplexviruses infecting African great apes subsequently experienced multiple cross-species transmission events over the past 3 My, the most recent of which occurred between humans and bonobos around 1 Ma. These findings revise our understanding of the origins of human herpes simplexviruses and suggest that HSV-2 is one of the earliest zoonotic pathogens.  © 2021 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Captive chimpanzees living in confined environments like sanctuaries or primatology centers are frequently affected by gastrointestinal parasites. Some of these are likely to be transmitted to humans and may seriously affect public health. However little information is currently available on the gastrointestinal parasites of primates living in such environments. Here, we characterize the diversity and prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites in two populations of captive chimpanzees living in south-eastern Gabon. Our study reveals that at least nine parasite species infect the chimpanzees with high prevalence, including several helminths (Ascaris spp., Enterobius spp., Strongyloides spp., Trichuris spp., Hymenolepis spp., Mammomonogamus spp), three protozoa (Balantioides spp., Entamoeba spp. and Troglodytella spp) and several unidentified parasites. All the parasite taxa we identified had previously been identified in other primates, including humans. Age, sex and site type may influence infection rates and/or parasite diversity found in a particular host. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Respiratory pathogens are expected to spread through social contacts, but outbreaks often occur quickly and unpredictably, making it challenging to simultaneously record social contact and disease incidence data, especially in wildlife. Thus, the role of social contacts in the spread of infectious disease is often treated as an assumption in disease simulation studies, and few studies have empirically demonstrated how pathogens spread through social networks. In July–August 2015, an outbreak of respiratory disease was observed in a wild chimpanzee community in Kibale National Park, Uganda, during an ongoing behavioral study of male chimpanzees, offering a rare opportunity to evaluate how social behavior affects individual exposure to socially transmissible diseases. From May to August 2015, we identified adult and adolescent male chimpanzees displaying coughs and rhinorrhea and recorded 5-m proximity data on males (N = 40). Using the network k-test, we found significant relationships between male network connectivity and the distribution of cases within the network, supporting the importance of short-distance contacts for the spread of the respiratory outbreak. Additionally, chimpanzees central to the network were more likely to display clinical signs than those with fewer connections. Although our analyses were limited to male chimpanzees, these findings underscore the value of social connectivity data in predicting disease outcomes and elucidate a potential evolutionary cost of being social. © 2021, EcoHealth Alliance.

ABSTRACT: How the unique capacities of human cognition arose in evolution is a question of enduring interest. It is still unclear which developmental programmes are responsible for the emergence of the human brain. The inability to determine corresponding ages between humans and apes has hampered progress in detecting developmental programmes leading to the emergence of the human brain. I harness temporal variation in anatomical, behavioural and transcriptional variation to determine corresponding ages from fetal to postnatal development and ageing, between humans and chimpanzees. This multi-dimensional approach results in 137 corresponding time points across the lifespan, from embryonic day 44 to approximately 55 years of age, in humans and their equivalent ages in chimpanzees. I used these data to test whether developmental programmes, such as the timeline of prefrontal cortex (PFC) maturation, previously claimed to differ between humans and chimpanzees, do so once variation in developmental schedules is controlled for. I compared the maturation of frontal cortex projections from structural magnetic resonance (MR) scans and from temporal variation in the expression of genes used to track long-range projecting neurons (i.e. supragranular-enriched genes) in chimpanzees and humans. Contrary to what has been suggested, the timetable of PFC maturation is not unusually extended in humans. This dataset, which is the largest with which to determine corresponding ages across humans and chimpanzees, provides a rigorous approach to control for variation in developmental schedules and to identify developmental programmes responsible for unique features of the human brain. © 2021 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzee societies generally show male philopatry and female dispersal. However, demographic data on wild chimpanzee societies from long-term study sites have revealed that some females give birth in their natal group (i.e., “remaining females”). Here, we report two remaining females in the M group in Mahale, Tanzania, and compare their cases with previous reports to explore the social and ecological factors that lead to females remaining in their natal group. The results revealed that neither the social traits of the remaining females nor the ecological factors they experienced showed a coherent trend. However, we found multiple, non-mutually exclusive potential factors that may influence the decision by females to remain in their natal group: a decrease in indirect feeding competition, support from mothers or allomothers in the care of offspring and in aggressive interactions with other individuals, close relationships with the other remaining females, and a short adolescent infertility period. Additionally, we observed a natal female copulating with her older brother, which was the first observation of brother–sister incest in Mahale. Although DNA analysis revealed that her infant was not a product of inbreeding, the pair copulated frequently in the latter half of her estrus period, suggesting that they did not avoid incest behaviorally to avoid inbreeding. Furthermore, there was no hard evidence that the remaining female avoided mating with her maternal brother, suggesting that incest avoidance may not be a proximate factor responsible for female dispersal. © 2021, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Sierra Leone constitutes the western boundary to the West Africa Upper Guinea Rainforest, one of 35 global biodiversity hotspots. The country is home to the third-largest western chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) population, a subspecies upgraded to Critically Endangered on the 2016 IUCN Red List. The main threats facing chimpanzees in Sierra Leone are habitat loss and increasing interactions with humans. The Mobonda Community Conservation Project (MCCP) is a component of Tacugama Chimpanzee Sanctuary's Community Outreach Program and Kids Environmental Education Program. The aim of MCCP is to promote community-based forest management in combination with wildlife conservation through carefully designed programs that benefit communities, wildlife, and ecologically significant habitats. MCCP also aims to promote self-sustained and integrated community landscape conservation, to facilitate policy discussions to strengthen wildlife laws, and to build the capacity of the Government to implement community-based wildlife and forestry protection projects. Since Tacugama began collecting data in Moyamba District in June 2015, the project has evolved into an assembly of components. MCCP currently works with five communities, running programs including environmental education, ecological research, biomonitoring including wildlife law enforcement, habitat rehabilitation through reforestation of identified wildlife corridors, improved sustainable livelihoods, and ecotourism initiatives. These programs contributed to a reduction in the threats facing wildlife in the area; the project has seen stable chimpanzee numbers where decrements to chimpanzee populations continue to be experienced elsewhere. Other MCCP outcomes include boosted sustainable agricultural production and higher oyster yields while decreasing the negative impact on the mangrove ecosystem allowing it to recover and support an array of important fauna and flora. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC

ABSTRACT: Grooming site preferences have been relatively well studied in monkey species in order to investigate the function of social grooming. They are not only influenced by the amount of ectoparasites, but also by different social variables such as the dominance rank between individuals or their levels of affiliation. However, studies on this topic mainly come from monkey species, with almost no report on great apes. This study aimed to explore whether body site and body orientation preferences during social grooming show species-specific differences (bonobos vs. chimpanzees) and environment-specific differences (captivity vs. wild). Results showed that bonobos groomed the head, the front and faced each other more often than chimpanzees, while chimpanzees groomed the back, anogenitals and more frequently in face-to-back positions. Moreover, captive individuals were found to groom facing one another more often than wild ones, whereas wild individuals groomed the back and in face-to-back positions more. While future studies should expand their scope to include more populations per condition, our preliminary 2 by 2 comparison study highlights the influence of (i) species-specific social differences such as social tolerance, social attention and facial communication, and (ii) socioenvironmental constraints such as risk of predation, spatial crowding and levels of hygiene, that might be the two important factors determining the grooming patterns in two Panspecies. © 2021 S.

ABSTRACT: Endangered wildlife increasingly inhabits human-dominated landscapes outside protected areas. Large-bodied mammals require large spaces, and their ranging may be especially impacted by landscape modifications including farming, road development and urbanisation. We studied the Wagaisa community of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in Uganda, which inhabit a landscape characterised by high human population density, widespread deforestation, and rapid agricultural and infrastructural development. We aimed to assess whether this dynamic, fragmented environment constrains the chimpanzees’ ranging, and to identify critical habitat patches to aid their conservation. During March–May 2018, we assessed range use from locations of direct observations and indirect signs, corroborated by longer-term behavioural monitoring of the chimpanzees (June 2018–December 2019). No evidence of limited ranging was found. The Wagaisa chimpanzees used an area measuring ≥ 43 km2 (100% MCP) and ranged extensively in the anthropogenic matrix. Most frequently used parts of the range (‘core habitat areas’) centred around small (5–20 acres), widely dispersed remnant forest patches and exotic eucalyptus plantations. Forty per cent of chimpanzee nests were constructed in eucalyptus trees, suggesting a behavioural adjustment to landscape changes. Actions to facilitate conservation of these ‘village chimpanzees’ and others surviving in transformed human-dominated habitat need not conflict with the sustainable development of the region. © 2020 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, present a serious threat to endangered wild chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) populations. In some parts of sub-Saharan Africa, chimpanzee tracking is a popular tourism activity, offering visitors a chance to view apes in their natural habitats. Chimpanzee tourism is an important source of revenue and thus benefits conservation; however, chimpanzee tracking may also increase the risk of disease transmission from people to chimpanzees directly (e.g., via aerosol transmission) or indirectly (e.g., through the environment or via fomites). This study assessed how tourist behaviors might facilitate respiratory disease transmission at a chimpanzee tracking site in Kibale National Park, Uganda. We observed tourists, guides, and student interns from the time they entered the forest to view the chimpanzees until they left the forest and noted behaviors related to disease transmission. Common behaviors included coughing, sneezing, and urinating, which respectively occurred during 88.1%, 65.4%, and 36.6% of excursions. Per excursion, individuals touched their faces an average of 125.84 ± 34.45 times and touched large tree trunks or branches (which chimpanzees might subsequently touch) an average of 230.14 ± 108.66 times. These results show that many pathways exist by which pathogens might move from humans to chimpanzees in the context of tourism. Guidelines for minimizing the risk of such transmission should consider tourist behavior and the full range of modes by which pathogen transmission might occur between tourists and chimpanzees. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC

ABSTRACT: Understanding variation in host-associated microbial communities is important given the relevance of microbiomes to host physiology and health. Using 560 fecal samples collected from wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) across their range, we assessed how geography, genetics, climate, vegetation, and diet relate to gut microbial community structure (prokaryotes, eukaryotic parasites) at multiple spatial scales. We observed a high degree of regional specificity in the microbiome composition, which was associated with host genetics, available plant foods, and potentially with cultural differences in tool use, which affect diet. Genetic differences drove community composition at large scales, while vegetation and potentially tool use drove within-region differences, likely due to their influence on diet. Unlike industrialized human populations in the United States, where regional differences in the gut microbiome are undetectable, chimpanzee gut microbiomes are far more variable across space, suggesting that technological developments have decoupled humans from their local environments, obscuring regional differences that could have been important during human evolution.

ABSTRACT: Aim: As part of the Gaborone Declaration for Sustainability in Africa, Liberia has pledged to include the value of nature in national decision making through natural capital accounting. Surveying species of concern, such as the western chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus), which was recently reclassified as “critically endangered” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and identifying protection priority areas are critical first steps towards achieving Liberia's goal to conserve 30% of its remaining forests and supporting the wave of conservation projects taking place in the country. Location: Liberia, Africa. Methods: We modelled western chimpanzee habitat suitability, focusing on determining relevant environmental predictors and the most appropriate scale for modelling species–habitat relationships. We built models at six resolutions (30–960 m) to identify scale domains where relationships remain constant. We include several habitat variables that have not been included in prior modelling efforts. We then used the suitability map as the conductance input into a connectivity analysis using Circuitscape. Results: The amount of forest within 1–3 km was the most important predictor of chimpanzee occurrence. Variable ranks and importance shifted considerably between modelling scales, supporting the need for multiscale investigations, but scale domains were present. Several important corridors for chimpanzee habitat and movement overlap considerably with existing timber and palm oil concessions and overlap mining and rubber concessions to a lesser degree. Main conclusions: The proportion of primary forest within 1–3 km is critically important for chimpanzee habitat. Ongoing conservation projects and efforts taking place in Liberia including the Good Growth Partnership and the Gaborone Declaration for Sustainability in Africa can utilize the spatial findings on connectivity provided by this study to inform future conservation decisions, particularly expanding exiting protected areas. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Oesophagostomosis is a zoonotic disease caused by nematodes of the genus Oesophagostomum in the intestinal walls of many species, including ruminants, pigs, humans, and nonhuman primates. Although great apes appear to tolerate the parasite in the wild, they can develop a clinical form that can lead to death in captivity and the natural environment. At the Primatology Centre of the International Centre for Medical Research in Franceville (CIRMF) in Gabon, we recorded 4 deaths of chimpanzees (Pan t. troglodytes) caused by Oesophagostomum spp. between 2015 and 2019. In each case, coprological analysis was positive for strongylid eggs and abdominal ultrasound revealed nodules about 4 cm in diameter on the intestinal and abdominal walls. Albendazole treatments administered by mouth in two doses of 400 mg six months apart resulted in the disappearance of the parasite in coprological samples but the chimpanzees still died. Autopsies carried out on all four chimpanzees revealed a rupture of the cysts and a discharge of pus into the abdomen in each case. We report surgical management involving the removal of Oesophagostomum spp. cysts from a chimpanzee following coprological analysis and abdominal ultrasound examination. Surgical exploration confirmed the fragility of the cystic walls, the rupture of which we avoided. This 5th new case of Oesophagostomum ssp. nodules recovered without complications following the operation and could rejoin his group. We suggest that surgical intervention should be considered in similar cases in captive primates, especially chimpanzees. Copyright © 2021 Barthélémy Ngoubangoye et al.

ABSTRACT: The habitat quality of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), including the availability of plant food and nesting species, is important to ensure the long-term survival of this endangered species. Botanical composition of vegetation is spatially variable and depends on soil characteristics, weather, topography, and numerous other biotic and abiotic factors. There are few data regarding the availability of chimpanzee plant food and nesting species in the Masito-Ugalla Ecosystem (MUE), a vast area that lies outside national park boundaries in Tanzania, and how the availability of these resources varies with human disturbance. We hypothesized that chimpanzee plant food species richness, diversity, and abundance decline with increasing human disturbance. Further, we predicted that chimpanzee abundance and habitat use is influenced negatively by human disturbance. Published literature from Issa Valley, Gombe, and Mahale Mountains National Parks, in Tanzania, was used to document plant species consumed by chimpanzees, and quantify their richness, diversity, and abundance, along 32 transects totaling 63.8 km in length across four sites of varying human disturbance in MUE. We documented 102 chimpanzee plant food species and found a significant differences in their species richness (H = 55.09, P < 0.001) and diversity (H = 36.81, P < 0.001) across disturbance levels, with the moderately disturbed site exhibiting the highest species richness and diversity. Chimpanzees built nests in 17 different tree species. The abundance of nesting tree species did not vary across survey sites (H = 0.279, P > 0.964). The least disturbed site exhibited the highest encounter rate of chimpanzee nests/km, with rates declining toward the highly disturbed sites. Our results show that severe anthropogenic disturbance in MUE is associated with the loss of chimpanzee plant food species and negatively influences chimpanzee habitat use, a relationship that threatens the future of all chimpanzee populations outside national parks. © 2020 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Social animals must carefully track consequential events and opportunities for social learning. However, the competing demands of the social world produce trade-offs in social attention, defined as directed visual attention towards conspecifics. A key question is how socioecology shapes these biases in social attention over evolution and development. Chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, and bonobos, Pan paniscus, provide ideal models for addressing this question because they have large communities with fission–fusion grouping, divergent sex-based dominance hierarchies and occasional intergroup encounters. Using noninvasive eye-tracking measures, we recorded captive apes’ attention to side-by-side images of familiar and unfamiliar conspecifics of the same sex. We tested four competing hypotheses about the influence of taxonomically widespread socioecological pressures on social attention, including intergroup conflict, dominance, dispersal and mating competition. Both species preferentially attended to familiar over unfamiliar conspecifics when viewing the sex that typically occupies the highest ranks in the group: females for bonobos, and males for chimpanzees. However, they did not demonstrate attentional biases between familiar and unfamiliar members of the subordinate sex. Findings were consistent across species despite differences in which sex tends to be more dominant. These results suggest that sex-based dominance patterns guide social attention across Pan. Our findings reveal how socioecological pressures shape social attention in apes and likely contribute to the evolution of social cognition across primates. © 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ABSTRACT: The deployment of a vaccine that limits transmission and disease likely will be required to end the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We recently described the protective activity of an intranasally administered chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine encoding a pre-fusion stabilized spike (S) protein (ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S [chimpanzee adenovirus-severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2-S]) in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of mice expressing the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Here, we show the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of this vaccine in non-human primates. Rhesus macaques were immunized with ChAd-Control or ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S and challenged 1 month later by combined intranasal and intrabronchial routes with SARS-CoV-2. A single intranasal dose of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induces neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses and limits or prevents infection in the upper and lower respiratory tracts after SARS-CoV-2 challenge. As ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S confers protection in non-human primates, it is a promising candidate for limiting SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission in humans. © 2021 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: The predation and consumption of animals are common behaviours in chimpanzees across tropical Africa. To date, however, relatively little is known concerning the hunting behaviour of central chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes). Here, we provide the first direct observations of hunting behaviour by individuals of the newly habituated Rekambo community in the Loango National Park, Gabon. Over a period of 23 months (May 2017 to March 2019), we observed a total of 61 predation attempts on eight mammal species, including four monkey species. The two most frequently hunted species were two monkey species (Cercocebus torquatus,Cercopithecus nictitans), which are not hunted at other long-term field sites. The majority of predation events observed involved parties of an average of eight individuals, mainly adult males, with hunting success being higher with increasing numbers of participants. Hunting occurred all year round, but hunting rates increased in the dry season, the period of high fruit availability in the Loango National Park. These results are in line with the nutrient surplus hypothesis which explains seasonal variation in hunting behaviour in several populations of eastern chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii: e.g., Mahale, Tanzania; Ngogo, Uganda). Finally, with a hunting frequency of 2.65 hunts per month, the Rekambo community had higher hunting rates than other sites (Bossou, Republic of Guinea; Kahuzi-Biega, Democratic Republic of Congo; Budongo, Uganda) where red colobus monkeys are also absent. We discuss these results and compare them to patterns at other long-term sites. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: HIV-1 infection in human beings has been an outcome of cross-species transmission event of simian immunodeficiency virus from chimpanzees (SIVcpz). Present study reveals differential features of envelope genes representing different categories of HIV-1 disease progression in human beings, namely, rapid progressors (RP), slow progressors (SP) and long-term non-progressors (LTNP) with respect to SIVcpz, based on their amino acid usage patterns. It was evident that SP, LTNP and SIVcpz envelope genes displayed similar patterns of amino acid usage which strongly contrasted with the features exhibited by the envelope genes representing RP category. Robust analysis revealed that selection constraint of human host on SP and LTNP associated envelope genes and chimpanzee host on SIVcpz envelope genes were more severe compared to selection pressure operational on RP associated envelope genes. Evolutionary forces of selection appeared to be comparatively more relaxed on the RP envelope genes in contrast to SP, LTNP and SIVcpz types. Better binding of RP envelope glycoprotein 120 (gp120) compared to envelope gp120 representing SP, LTNP and SIVcpz with host cellular receptor CD4, as inferred employing molecular docking approaches, promises to confer meaningful insights into the event of speedy progression of HIV in rapid progressors. It was interesting to note that envelope glycoprotein exhibited a tendency of hindering proper interaction of host (human/chimpanzee) CD4 and major histocompatibility complex II (MHC II), with a better efficacy in rapid progressors, thus, facilitating highest degrees of immune suppression. Proper identification of the contrasting features might confer a scope to modulate rapid progression of HIV to a long-term non-progressive controlled case, as observed in LTNP and SIVcpz infection, simultaneously aiding therapeutic research against AIDS targeted at drug and vaccine development.

ABSTRACT: The inferior parietal lobule (IPL) is one of the most expanded cortical regions in humans relative to other primates. It is also among the most structurally and functionally asymmetric regions in the human cerebral cortex. Whether the structural and connectional asymmetries of IPL subdivisions differ across primate species and how this relates to functional asymmetries remain unclear. We identified IPL subregions that exhibited positive allometric in both hemispheres, scaling across rhesus macaque monkeys, chimpanzees, and humans. The patterns of IPL subregions asymmetry were similar in chimpanzees and humans, but no IPL asymmetries were evident in macaques. Among the comparative sample of primates, humans showed the most widespread asymmetric connections in the frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices, constituting leftward asymmetric networks that may provide an anatomical basis for language and tool use. Unique human asymmetric connectivity between the IPL and primary motor cortex might be related to handedness. These findings suggest that structural and connectional asymmetries may underlie hemispheric specialization of the human brain. © Cheng et al.

ABSTRACT: Oxytocin has drawn significant research attention for its role in modulating mammalian social behavior. Despite generally conserved roles, oxytocin can function differently even in closely related species. Previous studies have shown that bonobos and chimpanzees, humans’ two closest relatives, demonstrate considerable behavioral differences, including that bonobos look more at others’ eyes than chimpanzees. Oxytocin is known to increase attention to another's eyes in many mammalian species (e.g. dogs, monkeys, and humans), yet this effect has not been tested in any nonhuman great ape species. This study examined how intranasally-administered oxytocin affects eye contact in bonobos and chimpanzees using eye tracking. Following administration of either oxytocin or saline control with a nebulizer, chimpanzees (n = 6) and bonobos (n = 5) were shown images of conspecific faces while their eye movement was recorded. Oxytocin changed the eye-looking behavior of bonobos and chimpanzees differently. We found that oxytocin increased eye contact in bonobos but not chimpanzees; while one chimpanzee showed an increase, interestingly, 5 out of 6 chimpanzees showed decreased looking to the eyes compared to the mouth, suggesting moderate eye avoidance. Given the importance of eye contact in their social interactions, our results suggest that oxytocin may play modulatory roles in bonobos’ and chimpanzees’ species-specific social behavior and underscore the importance of oxytocin in hominid social evolution. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Distress calls are an acoustically variable group of vocalizations ubiquitous in mammals and other animals. Their presumed function is to recruit help, but there has been much debate on whether the nature of the disturbance can be inferred from the acoustics of distress calls. We used machine learning to analyse episodes of distress calls of wild infant chimpanzees. We extracted exemplars from those distress call episodes and examined them in relation to the external event triggering them and the distance to the mother. In further steps, we tested whether the acoustic variants were associated with particular maternal responses. Our results suggest that, although infant chimpanzee distress calls are highly graded, they can convey information about discrete problems experienced by the infant and about distance to the mother, which in turn may help guide maternal parenting decisions. The extent to which mothers rely on acoustic cues alone (versus integrate other contextual-visual information) to decide upon intervening should be the focus of future research. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Object-sorting tasks have been used as a means of assessing the cognitive development of humans. In order to investigate cognitive development from a comparative perspective, an object-sorting task was conducted in a longitudinal face-to-face situation involving three juvenile/adolescent chimpanzees (7–9 years old) and 17 children (2–5 years old). The subjects were requested to place nine blocks of different categories (distinguished by three colors and three shapes) into the cells of a box arrayed in a three-by-three pattern. Chimpanzees showed complete or partial categorical sorting in 24–43% of pre-cued trials. The youngest children had difficulty in completing a trial by placing all nine blocks into the box. Humans older than 2 years succeeded in making a one-to-one correspondence by placing a block in each cell, while the end-state pattern remained random. The children gradually increased their rate of categorical sorting, where objects of one category were placed in the same row/column; this tendency peaked at 4 years of age. Above this age, the humans spontaneously shifted their sorting strategy to make a completely even configuration (resulting in a Latin square), which may be more cognitively demanding than categorical sorting. While chimpanzees and older children used both color and shape cues for categorical sorting, younger humans preferred to use shape cues. The results of the present study show fundamental similarities between humans and chimpanzees at the basic level of categorical sorting, which indicates that some autonomous rules are applied during object manipulation. © 2020, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Variance in the quality of food sites exploited by group-living animals should allow dominant individuals to gain feeding advantages. In some cases of eating in large patches, however, the amount of agonism can be puzzlingly low. We studied this problem in wild adult chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, eating ripe fruits in large tree crowns, a context in which little aggression has previously been recorded. Observations were conducted from within the same tree crown as feeding chimpanzees, which allowed us to obtain high-quality data on food distribution, feeding behaviour and aggression. We assessed energy availability and chimpanzee behaviour in relation to their feeding depth. Deeper food sites were associated with less metabolizable food energy (kcal/m3) and lower energy intake rates (kcal/min). Energy availability also varied by tree type (higher in drupe trees than in fig trees) and fruit ripeness (higher in riper fruits). Males were dominant to females, and within both sexes aggressive interactions conformed to a linear hierarchy. Overall higher-ranking individuals used aggression and dominance to access superior feeding sites and achieve higher rates of energy intake, but the effects of dominance varied according to tree type, sex and party composition. Our study shows that covert contest competition over feeding sites gave dominant individuals an important advantage even in very large patches. © 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ABSTRACT: Primate foraging is influenced by the spatial and temporal distribution of foods, which may facilitate or constrain optimal nutrient intakes. Chimpanzees are frugivorous primates that mainly subsist on ripe fruit that is typically low in available protein (AP) and high in easily digestible carbohydrates. Because chimpanzees prefer ripe fruit and often eat it in large quantities compared with other foods, we hypothesized that protein intake would be tightly regulated while non-protein energy (NPE) would vary with fruit intake. To test this hypothesis, we conducted all-day follows on female chimpanzees, recorded all types of food consumed (i.e., drupes, figs, and non-fruit foods), estimated the nutritional contributions of these foods to daily NPE and AP intake and investigated how the ratio of NPE to AP varied due to changes in the types of foods consumed. Although the proportions of drupes, figs, and non-fruit foods varied in their diets, female chimpanzees maintained a relatively stable intake of AP while intake of NPE varied depending on the daily diet, demonstrating that like other frugivorous primates studied to date, chimpanzees prioritize protein. The mean daily ratio of NPE to AP was 7:1, which is similar to that of other frugivorous primates studied. Our results support the hypothesis that frugivorous animals may generally prioritize AP, while maximizing NPE intake within that constraint, and could shed light on aspects of human dietary evolution. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

ABSTRACT: Citizen science has grown rapidly in popularity in recent years due to its potential to educate and engage the public while providing a means to address a myriad of scientific questions. However, the rise in popularity of citizen science has also been accompanied by concerns about the quality of data emerging from citizen science research projects. We assessed data quality in the online citizen scientist platform Chimp&See, which hosts camera trap videos of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and other species across Equatorial Africa. In particular, we compared detection and identification of individual chimpanzees by citizen scientists with that of experts with years of experience studying those chimpanzees. We found that citizen scientists typically detected the same number of individual chimpanzees as experts, but assigned far fewer identifications (IDs) to those individuals. Those IDs assigned, however, were nearly always in agreement with the IDs provided by experts. We applied the data sets of citizen scientists and experts by constructing social networks from each. We found that both social networks were relatively robust and shared a similar structure, as well as having positively correlated individual network positions. Our findings demonstrate that, although citizen scientists produced a smaller data set based on fewer confirmed IDs, the data strongly reflect expert classifications and can be used for meaningful assessments of group structure and dynamics. This approach expands opportunities for social research and conservation monitoring in great apes and many other individually identifiable species. © 2020 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Human straight-legged bipedalism represents one of the earliest events in the evolutionary split between humans (Homo spp.) and chimpanzees (Pan spp.), although its selective basis is a mystery. A carrying-related hypothesis has recently been proposed in which hair loss within the hominin lineage resulted in the inability of babies to cling to their mothers, requiring mothers to walk upright to carry their babies. However, a question remains for this model: what drove the hair loss that resulted in upright walking? Observers since Darwin have suggested that hair loss in humans may represent an evolutionary strategy for defence against ticks. The aim of this review is to propose and evaluate a novel tick-based evolutionary hypothesis wherein forest fragmentation in hominin paleoenvironments created conditions that were favourable for tick proliferation, selecting for hair loss in hominins and grooming behaviour in chimpanzees as divergent anti-tick strategies. It is argued that these divergent anti-tick strategies resulted in different methods for carrying babies, driving the locomotor divergence of humans and chimpanzees. © 2021 by the author.

ABSTRACT: As great ape populations around the world continue to decline, largely due to anthropogenic activities, conservation programs aimed at supporting these efforts have had mixed success. Here, we evaluate our community-based conservation program in Gishwati forest, Rwanda, aimed at helping to restore biodiversity and ecosystem services using chimpanzees as a flagship species. We examine the effectiveness of this program on reducing one of the ongoing threats to Gishwati's population of chimpanzees, illegal cattle grazing as well as the program's influence on the size of the chimpanzee population. We monitored illegal cattle grazing during several study periods between 2009 and 2019 in Gishwati forest following the implementation of our conservation program in 2008 that included law enforcement, community engagement, and research components. We found that when our conservation program was active, illegal cattle grazing was reduced to low levels. We also observed an increase in the chimpanzee population size during the 11 years since we started our conservation program. We examine how this reduction in cattle grazing and increase in chimpanzee population size may have been influenced by our community-centered approach and discuss the future of our conservation work in Gishwati. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC

ABSTRACT: Increased human activities such as commodity-led deforestation, extension of agriculture, urbanization, and wildfires are major drivers of forest loss worldwide. In Cameroon, these activities cause a loss of suitable primate habitat and could ultimately threaten the survival of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). We derived independent estimates of the population size of the Endangered Nigeria–Cameroon chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes ellioti) in Kom-Wum Forest Reserve, Cameroon, and surrounding unprotected forest areas through 1) direct observations, 2) camera trapping, 3) distance sampling, 4) marked nest counts, and 5) standing crop nest counts. In addition, we georeferenced signs of chimpanzee and human activity along line transects. We used a generalized linear mixed model to predict the occurrence of chimpanzees in response to edge length (measured as the perimeter of core forest patches), core area of forest patches (measured as area of forest patches beyond an edge width of 100 m), habitat perforation (measured as the perimeter of nonforested landscape within core forest patches), patch size(measured as area of forest patches), and forest cover. Chimpanzee density estimates ranged from 0.1 (direct observation) to 0.9 (distance sampling) individuals km−2 depending on estimation method with a mean nest group size of 7 ± 5.4 (SD). The mean encounter rate for signs of chimpanzee activity was significantly higher in mature forests (2.3 signs km−1) than in secondary forests (0.3 signs km−1) and above 1000 m elevation (4.0 signs km−1) than below 1000 m (1.0 signs km−1). The mean encounter rate for signs of human activity was significantly higher in secondary (8.0 signs km−1) than in mature forests (0.9 signs km−1). Secondary forests, habitat perforation, and edge length had a significant negative effect on the occurrence of chimpanzee signs. Overall, human activity and forest degradation affected the number of observed chimpanzee signs negatively. Regular antipoaching patrols and reforestation programs in degraded areas could potentially reduce threats to populations of endangered species and may increase suitable habitat area. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Gene regulatory divergence is thought to play a central role in determining human-specific traits. However, our ability to link divergent regulation to divergent phenotypes is limited. Here, we utilized human–chimpanzee hybrid induced pluripotent stem cells to study gene expression separating these species. The tetraploid hybrid cells allowed us to separate cis- from trans-regulatory effects, and to control for nongenetic confounding factors. We differentiated these cells into cranial neural crest cells, the primary cell type giving rise to the face. We discovered evidence of lineage-specific selection on the hedgehog signaling pathway, including a human-specific sixfold down-regulation of EVC2 (LIMBIN), a key hedgehog gene. Inducing a similar down-regulation of EVC2 substantially reduced hedgehog signaling output. Mice and humans lacking functional EVC2 show striking phenotypic parallels to human–chimpanzee craniofacial differences, suggesting that the regulatory divergence of hedgehog signaling may have contributed to the unique craniofacial morphology of humans. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Cardiac disease is of importance in captive chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) health. Here we report an eosinophilic and necrotizing myocarditis in a 17-y-old chimpanzee with no previous history of cardiac disease that progressed to death within 48 h. Toxic and infectious causes were ruled out. The chimpanzee had eosinophilia at different occasions in previous years. The animal had a severe, diffuse, and acute monophasic necrotizing myocarditis, with a moderate lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate that was rich in eosinophils. Ante- and postmortem investigations are compatible with an unusual eosinophilic myocarditis with clinical evolution and morphology comparable with human eosinophilic myocarditis secondary to hypereosinophilic syndrome. © 2021 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians

ABSTRACT: In the present study, we applied our ‘precise annotation’ to the mitochondrial (mt) genomes of human, chimpanzee, rhesus macaque and mouse using 5′ and 3′ end small RNAs. Our new annotations updated previous annotations. In particular, our new annotations led to two important novel findings: (1) the identification of five Conserved Sequence Blocks (CSB1, CSB2, CSB3, LSP and HSP) in the control regions; and (2) the annotation of Transcription Initiation and novel Transcription Termination Sites. Based on these annotations, we proposed a novel model of mt transcription which can account for the mt transcription and its regulation in mammals. According to our model, Transcription Termination Sites function as switches to regulate the production of short, long primary transcripts and uninterrupted transcription, rather than simply terminate the mt transcription. Moreover, the expression levels of mitochondrial transcription termination factors control the proportions of rRNAs, mRNAs and lncRNAs in total mt RNA. Our findings point to the existence of many other, as yet unidentified, Transcription Termination Sites in mammals. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Plasmodium vivax is the world’s most widely distributed human malaria parasite, with over 2.8 billion people at risk in Asia, the Americas, and Africa. The 80–90% new P. vivax malaria infections are due to relapses which suggest that a vaccine with high efficacy against relapses by prevention of hypnozoite formation could lead to a significant reduction in the prevalence of P. vivax infections. Here, we describe the development of new recombinant ChAdOx1 and MVA vectors expressing P. cynomolgi Thrombospondin Related Adhesive Protein (PcTRAP) and the circumsporozoite protein (PcCSP). Both were shown to be immunogenic in mice prior to their assessment in rhesus macaques. We confirmed good vaccine-induced humoral and cellular responses after prime-boost vaccination in rhesus macaques prior to sporozoite challenge. Results indicate that there were no significant differences between mock-control and vaccinated animals after challenge, in terms of protective efficacy measured as the time taken to 1st patency, or as number of relapses. This suggests that under the conditions tested, the vaccination with PcTRAP and PcCSP using ChAdOx1 or MVA vaccine platforms do not protect against pre-erythrocytic malaria or relapses despite good immunogenicity induced by the viral-vectored vaccines. © 2020 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Tuberculosis (TB) still is the principal cause of death from infectious disease and improved vaccination strategies are required to reduce the disease burden and break TB transmission. Here, we investigated different routes of administration of vectored subunit vaccines based on chimpanzee-derived adenovirus serotype-3 (ChAd3) for homologous prime-boosting and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) for heterologous boosting with both vaccine vectors expressing the same antigens from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Ag85B, ESAT6, Rv2626, Rv1733, RpfD). Prime-boost strategies were evaluated for immunogenicity and protective efficacy in highly susceptible rhesus macaques. A fully parenteral administration regimen was compared to exclusive respiratory mucosal administration, while parenteral ChAd3-5Ag prime-boosting and mucosal MVA-5Ag boosting were applied as a push-and-pull strategy from the periphery to the lung. Immune analyses corroborated compartmentalized responses induced by parenteral versus mucosal vaccination. Despite eliciting TB-specific immune responses, none of the investigational regimes conferred a protective effect by standard readouts of TB compared to non-vaccinated controls, while lack of protection by BCG underpinned the stringency of this non-human primate test modality. Yet, TB manifestation after full parenteral vaccination was significantly less compared to exclusive mucosal vaccination. © 2020, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: In mammals, allogrooming is prominent in forming and maintaining social and cooperative relationships. Yet an animal's social time is constrained, which may limit its access to a large number of partners. Dunbar (1993, Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 16 (4), 681–694) proposed that human polyadic conversations, which allow access to several social partners simultaneously, evolved as a form of social grooming to circumvent this time constraint. In nonhuman primates, polyadic grooming (PG), in contrast to dyadic grooming, may similarly be a time-efficient way to maintain weak social relationships with many partners which can be important for group level cooperation. It remains unknown whether PG is used to fulfil specific cooperative needs by accessing numerous weakly bonded partners and increasing the number of partners accessed per unit of time. We compared the use and effect of PG between chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, which are highly territorial and collaborative (especially males), and bonobos, Pan paniscus, which are less territorial and collaborative and in which females are the main co-operators. We carried out focal grooming observations in one bonobo and two chimpanzee communities in the wild. As predicted, chimpanzees engaged in more PG than bonobos. Surprisingly, males engaged in PG more than females in both species. While chimpanzees accessed more partners per minute of grooming than bonobos via dyadic grooming, PG increased the number of partners accessed per minute only in bonobos. Finally, chimpanzees primarily used PG with individuals who were close in rank and frequent grooming partners, whereas bonobos used PG with individuals who were distant in rank, close party associates and frequent grooming partners. We suggest that bonobo males use PG to enhance conspecific social tolerance and mate choice. The overall higher rate of PG in chimpanzees suggests that between-group competition may promote polyadic affiliation, which possibly reinforces group cohesion and coordination. © 2020 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The West African chimpanzee is critically endangered (CR). From 1990 to 2007, Ivory Coast lost 90% of its population to habitat destruction and poaching. In order to effectively implement conservation measures, we need to determine the status of any remaining populations in the country. The chimpanzee population of Comoé National Park (CNP) was assumed to have been severely depleted following the politico-military crisis of 2002–2011. Surveys in 2007, 2010, 2012, and 2014 failed to find significant evidence of chimpanzees in the park, leading managers to believe that no sustainable population was left. To evaluate status and distribution of chimpanzees in CNP, in 2015 we conducted a stratified survey in our study area in the southwest of the park. Over the next 3 years, we conducted recce walks in the north, east, and center of the park, and in 2017 we collected additional data on distribution of chimpanzees during the full park survey for elephants. Additionally, for the first time in northern Ivory Coast, we carried out a local nest decay study. In our main study area, we estimated a density of 0.14 weaned chimpanzees/km2, with an abundance of 127 (92–176) weaned chimpanzees, representing a sustainable population in CNP. We identified 123 individual chimpanzees via parallel camera-trap survey. We discovered a resident chimpanzee population to the east of the Comoé River, an area previously assumed devoid of chimpanzees. This study confirms the viability of a population key for the conservation of Western chimpanzee. We stress the importance of concentrating stratified surveys in potential wildlife habitat to determine the distribution of this and other cryptic threatened species. © 2020, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The original version of this article unfortunately contained mistakes in the Discussion and Acknowledgments sections. The changes are shown below: 1. In the second paragraph of the Discussion section, line 10, it reads: ‘In addition, a difference in decay rates of sticks between the north and south would not account for the fact that more ponerine tools were found to the north than to the south (although the difference was not significant), vs. the opposite pattern for Dorylus tools.’ The actual pattern found was the opposite of this, of course: significantly more epigaeic Dorylus tools were found to the north than to the south, while (nonsignificantly) more ponerine tools were found to the south. 2. In the Acknowledgments section, Adam Darby-Singh’s family name was incorrectly spelled as “Darby-Si Singh”.

ABSTRACT: While declining physical performance is an expected consequence of ageing, human clinical research has placed increasing emphasis on physical frailty as a predictor of death and disability in the elderly. We examined non-invasive measures approximating frailty in a richly sampled longitudinal dataset on wild chimpanzees. Using urinary creatinine to assess lean body mass, we found moderate but significant declines in physical condition with age in both sexes. While older chimpanzees spent less of their day in the trees and feeding, they did not alter activity budgets with respect to travel or resting. There was little evidence that declining lean body mass had negative consequences independent of age. Old chimpanzees with poor lean body mass rested more often but did not otherwise differ in activity. Males, but not females, in poor condition were more likely to exhibit respiratory illness. Poor muscle mass was associated acutely with death in males, but it did not predict future mortality in either sex. While there may be some reasons to suspect biological differences in the susceptibility to frailty in chimpanzees versus humans, our data are consistent with recent reports from humans that lean, physically active individuals can successfully combat frailty.

ABSTRACT: With one million animal species at risk of extinction, there is an urgent need to regularly monitor threatened species. However, in practice this is challenging, especially with wide-ranging, elusive and cryptic species or those that occur at low density. Here we compare two non-invasive methods, passive acoustic monitoring (n = 12) and camera trapping (n = 53), to detect chimpanzees Pan troglodytes in a savanna-woodland mosaic habitat at the Issa Valley, Tanzania. With occupancy modelling we evaluate the efficacy of each method, using the estimated number of sampling days needed to establish chimpanzee absence with 95% probability, as our measure of efficacy. Passive acoustic monitoring was more efficient than camera trapping in detecting wild chimpanzees. Detectability varied over seasons, likely due to social and ecological factors that influence party size and vocalization rate. The acoustic method can infer chimpanzee absence with less than 10 days of recordings in the field during the late dry season, the period of highest detectability, which was five times faster than the visual method. Synthesis and applications. Despite some technical limitations, we demonstrate that passive acoustic monitoring is a powerful tool for species monitoring. Its applicability in evaluating presence/absence, especially but not exclusively for loud call species, such as cetaceans, elephants, gibbons or chimpanzees provides a more efficient way of monitoring populations and inform conservation plans to mediate species-loss. © 2020 British Ecological Society

ABSTRACT: A number of social animals produce food-associated calls, which have been interpreted as informative and referential about the quality or quantity of food accessed by the caller. In chimpanzees, however, some behavioural patterns have remained unexplained by this model, suggesting that food-associated calls have a more generalized social function beyond attracting others to food, such as promoting tolerance between co-feeding individuals. In this study, we investigated how wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) of Budongo Forest, Uganda, use food associated-calls in situations when social tolerance is low, i.e., during agonistic interactions. We found a positive relationship between food calling and agonistic behaviours during a feeding event, independent of the number of males on the feeding patch. Moreover, food calling followed rather than preceded agonistic interactions, suggesting that aggression can trigger food call production. These results support the view that chimpanzee food-associated calls can act as social tools mediating competitive or aggressive interactions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are a crucial model for understanding the evolution of human health and longevity. Cardiovascular disease is a major source of mortality during ageing in humans and therefore a key issue for comparative research. Current data indicate that compared to humans, chimpanzees have proatherogenic blood lipid profiles, an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease in humans. However, most work to date on chimpanzee lipids come from laboratory-living populations where lifestyles diverge from a wild context. Here, we examined cardiovascular profiles in chimpanzees living in African sanctuaries, who range semi-free in large forested enclosures, consume a naturalistic diet, and generally experience conditions more similar to a wild chimpanzee lifestyle. We measured blood lipids, body weight and body fat in 75 sanctuary chimpanzees and compared them to publicly available data from laboratory-living chimpanzees from the Primate Aging Database. We found that semi-free-ranging chimpanzees exhibited lower body weight and lower levels of lipids that are risk factors for human cardiovascular disease, and that some of these disparities increased with age. Our findings support the hypothesis that lifestyle can shape health indices in chimpanzees, similar to effects observed across human populations, and contribute to an emerging understanding of human cardiovascular health in an evolutionary context.

ABSTRACT: The genetic evolution of HIV-1 from its progenitor virus SIV following cross-species transmission is not well understood. Here we simulated the SIVcpz initial transmission to humans using humanized mice and followed the viral evolution during serial passages lasting more than a year. All three SIVcpz progenitor viruses used, namely LB715 and MB897 (group M) as well as EK505 (group N) readily infected hu-mice resulting in chronic viremia. Viral loads increased progressively to higher set-points and the CD4+ T cell decline became more pronounced by the end of the second serial passage indicating viral adaptation and increased pathogenicity. Viral genomes sequenced at different time points revealed many non-synonymous variants not previously reported that occurred throughout the viral genome, including the gag, pol, env, and nef genes. These results shed light on the potential changes that the SIVcpz genome had undergone during the initial stages of human infection and subsequent spread. © Copyright © 2020 Schmitt, Curlin, Remling-Mulder, Moriarty, Goff, O’Connor, Stenglein, Marx and Akkina.

ABSTRACT: Objectives: To document ophthalmic findings, Schirmer's tear test I (STT), and intraocular pressure (IOP) values for anesthetized chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Animals Studied: Ten captive chimpanzees from Zoo Knoxville and Chattanooga Zoo. Procedures: Ten chimpanzees were anesthetized for annual physical examinations, blood collection, and ophthalmic examination. Each was anesthetized with intramuscular (IM) injections of dexmedetomidine, midazolam, and ketamine. Ophthalmic findings and STT and IOP values in addition to general health information were recorded for each chimpanzee. Pupillary diameter was measured after topical tropicamide administration. A Shapiro-Wilk test of normality was done for age, weight, STT values, IOP values, and pupil size. Results: Ages ranged from 11 to 42 years. Weight range was 40.9-83.6 kg. The mean STT was 13.4 ± 5.3 mm/min. The mean IOP was 14 ± 4.2 mm Hg. Seven of the 10 chimpanzees were considered geriatric, and each had perilimbal lipid deposits. Sedative-associated miosis was successfully counteracted with a regimen of repeated applications of tropicamide, enabling complete fundic examination. Conclusions: A complete ophthalmic examination can be done on anesthetized chimpanzees with the protocol used in this study. © 2020 American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists

ABSTRACT: The vasopressin system has been implicated in the regulation of social behavior and cognition in humans, nonhuman primates and other social mammals. In chimpanzees, polymorphisms in the vasopressin V1a receptor gene (AVPR1A) have been associated with social dimensions of personality, as well as to responses to sociocommunicative cues and mirror self-recognition. Despite evidence of this association with social cognition and behavior, there is little research on the neuroanatomical correlates of AVPR1A variation. In the current study, we tested the association between AVPR1A polymorphisms in the RS3 promotor region and gray matter covariation in chimpanzees using magnetic resonance imaging and source-based morphometry. The analysis identified 13 independent brain components, three of which differed significantly in covariation between the two AVPR1A genotypes (DupB−/− and DupB+/−; P <.05). DupB+/− chimpanzees showed greater covariation in gray matter in the premotor and prefrontal cortex, basal forebrain, lunate and cingulate cortex, and lesser gray matter covariation in the superior temporal sulcus and postcentral sulcus. Some of these regions were previously found to differ in vasopressin and oxytocin neural fibers between nonhuman primates, and in AVPR1A gene expression in humans with different RS3 alleles. This is the first report of an association between AVPR1A and gray matter covariation in nonhuman primates, and specifically links an AVPR1A polymorphism to structural variation in the social brain network. These results further affirm the value of chimpanzees as a model species for investigating the relationship between genetic variation, brain structure and social cognition with relevance to psychiatric disorders, including autism. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and International Behavioural and Neural Genetics Society

ABSTRACT: Wild great apes build beds for sleeping by combining tree branches or other vegetation, but the development of this behavior is poorly understood. We investigated the development of bed-building behaviors by conducting complementary cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of captive chimpanzees. In the cross-sectional study, we created an ethogram of behaviors related to bed-building by observing 59 chimpanzees living at the Kumamoto Sanctuary, Kyoto University, and the Kyoto City Zoo. In the longitudinal study, we installed bed-building platforms, provided branches on the platforms on a regular basis, and recorded behaviors of five chimpanzees (including an infant born in 2013) over a 3-year period from February 2015 to February 2018 at the Kyoto City Zoo (total 490.7 h). We found that all the chimpanzees performed some form of bed-building behavior but wild-born chimpanzees possessed more sophisticated techniques than captive-born chimpanzees. We also found that although the offspring of a wild-born female only showed simple techniques at the beginning of the longitudinal study, his repertoire of bed-building behaviors became as complex as that of his mother by the age of five. Our results suggest that improved bed-building behaviors can be supported in captive-born great apes by providing learning opportunities during appropriate stages of development. © 2020, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: There is no literature referring to the ancient iconographic depiction of apes in the eastern circum-Mediterranean region and the Near East. Written reports such as the Old Testament mention apes, but this may be a reference to monkeys, while Hanno the Carthaginian Navigator referred to chimpanzees in the 5th–6th century BC. Here we describe two marble figures, belonging to a private gallery, allegedly from Middle Bronze Age Elam. They represent a “seated monkey” and a “crouched monkey.” Detailed observation and analysis of the morphological characters of both figures show that they almost certainly represent chimpanzees. If the dates and provenance of this material are correct, they are the earliest known representations of African apes. It would follow that chimpanzees were traded, as living animals, as artifacts or imageries, along an extended distance from the Central African forests to the east coast of Africa towards Elam, by the 2nd millennium BC. Alternatively, the figures may date from the Roman period, in which case the circulation of these apes or ape representations occurred centuries later, possibly from other parts of Africa. As these figures are relevant for the archaeoprimatological record, their archeological contexts require further detailed studies. Nevertheless, whether the figures are of Elamite or Roman origin, they are the earliest known representations of chimpanzees. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Background: Dried blood spots (DBS) are used in human medicine to measure total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) in the blood. However, this easy and affordable sampling technique has not been evaluated in primates to measure vitamin D concentrations. Objectives: We aimed to compare 25-OHD measurements in chimpanzee serum at two different laboratories and determine the precision and accuracy of the DBS method by comparing DBS and serum results. Methods: Blood samples from 17 captive chimpanzees were collected, and 25-OHD3 and 25-OHD2 were measured in serum at two accredited laboratories using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The same analytes were measured on DBS cards, and results were compared with that of serum. Data were assessed using the Spearman correlation, Deming regression, and Bland-Altman analyses. Results: The correlation coefficient between the two measurements in serum was rs =.51 (P =.04), and the mean bias was −1.25 ± 14.83. When comparing 25-OHD concentrations measured in DBS and serum at the same laboratory, the rs was 0.7 (P =.002), and the mean bias was 1.42 ± 14.58. Estimated intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation for DBS results were 6% and 12.6%, respectively. Conclusions: Although substantial analytical variability was found in 25-OHD measurements regardless of the sample type, the identification of both constant and proportional error and wider limits of agreement with the DBS technique makes the interpretation of DBS results challenging, especially for values close to clinical cut-off points. The DBS and serum methods were not interchangeable, and further studies are needed to validate DBS samples for vitamin D measurements in chimpanzees. © 2020 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Recent improvements in tracking technologies have resulted in a growing number of fine-scale animal movement studies in a variety of fields, from wildlife management to animal cognition. Most studies assume that an animal's ‘optimal’ foraging route is linear, ignoring the role the energy landscape can play in influencing movement efficiency. Our objective was to investigate whether landscape features that affect movement costs (topographical variation, superstrate and substrate) influence the movement of chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, in a rugged, montane environment. We tested for route reuse and preferential use of human-made trails and ridge tops, using 14 months of focal follow data from 14 individuals and maps of established chimpanzee trails. Chimpanzees travelled on human-made trails significantly more than expected and showed weak preference for use of ridge tops for travel. Line density analysis demonstrated route reuse in chimpanzees and uncovered a network of high-use routes across their range. To our knowledge, this is the first study to empirically demonstrate route reuse and preferential use of human-made trails for travel by chimpanzees. We discuss the energetic and cognitive benefits of trail use and the implications for chimpanzee sociality. By applying resource selection and line density analysis to fine-scale movement data, this study demonstrates the importance of incorporating landscape features in predictive animal movement models. © 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ABSTRACT: Social grooming is often exchanged between individuals in many primate species. Rates of bidirectional (or simultaneous mutual) grooming vary across primate species, and its function is not yet fully understood. For example, mutual grooming is frequent in chimpanzees but rare in most primate species including wild bonobos. There are, however, no quantitative data available in captive bonobos. Therefore, through the direct comparison between captive bonobos and chimpanzees, this study aimed to (i) compare the frequency of mutual grooming between Pan species, (ii) explore and compare the function of mutual grooming, and (iii) discuss the rarity of this behavior in wild bonobo populations. We tested three hypotheses following the previous literature in wild chimpanzees. The social bonding hypothesis states that mutual grooming facilitates the maintenance of strong dyadic bonds. The immediate investment hypothesis states that it serves to signal willingness to invest in the interaction. The switching hypothesis states that mutual grooming serves no function but only occurs as an overlap to change the direction of unidirectional grooming. Our findings strongly supported the immediate investment hypothesis, but not the others. Grooming bouts that included mutual grooming were longer and more equitable than bouts without, illustrating that captive Pan species use mutual grooming to maximize their short-Term benefits and increase the social value of their interaction. Captive bonobos performed mutual grooming in similar proportions and for similar functions as captive and wild chimpanzees do. This contrasts with wild bonobos who engage in this behavior only rarely. We suggest that the differences in patterns of mutual grooming between captive and wild bonobos might be explained by different degrees of kinship or by a potential intraspecies variation.  © 2020

ABSTRACT: Compared with most mammals, postnatal development in great apes is protracted, presenting both an extended period of phenotypic plasticity to environmental conditions and the potential for sustained mother-offspring and/or sibling conflict over resources. Comparisons of cortisol levels during ontogeny can reveal physiological plasticity to species or population specific socioecological factors and in turn how these factors might ameliorate or exaggerate mother-offspring and sibling conflict. Here, we examine developmental patterns of cortisol levels in two wild chimpanzee populations (Budongo and Taï), with two and three communities each, and one wild bonobo population (LuiKotale), with two communities. Both species have similar juvenile life histories. Nonetheless, we predicted that key differences in socioecological factors, such as feeding competition, would lead to interspecific variation in mother-offspring and sibling conflict and thus variation in ontogenetic cortisol patterns. We measured urinary cortisol levels in 1394 samples collected from 37 bonobos and 100 chimpanzees aged up to 12 years. The significant differences in age-related variation in cortisol levels appeared population specific rather than species specific. Both bonobos and Taï chimpanzees had comparatively stable and gradually increasing cortisol levels throughout development; Budongo chimpanzees experienced declining cortisol levels before increases in later ontogeny. These age-related population differences in cortisol patterns were not explained by mother-offspring or sibling conflict specifically; instead, the comparatively stable cortisol patterns of bonobos and Taï chimpanzees likely reflect a consistency in experience of competition and the social environment compared with Budongo chimpanzees, where mothers may adopt more variable strategies related to infanticide risk and resource availability. The clear population-level differences within chimpanzees highlight potential intraspecific flexibility in developmental processes in apes, suggesting the flexibility and diversity in rearing strategies seen in humans may have a deep evolutionary history. © 2020 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Abbreviata caucasica (syn. Physaloptera mordens) has been reported in human and various non-human primates including great apes. The identification of this nematode is seldom performed and relies on egg characterization at the coproscopy, in the absence of any molecular tool. Following the recovery of two adult females of A. caucasica from the feces of wild Senegalese chimpanzees, morphometric characteristics were reported and new data on the width of the esophagus (0.268– 0.287 mm) and on the cuticle structure (0.70–0.122 mm) were provided. The molecular characterization of a set of mitochondrial (cox1, 16S rRNA, 12S rRNA) and nuclear (18S rRNA and ITS2) partial genes was performed. Our phylogenetic analysis indicates for the first time that A. caucasica is monophyletic with Physaloptera species. A novel molecular tool was developed for the routine diagnosis of A. caucasica and the surveillance of Nematoda infestations. An A. caucasica-specific qPCR targeting the 12S gene was assessed. The assay was able to detect up to 1.13 × 10−3 eggs/g of fecal matter irrespective of its consistency, with an efficiency of 101.8% and a perfect adjustment (R2 = 0.99). The infection rate by A. caucasica in the chimpanzee fecal samples was 52.08%. Only 6.19% of the environmental samples were positive for nematode DNA and any for A. caucasica. Our findings indicate the need for further studies to clarify the epidemiology, circulation, life cycle, and possible pathological effects of this infestation using the molecular tool herein developed. © 2020 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Understanding the capacity for humans to share resources (crops, wild foods, space) with large-bodied wildlife is vital for biodiversity conservation and human wellbeing, and requires comprehensive examination of their temporal interactions over fine spatial scales. We combined ecological (plant identification, wild fruit availability plots, animal fecal and trace sampling) and social science (free-listing, semi-structured interviews, participant observation) methods to systematically and simultaneously collect data on the availability and selection of fruits from wild plants by humans and critically endangered chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus), a national conservation flagship species at Cantanhez National Park, Guinea-Bissau. Within an area of 12.7 km2, we demonstrate that local people’s monthly use of wild fruits was driven by its overall availability in the habitat, whereas chimpanzees, as ripe fruit specialists, sought out fruits year-round. Humans and chimpanzees overlap in the selection of fruits from at least 27 wild plant species. The ranked use of fruits from species which were used by both chimpanzees and humans was significantly positively correlated, suggesting they preferentially target fruits of the same wild plant species. Each month, humans and chimpanzees selected three to six of the same wild fruit species. Chimpanzees fed significantly more on wild fruit species that were available for longer periods, with no effect of that plant species density. Neither plant density nor number of fruiting months impacted human selection of fruit from a plant species, suggesting people might seek out desired resources irrespective of a species’ abundance in the landscape. These findings are important for the development of a shared knowledge base to establish culturally relevant conservation management strategies. We recommend the active management of plant species that are exploited for their fruits by both humans and chimpanzees at Cantanhez National Park, including figs (Ficus spp.), oil-palm (Elaeis guineensis) and velvet tamarind (Dialium guineense). This can be achieved through supporting traditional resource management practices and the strategic replanting of shared plants in deforested areas and degraded corridors between forest fragments. This situation is representative of human-chimpanzee coexistence scenarios found across West Africa; the importance of shared resource use should be incorporated into local, national and regional conservation strategies. © Copyright © 2020 Hockings, Parathian, Bessa and Frazão-Moreira.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees in zoos with sufficient and appropriate environmental enrichment devices are expected to exhibit behaviors, interactions, and societies similar to those in the wild. In this study, we compared the activity budgets of each observed behavior, characteristics of social grooming, and social networks of captive chimpanzees at Tama Zoological Park (Tama) with those of wild chimpanzees at Mahale Mountains National Park, Tanzania (Mahale), and tested our predictions. We surveyed 16 chimpanzees in both Tama and Mahale and recorded the behaviors and individuals in proximity of each focal individual and social grooming the focal individuals participated in. The proportion of time spent collecting foraging was significantly lower in Tama than in Mahale. Additionally, the percentage of mutual grooming was much higher in Tama than in Mahale. All focal individuals in Mahale performed mutual grooming interactions, including grooming handclasp (GHC) but this was not observed in Tama. The result of a high rate of mutual grooming in chimpanzees in Tama without GHC and the finding that individuals forming the core of their social network are sex independent suggest that chimpanzees placed in an appropriate environmental enrichment have idiosyncratic grooming or social features, even in captivity. © 2020 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Socioecological environments that promote frequent interaction and social tolerance have favored the evolution of strong and equitable social bonds, which facilitate cooperation and confer fitness benefits. In most species, kinship is the primary predictor of bond strength and quality, but it does not adequately explain partner choice among adult male chimpanzees. Instead, most bonds and cooperative interactions occur among unrelated individuals, likely because of a lack of brothers among available partners. To identify what factors drive partner choice when kinship does not, we investigated the strength and quality of social bonds among adult male chimpanzees (N = 26) at Gombe National Park, Tanzania. Maternal brothers, when present, formed stronger bonds than other dyads, and maternal brothers who were close in age or rank formed the strongest bonds. Among dyads that were not maternal brothers, however, the strength of social bonds was not associated with either age difference or rank difference. Additionally, dyads with stronger bonds groomed more equitably than other dyads, as did maternal brothers and dyads close in rank. Bonds were stable, community-wide, for 2 years on average, while lasting up to 13 years. Overall, there remains no clear-cut explanation for partner choice among male chimpanzees. Demographic constraints limit the impact of kinship, and the effects of age and rank difference are small or nonexistent, suggesting that bond strength results from a more complex process than a simple accounting of basic characteristics. Instead, dyads may possess some distinct quality that engenders strength and stability, such as compatible personalities. Significance statement: Strong social ties are associated with increased fitness in several species, including humans, baboons, feral horses, and dolphins. Although close kin typically form the strongest bonds, kinship explains only a limited number of bonds (and associated cooperation) among adult male chimpanzees. To identify what factors influence partner choice when kinship does not, we examined social bonds among adult male chimpanzees at Gombe National Park, Tanzania. Males formed strong, stable bonds and groomed more equitably with strong bond partners. Nevertheless, kinship, age difference, and rank difference did not fully explain male partner choice. These results contrast with findings in other species, where stronger and more equitable bonds are typically formed by kin as well as those that are close in age and rank. Instead, male chimpanzee dyads may possess some distinct quality that promotes strength and stability, such as compatible personalities. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Primates are sometimes categorized in terms of their habitat. Although such categorization can be oversimplistic, there are scientific benefits from the clarity and consistency that habitat categorization can bring. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) inhabit various environments, but researchers often refer to “forest” or “savanna” chimpanzees. Despite the wide use of this forest–savanna distinction, clear definitions of these landscapes for chimpanzees, based on environmental variables at study sites or determined in relation to existing bioclimatic classifications, are lacking. The robustness of the forest–savanna distinction thus remains to be assessed. We review 43 chimpanzee study sites to assess how the landscape classifications of researchers fit with the environmental characteristics of study sites and with three bioclimatic classifications. We use scatterplots and principal components analysis to assess the distribution of chimpanzee field sites along gradients of environmental variables (temperature, rainfall, precipitation seasonality, forest cover, and satellite-derived Hansen tree cover). This revealed an environmental continuum of chimpanzee study sites from savanna to dense forest, with a rarely acknowledged forest mosaic category in between, but with no natural separation into these three classes and inconsistencies with the bioclimatic classifications assessed. The current forest–savanna dichotomy therefore masks a progression of environmental adaptation for chimpanzees, and we propose that recognizing an additional, intermediate “forest mosaic” category is more meaningful than focusing on the ends of this environmental gradient only. Future studies should acknowledge this habitat continuum, place their study sites on the forest–savanna gradient, and include detailed environmental data to support further attempts at quantification. © 2020, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: Many species are threatened with extinction as their population sizes decrease with changing environments or face novel pathogenic threats. A reduction of genetic diversity at major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes may have dramatic effects on populations' survival, as these genes play a key role in adaptive immunity. This might be the case for chimpanzees, the MHC genes of which reveal signatures of an ancient selective sweep likely due to a viral epidemic that reduced their population size a few million years ago. To better assess how this past event affected MHC variation in chimpanzees compared to humans, we analysed several indexes of genetic diversity and linkage disequilibrium across seven MHC genes on four cohorts of chimpanzees and we compared them to those estimated at orthologous HLA genes in a large set of human populations. Results: Interestingly, the analyses uncovered similar patterns of both molecular diversity and linkage disequilibrium across the seven MHC genes in chimpanzees and humans. Indeed, in both species the greatest allelic richness and heterozygosity were found at loci A, B, C and DRB1, the greatest nucleotide diversity at loci DRB1, DQA1 and DQB1, and both significant global linkage disequilibrium and the greatest proportions of haplotypes in linkage disequilibrium were observed at pairs DQA1-DQB1, DQA1-DRB1, DQB1-DRB1 and B-C. Our results also showed that, despite some differences among loci, the levels of genetic diversity and linkage disequilibrium observed in contemporary chimpanzees were globally similar to those estimated in small isolated human populations, in contrast to significant differences compared to large populations. Conclusions: We conclude, first, that highly conserved mechanisms shaped the diversity of orthologous MHC genes in chimpanzees and humans. Furthermore, our findings support the hypothesis that an ancient demographic decline affecting the chimpanzee populations - like that ascribed to a viral epidemic - exerted a substantial effect on the molecular diversity of their MHC genes, albeit not more pronounced than that experienced by HLA genes in human populations that underwent rapid genetic drift during humans' peopling history. We thus propose a model where chimpanzees' MHC genes regenerated molecular variation through recombination/gene conversion and/or balancing selection after the selective sweep. © 2020 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Chimpanzees and humans establish preferences over individuals they may benefit more from through scoring indirect reputation. However, humans prefer prosocial individuals even at their own cost. Giving preference to prosocial reputation over material rewards might have permitted the establishment of cooperative human societies. We tested the evolutionary roots of this propensity: importantly, in our study, the reputation scored had no food involved. Eighteen chimpanzees watched a performance where an antisocial experimenter hit a human victim and a prosocial experimenter interrupted the fight and consoled the victim. Next, the chimpanzees begged food from one of them. In Phase 2, the experimenters offered different food amounts (antisocial + 4 vs. prosocial + 1). Chimpanzees significantly prioritized rewards over reputation (i.e., chose antisocial). In Phase 3, both experimenters offered two pieces of food. Most of the subjects showed indifference to reputation (i.e., chose randomly). Watching fights produced significantly more arousal than consolations. Emotional engagement could not account for chimpanzees’ choices since their choices varied between phases but their arousal did not. Ontogeny and rearing history might play a role in chimpanzees’ choices: the adolescent males (n = 3) consistently chose the antisocial individual whereas hand-reared subjects chose significantly different from mother-reared. We discuss whether the valence of the reputation is species-specific. Significance statement: From an evolutionary perspective, being able to learn indirect reputation is relevant for the individual’s fitness. Both chimpanzees and humans have previously proved to choose those who will presumably behave in the future in a way they could benefit from, suggesting similar underlying cognitive processes that would have emerged at an earlier common ancestor. However, both species approach differently to prosocial individuals. Humans live in societies where there is common agreement about certain universal rights which should always prevail, and thus they are more willing to approach prosocial individuals, even at their own cost. By contrast, in our study, chimpanzees, whose societies are based on unequitable distribution of power and resources, were not that willing to consistently and costly approach prosocial individuals. Moreover, other interpersonal factors, such as the type of upbringing or age-related changes in behavior (aggressiveness during adolescence), might have accounted for these differences. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Behavioral flexibility, including an ability to modify feeding behavior, is a key trait enabling primates to survive in forest fragments. In human-dominated landscapes, unprotected forest fragments can become progressively degraded, and may be cleared entirely, challenging the capacity of primates to adjust to the changes. We examined responses of wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) to major habitat change: that is, clearance of forest fragments for agriculture. Over 7 years, fragments in Bulindi, Uganda, were reduced in size by 80%. We compared the chimpanzees’ diet at the start and end of this period of rapid deforestation, using data derived mainly from fecal analysis. Similar to other long-term study populations, chimpanzees in Bulindi have a diverse diet comprising over 169 plant foods. However, extensive deforestation seemed to impact their feeding ecology. Dietary changes after fragment clearance included reduced overall frugivory, reduced intake of figs (Ficus spp.; formerly a dietary “staple” for these chimpanzees), and reduced variety of fruits in fecal samples. Nevertheless, the magnitude of most changes was remarkably minor given the extent of forest loss. Agricultural fruits increased in dietary importance, with crops accounting for a greater proportion of fruits in fecal samples after deforestation. In particular, cultivated jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus) became a “staple” food for the chimpanzees but was scarcely eaten before fragment clearance. Crops offer some nutritional benefits for primates, being high in carbohydrate energy and low in hard-to-digest fiber. Thus, crop feeding may have offset foraging costs associated with loss of wild foods and reduced overall frugivory for the chimpanzees. The adaptability of many primates offers hope for their conservation in fragmented, rural landscapes. However, long-term data are needed to establish whether potential benefits (i.e. energetic, reproductive) of foraging in agricultural matrix habitats outweigh fitness costs from anthropogenic mortality risk for chimpanzees and other adaptable primates. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: A key feature of human behavioral diversity is that it can be constrained by cultural preference (“cultural override”); that is, population-specific preferences can override resource availability. Here we investigate whether a similar phenomenon can be found in one of our closest relatives, as well as the potential impacts of ecological differences on feeding behavior. Our study subjects were different subpopulations of Eastern chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) occupying two very different habitats, moist tropical lowland forests vs. moist tropical forest–savanna mosaic on opposite sides of a major river. Given differences in encounter rates of different kinds of tool sites on both sides of the Uele River, we predicted that these subpopulations would differ in their likelihood of using tools to prey on two insect species despite similar availability. In surveys conducted over a 9-year period at 19 different survey regions in northern Democratic Republic of Congo (10 in lowland forest and 9 in mosaic), we collected and analyzed data on chimpanzee tool-assisted exploitation of insects. To determine the availability of insect species eaten by the chimpanzees, we counted insects and their mounds on transects and recces at 12 of these sites. For stick tools used to harvest epigaeic Dorylus and ponerine ants, we evaluated seasonal, geographical, and prey-availability factors that might influence their occurrence, using nest encounter rate as a proxy to control for chimpanzee abundance. Across the 19 survey regions spanning both sides of the Uele, we found little difference in the availability of epigaeic Dorylus and ponerine ants. Despite this, tool encounter rates for epigaeic Dorylus, but not ponerine, ants were significantly higher in the mosaic to the north of the Uele. Furthermore, we found no evidence for termite fishing anywhere, despite the availability of Macrotermes mounds throughout the region and the fact that chimpanzees at a number of other study sites use tools to harvest these termites. Instead, the chimpanzees of this region used a novel percussive technique to harvest two other types of termites, Cubitermes sp. and Thoracotermes macrothorax. This mismatch between prey availability and predation is consistent with cultural override, but given the different habitats on the two sides of the Uele River, we cannot fully rule out the influence of ecological factors. Comparing our findings with those of similar studies of other chimpanzee populations promises to contribute to our understanding of the evolution of behavioral diversity in humans and our closest cousins. © 2020, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees are the closest living relatives of humans. The divergence between human and chimpanzee ancestors dates to approximately 6,5-7,5 million years ago. Genetic features distinguishing us from chimpanzees and making us humans are still of a great interest. After divergence of their ancestor lineages, human and chimpanzee genomes underwent multiple changes including single nucleotide substitutions, deletions and duplications of DNA fragments of different size, insertion of transposable elements and chromosomal rearrangements. Human-specific single nucleotide alterations constituted 1.23% of human DNA, whereas more extended deletions and insertions cover ~ 3% of our genome. Moreover, much higher proportion is made by differential chromosomal inversions and translocations comprising several megabase-long regions or even whole chromosomes. However, despite of extensive knowledge of structural genomic changes accompanying human evolution we still cannot identify with certainty the causative genes of human identity. Most structural gene-influential changes happened at the level of expression regulation, which in turn provoked larger alterations of interactome gene regulation networks. In this review, we summarized the available information about genetic differences between humans and chimpanzees and their potential functional impacts on differential molecular, anatomical, physiological and cognitive peculiarities of these species. © 2020 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) have been known for a long time to have color vision identical to humans (Grether in J Comp Psychol 29(2):167–177, 1940b; Jacobs et al. in Vis Res 36(16):2587–2594, 1996). With this study, we wonder if chimpanzees, as humans, show preferences for some colors rather than others. During a first range of experiments, we test their ability to discriminate all the colors from our set, through easy matching-to-sample tasks. The seven chimpanzees that participate in this first test show the results we can expect from chimpanzees with normal color vision. Then, six of them are tested for preferences. This range of experiments results in the existence of consistent tendencies across all the trials and situations, as chimpanzees would mostly first choose some particular colors, and conversely choose last different colors. Although the results for color discrimination are identical for all the seven chimpanzees, preference tests demonstrate four different tendencies. This study is the first step toward broader experiments, including more chimpanzee subjects, but also different species, with the only requirement of being trained to the basic use of a touch panel interface. © 2020, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes),with a dwindling population size, are distributed across sub-Saharan Africa. They are classified into two biogeographical clusters comprising of four subspecies: a western African cluster that includes P. t. verus and P. t. ellioti and a central/eastern African cluster that includes P. t. troglodytes and P. t. schweinfurthii. While the genetic distinctness of Nigeria-Cameroonian chimpanzees (P. t. ellioti) from western chimpanzees has been known for a while, the fine structures within P. t. ellioti population has remained under-studied. In this study, we developed the first ever ancestry informative marker (AIMs) panel that can detect the fine population structure within Nigeria-Cameroonian chimpanzees with high resolution. We compared four commonly used AIMs-determining strategies, namely Infocalc algorithm, Wright’s FST, smart principal component analysis (SmartPCA) and ADMIXTURE to first identify the best approach and then developed an AIMs panel of 435 SNPs employing the consensus of the four approaches (n = 129), with additional supplements from the best two approaches (Infocalc and ADMIXTURE). To the best of our knowledge, we have developed the first-ever AIMs panel for chimpanzees, which can greatly aid in their planned reintroduction to the natural habitat, maintaining their genetic integrity through planned captive breeding, and in tracking illegal trading across the globe. © 2020, Indian Academy of Sciences.

ABSTRACT: Background: Alu elements are most abundant retrotransposons with > 1.2 million copies in the primate genome. AluYb8 subfamily was diverged from AluY lineage, and has accumulated eight diagnostic mutations and 7-bp duplication during primate evolution. A total of 1851 AluYb copies are present in the human genome, and most of them are human-specific. On the other hand, only a few AluYb8 copies were identified in the chimpanzee genome by previous studies on AluYb8. The significantly different number of species-specific AluYb8 elements between human and chimpanzee might result from the incompletion of chimpanzee reference genome sequences at the time of the previous study. Objective: AluYb8 elements could generate genomic structural variations in the chimpanzee genome. This study aimed to identify and characterize chimpanzee-specific AluYb elements using the most updated chimpanzee reference genome sequences (Jan. 2018, panTro6). Methods: To identify chimpanzee-specific AluYb8, we carried out genomic comparison with non-chimpanzee primate genome using the UCSC table browser. In addition, chimpanzee-specific AluYb8 candidates were manually inspected and experimentally verified using PCR and Sanger sequencing. Results: Among a total of 231 chimpanzee-specific AluYb8 candidates, 11 of the candidates are chimpanzee-specific AluYb8, and 29 elements are shared between the chimpanzee and non-chimpanzee primate genomes. Through the sequence analysis of AluYb8 and other Alu subfamilies, we were able to observe various diagnostic mutations and variable length duplications in 7-bp duplication region of AluYb8 element. In addition, we further validated two of the chimpanzee-specific AluYb8 elements (CS8 and CS20) that were not previously discovered by display PCR and Sanger sequencing. Interestingly, we identified a AluYb8 insertion-mediated deletion (CS8 locus) in the chimpanzee genome. Conclusion: Our study found that AluYb8 elements are much more abundant in the human genome than chimpanzee genome, and that it could be due to the absence of hyperactive “master” AluYb8 elements in the chimpanzee genome. © 2020, The Genetics Society of Korea.

ABSTRACT: Management of primates in captivity often presents the challenge of introducing new individuals into a group, and research investigating the stability of the social network in the medium term after the introduction can help inform management decisions. We investigated the behavior of a group of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) housed at Chester Zoo, UK over 12 months (divided into three periods of 4 months) following the introduction of a new adult female. We recorded grooming, proximity, other affiliative behaviors, and agonistic behaviors and used social network analysis to investigate the stability, reciprocity, and structure of the group, to examine the effect of rearing history on grooming network position and the role of sex in agonistic behavior. Both the grooming and agonistic networks correlated across all three periods, while affiliative networks correlated only between periods 2 and 3. Males had significantly higher out-degree centrality in agonistic behaviors than females, indicating that they carried out agonistic behaviors more often than females. There was no significant difference in centrality between hand-reared and mother-reared chimpanzees. Overall, the group structure was stable and cohesive during the first year after the introduction of the new female, suggesting that this change did not destabilize the group. Our findings highlight the utility of social network analysis in the study of primate sociality in captivity, and how it can be used to better understand primate behavior following the integration of new individuals. © 2020, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Age at lower first molar (M1) emergence is a commonly used proxy for inferring life-history scheduling in fossil primates, but its utility is dependent on knowing to what extent extant populations vary in this datum and how this variation correlates with the scheduling of life-history variables. Here, we address the first of these issues among extant chimpanzees. While age at M1 emergence has been documented in several live individuals from the Kanyawara population of Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii in Uganda, it has been estimated for only one individual of Pan troglodytes verus, based on a deceased animal from the Taï Forest in Côte d'Ivoire. To further explore interpopulation variation in this variable in chimpanzees, and using dental histology, we calculated ages at death for two wild-shot individuals of P. t. verus with erupting M1, both collected in Liberia during the mid-1950s, and estimated ages at M1 emergence from the ages at death. The overall range for these two individuals is ∼4.2–4.6 yr, compared with an age of ∼3.7 yr for the individual from the Taï Forest, and <2.5–3.3 yr for the several individuals of P. t. schweinfurthii. While the absolute range of ∼2 yr in these samples combined is little greater than in captive chimpanzees, the disparity between the samples of P. t. schweinfurthii and P. t. verus is striking, although it cannot be determined if this disparity represents a subspecies difference or simply population differences expressed in two different subspecies. While life-history data are unavailable for the population to which the Liberian chimpanzees belonged, the difference in M1 emergence ages between these individuals and those from Kanyawara still suggests caution when attempting even broad life-history inference in fossil apes and hominins based on age at M1 emergence. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The chimpanzee is one of our planet's best-loved and most instantly recognizable animals. Splitting from the human lineage between four and six million years ago, it is (along with its cousin, the bonobo) our closest living relative, sharing around 99 percent of our genes. First encountered by Westerners in the seventeenth century, virtually nothing was known about chimpanzees in their natural environment until 1960, when Jane Goodall traveled to Gombe to live and work with them. Accessibly written, yet fully referenced and uncompromising in its accuracy and comprehensiveness, this book encapsulates everything we currently know about chimpanzees: from their discovery and why we study them to their anatomy, physiology, genetics, and culture. The text is beautifully illustrated and infused with examples and anecdotes drawn from the author's 30 years of primate observation, making this a perfect resource for students of biological anthropology and primatology as well as non-specialists interested in chimpanzees. © Kevin D.

ABSTRACT: Studying animal grouping behavior is important for understanding the causes and consequences of sociality and has implications for conservation. Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) party size is often assessed by counting individuals or extracted indirectly from camera trap footage or the number of nests. Little is known, however, about consistency across methods for estimating party size. We collected party size data for wild chimpanzees in the Issa valley, western Tanzania, using direct observations, camera traps, and nest counts over six years (2012–2018). We compared mean monthly party size estimates calculated using each method and found that estimates derived from direct observations were weakly positively correlated with those derived from camera traps. Estimates from nest counts were not significantly correlated with either direct observations or camera traps. Overall observed party size was significantly larger than that estimated from both camera traps and nest counts. In both the dry and wet seasons, observed party size was significantly larger than camera trap party size, but not significantly larger than nest party size. Finally, overall party size and wet season party size estimated from camera traps were significantly smaller than nest party size, but this was not the case in the dry season. Our results reveal how data collection methods influence party size estimates in unhabituated chimpanzees and have implications for comparative analysis within and across primate communities. Specifically, future work must consider how estimates were calculated before we can reliably investigate environmental influences on primate behavior. © 2020, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Many primates show sex differences in behavior, particularly social behavior, but also tool use for extractive foraging. All great apes learn to build a supportive structure for sleep. Whether sex differences exist in building, as in extractive foraging, is unknown, and little is known about how building skills develop and vary between individuals in the wild. We therefore aimed to describe the nesting behavior of savanna chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) in Fongoli, Senegal to provide comparative data and to investigate possible sex or age differences in nest building behaviors and nest characteristics. We followed chimpanzee groups to their night nesting sites to record group (55 nights) and individual level data (17 individuals) on nest building initiation and duration (57 nests) during the dry season between October 2007 and March 2008. We returned the following morning to record nest and tree characteristics (71 nests built by 25 individuals). Fongoli chimpanzees nested later than reported for other great apes, but no sex differences in initiating building emerged. Observations were limited but suggest adult females and immature males to nest higher, in larger trees than adult males, and adult females to take longer to build than either adult or immature males. Smaller females and immature males may avoid predation or access thinner, malleable branches, by nesting higher than adult males. These differences suggest that sex differences described for chimpanzee tool use may extend to nest building, with females investing more time and effort in constructing a safe, warm structure for sleep than males do. © 2020, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Vocalizations linked to emotional states are partly conserved among phylogenetically related species. This continuity may allow humans to accurately infer affective information from vocalizations produced by chimpanzees. In two pre-registered experiments, we examine human listeners' ability to infer behavioural contexts (e.g. discovering food) and core affect dimensions (arousal and valence) from 155 vocalizations produced by 66 chimpanzees in 10 different positive and negative contexts at high, medium or low arousal levels. In experiment 1, listeners (n = 310), categorized the vocalizations in a forced-choice task with 10 response options, and rated arousal and valence. In experiment 2, participants (n = 3120) matched vocalizations to production contexts using yes/no response options. The results show that listeners were accurate at matching vocalizations of most contexts in addition to inferring arousal and valence. Judgments were more accurate for negative as compared to positive vocalizations. An acoustic analysis demonstrated that, listeners made use of brightness and duration cues, and relied on noisiness in making context judgements, and pitch to infer core affect dimensions. Overall, the results suggest that human listeners can infer affective information from chimpanzee vocalizations beyond core affect, indicating phylogenetic continuity in the mapping of vocalizations to behavioural contexts.  © 2020 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Projects to reduce emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) are designed to reduce carbon emissions through avoided deforestation and degradation, and in many cases, to produce additional community and biodiversity conservation co-benefits. While these co-benefits can be significant, quantifying conservation impacts has been challenging, and most projects use simple species presence to demonstrate positive biodiversity impact. Some of the same tools applied in the quantification of climate mitigation benefits have relevance and potential application to estimating co-benefits for biodiversity conservation. In western Tanzania, most chimpanzees live outside of national park boundaries, and thus face threats from human activity, including competition for suitable habitat. Through a case study of the Ntakata Mountains REDD project in western Tanzania, we demonstrate a combined application of deforestation modelling with species distribution models to assess forest conservation benefits in terms of avoided carbon emissions and improved chimpanzee habitat. The application of such tools is a novel approach that we argue permits the better design of future REDD projects for biodiversity co-benefits. This approach also enables project developers to produce the more manageable, accurate and cost-effective monitoring, reporting and verification of project impacts that are critical to verification under carbon standards. © 2020 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The electroencephalogram (EEG) waveform can predictably change with depth of anesthesia, and algorithms such as the Patient State index (PSi) have been developed to convert the waveform into a user-friendly objective reading of anesthetic depth. In this study, PSi values were measured in 10 captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) during three phases of an anesthetic event. Phase 1 included sedation with dexmedetomidine, midazolam, and ketamine. Phase 2 started with administration of an α-2 antagonist and isoflurane. Phase 3 started with discontinuing isoflurane and ended with spontaneous movement and extubation. Initial PSi readings for phase 1 were high at 74.5 ± 12.2 (mean ± SD), before declining to 24.1 ± 5.3 for the remainder of the phase. Phase 2 PSi values were recorded as 21.4 ± 5.4 and then climbed during phase 3. Spontaneous movement was recorded at PSi values of 72 to 79. Electroencephalographic monitoring via PSi was successfully performed during three phases of anesthesia in the chimpanzees and was consistent with human values reported during general anesthesia. This paper serves as a preliminary investigation into EEG monitoring of chimpanzees, and further work is needed for its validation. © Copyright 2020 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Increasing our understanding of primate gestural communication can provide new insights into language evolution. A key question in primate communication is the association between the social relationships of primates and their repertoire of gestures. Such analyses can reveal how primates use their repertoire of gestural communication to maintain their networks of family and friends, much as humans use language to maintain their social networks. In this study we examined the association between the repertoire of gestures (overall, manual and bodily gestures, and gestures of different modalities) and social bonds (presence of reciprocated grooming), coordinated behaviors (travel, resting, co-feeding), and the complexity of ecology (e.g. noise, illumination) and sociality (party size, audience), in wild East African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii). A larger repertoire size of manual, visual gestures was associated with the presence of a relationship based on reciprocated grooming and increases in social complexity. A smaller repertoire of manual tactile gestures occurred when the relationship was based on reciprocated grooming. A smaller repertoire of bodily gestures occurred between partners who jointly traveled for longer. Whereas gesture repertoire size was associated with social complexity, complex ecology also influenced repertoire size. The evolution of a large repertoire of manual, visual gestures may have been a key factor that enabled larger social groups to emerge during evolution. Thus, the evolution of the larger brains in hominins may have co-occurred with an increase in the cognitive complexity underpinning gestural communication and this, in turn, may have enabled hominins to live in more complex social groups. © 2019 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Premasticated food transfer, when an individual partially breaks down food through chewing and feeds it to another individual, usually mouth-to-mouth, is described widely across human cultures. This behavior plays an important role in modern humans’ strategy of complementary feeding, which involves supplementing maternal milk in infant diets with processed, easily digestible versions of adult foods. The extent to which other primates engage in premasticated food transfer with infants is unclear, as premasticated food transfers have been only occasionally reported in other ape species. We investigated premasticated food transfers in 62 mother-infant pairs of wild chimpanzees at Ngogo, Uganda, as well as unresisted food taking, when mothers passively allow infants to seize food. We evaluated the presence or absence and rates of premasticated food transfer and unresisted food taking relative to maternal parity and infant age and sex and assessed the food species and part used. We found that chimpanzee mothers regularly shared premasticated food with their infants aged between 6 months and 4 years, but they were more likely to share, and more frequently shared, with younger infants. The frequency with which females shared premasticated food may relate to maternal experience, as multiparous females shared premasticated food more often than did first-time mothers, which we did not find with unresisted food taking. Both easy-to-chew, commonly eaten foods and tougher, rarely eaten foods were shared. Premasticated food transfer and unresisted food taking may be infant-rearing strategies to facilitate the transition from a diet of exclusive maternal milk to solid food during early infancy. Premasticated food transfer in particular may provide energetic, immune, or growth benefits to infants through reduced chewing effort and maternal saliva. Given our findings in chimpanzees and earlier reports in other ape species, we suggest that the foundation of complementary feeding, a uniquely hominin strategy, might have been present in a common ancestor shared with the other great apes in the form of premasticated, mouth-to-mouth food transfer by mothers with their offspring. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: We used mitochondrial DNA to examine gene flow in a region of western Uganda that has received little attention regarding chimpanzee population dynamics. The area is critical to gene flow between isolated Democratic Republic of Congo populations and the rest of East Africa. None of the chimpanzees in each of the 4 protected areas under consideration (Toro-Semliki Wildlife Reserve, Semuliki National Park, Rwenzori Mountains National Park and Itwara Central Forest Reserve) are fully habituated. Therefore, it is not clear whether one or more populations have historically used this fragmented landscape for (1) regular ranging and/or (2) infrequent dispersal. We incorporated the published sequences of the first hypervariable region of the D-loop of the mitochondrial genome from 3 previously sampled sites (n = 39) while also contributing the first extensive genetic sampling of chimpanzees in Toro-Semliki (n = 80). Our goal was to generate a historical baseline model of metapopulation dynamics in this region and determine which, if any, of these protected areas forms a fragmented landscape for a single chimpanzee population. According to a discriminant analysis of principal components, the haplotypes at Toro-Semliki form a central cluster, and Itwara is its nearest genetic neighbor. Rwenzori Mountains National Park is the most distant neighbor of all protected areas. We performed an analysis of molecular variance for 14 different population models that divided the samples from the 4 protected areas into 2, 3 or 4 populations. The best fit model included 3 populations: Toro-Semliki Wildlife Reserve and Itwara Forest Reserve comprised a single population; Semuliki National Park and Rwenzori Mountains National Park formed 2 additional separate populations (variance among = 9%, p = 0.014). The results indicated that some protected areas comprised distinctive populations, while others formed a fragmented landscape for a population's ranging for foraging purposes. Therefore, the edges of a protected area do not always define a chimpanzee population. We propose a closer examination of those dynamics through renewed sampling. Advances in DNA extraction and next-generation sequencing will allow us to compare thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the genomes of unhabituated chimpanzees living in each of these protected areas. © 2020 S.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees are among the closest living relatives to humans and, as such, provide a crucial comparative model for investigating primate brain evolution. In recent years, human brain mapping has strongly benefited from enhanced computational models and image processing pipelines that could also improve data analyses in animals by using species-specific templates. In this study, we use structural MRI data from the National Chimpanzee Brain Resource (NCBR) to develop the chimpanzee brain reference template Juna.Chimp for spatial registration and the macro-anatomical brain parcellation Davi130 for standardized whole-brain analysis. Additionally, we introduce a ready-to-use image processing pipeline built upon the CAT12 toolbox in SPM12, implementing a standard human image preprocessing framework in chimpanzees. Applying this approach to data from 194 subjects, we find strong evidence for human-like age-related gray matter atrophy in multiple regions of the chimpanzee brain, as well as, a general rightward asymmetry in brain regions. © Vickery et al.

ABSTRACT: In humans, senescence increases susceptibility to viral infection. However, comparative data on viral infection in free-living non-human primates - even in our closest living relatives, chimpanzees and bonobos (Pan troglodytes and P. paniscus) - are relatively scarce, thereby constraining an evolutionary understanding of age-related patterns of viral infection. We investigated a population of wild eastern chimpanzees (P. t. schweinfurthii), using metagenomics to characterize viromes (full viral communities) in the faeces of 42 sexually mature chimpanzees (22 males, 20 females) from the Kanyawara and Ngogo communities of Kibale National Park, Uganda. We identified 12 viruses from at least four viral families possessing genomes of both single-stranded RNA and single-stranded DNA. Faecal viromes of both sexes varied with chimpanzee age, but viral richness increased with age only in males. This effect was largely due to three viruses, salivirus, porprismacovirus and chimpanzee stool-associated RNA virus (chisavirus), which occurred most frequently in samples from older males. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that selection on males for early-life reproduction compromises investment in somatic maintenance, which has delayed consequences for health later in life, in this case reflected in viral infection and/or shedding. Faecal viromes are therefore useful for studying processes related to the divergent reproductive strategies of males and females, ageing, and sex differences in longevity.

ABSTRACT: Energy investment in reproduction is predicted to trade off against other necessary physiological functions like immunity, but it is unclear to what extent this impacts fitness in long-lived species. Among mammals, female primates, and especially apes, exhibit extensive periods of investment in each offspring. During this time, energy diverted to gestation and lactation is hypothesized to incur short and long-term deficits in maternal immunity and lead to accelerated ageing. We examined the relationship between reproduction and immunity, as measured by faecal parasite counts, in wild female chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) of Kibale National Park, Uganda. While we observed higher parasite shedding (counts of eggs, cysts and larvae) in pregnant chimpanzees relative to cycling females, parasites rapidly decreased during early lactation, the most energetically taxing phase of the reproductive cycle. Additionally, while our results indicate that parasite shedding increases with age, females with higher fertility for their age had lower faecal parasite counts. Such findings support the hypothesis that the relatively conservative rate of female reproduction in chimpanzees may be protective against the negative effects of reproductive effort on health.

ABSTRACT: Populations of the common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) are in an impending risk of going extinct in the wild as a consequence of damaging anthropogenic impact on their natural habitat and illegal pet and bushmeat trade. Conservation management programmes for the chimpanzee have been established outside their natural range (ex situ), and chimpanzees from these programmes could potentially be used to supplement future conservation initiatives in the wild (in situ). However, these programmes have often suffered from inadequate information about the geographical origin and subspecies ancestry of the founders. Here, we present a newly designed capture array with ~60,000 ancestry informative markers used to infer ancestry of individual chimpanzees in ex situ populations and determine geographical origin of confiscated sanctuary individuals. From a test panel of 167 chimpanzees with unknown origins or subspecies labels, we identify 90 suitable non-admixed individuals in the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) Ex situ Programme (EEP). Equally important, another 46 individuals have been identified with admixed subspecies ancestries, which therefore over time, should be naturally phased out of the breeding populations. With potential for future re-introduction to the wild, we determine the geographical origin of 31 individuals that were confiscated from the illegal trade and demonstrate the promises of using non-invasive sampling in future conservation action plans. Collectively, our genomic approach provides an exemplar for ex situ management of endangered species and offers an efficient tool in future in situ efforts to combat the illegal wildlife trade. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Genetics Society.

ABSTRACT: In the present study we calculated the muscle fascicle length (MFL) and the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) in the elbow flexor muscles of five Homo sapiens and five Pan troglodytes. We also assessed the expression of the myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction in the same muscles and, finally, we analyzed the muscle insertion sites in the proximal epiphyses of the ulna and the radius with 3D geometric morphometrics. Our main objective is to identify quantitative differences in the elbow flexor muscles of Homo sapiens and Pan troglodytes in terms of muscle architecture, expression of MyHC isoforms, and bone insertion sites and to explore the association of these differences with the types of locomotion developed by these two species of hominoid primates. We observed that the elbow flexor muscles had a greater PCSA and a higher expression of the fast MyHC-II isoforms in Pan troglodytes, while they had a greater MFL and a higher expression of the slow MyHC-I isoform in Homo sapiens. The insertion site of the brachialis was larger in Pan troglodytes, while that of the biceps brachii was larger in Homo sapiens. Our findings may be related to the greater capacity of force generation in the elbow flexor muscles of Pan troglodytes, as an adaptation to vertical climbing, and to the greater contraction speed and resistance to fatigue of the muscles in Homo sapiens, as an adaptation to the manipulative function of the upper extremities. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The hunting activities of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) at Mahale Mountains National Park exhibited a significant change over a 46-year observation period, shifting from sporadic hunting for small ungulates and primates through seizure or chasing, to a specialized hunting habit for red colobus (Piliocolobus rufomitratus). By the early 1980s, a new hunting habit had developed through the following stages: (1) occasional single kills by mature/adolescent males, (2) multiple kills by mature/adolescent males, (3) participation of mature females in both multiple and single kills, and (4) increased frequencies of multiple kills and female participation in killing. Throughout the observation period, red colobus was the most frequently hunted species, accounting for 71.0% of all hunts, 68.1% of all kills, and 70.3% of the consumed prey. Adult/adolescent female chimpanzees accounted for 23.1% of all kills and 20.4% of red colobus kills, both of which are higher than proportions reported in other areas. There are several possible explanations for these changes: (1) improved observation conditions, including familiarization of the chimpanzees with human observers; (2) environmental changes such as forest and faunal recovery, particularly an increase in the red colobus population; (3) change(s) in observation methods; (4) a new invention or (5) reinvention by the Mimikire (M) group chimpanzees; and (6) the change in intergroup relationships between the M and Kajabala (K) groups. © 2020, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: A 19-year-old female chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) presented for cachexia, acute weakness, hyporexia, icterus, and polyuria. The animal was diagnosed with a hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state, which is a well-recognized syndrome in diabetic humans that is rarely diagnosed in animals.

ABSTRACT: The roots of human hunting and meat eating lie deep in our evolutionary past shared with chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). From the few habituated wild populations, we know that there is considerable variation in the extent to which chimpanzees consume meat. Expanding our knowledge of meat eating frequencies to more, yet unhabituated, populations requires noninvasive, indirect quantitative techniques. We here evaluate the use of stable isotopes to reconstruct meat-eating behavior in wild chimpanzees. We present hair isotope data (n = 260) of two western chimpanzee (P. troglodytes verus) groups from Taï forest (Côte d'Ivoire) and relate them to directly observed amounts of meat consumed, sex/female reproductive state, and group, while controlling for differences between individuals, seasons, and observation efforts. Succeeding seven months of hunting observations, we collected hair of 25 individuals for sequential analysis of δ15N and δ13C. Hunting success in the 7-month study period varied between the groups, with 25 successful hunts in the East group and only 8 in the North group. However, our models only found a direct relationship between amounts of meat consumed and variation within individual hair δ15N values in the East group, but not in the North group and not when comparing between individuals or groups. Although on average East group individuals consumed more than double the amount of meat than North group individuals, their δ15N values were significantly lower, suggesting that differences in microhabitat are substantial between group territories. The effect of sex/female reproductive state was significant in δ15N and δ13C, suggesting it related to access to food or feeding preferences. We conclude that several factors additional to diet are influencing and thus obscuring the isotope ratios in wild chimpanzee hair, particularly when comparing between sexes and social groups. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Beginning in the 1960s the first systematic projects dedicated to testing whether great apes could acquire some aspects of human language were conducted. The ape subjects demonstrated remarkable capacities to learn and use elements of either sign language or an artificial language. The results from research across several laboratories drew a mixture of excitement and skepticism, and critiques and debates have ensued since the earliest reports were published. This continues today. Terrace (2019, Nim: A chimpanzee who learned sign language. New York, NY: Columbia University Press) repeats many of the same points made decades earlier, and has added some additional critiques. That scientists hold different perspectives on what to conclude from ape language studies is expected. However, any conclusion one draws should be based upon available evidence, which we outline in this review. We also address the critiques offered by Terrace (2019), including the stance that apes cannot understand or use words. Focusing on symbol use by chimpanzees and bonobos we describe evidence that argues for understanding of words, including capacities for declarative communication and intersubjectivity found in these apes. We conclude that the many decades of research using a variety of symbol systems challenges the absolutist position that chimpanzees and bonobos cannot learn language or understand the concept of a word. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC

ABSTRACT: At zoos, and some sanctuaries, members of the public can observe the resident animals. Examining the characteristics and consequences of this type of human–animal encounter is important to understand public education and engagement as well as animal behavior and welfare. Zoos typically have a large and consistent visitor presence, and researchers report mixed findings regarding the effects of the visiting public on the behavior of resident primates. In contrast, public visitation at sanctuaries more often occurs sporadically and on a relatively small scale, as compared with zoos, and typically via organized tours or educational events. Owing to these differences, it is necessary to explore the effects of public programs on animals in sanctuary settings in addition to the more comprehensive efforts studying such influences in zoos. Therefore, we observed four groups of sanctuary chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) at Chimp Haven (USA) over one year, including opportunistic observations during public programs. These scheduled, but infrequent, educational events offered visitors the possibility to view chimpanzees in outdoor enclosures and sometimes included staff-led small tours and food and enrichment provision to the chimpanzees. Our aim was to determine whether the 50 chimpanzees’ behavior differed when public programs were offered at the sanctuary compared with “baseline” periods. It was found that during these programs chimpanzees spent more time in outdoor enclosures (GLMM: est. = 1.559, SE = 0.309, Z = 5.04, p < 0.001) and increased time feeding (GLMM: est. = 0.754, SE = 0.356, Z = 2.11, p = 0.034) and locomoting (GLMM: est. = 0.887, SE = 0.197, Z = 4.50, p < 0.001) compared with times when public programs were not ongoing. We rarely observed agonistic and abnormal behaviors, potential metrics of welfare, regardless of whether public programs were ongoing. Abnormal behaviors occurred too infrequently for statistical analysis. While the chimpanzees showed some differences in their behavioral repertoire during the public programs, such changes do not suggest that their welfare was compromised as a result of these activities. © 2020, © 2020 ISAZ.

ABSTRACT: Primates frequently form affiliative relationships that have important fitness consequences. Affiliative relationships between unrelated males and females are ubiquitous in humans but are not widely reported in humans' closest living relatives, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Instead, adult male chimpanzees are extremely aggressive to females, using the aggression to coerce females to mate with them. Adolescent male chimpanzees are physically and socially immature and unable to use aggression toward females in the same way as adult males. Instead, adolescent males might build affiliative relationships with females as an alternative tactic to increase their chances of mating and reproducing. To investigate this possibility, we recorded social interactions between 20 adolescent and 10 young adult males and 78 adult female chimpanzees over 2 years at Ngogo in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Analyses using grooming and proximity as assays revealed that adolescent and young adult males formed differentiated, affiliative relationships with females. These relationships were as strong as the bonds young males formed with maternal kin and unrelated males and increased in strength and number as males aged and started to dominate females. Male-female relationships extended outside the immediate context of mating. Although males affiliated slightly more often with females when they were cycling, they also did so when females were pregnant and nursing young infants. Males and females who formed bonds reassured each other, looked back and waited for each other while traveling, and groomed more equitably than other male-female pairs, even after the time they spent together in association and the female's reproductive state were taken into account. Despite the affiliative nature of these relationships, adolescent and young adult males selectively targeted their female partners for aggression. These findings provide new insights into the evolution of social bonds between human females and males, which can involve both affiliation and coercive violence. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Historical studies conducted in chimpanzees gave us the opportunity to investigate the basis for the different severities of liver damage and disease outcome associated with infection with wild-type hepatitis B virus (HBV) versus a pre-core HBV mutant, HBV/hepatitis D virus (HDV) coinfection, and HDV superinfection. Weekly samples from 9 chimpanzees were studied for immune responses by mea-suring plasma levels of 29 cytokines in parallel with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and viral kinetics. Comparison of classic acute hepatitis B (AHB) with severe or progressive AHB and HBV/HDV coinfection or superinfection identified distinct cytokine profiles. Classic AHB (mean ALT peak, 362 IU/liter) correlated with an early and significant induction of interferon alpha-2 (IFN-α2), IFN-γ, interleukin-12 p70 (IL-12 p70), and IL-17A. In contrast, these cytokines were virtually undetectable in severe AHB (mean ALT peak, 1,335 IU/liter), characterized by significant elevations of IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and MIP-1β. In progressive AHB (mean ALT peak, 166 IU/liter), there was a delayed and lower-magnitude induction of cytokines. The ALT peak was also delayed (mean, 23.5 weeks) compared to those of classic (13.5 weeks) and severe AHB (7.5 weeks). HBV/HDV coinfection correlated with significantly lower levels of IFN-α2, IFN-γ, and IL-17A, associated with the presence of multiple proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-15. Conversely, HDV superinfection induced the highest ALT peak (1,910 IU/liter) and was associated with a general suppression of cytokines. Our data demonstrate that the most severe liver damage, caused by an HBV precore mutant and HDV, correlated with restricted cytokine expression and lack of Th1 response, raising the question of whether these viruses are directly cytopathic. IMPORTANCE Studies performed in chimpanzees at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) demonstrated a significant difference in ALT levels during acute hepatitis of different viral etiologies, with a hierarchy in the extent of liver damage according to the infecting virus: the highest level was in HDV superinfection, followed by infection with a precore HBV mutant, HBV/HDV coinfection, and, lastly, wild-type HBV in-fection. Our study demonstrates that both the virus and host are important in disease pathogenesis and offers new insights into their roles. We found that distinct cytokine profiles were associated with disease severity and clinical outcome. In par-ticular, resolution of classic acute hepatitis B (AHB) correlated with a predominant Th1 response, whereas HBV/HDV coinfection showed a predominant proinflamma-tory response. Severe AHB and HDV superinfection showed a restricted cytokine pro-file and no evidence of Th1 response. The lack of cytokines associated with adaptive T-cell responses toward the precore HBV mutant and HDV superinfection argues in favor of a direct cytopathic effect of these viruses. © 2020, American Society for Microbiology.

ABSTRACT: Evolutionary developmental biology of our closest living relative, the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), is essential for understanding the origin of human traits. However, it is difficult to access developmental events in the chimpanzee in vivo because of technical and ethical restrictions. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer an alternative in vitro model system to investigate developmental events by overcoming the limitations of in vivo study. Here, we generated chimpanzee iPSCs from adult skin fibroblasts and reconstructed early neural development using in vitro differentiation culture conditions. Chimpanzee iPSCs were established using straightforward methods, namely, lipofection of plasmid vectors carrying human reprogramming factors, combined with maintenance in a comprehensive feeder-free culture. Ultimately, direct neurosphere formation culture induced rapid and efficient differentiation of neural stem cells from chimpanzee iPSCs. Time course analysis of neurosphere formation demonstrated ontogenetic changes in gene expression profiles and developmental potency along an early neural development path from epiblasts to radial glia. Our iPSC culture system is a potent tool for investigating the molecular and cellular foundation underlying chimpanzee early neural development and better understanding of human brain evolution. © 2020 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAd) vectors represent an attractive vaccine platform and are thus employed as vaccine candidates against several infectious diseases. Since inducing effective immunity depends on the interplay between innate and adaptive immunity, a deeper understanding of innate immune responses elicited by intramuscularly injected ChAd vectors in tissues can advance the platform’s development. Using different candidate vaccines based on the Group C ChAd type 155 (ChAd155) vector, we characterized early immune responses in injected muscles and draining lymph nodes (dLNs) from mice, and complemented these analyses by evaluating cytokine responses and gene expression patterns in peripheral blood from ChAd155-injected macaques. In mice, vector DNA levels gradually decreased post-immunization, but local transgene mRNA expression exhibited two transient peaks [at 6 h and Day (D)5], which were most obvious in dLNs. This dynamic pattern was mirrored by the innate responses in tissues, which developed as early as 1–3 h (cytokines/chemokines) or D1 (immune cells) post-vaccination. They were characterized by a CCL2- and CXCL9/10-dominated chemokine profile, peaking at 6 h (with CXCL10/CCL2 signals also detectable in serum) and D7, and clear immune-cell infiltration peaks at D1/D2 and D6/D7. Experiments with a green fluorescent protein-expressing ChAd155 vector revealed infiltrating hematopoietic cell subsets at the injection site. Cell infiltrates comprised mostly monocytes in muscles, and NK cells, T cells, dendritic cells, monocytes, and B cells in dLNs. Similar bimodal dynamics were observed in whole-blood gene signatures in macaques: most of the 17 enriched immune/innate signaling pathways were significantly upregulated at D1 and D7 and downregulated at D3, and clustering analysis revealed stronger similarities between D1 and D7 signatures versus the D3 signature. Serum cytokine responses (CXCL10, IL1Ra, and low-level IFN-α) in macaques were predominantly observed at D1. Altogether, the early immune responses exhibited bimodal kinetics with transient peaks at D1/D2 and D6/D7, mostly with an IFN-associated signature, and these features were remarkably consistent across most analyzed parameters in murine tissues and macaque blood. These compelling observations reveal a novel aspect of the dynamics of innate immunity induced by ChAd155-vectored vaccines, and contribute to ongoing research to better understand how adenovectors can promote vaccine-induced immunity. © Copyright © 2020 Collignon, Bol, Chalon, Surendran, Morel, van den Berg, Capone, Bechtold and Temmerman.

ABSTRACT: The gut microbiome can vary across differences in host lifestyle, geography, and host species. By comparing closely related host species across varying lifestyles and geography, we can evaluate the relative contributions of these factors in structuring the composition and functions of the microbiome. Here we show that the gut microbial taxa, microbial gene family composition, and resistomes of great apes and humans are more related by host lifestyle than geography. We show that captive chimpanzees and gorillas are enriched for microbial genera commonly found in non-Westernized humans. Captive ape microbiomes also had up to ~34-fold higher abundance and up to ~5-fold higher richness of all antibiotic resistance genes compared with wild apes. Through functional metagenomics, we identified a number of novel antibiotic resistance genes, including a gene conferring resistance to colistin, an antibiotic of last resort. Finally, by comparing our study cohorts to human and ape gut microbiomes from a diverse range of environments and lifestyles, we find that the influence of host lifestyle is robust to various geographic locations. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to International Society for Microbial Ecology.

ABSTRACT: Once considered a hallmark of human uniqueness, brain asymmetry has emerged as a feature shared with several other species, including chimpanzees, one of our closest living relatives. Most notable has been the discovery of asymmetries in homologues of cortical language areas in apes, particularly in the planum temporale (PT), considered a central node of the human language network. Several lines of evidence indicate a role for genetic mechanisms in the emergence of PT asymmetry; however, the genetic determinants of cerebral asymmetries have remained elusive. Studies in humans suggest that there is heritability of brain asymmetries of the PT, but this has not been explored to any extent in chimpanzees. Furthermore, the potential influence of non-genetic factors has raised questions about the reproducibility of earlier observations of PT asymmetry reported in chimpanzees. As such, the present study was aimed at examining both the heritability of phenotypic asymmetries in PT morphology, as well as their reproducibility. Using magnetic resonance imaging, we evaluated morphological asymmetries of PT surface area (mm 2) and mean depth (mm) in captive chimpanzees (n = 291) derived from two genetically isolated populations. Our results confirm that chimpanzees exhibit a significant population-level leftward asymmetry for PT surface area, as well as significant heritability in the surface area and mean depth of the PT. These results conclusively demonstrate the existence of a leftward bias in PT asymmetry in chimpanzees and suggest that genetic mechanisms play a key role in the emergence of anatomical asymmetry in this region.  © 2020 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Transmission to chimpanzees of a precore hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutant implicated in acute liver failure (ALF) in humans did not cause ALF nor the classic form of acute hepatitis B (AHB) seen upon infection with the wild-type HBV strain, but rather a severe AHB with distinct disease features. Here, we investigated the viral and host immunity factors responsible for the unusual severity of AHB associated with the precore HBV mutant in chimpanzees. Archived serial serum and liver specimens from two chimpanzees inoculated with a precore HBV mutant implicated in ALF and two chimpanzees inoculated with wild-type HBV were studied. We used phage-display library and next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies to characterize the liver antibody response. The results obtained in severe AHB were compared with those in classic AHB and HBV-associated ALF in humans. Severe AHB was characterized by: (i) the highest alanine aminotransferase (ALT) peaks ever seen in HBV transmission studies with a significantly shorter incubation period, compared to classic AHB; (ii) earlier HBsAg clearance and anti-HBs seroconversion with transient or undetectable hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg); (iii) limited inflammatory reaction relative to hepatocellular damage at the ALT peak with B-cell infiltration, albeit less extensive than in ALF; (iv) detection of intrahepatic germline antibodies against hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) by phage-display libraries in the earliest disease phase, as seen in ALF; (v) lack of intrahepatic IgM anti-HBcAg Fab, as seen in classic AHB, but at variance with ALF; and (vi) higher proportion of antibodies in germline configuration detected by NGS in the intrahepatic antibody repertoire compared to classic AHB, but lower than in ALF. This study identifies distinct outcome-specific features associated with severe AHB caused by a precore HBV mutant in chimpanzees, which bear closer resemblance to HBV ALF than to classic AHB. Our data suggest that precore HBV mutants carry an inherently higher pathogenicity that, in addition to specific host factors, may play a critical role in determining the severity of acute HBV disease. © 2020 Public Library of Science.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: In mammals, the excretion of cortisol can provide energy toward restoring homeostasis and is a major component of the stress response. However, chronically elevated cortisol levels also have suppressive effects on immune function. As mounting an immune response is energetically costly, sick individuals may conserve energy by exhibiting certain sickness behaviors, such as declining activity levels. Due to the complex interplay between immune function and sickness behaviors, endocrinological correlates have received growing attention in the medical community, but so far, this subject was investigated rarely. Furthermore, given the complexities of studying illnesses and immunity in natural settings, correlates of sickness behaviors have yet to be studied in non-human primates in the wild. Methods: We measured urinary cortisol levels using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry in a group of wild habituated chimpanzees in Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire, before, during, and after a respiratory disease outbreak (main causative pathogen: human respiratory syncytial virus A, with coinfections of Streptococcus pneumoniae). Changes in cortisol levels were then related to urinary neopterin levels, a biomarker of immune system activation. Results: Urinary cortisol levels were found to be more than 10-fold higher during the outbreak in comparison with levels before and after the outbreak period. Increasing cortisol levels were also associated with increasing neopterin levels. Interestingly, rather atypical patterns in a diurnal decline of cortisol levels were found during infection periods, such that levels remained raised throughout the day. Conclusion: In conclusion, cortisol increase was related to cellular immune response. Our results suggest that cortisol is a mediator of infectious disease pathogenicity through its impact on the immune system and that wild chimpanzees may be facing energetic stress when sick. By monitoring immune challenges in wild-living animals, our study demonstrates that immune defenses have costs and that these costs are context-specific. © Copyright © 2020 Behringer, Preis, Wu, Crockford, Leendertz, Wittig and Deschner.

ABSTRACT: Several theories have been generated to understand the socio-cognitive mechanisms underlying the unique cooperative abilities of humans. The 'interdependence hypothesis' posits first, that the cognitive dimension of human cooperation evolved in contexts when several individuals needed to act together to achieve a common goal, like when hunting large prey. Second, the more interdependent individuals are, the more likely they are to provide services to conspecifics in other contexts. Alternatively, the 'social tolerance hypothesis' proposes that higher social tolerance allows conspecifics to cooperate more efficiently and with a wider range of partners. We conducted the first field experimental evaluation of both hypotheses in our closest living relatives by contrasting chimpanzees to the less interdependent but more tolerant bonobos. We compared each species' performance during a cooperative task: informing conspecifics about a danger. We presented Gaboon viper models to 82 individuals from five wild communities. Chimpanzees arriving late at the snake were significantly more likely to have heard a call and less likely to startle, indicating that chimpanzees were better informed about the presence of the threat than bonobos. This stems from clear species differences in how individuals adjusted their calling decisions to the level of information already available. Chimpanzees were more likely to call and produced more alarm calls when they had not yet heard a call, whereas bonobos did so when they already heard a call. Our results confirm the link between interdependence and cooperation performance. These species differences were most likely driven by differences in motivation rather than in cognitive capacities because both species tended to consider audience knowledge in their decision to call. Our results inform theories on the evolution of human cooperation by linking inter-group competition pressure and in-group cooperative motivation and/or capability. © 2020 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Across vertebrates, species with intense male mating competition and high levels of sexual dimorphism in body size generally exhibit dimorphism in age-specific fertility. Compared with females, males show later ages at first reproduction and earlier reproductive senescence because they take longer to attain adult body size and musculature, and maintain peak condition for a limited time. This normally yields a shorter male duration of effective breeding, but this reduction might be attenuated in species that frequently use coalitionary aggression. Here, we present comparative genetic and demographic data on chimpanzees from three long-term study communities (Kanyawara: Kibale National Park, Uganda; Mitumba and Kasekela: Gombe National Park, Tanzania), comprising 581 male risk years and 112 infants, to characterize male age-specific fertility. For comparison, we update estimates from female chimpanzees in the same sites and append a sample of human foragers (the Tanzanian Hadza). Consistent with the idea that aggressive mating competition favors youth, chimpanzee males attained a higher maximum fertility than females, followed by a steeper decline with age. Males did not show a delay in reproduction compared with females, however, as adolescents in both sites successfully reproduced by targeting young, subfecund females, who were less attractive to adults. Gombe males showed earlier reproductive senescence and a shorter duration of effective breeding than Gombe females. By contrast, older males in Kanyawara generally continued to reproduce, apparently by forming coalitions with the alpha. Hadza foragers showed a distinct pattern of sexual dimorphism in age-specific fertility as, compared with women, men gained conceptions later but continued reproducing longer. In sum, both humans and chimpanzees showed sexual dimorphism in age-specific fertility that deviated from predictions drawn from primates with more extreme body size dimorphism, suggesting altered dynamics of male-male competition in the two lineages. In both species, coalitions appear important for extending male reproductive careers. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: In the absence of disease, ageing in the human brain is accompanied by mild cognitive dysfunction, gradual volumetric atrophy, a lack of significant cell loss, moderate neuroinflammation, and an increase in the amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau proteins. Conversely, pathologic age-related conditions, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD), result in extensive neocortical and hippocampal atrophy, neuron death, substantial Aβ plaque and tau-associated neurofibrillary tangle pathologies, glial activation and severe cognitive decline. Humans are considered uniquely susceptible to neurodegenerative disorders, although recent studies have revealed Aβ and tau pathology in non-human primate brains. Here, we investigate the effect of age and AD-like pathology on cell density in a large sample of postmortem chimpanzee brains (n = 28, ages 12-62 years). Using a stereologic, unbiased design, we quantified neuron density, glia density and glia:neuron ratio in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, middle temporal gyrus, and CA1 and CA3 hippocampal subfields. Ageing was associated with decreased CA1 and CA3 neuron densities, while AD pathologies were not correlated with changes in neuron or glia densities. Differing from cerebral ageing and AD in humans, these data indicate that chimpanzees exhibit regional neuron loss with ageing but appear protected from the severe cell death found in AD.

ABSTRACT: The development of the adrenal cortex varies considerably across primates, being most conspicuous in humans, where a functional zona reticularis–the site of dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEA/S) production–does not develop until middle childhood (5–8 years). Prior reports suggest that a human-like adrenarche, associated with a sharp prepubertal increase in DHEA/S, may only occur in the genus Pan. However, the timing and variability in adrenarche in chimpanzees remain poorly described, owing to the lack of longitudinal data, or data from wild populations. Here, we use urine samples from East African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) collected over 20 years at Kanyawara in Kibale National Park, Uganda, to trace the developmental trajectories of DHEAS (n = 1,385 samples, 53 individuals) and cortisol (n = 12,726 samples, 68 individuals). We used generalized additive models (GAM) to investigate the relationship between age, sex, and hormone levels. Adrenarche began earlier in chimpanzees (~2–3 years) compared with what has been reported in humans (6–8 years) and, unlike humans, male and female chimpanzees did not differ significantly in the timing of adrenarche nor in DHEAS concentrations overall. Similar to what has been reported in humans, cortisol production decreased through early life, reaching a nadir around puberty (8–11 years), and a sex difference emerged with males exhibiting higher urinary cortisol levels compared with females by early adulthood (15–16 years). Our study establishes that wild chimpanzees exhibit a human-like pattern of cortisol production during development and corroborates prior reports from captive chimpanzees of a human-like adrenarche, accompanied by significant developmental increases in DHEAS. While the role of these developmental hormone shifts are as yet unclear, they have been implicated in stages of rapid behavioral development once thought unique to humans, especially in regard to explaining the divergence of female and male social behavior before pubertal increases in gonadal hormones. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Speech is a human hallmark, but its evolutionary origins continue to defy scientific explanation. Recently, the open–close mouth rhythm of 2–7 Hz (cycles/second) characteristic of all spoken languages has been identified in the orofacial signals of several nonhuman primate genera, including orangutans, but evidence from any of the African apes remained missing. Evolutionary continuity for the emergence of speech is, thus, still inconclusive. To address this empirical gap, we investigated the rhythm of chimpanzee lip-smacks across four populations (two captive and two wild). We found that lip-smacks exhibit a speech-like rhythm at approximately 4 Hz, closing a gap in the evidence for the evolution of speech-rhythm within the primate order. We observed sizeable rhythmic variation within and between chimpanzee populations, with differences of over 2 Hz at each level. This variation did not result, however, in systematic group differences within our sample. To further explore the phylogenetic and evolutionary perspective on this variability, inter-individual and inter-population analyses will be necessary across primate species producing mouth signals at speech-like rhythm. Our findings support the hypothesis that speech recruited ancient primate rhythmic signals and suggest that multi-site studies may still reveal new windows of understanding about these signals’ use and production along the evolutionary timeline of speech. © 2020 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: After diverging, each chimpanzee subspecies has been the target of unique selective pressures. Here, we employ a machine learning approach to classify regions as under positive selection or neutrality genome-wide. The regions determined to be under selection reflect the unique demographic and adaptive history of each subspecies. The results indicate that effective population size is important for determining the proportion of the genome under positive selection. The chimpanzee subspecies share signals of selection in genes associated with immunity and gene regulation. With these results, we have created a selection map for each population that can be displayed in a genome browser (www.hsb.upf.edu/chimp browser). This study is the first to use a detailed demographic history and machine learning to map selection genome-wide in chimpanzee. The chimpanzee selection map will improve our understanding of the impact of selection on closely related subspecies and will empower future studies of chimpanzee. © The Author(s) 2020.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: To identify anatomical differences in the deltoid tuberosity of Homo sapiens and Pan troglodytes, potentially relating to the different uses of the forelimb in these two phylogenetically related species. Basic procedures: We have used three-dimensional geometric morphometrics (3D GM) to analyze the deltoid tuberosity of scanned humeri from 30 H. sapiens and 27 P. troglodytes. We also used the 3D scans of the humeri to calculate the surface area of the deltoid tuberosity. Finally, we dissected the deltoid muscles of three H. sapiens and three P. troglodytes to determine the relative mass and the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) of each part of the muscle. Main findings: The 3D GM analysis of the deltoid tuberosity identified an anteroposterior enlargement of the P. troglodytes tuberosity, with a lateral displacement of the middle segment, whereas in H. sapiens, there was a distal displacement of the middle segment. Muscle architecture analysis indicated higher normalized values ​​of the PCSA of the clavicular and acromial deltoid in P. troglodytes. Principal conclusions: The anatomical features observed in our P. troglodytes specimens serve to strengthen the three parts of the deltoid muscle. This fact can be related to the use of the forelimb in locomotion, both arboreal and knuckle-walking, in this species. Humans use the forelimb mainly in manipulative tasks, so they do not develop – as do chimpanzees – the anatomical features that increase the deltoid force. Our findings have shown that the different uses of the forelimb in modern humans and common chimpanzees can affect both muscle architecture and bone morphology, either jointly or separately. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH

ABSTRACT: Modern human shoulder function is affected by the evolutionary adaptations that have occurred to ensure survival and prosperity of the species. Robust examination of behavioral shoulder performance and injury risk can be holistically improved through an interdisciplinary approach that integrates anthropology and biomechanics. Coordination of these fields can allow different perspectives to contribute to a more complete interpretation of biomechanics of the modern human shoulder. The purpose of this study was to develop a novel biomechanical and comparative chimpanzee glenohumeral model, designed to parallel an existing human glenohumeral model, and compare predicted musculoskeletal outputs between the two models. The chimpanzee glenohumeral model consists of three modules - an external torque module, a musculoskeletal geometric module and an internal muscle force prediction module. Together, these modules use postural kinematics, subject-specific anthropometrics, a novel shoulder rhythm, glenohumeral stability ratios, hand forces, musculoskeletal geometry and an optimization routine to estimate joint reaction forces and moments, subacromial space dimensions, and muscle and tissue forces. Using static postural data of a horizontal bimanual suspension task, predicted muscle forces and subacromial space were compared between chimpanzees and humans. Compared with chimpanzees, the human model predicted a 2 mm narrower subacromial space, deltoid muscle forces that were often double those of chimpanzees and a strong reliance on infraspinatus and teres minor (60-100% maximal force) over other rotator cuff muscles. These results agree with previous work on inter-species differences that inform basic human rotator cuff function and pathology. © 2020. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd

ABSTRACT: The study of innovation in non-human animals (henceforth: animals) has recently gained momentum across fields including primatology, animal behaviour and cultural evolution. Examining the rate of innovations, and the cognitive mechanisms driving these innovations across species, can provide insights into the evolution of human culture. Especially relevant to the study of human culture is one of our closest living relatives, the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes). Both wild and captive chimpanzees demonstrate an impressive ability to innovate solutions to novel problems, but also a striking level of conservatism in some contexts, creating a unique and at times puzzling, picture of animal innovation. Whilst the animal innovation field is rife with potential for expanding our knowledge of human and non-human cognition and problem-solving, it is undermined by a lack of consistency across studies. The field is yet to settle on a definition of the term ‘innovation’, leading to studies being incomparable across and even within the same species. Here, we fill two gaps in the literature. First, we discuss some of the most prevalent definitions of ‘innovation’ from different fields, highlighting similarities and differences between them. Secondly, we provide an up-to-date review of accounts of innovations in both wild and captive chimpanzees. We hope this review will provide a resource for researchers interested in the study of innovation in chimpanzees and other animals, as well as emphasising the need for consistency in the way in which innovations are reported. © 2020 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Across the animal kingdom, males tend to exhibit more behavioural and morphological variability than females, consistent with the ‘greater male variability hypothesis’. This may reflect multiple mechanisms operating at different levels, including selective mechanisms that produce and maintain variation, extended male development, and X chromosome effects. Interestingly, human neuroanatomy shows greater male variability, but this pattern has not been demonstrated in any other species. To address this issue, we investigated sex-specific neuroanatomical variability in chimpanzees by examining relative and absolute surface areas of 23 cortical sulci across 226 individuals (135F/91M), using permutation tests of the male-to-female variance ratio of residuals from MCMC generalized linear mixed models controlling for relatedness. We used these models to estimate sulcal size heritability, simulations to assess the significance of heritability, and Pearson correlations to examine inter-sulcal correlations. Our results show that: (i) male brain structure is relatively more variable; (ii) sulcal surface areas are heritable and therefore potentially subject to selection; (iii) males exhibit lower heritability values, possibly reflecting longer development; and (iv) males exhibit stronger inter-sulcal correlations, providing indirect support for sex chromosome effects. These results provide evidence that greater male neuroanatomical variability extends beyond humans, and suggest both evolutionary and developmental explanations for this phenomenon. © 2020 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Following the tradition of comparing humans with chimpanzees placed under unfavorable conditions, the authors suggest many uniquely human technological abilities. However, chimpanzees use spontaneously tools in nature to achieve many different goals demonstrating technological skills and reasoning contradicting the authors contrast. Chimpanzees and humans develop skills through the experiences faced during their upbringing and neglecting this leads to fake conclusions.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Social mammals often live in groups in which a dominance hierarchy is an important determinant of access to mates. In addition to competing individually, males may form coalitions of two or more to attack or intimidate rivals. Coalition formation could be particularly advantageous for adolescent males by helping them compensate for their physical and social immaturity. However, adolescents may struggle to attract effective coalition partners because of these inadequacies. Here, we examine the behavior of maturing male chimpanzees to test whether coalitions are more frequent among more or less powerful individuals. Our longitudinal study followed 18 males (ages 5 through 25 years) and utilized 1517 coalitions across 12 years of observation of the Kanyawara chimpanzee community in Kibale National Park, Uganda. We found that rates of coalition formation increased across maturation and that this increase was independent of a rise in the overall use of aggression. Juveniles formed coalitions almost exclusively with their mothers, while adolescents partnered primarily with peers and adult males. When adolescents and adult males formed coalitions with each other, the adolescents were more likely to join the adults than vice versa. Finally, adolescents engaged in joint behavior with adult males more often in non-aggressive vocal displays than in aggressive coalitions. Taken together, our results suggest that adolescent males are largely unable to attract the most powerful coalition partners and that they “make the best of a bad job” by joining adult males in less competitive situations, when the risk of receiving aggression from opponents is lower. Significance statement: Adolescent males are at a disadvantage in competing for powerful allies, because they have less strength to contribute to a cooperative dyad. Even when a variety of possible coalition partners are present, the partner choices of higher-ranking males likely limit the number of remaining individuals that are available and willing to form coalitions with adolescents. Accordingly, we found that males sorted with closely ranked coalition partners down the hierarchy, leaving adolescents to form coalitions with partners of similar rank to themselves rather than high-ranking adult males. There was no evidence for rank sorting in joint vocal displays, however. Additionally, adolescents participated in more than twice as many joint vocal displays as coalitions. These data suggest that joint vocal displays represent a viable alternative to coalitions for adolescents attempting to integrate themselves into the adult male social world. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Inter-individual variation in gene expression has been shown to be heritable and is often associated with differences in disease susceptibility between individuals. Many studies focused on mapping associations between genetic and gene regulatory variation, yet much less attention has been paid to the evolutionary processes that shape the observed differences in gene regulation between individuals in humans or any other primate. To begin addressing this gap, we performed a comparative analysis of gene expression variability and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in humans and chimpanzees, using gene expression data from primary heart samples. We found that expression variability in both species is often determined by non-genetic sources, such as cell-type heterogeneity. However, we also provide evidence that inter-individual variation in gene regulation can be genetically controlled, and that the degree of such variability is generally conserved in humans and chimpanzees. In particular, we found a significant overlap of orthologous genes associated with eQTLs in both species. We conclude that gene expression variability in humans and chimpanzees often evolves under similar evolutionary pressures. © Fair et al.

ABSTRACT: This paper considers the question of whether chimpanzees possess at least a primitive sense of normativity: i.e., some ability to internalize and enforce social norms—rules governing appropriate and inappropriate behaviour—within their social groups, and to make evaluations of others’ behaviour in light of such norms. A number of scientists and philosophers have argued that such a sense of normativity does exist in chimpanzees and in several other non-human primate and mammalian species. However, the dominant view in the scientific and philosophical literature is that psychological capacities for social norms evolved uniquely in the human lineage, after our last common ancestor with chimpanzees and bonobos. After reviewing some of the existing evidence for normative capacity in chimpanzees, I defend the thesis of chimpanzee normativity against three key theoretical objections that have been presented in the literature, each of which have played a part in motivating the dominant sceptical position. I argue that, while we still have much to learn about the nature and extent of the normative capacities of other animals, there is strong prima facie evidence for social norms and normative evaluation in chimpanzees and the main theoretical objections to chimpanzee normativity are not at all compelling. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

ABSTRACT: The most frequent chromosomal aneuploidy in humans, trisomy 21 (T21), has only been reported twice in the common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes). In both cases, phenotypical traits were comparable to human T21 traits and were formally diagnosed through conventional techniques like chromosomal staining. Here, we present the first application of sequencing data as a diagnostic tool to compare chromosomal dosage imbalances in chimpanzees. By calculating the ratio of mapped reads on each chromosome between a case and a control, we observe a trisomic dosage imbalance on chromosome 21 in the case individual. While case numbers remain too low to be conclusive, evidence suggests that prevalence of T21 in chimpanzees could be lower than in humans. In future genetic testing of captive ape populations, the genetic diagnostic methods presented here will allow for a reliable and time-efficient assessment of the global prevalence of chromosomal dose imbalances in chimpanzees and other great apes. © 2020, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Primates often consume either bark or cambium (inner bark) as a fallback food to complete their diet during periods of food scarcity. Wild chimpanzees exhibit great behavioral diversity across Africa, as studies of new populations frequently reveal. Since 2014, we have been using a combination of camera traps and indirect signs to study the ecology and behavior of wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) in Comoé National Park, Ivory Coast, to document and understand the behavioral adaptations that help them to survive in a savanna–forest mosaic landscape. We found that Comoé chimpanzees peel the bark of the buttresses of kapok tree (Ceiba pentandra) trees to eat the cambium underneath. Individuals of all sex/age classes across at least six neighboring communities peeled the bark, but only during the late rainy season and beginning of the dry season, when cambium may represent an important fallback food. Baboons (Papio anubis) also target the same trees but mainly eat the bark itself. Most of the bark-peeling wounds on Ceiba trees healed completely within 2 years, seemingly without any permanent damage. We recorded chimpanzees visiting trees in early stages of wound recovery but leaving them unpeeled. Only 6% of peeled trees (N = 53) were reexploited after a year, suggesting that chimpanzees waited for the rest of the trees to regrow the bark fully before peeling them again, thus using them sustainably. Many human groups of hunter-gatherers and herders exploited cambium sustainably in the past. The observation that similar sustainable bark-peeling behavior evolved in both chimpanzees and humans suggests that it has an important adaptive value in harsh environments when other food sources become seasonally scarce, by avoiding the depletion of the resource and keeping it available for periods of scarcity. © 2020, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: Postpartum developmental delay has been proposed as an important phenotype of human evolution which contributes to many human-specific features including the increase in brain size and the advanced human-specific cognitive traits. However, the biological processes and molecular functions underlying early brain development still remain poorly understood, especially in human and primates. Results: In this paper, we comparatively and extensively studied dorsolarteral prefrontal cortex expression data in human and chimpanzee to investigate the critical processes or biological events during early brain development at a molecular level. By using the dynamic network biomarker (DNB) model, we found that there are tipping points around 3 months and 1 month, which are crucial periods in infant human and chimpanzee brain development, respectively. In particular, we shown that the human postnatal development and the corresponding expression changes are delayed 3 times relative to chimpanzee, and we also revealed that many common biological processes are highly involved in those critical periods for both human and chimpanzee, e.g., physiological system development functions, nervous system development, organismal development and tissue morphology. These findings support that the maximal rates of brain growth will be in those two critical periods for respective human and primates. In addition, different from chimpanzee, our analytic results also showed that human can further develop a number of advanced behavior functions around this tipping point (around 3 months), such as the ability of learning and memory. Conclusion: This work not only provides biological insights into primate brain development at a molecular level but also opens a new way to study the criticality of nonlinear biological processes based on the observed omics data. © 2020 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Errors of source monitoring are widespread human memory challenges, and our memories are subject to distortion upon the presentation of subsequent misinformation. Less is known about if and when misinformation effects occur in nonhuman species’ memory. Here we tested a symbol-trained chimpanzee’s recall memory of a hidden food item’s identity after a 10-min delay. During this delay, the subject was sometimes (depending on the condition) shown consistent or inconsistent video information about the identity of the food, before being asked to name the item to a second experimenter blind to the reward and condition. Across all conditions, our subject, Sherman, correctly named the food item at above chance levels. In the Inconsistent condition, in which Sherman was shown a video with misleading information, his performance was the worst of all conditions (although accuracy was still high). Interestingly, however, during three of the four trials in this condition in which Sherman made a mistake, he incorrectly named the food item shown during the misleading video information. These results provide evidence that chimpanzees, like humans, may be vulnerable to misinformation effects, even when that misleading information is presented in a different modality (video) than the original live event memory, demonstrating further commonality between human and ape memory systems. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Identification of gene expression traits unique to the human brain sheds light on the molecular mechanisms underlying human evolution. Here, we searched for uniquely human gene expression traits by analyzing 422 brain samples from humans, chimpanzees, bonobos, and macaques representing 33 anatomical regions, as well as 88,047 cell nuclei composing three of these regions. Among 33 regions, cerebral cortex areas, hypothalamus, and cerebellar gray and white matter evolved rapidly in humans. At the cellular level, astrocytes and oligodendrocyte progenitors displayed more differences in the human evolutionary lineage than the neurons.

ABSTRACT: Caves play an important ecological role for nonhuman primates in Africa and Asia. Savanna chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) living in the Mandingue plateau of Senegal and Mali use caves for thermoregulation, where these refugia provide a cool microclimate during the hot, dry season. In this study, we examined cave use frequency for a chimpanzee community in southeastern Senegal. We used images from a camera trap placed at the mouth of a large laterite cave to investigate the hypotheses that sex, reproductive state, and seasonality influence the frequency of cave use. The camera collected 14,053 still images of chimpanzees between 2011 and 2013 over 325 camera trap days. Our results indicate no difference in cave use frequency between males and females overall. However, female reproductive state did significantly influence cave use, with lactating mothers using the cave more frequently than both males and nonlactating females. Chimpanzees used the cave during the hottest times of the day and were more likely to visit the cave during periods of low water availability and high maximum temperatures associated with the dry season. These results suggest the importance of thermoregulation in extreme heat for all individuals, and specifically for lactating females with nursing infants that likely experience higher metabolic and hydration stress. This study provides insight into the dynamics of primate cave use by contributing evidence that chimpanzee cave use may be influenced by reproductive states in addition to thermoregulatory needs. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Links between the human facial width-to-height ratio (fWHR) and aggressive behaviours have been debated in recent years. The question of whether fWHR is a cue to dominance could benefit from the study of primate species that are closely related to humans. We therefore built on the broad literature in humans, and recent research in capuchins, macaques and bonobos, and examined associations between fWHR in 131 captive chimpanzees from the United States, United Kingdom and Japan, and measures of age, sex, subspecies (Pan troglodytes verus, P. t. schweinfurthii, P. t. troglodytes), and six personality components (Dominance, Extraversion, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, Neuroticism, and Openness). We found no evidence for sexual dimorphism in fWHR, as has been found in humans. We did find a positive relationship between fWHR and Dominance in P. t. verus, but only in adult females. This finding contrasts with that in humans, where dominant males have wider faces. We discuss these results in light of male-female differences in temporal rank stability, and in contrast to findings for bonobos, providing a useful perspective for fWHR research in humans. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Measurements of intraocular pressure (IOP) and tear production are key components of ophthalmic examination. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) were anesthetized using either tiletamine-zolazepam (TZ; 2 mg/kg) combined with medetomidine (TZM; 0.02 mg/kg), or, TZ alone (6mg/kg). Tear production was lower (P = 0.03) with TZM (5.63 ± 6.22 mm/min; n = 16) than with TZ (11.13 ± 4.63 mm/min; n = 8). Mean IOP, measured using rebound tonometry in an upright body position (n = 8) was 18.74 ± 3.01 mm Hg, with no differences between right and left eyes. However, positioning chimpanzees in left lateral recumbency (n = 27) resulted in higher IOP in the dependent (left) eye (24.77 ± 4.49 mm Hg) compared to the nondependent (right) eye (22.27 ± 4.65 mm Hg) of the same animal (P < 0.0001). These data indicate medetomidine anesthesia markedly lowers tear production in chimpanzees, and that body position should be taken into consideration when performing rebound tonometry. © Copyright 2020 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: While the ability of naturally ranging animals to recall the location of food resources and use straight-line routes between them has been demonstrated in several studies [1, 2], it is not known whether animals can use knowledge of their landscape to walk least-cost routes [3]. This ability is likely to be particularly important for animals living in highly variable energy landscapes, where movement costs are exacerbated [4, 5]. Here, we used least-cost modeling, which determines the most efficient route assuming full knowledge of the environment, to investigate whether chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) living in a rugged, montane environment walk least-cost routes to out-of-sight goals. We compared the “costs” and geometry of observed movements with predicted least-cost routes and local knowledge (agent-based) and straight-line null models. The least-cost model performed better than the local knowledge and straight-line models across all parameters, and linear mixed modeling showed a strong relationship between the cost of observed chimpanzee travel and least-cost routes. Our study provides the first example of the ability to take least-cost routes to out-of-sight goals by chimpanzees and suggests they have spatial memory of their home range landscape. This ability may be a key trait that has enabled chimpanzees to maintain their energy balance in a low-resource environment. Our findings provide a further example of how the advanced cognitive complexity of hominins may have facilitated their adaptation to a variety of environmental conditions and lead us to hypothesize that landscape complexity may play a role in shaping cognition. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.
Green et al. provide the first evidence that chimpanzees are able to walk least-cost routes in a variable energy landscape. Least-cost modeling predicted the costs and sinuosity of chimpanzee paths better than local knowledge and straight-line null models.

ABSTRACT: In-group cohesion is an essential component of successful intergroup competition in both human and nonhuman animals, likely facilitating group members access to potential benefits. However, when benefits are equally shared among group members, group defense becomes a collective action problem, which might subvert cohesive participation during intergroup competition. There is a lack of consensus across studies and species with regard to the link between in-group cohesion and intergroup competition, likely as a result of species differences in managing the collective action problem. Here, we examine this link in a species with a striking example of collective action during intergroup competition, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus). Using two years of focal-follow data on males and females in two groups at the Taï Forest, Côte d’Ivoire, we investigated the immediate and long-term effects of intergroup competition (border patrols and intergroup encounters) on measures of in-group cohesion, namely modularity, party size, and intergroup aggression. We found that groups’ association patterns were less modular (more cohesive) in months in which they engaged in more border patrols and intergroup encounters. We found that current and greater prior engagement in intergroup competition predicted larger party sizes. Furthermore, current, but not prior engagement in intergroup competition, predicted reduced intragroup aggression by males but not by females. Increased in-group cohesion in chimpanzees likely reduces potential costs of intergroup competition engagement, by facilitating joint participation in current and future intergroup conflicts, overcoming the collective action problem. © 2019, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Most primates experience seasonal fluctuations in the availability of food resources and face the challenge of balancing energy expenditure with energy gain during periods of resource scarcity. This is likely to be particularly challenging in rugged, montane environments, where available energy is relatively low and travel costs are high. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) show extensive behavioral diversity across study sites. Yet, as most research has focused on low- and mid-elevation sites, little is known on how chimpanzees respond to periods of low fruit availability in harsh montane environments. We use focal follow and phenology data to investigate how fruit availability influences daily path length and monthly home range in chimpanzees living in Nyungwe National Park, a montane forest in Rwanda. Nyungwe chimpanzees decreased their daily travel distances during periods of fruit scarcity. However, this decrease in travel effort did not correspond with a decrease in foraging area. Instead, monthly homes ranges shifted location across the study period. Nyungwe chimpanzees occupy a relatively wide altitudinal range and the shifts in monthly home range location may reflect differences in the altitudinal distribution of food resources. Chimpanzee monthly diet was often dominated by one or two species and each of these species were confined to different elevation zones. One important species, Podocarpus latifolius, grew only at high elevations (2,600–2,950 m) and chimpanzees ranged at the altitudinal peak of their range for 2 consecutive months while feeding on this species. Thus, while high elevations are often thought to be harsh environments for primates, they can be an important part of a species’ home range when they provide a refugium for densely distributed, important food species. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Monkeypox is a viral zoonotic disease on the rise across endemic habitats. Despite the growing importance of monkeypox virus, our knowledge on its host spectrum and sylvatic maintenance is limited. Here, we describe the recent repeated emergence of monkeypox virus in a wild, human-habituated western chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus, hereafter chimpanzee) population from Taï National Park, Ivory Coast. Through daily monitoring, we show that further to causing its typical exanthematous syndrome, monkeypox can present itself as a severe respiratory disease without a diffuse rash. By analysing 949 non-invasively collected samples, we identify the circulation of at least two distinct monkeypox virus lineages and document the shedding of infectious particles in faeces and flies, suggesting that they could mediate indirect transmission. We also show that the carnivorous component of the Taï chimpanzees’ diet, mainly consisting of the sympatric monkeys they regularly hunt, did not change nor shift towards rodent consumption (the presumed reservoir) before the outbreaks, suggesting that the sudden emergence of monkeypox virus in this population is probably due to changes in the ecology of the virus itself. Using long-term mortality surveillance data from Taï National Park, we provide evidence of little to no prior viral activity over at least two decades. We conclude that great ape sentinel systems devoted to the longitudinal collection of behavioural and health data can help clarify the epidemiology and clinical presentation of zoonotic pathogens. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

ABSTRACT: Methylation levels have been shown to change with age at sites across the human genome. Change at some of these sites is so consistent across individuals that it can be used as an 'epigenetic clock' to predict an individual's chronological age to within a few years. Here, we examined how the pattern of epigenetic ageing in chimpanzees compares with humans. We profiled genome-wide blood methylation levels by microarray for 113 samples from 83 chimpanzees aged 1-58 years (26 chimpanzees were sampled at multiple ages during their lifespan). Many sites (greater than 65 000) showed significant change in methylation with age and around one-third (32%) of these overlap with sites showing significant age-related change in humans. At over 80% of sites showing age-related change in both species, chimpanzees displayed a significantly faster rate of age-related change in methylation than humans. We also built a chimpanzee-specific epigenetic clock that predicted age in our test dataset with a median absolute deviation from known age of only 2.4 years. However, our chimpanzee clock showed little overlap with previously constructed human clocks. Methylation at CpGs comprising our chimpanzee clock showed moderate heritability. Although the use of a human microarray for profiling chimpanzees biases our results towards regions with shared genomic sequence between the species, nevertheless, our results indicate that there is considerable conservation in epigenetic ageing between chimpanzees and humans, but also substantial divergence in both rate and genomic distribution of ageing-associated sites.

ABSTRACT: Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection affects 257 million people globally. Current therapies suppress HBV but viral rebound occurs on cessation of therapy; novel therapeutic strategies are urgently required. To develop a therapeutic HBV vaccine that can induce high magnitude T cells to all major HBV antigens, we have developed a novel HBV vaccine using chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAd) and modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) viral vectors encoding multiple HBV antigens. ChAd vaccine alone generated very high magnitude HBV specific T cell responses to all HBV major antigens. The inclusion of a shark Invariant (SIi) chain genetic adjuvant significantly enhanced the magnitude of T-cells against HBV antigens. Compared to ChAd alone vaccination, ChAd-prime followed by MVA-boost vaccination further enhanced the magnitude and breadth of the vaccine induced T cell response. Intra-cellular cytokine staining study showed that HBV specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were polyfunctional, producing combinations of IFNγ, TNF-α, and IL-2. In summary, we have generated genetically adjuvanted ChAd and MVA vectored HBV vaccines with the potential to induce high-magnitude T cell responses through a prime-boost therapeutic vaccination approach. These pre-clinical studies pave the way for new studies of HBV therapeutic vaccination in humans with chronic hepatitis B infection. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: Social rank is positively correlated with reproductive success in numerous species, albeit demographic factors often influence those patterns. In multimale primate species, reproductive skew tends to decrease with increasing numbers of males and sexually receptive females. Alpha male chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) often sire a disproportionate, though somewhat variable, percentage of offspring compared to other males. In a small community of eastern chimpanzees inhabiting a human-dominated landscape in Bulindi, Uganda, we found extraordinarily high levels of alpha male reproductive success over a 5-year period (7/8 offspring = 88%), despite the presence of multiple subordinate males. The skew exceeds that reported in other studies of chimpanzees as well as closely related bonobos (Pan paniscus). Our findings underscore the role of demographic and social factors in male reproductive success and also suggest that conclusions about species differences may be premature. The interaction of small community size, dispersal limitations, and male reproductive strategies like those found here may decrease genetic diversity and increase the risk of concomitant inbreeding in chimpanzee communities under strong anthropogenic pressure. © 2020 S.

ABSTRACT: Although a large body of primate cognition research is done in captive institutions, little is known about how much individuals from different facilities vary in their experiences and cognitive skills. Here we present the results of an experimental study investigating how physical cognitive skills vary between chimpanzees in relation to captive settings and their time in captivity. We tested 59 chimpanzees housed at two different captive facilities (a rehabilitation center (sanctuary) and a zoo) in three problem-solving tasks. Our results showed that chimpanzees at the two housing facilities significantly differed in overall task performance. On average, the sanctuary chimpanzees outperformed the chimpanzees housed at the zoo in the detour reaching task and the honey trap task. However, the zoo chimpanzees performed slightly better on average in the learning task. We propose that, for this particular sample, the documented differences result from a combination of factors, such as prior experience with cognitive testing, motivation levels and varying degrees of human exposure. Within the sanctuary sample, we found that chimpanzees who arrived at an earlier age at the sanctuary and had therefore spent a larger percentage of their lives in a captive environment, were better problem-solvers than those that arrived at a later age to the sanctuary. Thus, rehabilitation and time in captivity contributed to improved physical cognitive skills in sanctuary chimpanzees. Our results highlight the importance of studying intraspecific variation and the effect that previous experience and living conditions might have on physical cognitive skills in non-human apes. Accordingly, we should be cautious when extrapolating findings of cognitive studies from one population to the species as a whole. Copyright 2020 Forss et al.

ABSTRACT: Obesity is a problem in captive chimpanzee colonies that can lead to increased risk for disease; therefore, implementation of effective weight management strategies is imperative. To properly implement a weight management program, captive managers should be able to noninvasively identify and assess overweight or obese individuals. Traditional means of categorizing obese individuals involve sedating the animals to obtain body weights or skin fold measurements. The current study aimed to validate a noninvasive, subjective body condition score (BCS) system for captive chimpanzees. The system utilizes a 10-point scale, with one rated as “emaciated,” five as “normal,” and 10 as “extremely obese.” Between 2013 and 2014, 158 chimpanzees were weighed and scored using this system (a) while sedated and (b) while awake in their social group within 1–3 days of sedation (“In-group” ratings). We found high inter-rater reliability between In-group raters, as well as between sedated and In-group scores. BCSs, which require observation only, were significantly positively correlated with weight (an objective measure of obesity often requiring anesthetization), supporting the scale's validity. The BCS system identified 36 individuals as “overweight,” while the use of weights alone identified only 26 individuals as “overweight.” Furthermore, the BCS system was able to classify individuals of the same sex and weight as having different BCSs, ranging from normal to overweight. Lastly, using focal animal behavioral observations from 2016 to 2018 (N = 120), we found that In-group BCS predicted individual levels of inactive behavior more than 2 years later, demonstrating the predictive validity of the scale. These results illustrate the utility of the BCS system as a noninvasive, reliable, and valid technique that may be more sensitive than traditional methods in identifying and quantifying obesity in chimpanzees. This system can be a useful tool for captive managers to monitor and manage the weight of chimpanzees and other nonhuman primates. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC

ABSTRACT: Humans are constantly acquiring new information and skills. However, forgetting is also a common phenomenon in our lives. Understanding the lability of memories is critical to appreciate how they are formed as well as forgotten. Here we investigate the lability of chimpanzees' short-term memories and assess what factors cause forgetting in our closest relatives. In two experiments, chimpanzees were presented with a target task, which involved remembering a reward location, followed by the presentation of an interference task-requiring the recollection of a different reward location. The interference task could take place soon after the presentation of the target task or soon before the retrieval of the food locations. The results show that chimpanzees' memories for the location of a reward in a target task were compromised by the presentation of a different food location in an interference task. Critically, the temporal location of the interference task did not significantly affect chimpanzees' performance. These pattern of results were found for both Experiment 1-when the retention interval between the encoding and retrieval of the target task was 60 seconds-and Experiment 2-when the retention interval between the encoding and retrieval of the target task was 30 seconds. We argue that the temporal proximity of the to-be-remembered information and the interference item during encoding is the factor driving chimpanzees' performance in the present studies. © 2020 Martin-Ordas et al.

ABSTRACT: We investigated intestinal trichomonads in western lowland gorillas, central chimpanzees and humans cohabiting the forest ecosystem of Dzanga-Sangha Protected Area in Central African Republic, using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and SSU rRNA gene sequences. Trichomonads belonging to the genus Tetratrichomonas were detected in 23% of the faecal samples and in all host species. Different hosts were infected with different genotypes of Tetratrichomonas. In chimpanzees, we detected tetratrichomonads from 'novel lineage 2', which was previously reported mostly in captive and wild chimpanzees. In gorillas, we found two different genotypes of Tetratrichomonas. The ITS region sequences of the more frequent genotype were identical to the sequence found in a faecal sample of a wild western lowland gorilla from Cameroon. Sequences of the second genotype from gorillas were almost identical to sequences previously obtained from an anorexic French woman. We provide the first report of the presence of intestinal tetratrichomonads in asymptomatic, apparently healthy humans. Human tetratrichomonads belonged to the lineage 7, which was previously reported in domestic and wild pigs and a domestic horse. Our findings suggest that the ecology and spatial overlap among hominids in the tropical forest ecosystem has not resulted in exchange of intestinal trichomonads among these hosts.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To comprehensively characterize cardiac structure and function, from infancy to adulthood, in male and female wild-born captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) living in sanctuaries. ANIMALS 290 wild-born captive chimpanzees. PROCEDURES Physical and echocardiographic examinations were performed on anesthetized chimpanzees in 3 sanctuaries in Africa between October 2013 and May 2017. Results were evaluated across age groups and between sexes, and potential differences were assessed with multiple 1-way independent Kruskal-Wallis tests. RESULTS Results indicated that left ventricular diastolic and systolic function declined at a younger age in males than in females. Although differences in right ventricular diastolic function were not identified among age groups, right ventricular systolic function was lower in adult chimpanzees (> 12 years old), compared with subadult (8 to 12 years old) and juvenile (5 to 7 years old) chimpanzees. In addition, male subadult and adult chimpanzees had larger cardiac wall dimensions and chamber volumes than did their female counterparts. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results of the present study provided useful reference intervals for cardiac structure and function in captive chimpanzees categorized on the basis of age and sex; however, further research is warranted to examine isolated and combined impacts of blood pressure, age, body weight, and anesthetic agents on cardiac structure and function in chimpanzees. © 2019, American Veterinary Medical Association.

ABSTRACT: Within human problem-solving, the propensity to use a familiar approach, rather than switch to a more efficient alternative is pervasive. This susceptibility to "cognitive set" prevents optimization by biasing response patterns toward known solutions. In a recent study, which used a nonverbal touch screen task, baboons exhibited a striking ability to deviate from their learned strategy to use a more efficient shortcut. Humans, on the other hand, displayed the opposite response pattern and almost exclusively used a less efficient, but familiar, response. In the current study, we sought to further explore variation in susceptibility to cognitive set within the primate lineage by conducting the Learned Strategy-Direct Strategy task with 10 chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Using multilevel multinomial modeling, we found that chimpanzees' shortcut use was intermediate to baboons' and humans'. However, unlike either baboons or humans, there was pronounced inter- and intraindividual variability in chimpanzees' shortcut use. Additionally, a subset of chimpanzees employed a unique solution, wherein they switched strategies midtrial. Further, we found that chimpanzees did not exhibit switch costs when switching between the learned strategy and the shortcut, but humans did. We propose that differences in abstract rule encoding may underlie differences in susceptibility to cognitive set on the Learned Strategy-Direct Strategy task within the primate lineage. © 2019 American Psychological Association.

ABSTRACT: Between-group competition in social animals appears to be a prominent selective pressure shaping the evolution of territoriality and cooperation [1–4]. Evidence for an effect of between-group competition on fitness in territorial species, however, is mostly lacking because of difficulty in measuring between-group competition and its long-term impact [5]. Between-group competition corresponds to a complex set of interactions between neighboring groups, and its intensity seems to depend on the competitive abilities of each interacting group [6, 7]. We tested whether the competitive ability of groups and the pressure exerted by neighboring groups affected the reproductive success of wild female chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus). Using long-term data on four neighboring groups in the Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire, collected over the course of 54 observation years, we measured the competitive ability of habituated groups using the number of mature males and the pressure exerted by non-habituated neighbors with an index of neighbor pressure that combined the frequency of neighboring encounters and related spatial information. Importantly, we found that experiencing low neighbor pressure provides fitness benefits through increased offspring survival and shorter inter-birth intervals. Also, many males in a group are associated with shorter inter-birth intervals. We conclude that high between-group competition hampers fast reproduction and offspring survival when exposure is during the prenatal period. Our findings suggest that having many males in a group results in fitness benefits and that between-group competition should be considered as a potential selective pressure that shaped key social adaptations in the hominoid lineage. Lemoine et al. use long-term data on four neighboring groups of wild chimpanzees and show that between-group competition, expressed by a novel index of neighbor pressure and a group's competitive ability, reduces female reproductive success. This suggests that between-group competition represents a relevant selective pressure in territorial species. © 2019 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Monkeypox virus is a zoonotic Orthopoxvirus (OPXV) that causes smallpox-like illness in humans. In Cameroon, human monkeypox cases were confirmed in 2018, and outbreaks in captive chimpanzees occurred in 2014 and 2016. We investigated the OPXV serological status among staff at a primate sanctuary (where the 2016 chimpanzee outbreak occurred) and residents from nearby villages, and describe contact with possible monkeypox reservoirs. We focused specifically on Gambian rats (Cricetomys spp.) because they are recognized possible reservoirs and because contact with Gambian rats was common enough to render sufficient statistical power. We collected one 5-mL whole blood specimen from each participant to perform a generic anti-OPXV ELISA test for IgG and IgM antibodies and administered a questionnaire about prior symptoms of monkeypox-like illness and contact with possible reservoirs. Our results showed evidence of OPXV exposures (IgG positive, 6.3%; IgM positive, 1.6%) among some of those too young to have received smallpox vaccination (born after 1980, n = 63). No participants reported prior symptoms consistent with monkeypox. After adjusting for education level, participants who frequently visited the forest were more likely to have recently eaten Gambian rats (OR: 3.36, 95% CI: 1.91-5.92, P < 0.001) and primate sanctuary staff were less likely to have touched or sold Gambian rats (OR: 0.23, 95% CI: 0.19-0.28, P < 0.001). The asymptomatic or undetected circulation of OPXVs in humans in Cameroon is likely, and contact with monkeypox reservoirs is common, raising the need for continued surveillance for human and animal disease.

ABSTRACT: Comparative thanatology encompasses the study of death-related responses in non-human animals and aspires to elucidate the evolutionary origins of human behavior in the context of death. Many reports have revealed that humans are not the only species affected by the death of group members. Non-human primates in particular show behaviors such as congregating around the deceased, carrying the corpse for prolonged periods of time (predominantly mothers carrying dead infants), and inspecting the corpse for signs of life. Here, we extend the focus on death-related responses in non-human animals by exploring whether chimpanzees are inclined to console the bereaved: the individual(s) most closely associated with the deceased. We report a case in which a chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) mother experienced the loss of her fully developed infant (presumed stillborn). Using observational data to compare the group members’ behavior before and after the death, we found that a substantial number of group members selectively increased their affiliative expressions toward the bereaved mother. Moreover, on the day of the death, we observed heightened expressions of species-typical reassurance behaviors toward the bereaved mother. After ruling out several alternative explanations, we propose that many of the chimpanzees consoled the bereaved mother by means of affiliative and selective empathetic expressions. © 2019, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: In both the wild and captivity, chimpanzees engage in reciprocal patterns of prosocial behavior. However, the proximate mechanisms underlying these patterns are unclear. In the current study, we investigated whether chimpanzees prefer to act prosocially toward conspecifics who have directly benefited them (perhaps based on an affective bond) or whether they simply observe the prosocial behavior of others in general (including indirectly to third parties) and preferentially interact with and behave prosocially toward the most prosocial individuals. We found good evidence for direct reciprocity but little evidence for a general (indirect) preference for prosocial individuals. These results suggest that cooperative reciprocity in chimpanzees may be based mostly on social–affective processes and direct interactions.

ABSTRACT: Animals use tools for communication relatively rarely compared to tool use for extractive foraging. We investigated the tool-use behaviour accumulative stone throwing (AST) in wild chimpanzees, who regularly throw rocks at trees, producing impact sounds and resulting in the aggregations of rocks. The function of AST remains unknown but appears to be communication-related. We conducted field experiments to test whether impact sounds produced by throwing rocks at trees varied according to the tree's properties. Specifically, we compared impact sounds of AST and non-AST tree species. We measured three acoustic descriptors related to intrinsic timbre quality, and found that AST tree species produced impact sounds that were less damped, with spectral energy concentrated at lower frequencies compared to non-AST tree species. Buttress roots in particular produced timbres with low-frequency energy (low spectral centroid) and slower signal onset (longer attack time). In summary, chimpanzees use tree species capable of producing more resonant sounds for AST compared to other tree species available. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Tomasello claims that we lack convincing evidence that nonhuman animals manifest a sense of moral obligation (i.e., the concept of fairness) in their group activities. The philosophical analysis of distinctive evidence from ethology, namely group hunting practices among chimpanzees, can help the author appreciate the distinctive character of this behaviour as a display of fairness put into practice.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To examine potential relationships between ECG characteristics and echocardiographic measures of cardiac structure in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). ANIMALS 341 chimpanzees (175 males and 166 females) from 5 sanctuaries and 2 zoological collections. PROCEDURES Chimpanzees were anesthetized for routine health examinations between May 2011 and July 2017 as part of the International Primate Heart Project and, during the same anesthetic events, underwent 12-lead ECG and transthoracic echocardiographic assessments. Relationships between results for ECG and those for echocardiographic measures of atrial areas, left ventricular internal diameter in diastole (LVIDd), and mean left ventricular wall thicknesses (MLVWT) were assessed with correlational analysis, then multiple linear regression analyses were used to create hierarchical models to predict cardiac structure from ECG findings. RESULTS Findings indicated correlations (r = –0.231 to 0.310) between results for ECG variables and echocardiographic measures. The duration and amplitude of P waves in lead II had the strongest correlations with atrial areas. The Sokolow-Lyon criteria, QRS-complex duration, and R-wave amplitude in leads V6 and II had the strongest correlations with MLVWT, whereas the Sokolow-Lyon criteria, QRS-complex duration, and S-wave amplitude in leads V2 and V1 had the strongest correlations with LVIDd. However, the ECG predictive models that were generated only accounted for 17%, 7%, 11%, and 8% of the variance in the right atrial end-systolic area, left atrial end-systolic area, MLVWT, and LVIDd, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results indicated that relationships existed between ECG findings and cardiac morphology in the chimpanzees of the present study; however, further research is required to examine whether the predictive models generated can be modified to improve their clinical utility. © 2020, American Veterinary Medical Association.

ABSTRACT: Background: Gut parasites exert an important influence on the gut microbiome, with many studies focusing on the human gut microbiome. It has, however, undergone severe richness depletion. Hygienic lifestyle, antimicrobial treatments and altered gut homeostasis (e.g., chronic inflammation) reduce gut microbiome richness and also parasite prevalence; which may confound results. Studying species closely related to humans could help overcome this problem by providing insights into the ancestral relationship between humans, their gut microbiome and their gut parasites. Chimpanzees are a particularly promising model as they have similar gut microbiomes to humans and many parasites infect both species. Aims: We study the interaction between gut microbiome and enteric parasites in chimpanzees. Investigating what novel insights a closely related species can reveal when compared to studies on humans. Methods: Using eighty-seven faecal samples from wild western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) in Senegal, we combine 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing for gut microbiome characterization with PCR detection of parasite taxa (Blastocystis sp., Strongyloides spp., Giardia duodenalis, Cryptosporidium spp., Plasmodium spp., Filariae and Trypanosomatidae). We test for differences in gut microbiota ecosystem traits and taxonomical composition between Blastocystis and Strongyloides bearing and non-bearing samples. Results: For Blastocystis, twelve differentially abundant taxa (e.g., Methanobrevibacter), including Prevotella and Ruminococcus-Methanobrevibacter enterotype markers, replicate findings in humans. However, several richness indices are lower in Blastocystis carriers, contradicting human studies. This indicates Blastocystis, unlike Strongyloides, is associated to a “poor health” gut microbiome, as does the fact that Faecalibacterium, a bacterium with gut protective traits, is absent in Blastocystis-positive samples. Strongyloides was associated to Alloprevotella and five other taxonomic groups. Each parasite had its unique impact on the gut microbiota indicating parasite-specific niches. Our results suggest that studying the gut microbiomes of wild chimpanzees could help disentangle biological from artefactual associations between gut microbiomes and parasites. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Entamoeba histolytica is an enteric parasite that infects approximately 50 million people worldwide. Although E. histolytica is a zoonotic parasite that has the potential to infect nonhuman primates, such transmission is poorly understood. Consequently, this study examined whether E. histolytica is present among humans, chimpanzees and baboons living in the Greater Gombe Ecosystem (GGE), Tanzania. The primary aims were to determine patterns of E. histolytica infection in a system with human-nonhuman primate overlap and to test associations between infection status and potential risk factors of disease. Entamoeba spp. occurred in 60.3% of human, 65.6% of chimpanzee and 88.6% of baboon samples. Entamoeba histolytica occurred in 12.1% of human, 34.1% of chimpanzee and 10.9% of baboon samples. Human E. histolytica infection was associated with gastrointestinal symptoms. This was the first study to confirm the presence of E. histolytica in the GGE. The high sample prevalence of E. histolytica in three sympatric primates suggests that zoonotic transmission is possible and stresses the need for further phylogenetic studies. Interventions targeting better sanitation and hygiene practices for humans living in the GGE can help prevent E. histolytica infection in humans, while also protecting the endangered chimpanzees and other primates in this region. © Copyright Cambridge University Press 2018.

ABSTRACT: Examining the diets of primate populations inhabiting different habitat types could be useful in understanding local adaptation and divergence between these populations. In Cameroon, the Nigeria–Cameroon chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes ellioti) is subdivided into two genetically distinct populations that occupy different habitat types; one occurs in forests to the west and the other in a forest–woodland–savanna mosaic (ecotone) in the center of the country. We used macroscopic fecal sample assessment to investigate dietary differences in relation to monthly fruit availability among P. t. ellioti communities in both habitat types: at Ebo Forest (rainforest) and Mbam and Djerem National Park (ecotone). We collected data simultaneously across three sites: Bekob and Njuma (rainforest) and Ganga (ecotone) from January 2016 to December 2017. In the dry season, fruits were the most important dietary component at Bekob and Njuma, while nonfruit plant material (leaves, pith, and bark) were most important at Ganga. In the wet season, the proportion of fruits in the diet was greatest at Ganga, while nonfruit plant material dominated chimpanzee diets at Bekob and Njuma. Chimpanzees at Bekob ate more fruits from introduced and secondary forest plant species than those at Njuma and Ganga, especially during periods of fruit scarcity. Animal consumption was higher at Ganga and was inversely associated with fruit consumption. These observations link habitat diversity to differences in feeding ecology among genetically distinct populations of P. t. ellioti. We speculate that dietary differences reflect broader socioecological variation between these populations, and collectively, that these factors promote intraspecific divergence. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Studying genetic mechanisms underlying primate brain morphology can provide insight into the evolution of human brain structure and cognition. In humans, loss-of-function mutations in the gene coding for ASPM (Abnormal Spindle Microtubule Assembly) have been associated with primary microcephaly, which is defined by a significantly reduced brain volume, intellectual disability and delayed development. However, less is known about the effects of common ASPM variation in humans and other primates. In this study, we characterized the degree of coding variation at ASPM in a large sample of chimpanzees (N = 241), and examined potential associations between genotype and various measures of brain morphology. We identified and genotyped five non-synonymous polymorphisms in exons 3 (V588G), 18 (Q2772K, K2796E, C2811Y) and 27 (I3427V). Using T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of brains, we measured total brain volume, cerebral gray and white matter volume, cerebral ventricular volume, and cortical surface area in the same chimpanzees. We found a potential association between ASPM V588G genotype and cerebral ventricular volume but not with the other measures. Additionally, we found that chimpanzee, bonobo, and human lineages each independently show a signature of accelerated ASPM protein evolution. Overall, our results suggest the potential effects of ASPM variation on cerebral cortical development, and emphasize the need for further functional studies. These results are the first evidence suggesting ASPM variation might play a role in shaping natural variation in brain structure in nonhuman primates. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and International Behavioural and Neural Genetics Society

ABSTRACT: Digging for underground storage organs of plants has been reported in various populations of wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). However, it is unknown so far whether chimpanzees display lateral biases in manual digging as direct observations of this behavior are still lacking. It was therefore the aim of the present study to assess, for the first time, hand preferences for digging in a group of nine captive chimpanzees. We found that with only one exception, all individuals engaged in manual digging for buried food. Five individuals displayed a significant right-hand preference, two a significant left-hand preference, and one was ambidextrous. No apparent differences between males and females were found with regard to the direction or strength of hand preferences for manual digging. Only one out of four parent–offspring pairs was congruent in their preferred hand for manual digging. Three of the eight chimpanzees who dug manually also used tools in order to excavate buried food. Among those three individuals, one displayed a significant right-, one a significant left-hand preference, and one was ambidextrous. Only one of these three chimpanzees was consistent in preferring the same hand for manual and tool digging. The present findings are in line with the notion that chimpanzees display significant hand preferences at the individual level for haptic-guided behaviors, with a tendency for the right hand. © 2019, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: In intertemporal choice (ITC) tasks, animals are presented with alternative choices between a smaller reward that becomes available sooner and a larger reward that becomes available later. To equate the duration of a trial across the 2 options, postreward delays (PRDs) are inserted after the delivery of the reward. Animals need to incorporate this to increase the long-term reward rate. However, recent studies suggest that they have difficulty understanding the contingency associated with PRDs. Previous research indicates that chimpanzees exhibit particularly great self-control in ITC tasks, but it remains unclear whether chimpanzees do so when considering PRDs. Therefore, we used touchscreen experiments to explore chimpanzee intertemporal preferences when trial duration was equated by a PRD as well as when the PRD was eliminated. The computerized setting was used to try to control delay length flexibly and precisely while reducing the impact of the interaction with human experimenters. Moreover, choice options were presented on touchscreens using symbolic cues. This may reduce the impact of seeing food rewards on making a choice (i.e., the animals’ robust tendency to reach for the larger amount of food). In an ITC task in which the trial duration was equated, 4 chimpanzees preferred larger rewards but chose smaller rewards more often when the ratio of the reward amount was smaller. In an ITC task with no PRDs, 2 of 4 chimpanzees did switch their preference to smaller rewards and enhanced the reward rate although this result should be interpreted in light of some methodological limitations.

ABSTRACT: We present new data on the ingestion of minerals from termite mound soil by East African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) living in the Budongo Forest Reserve, Uganda, the Gombe National Park and the Mahale Mountains National Park, Tanzania. Termite mound soil is here shown to be a rich source of minerals, containing high concentrations of iron and aluminum. Termite mound soil is not, however, a source of sodium. The concentrations of iron and aluminum are the highest yet found in any of the mineral sources consumed. Levels of manganese and copper, though not so high as for iron and aluminum, are also higher than in other dietary sources. We focus on the contribution of termite mound soil to other known sources of mineral elements consumed by these apes, and compare the mineral content of termite soil with that of control forest soil, decaying wood, clay, and the normal plant-based chimpanzee diet at Budongo. Samples obtained from Mahale Mountains National Park and Gombe National Park, both in Tanzania, show similar mineral distribution across sources. We suggest three distinct but related mechanisms by which minerals may come to be concentrated in the above-mentioned sources, serving as potentially important sources of essential minerals in the chimpanzee diet. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees’ (Pan troglodytes) nut-cracking behavior represents one of the most complex forms of tool-use known among nonhuman animals. Given the close phylogenetic relationship between these apes and humans, investigating how such complex behavior develops in immatures can reveal the evolutionary roots of the cognitive processes that enabled the evolution of outstanding technological skills in our lineage. In this study, we investigated whether maternal behavior directly enhanced nut-cracking skills in immature individuals. We analyzed the behavior of 11 immatures and their mothers (N = 8) during nut-cracking activity, spanning over three consecutive nut-cracking seasons in the Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire. We used generalized linear mixed models to (a) obtain values of maternal scaffolding (defined as provision of learning opportunities) and active nut-sharing behavior of each mother according to the age of their offspring, and their average nut-cracking efficiency; (b) to test whether these variables enhanced immatures’ nut-cracking skills; and (c) to test whether immatures’ features (age, sex, and begging behavior) influenced maternal behavior as observed in our videos. Although the predicted values of maternal scaffolding and active nut-sharing did not obviously affect immatures’ skills, they were positively influenced by the average maternal efficiency and by sharing hammers with their mothers. In addition, our observations showed that mothers were more likely to share nuts with their sons than with their daughters, and the more their offspring begged. Concurrently, male immatures were also found to beg more often than females. Our results add evidence on the ontogenetic pathway leading to the full acquisition of nut-cracking in wild chimpanzees and on the effect that maternal behavior can have in promoting the acquisition of this complex tool-use behavior. Moreover, our study strengthens the importance of naturalistic observations to understand complex skill acquisition. Finally, we suggest future avenues for investigating the maternal influence on learning. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Primate infants have several physical features that distinguish them from adults in appearance. One such feature is the well-known ‘baby schema,’ in which the infant has a relatively large head and eyes, and a small nose and mouth. Humans typically prefer infants of both conspecifics and heterospecifics with a strong baby schema. In nonhuman primates, infants of some (e.g. chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes) but not all species (e.g. bonobos, Pan paniscus) have species-specific conspicuous skin and fur coloration, in addition to species-common infantile features. This study examined whether closely related chimpanzees and bonobos have a preference for infants, and, if so, whether they are attracted to species-common features (e.g. the relatively large head and eyes) or species-specific features (e.g. conspicuous coloration). We used eye tracking to measure eye movements while participants viewed naturalistic images of a mother–infant pair. We adopted a cross-species design, so that both species viewed images of chimpanzees, bonobos and an outgroup primate species. We found that chimpanzees viewed the faces of infants for longer than those of adults when presented with conspecific images, but not when presented with heterospecific images. Chimpanzees also did not show any preference when facial coloration was matched between conspecific infants and adults in a follow-up experiment. Chimpanzees thus seem to respond particularly to the special infantile coloration of conspecifics. Bonobos clearly differed from chimpanzees in that they did not view conspecific infants for longer than adults and viewed heterospecific adults for longer than infants. These observed species differences may be related to their species-typical social and rearing styles. In conclusion, the preference for infants is species-specific in bonobos and chimpanzees, with a general lack of preference for the species-common baby schema. © 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ABSTRACT: Among the many genes involved in the metabolism of therapeutic drugs, human arylamine N-acetyltransferases (NATs) genes have been extensively studied, due to their medical importance both in pharmacogenetics and disease epidemiology. One member of this small gene family, NAT2, is established as the locus of the classic human acetylation polymorphism in drug metabolism. Current hypotheses hold that selective processes favoring haplotypes conferring lower NAT2 activity have been operating in modern humans' recent history as an adaptation to local chemical and dietary environments. To shed new light on such hypotheses, we investigated the genetic diversity of the three members of the NAT gene family in seven hominid species, including modern humans, Neanderthals and Denisovans. Little polymorphism sharing was found among hominids, yet all species displayed high NAT diversity, but distributed in an opposite fashion in chimpanzees and bonobos (Pan genus) compared to modern humans, with higher diversity in Pan species at NAT1 and lower at NAT2, while the reverse is observed in humans. This pattern was also reflected in the results returned by selective neutrality tests, which suggest, in agreement with the predicted functional impact of mutations detected in non-human primates, stronger directional selection, presumably purifying selection, at NAT1 in modern humans, and at NAT2 in chimpanzees. Overall, the results point to the evolution of divergent functions of these highly homologous genes in the different primate species, possibly related to their specific chemical/dietary environment (exposome) and we hypothesize that this is likely linked to the emergence of controlled fire use in the human lineage. © 2019 Vangenot et al.

ABSTRACT: In the 1950s, Japanese zoologists took note when a number of macaques invented and passed on new food-washing behaviors within their troop. The discovery opened the door to a startling question: Could animals other than humans share social knowledge-and thus possess culture? The subsequent debate has rocked the scientific world, pitting cultural anthropologists against evolutionary anthropologists, field biologists against experimental psychologists, and scholars from Asia against their colleagues in Europe and North America. In Chimpanzee Culture Wars, the first ethnographic account of the battle, anthropologist Nicolas Langlitz presents first-hand observations gleaned from months spent among primatologists on different sides of the controversy. Langlitz travels across continents, from field stations in the Ivory Coast and Guinea to laboratories in Germany and Japan. As he compares the methods and arguments of the different researchers he meets, he also considers the plight of cultural primatologists as they seek to document chimpanzee cultural diversity during the Anthropocene, an era in which human culture is remaking the planet. How should we understand the chimpanzee culture wars in light of human-caused mass extinctions? Capturing the historical, anthropological, and philosophical nuances of the debate, Chimpanzee Culture Wars takes us on an exhilarating journey into high-tech laboratories and breathtaking wilderness, all in pursuit of an answer to the question of the human-animal divide. © 2020 by Princeton University Press.

ABSTRACT: We investigated whether chimpanzees use the temporal sequence of external events to determine causation. Seventeen chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) witnessed a human experimenter press a button in two different conditions. When she pressed the “causal button” the delivery of juice and a sound immediately followed (cause-then-effect). In contrast, she pressed the “non-causal button” only after the delivery of juice and sound (effect-then-cause). When given the opportunity to produce the desired juice delivery themselves, the chimpanzees preferentially pressed the causal button, i.e., the one that preceded the effect. Importantly, they did so in their first test trial and even though both buttons were equally associated with juice delivery. This outcome suggests that chimpanzees, like human children, do not rely solely on their own actions to make use of novel causal relations, but they can learn causal sequences based on observation alone. We discuss these findings in relation to the literature on causal inferences as well as associative learning. © 2019, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Accurate assessment of great ape populations is a prerequisite for conservation planning. Indirect survey methods using nest and dung, and a set of conversion parameters related to nest decay rates, are increasingly used. Most surveys use the standing crop nest count (SCNC) method, whereby nests are counted along transects and the estimated nest density is converted into chimpanzee density using an often non-local nest decay rate. The use of non-local decay rate is thought to introduce substantial bias to ape population estimates given that nest decay rates vary with location, season, rainfall, nest shape, and tree species used. SCNC method has previously been applied in Mbam-Djerem National Park (MDNP) in Cameroon, for chimpanzee surveys using a non-local nest decay rate. This current study aimed to measure a local nest decay rate for MDNP and implications for chimpanzee population estimates in the MDNP. The mean nest decay rate estimated using a logistic regression analysis was 127 [95% CI (100–160)] days. Moreover, the results suggested that rainfall strongly influenced the nest decay rate over the early stage of the lifetime of the nests. The study confirms that estimates of chimpanzee density and abundance using non-local decay rates should be treated with caution. Our research emphasized the importance of using local nest decay rates and other survey methods which do not depend on decay rates to obtain more accurate estimates of chimpanzee densities in order to inform conservation strategies of these great apes in MDNP. © 2019, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Working memory (WM) is a core executive function that allows individuals to hold, process and manipulate information. WM capacity has been repeatedly nominated as a key factor in human cognitive evolution; nevertheless, little is known about the WM abilities of our closest primate relatives. In this study, we examined signatures of WM ability in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Standard WM tasks for humans (Homo sapiens) often require participants to continuously update their WM. In Experiment 1, we implemented this updating requirement in a foraging situation: zoo-housed chimpanzees (n = 13) searched for food in an array of containers. To avoid redundant searches, they needed to continuously update which containers they had already visited (similar to WM paradigms for human children) with 15 s retention intervals in between each choice. We examined chimpanzees' WM capacity and to what extent they used spatial cues and object features to memorize their previous choices. In Experiment 2, we investigated how susceptible their WM was to attentional interference, an important signature, setting WM in humans apart from long-term memory. We found large individual differences with some individuals remembering at least their last four choices. Chimpanzees used a combination of spatial cues and object features to remember which boxes they had chosen already. Moreover, their performance decreased specifically when competing memory information was introduced. Finally, we found that individual differences in task performance were highly reliable over time. Together, these findings show remarkable similarities between human and chimpanzee WM abilities despite evolutionary and life-history differences. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: The study of representational play in nonhuman primates, including chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), provides interspecific perspectives on human cognitive development and evolution. A notable form of representational play in chimpanzees is play parenting, wherein parental behavior is directed at inanimate objects. Though observed in captivity, unambiguous examples of play parenting by wild chimpanzees are rare. Here, we report two cases from Ngogo in Kibale National Park, Uganda, in which a wild adult female chimpanzee (P. t. schweinfurthii) directed parental behaviors at corpses. Both cases involved the same adult female chimpanzee, aged 20–21 years. The first case was observed on 5 March 2016, and the play object was the corpse of a bushbaby (Galago thomasi); in the second case, observed on 6 May 2017, the play object was a recently deceased chimpanzee infant postmortally stolen from the mother. The chimpanzee possessed the first and second play objects for approximately 5.5 h and 1.8 h, respectively. In both cases, she performed a variety of maternal behaviors, including co-nesting, grooming, and dorsally carrying the play objects. In contrast to previous observations of play parenting in captivity, the play parent was a presumably sterile adult female, well beyond the average age of first birth. These observations contribute to the expanding literature on chimpanzee interactions with the corpses of both conspecifics and heterospecifics. © 2019, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The chapter describes a survey of large mammals in the Lake Tumba landscape with the focus on the chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) using straight lines (transects) and forest reconnaissance to document the species distribution and to estimate its abundance. Unfortunately, after the completion of the surveys, samples were insufficient to conduct a density analysis properly. The encounter rates were used as a sensible indicator of the species abundance and this latter varied with distance from main rivers, with the highest being within the distance 11–15 km; their averages were 0.11 nesting sites km−1 and 0.05 nesting sites, respectively, for the Ngiri Triangle and Bosobele, respectively. Swampy forests and seasonally flooded forests combined dominated the overall area; woody swamps occupied 32% of the space and that Ngiri Triangle had 27.6% of mixed mature forest on terra firma, which was higher than most forests in that zone where the average terra firma forest is greater than 20%. Finally, Chimpanzees’ nesting sites were found at the highest proportions (70%) in flooded forests and that human signs averaged at 2.3 signs per km in the Ngiri region (ranging between 0.8 and 5.0). © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

ABSTRACT: More data are needed for a better understanding of the long-term influence of wider and combined stressful events in chimpanzee personality development. We evaluated the effects of bushmeat trade outcomes on the personality development in 84 African sanctuary chimpanzees. The chimpanzees presented different backgrounds regarding maternal care, social exposure, and abuse. We evaluated personality traits in chimpanzees using the Cattell 16PF personality questionnaire, the first application of this questionnaire in this species. We found that chimpanzees were rated as higher in anxiety after long social deprivation during infancy and juvenility, and if high human exposure was experienced. Mother-reared chimpanzees were rated as lower in restraint than hand-reared chimpanzees. Finally, mother-reared chimpanzees were rated as less dominant than hand-reared chimpanzees and rated higher when they had experienced severe mistreatment. Results suggest a wide range of possible stressful events could be potentially shaping rescued chimpanzees’ personality and demonstrating the detrimental outcomes and consequences of the bushmeat and pet trade. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: In cooperative hunting, a carcass cannot be divided equally, and hunts may be unsuccessful. We studied how chimpanzees respond to these two variables, working for unequal rewards and no rewards, which have been rarely included in experimental cooperative tasks. We presented chimpanzees with a task requiring three chimpanzees to work together and varied the reward structure in two separate experiments. In Experiment 1, two individuals received more rewards than the third, making the outcome unequal. We wanted to know if cooperation would continue or break down, and what mechanisms might maintain performance. Experiment 2 used equal rewards, but this time one or more locations were left unbaited on a proportion of trials. Thus, there was a chance of individuals working to receive nothing. In Experiment 1, the chimpanzees worked at a high rate, tolerating the unequal outcomes, with rank appearing to determine who got access to the higher-value locations. However, equal outcomes (used as a control) enhanced cooperative performance, most likely through motivational processes rather than the absence of inequity aversion. In Experiment 2, performance dropped off dramatically when the chimpanzees were not rewarded on every trial. Their strategy was irrational as donating effort would have led to more rewards in the long run for each individual. Our results lead to a hierarchy of performances by condition with equity > inequity > donating effort. Chimpanzees therefore tolerate mild inequity, but cannot tolerate receiving nothing when others are rewarded. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) both knuckle-walk in adulthood but are known to develop their locomotor strategies differently. Using dentally defined age-groups of both Pan and Gorilla and behavioral data from the literature, this study presents an internal trabecular bone approach to better understand the morphological ontogeny of knuckle-walking in these taxa. Capitate and third metacarpal bones were scanned by μCT at 23–43 μm resolution with scaled volumes of interest placed centrally within the head of the capitate and base of the third metacarpal. Trabecular measures related to activity level (size-adjusted bone volume/total volume, trabecular number, and bone surface area/bone volume) met expectations of decreasing through ontogeny in both taxa. Degree of anisotropy did not show statistical support for predicted species differences, but this may be due to the sample size as observed changes through ontogeny reflect expected trends in the capitate. Analyses of principal trabecular orientation corroborated known behavioral differences related to variation of hand use in these taxa, but only Pan showed directional patterning associated with suggested wrist posture. Assessment of allometry showed that the trabecular bone of larger animals is characterized by fewer and thinner trabeculae relative to bone size. In combination, these findings confirm the efficacy of trabecular bone in reflecting locomotor ontogeny differences between closely related taxa. These techniques show promise for use within the hominin fossil record, particularly for taxa hypothesized to be arboreal in some capacity. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Modern human (Homo sapiens) children are generally considered to be dependent on older individuals for foods, even after weaning. However, recent studies of hunter-gatherer societies have reported that children can also acquire food by themselves, although the degree of self-provisioning by children differs among groups and is considered a facultative adaptation. To investigate the dependence of children on older individuals for food and the importance of self-provisioning in early hominins, I examined feeding behavior in wild, immature chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii). I studied 19 mother-offspring chimpanzee pairs in the Mahale Mountains National Park, Tanzania for approximately 22 months. Feeding behavior and interactions between mothers and their offspring were recorded. The results supported these three predictions: (1) immature chimpanzees need to feed more frequently than mothers because of increased basal metabolic rate and immature stomach capacity; (2) mothers provide effective opportunities to feed on high-quality food items which are similar to those of the mothers'; and (3) when feeding independently of their mothers, immature chimpanzees consume highly accessible food including non-adult foods nearby mothers to avoid getting lost and physical burden as with self-provisioning of human children in hunter gatherer societies. During non-simultaneous feeding bouts, immature individuals frequently consumed pith and wood. They may be valuable food items for immature individuals during their growth stage because they can be consumed year round and contain relatively higher crude ash and protein amounts, which may enable immature chimpanzees to manage the confines of their immature bodies, preventing them from matching adult feeding rhythms. This opportunistic feeding strategy is similar to self-provisioning by human children in hunter-gatherer societies. These results suggested that early hominin children performed self-provisioning based on opportunistic feeding strategies, and contributed to their food consumption by snacking in accordance with their metabolic needs and physical confines. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Humans are strongly lateralized for manual gestures at both individual and population levels. In contrast, the laterality bias in primates is less strong, leading some to suggest that lateralization evolved after the Pan and Homo lineages diverged. However, laterality in humans is also context-dependent, suggesting that observed differences in lateralization between primates and humans may be related to external factors such as the complexity of the social environment. Here we address this question in wild chimpanzees and examine the extent to which the laterality of manual gestures is associated with social complexity. Right-handed gestures were more strongly associated with goal-directed communication such as repair through elaboration in response to communication failure than left-handed gestures. Right-handed gestures occurred in evolutionarily urgent contexts such as in interactions with central individuals in the network, including grooming reciprocity and mating, whereas left-handed gestures occurred in less-urgent contexts, such as travel and play. Right-handed gestures occurred in smaller parties and in the absence of social competition relative to left-handed gestures. Right-handed gestures increased the rate of activities indicating high physiological arousal in the recipient, whereas left-handed gestures reduced it. This shows that right- and left-handed gestures differ in cognitive and social complexity, with right-handed gestures facilitating more complex interactions in simpler social settings, whereas left-handed gestures facilitate more rewarding interactions in complex social settings. Differences in laterality between other primates and humans are likely to be driven by differences in the complexity of both the cognitive skills underpinning social interactions and the social environment. © 2019, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Reported effects of Ebola on western lowland gorillas in the last years of the Twentieth Century brought the underestimated threat that infectious diseases pose to wildlife to the forefront of the international conservation community. Human-borne parasites have since been acknowledged to threaten different species of wildlife and particularly African great apes (Bonobos Pan paniscus, Pan troglodytes, and gorillas Gorilla gorilla) that were documented to contract diseases that affect human communities. The chapter examines 6 diseases, which have been documented to be transmitted between wildlife and humans and provides a short description of each type and its mode of transmission and discusses its potential to affecting wild bonobos within the ecological conditions in the species range and the regional biogeography. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

ABSTRACT: Background: In animals with altricial offspring, most growth occurs after birth and may be optimized by post-natal maternal care. Maternal effects on growth may be influenced by individual characteristics of the mothers, such as social status, individual investment strategies and the length of association with offspring. The prolonged juvenile dependence seen in humans is a distinctive life history adaptation, which may have evolved to facilitate sustained somatic and brain growth. In chimpanzees, offspring are typically weaned at approximately 4 years old, yet immature individuals continue to associate with their mothers for up to 10 years beyond weaning. Whether this lengthy association or the individual characteristics of mothers influences growth patterns in this species is not clear. The relationship between urinary creatinine and specific gravity is an established non-invasive measure of muscle mass in humans and chimpanzees. We analysed the urinary creatinine and specific gravity of 1318 urine samples from 70 wild chimpanzees from the Taï Forest, Ivory Coast aged 4 to 15 years. Results: We showed a clear increase in urinary creatinine levels with age in both males and females, replicating established growth curves in this species and reaffirming this measure as a reliable proxy for lean body mass. Comparing those who experience maternal loss (orphans) with non-orphan chimpanzees, maternal presence beyond weaning age and into late juvenility positively influenced offspring muscle mass throughout ontogeny such that orphans had significantly less muscle mass than age-matched non-orphans. In age-matched offspring with mothers, those with high-ranking mothers had greater muscle mass. Accounting for variation in muscle mass attributable to maternal presence, we found no effect of maternal investment (length of inter birth interval, from own birth to birth of following sibling) on offspring muscle mass. Conclusion: Chimpanzee mothers have an extended and multi-faceted influence on offspring phenotypes. Our results suggest that maternal investment extends beyond lactation and into early adulthood and has clear benefits to offspring physical development. Therefore, prolonged juvenile dependence, although unique in its form in human societies, may be a trait with deeper evolutionary origins. © 2020 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Sleep is essential for survival, yet it represents a time of extreme vulnerability, including through exposure to parasites and pathogens transmitted by biting insects. To reduce the risks of exposure to vector-borne disease, the encounter-dilution hypothesis proposes that the formation of groups at sleep sites is influenced by a “selfish herd” behavior, where individuals dilute risk by sleeping with other group members. To investigate this hypothesis in the context of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) sleep site selection, we employed four light traps that we also baited with nontoxic chemical attractants to capture insects throughout the night. Across 74 nights with 294 traps set, we collected 66,545 individual insects. Consistent with the encounter-dilution hypothesis, we found that insect exposure, inferred by absolute numbers of insects caught in nighttime traps, was strongly influenced by the grouping of traps. Specifically, single traps caught more insects—including vector transmitting female mosquitoes—than grouped traps, and the number of insects caught increased with increasing distance between grouped traps. Moreover, ground sleep sites caught fewer insects than arboreal sleep sites. In addition, traps associated with Cynometra alexandri trees resulted in significantly lower catch rates than Pseudospondias microcarpa–associated traps. Our results suggest wild chimpanzees use group sleep as a strategy to avoid biting insects that serve as hosts for vector-borne diseases. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Utilizing the Great Ape Information Network (GAIN), an open-access nationwide database containing the detailed life history information of all apes who have lived or currently reside in Japan, we present a robust chimpanzee life table by single year of age and sex including 821 individuals spanning nearly a century, current through March 11, 2019. While the demographic composition and status of captive chimpanzees in Japan has been previously reported, longevity and mortality statistics have not. We show that female and male survivorship do not differ significantly, and that a live-born chimpanzee in Japan can expect to live 28.3 years (females 26.3, males 30.3). Life expectancy increases to 34.6 years (females 33.4, males 35.7) for individuals who reach one year of age, and to 40.4 years (females 39.2, males 41.5) for those who survive to adulthood. The oldest chimpanzee in Japan, a wild-born male, lived an estimated 68 years. One in six infants are stillborn, and nearly 80% of all infants born alive survive beyond their first birthday. Finally, we report that a seasonal death pattern exists and chimpanzees in Japan are more likely to decease in the winter months (Dec–Feb) than in any other season. © 2019, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: As animal populations continue to decline, frequently driven by large-scale land-use change, there is a critical need for improved environmental planning. While data-driven spatial planning is widely applied in conservation, as of yet it is rarely used for primates. The western chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) declined by 80% within 24 years and was uplisted to Critically Endangered by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species in 2016. To support conservation planning for western chimpanzees, we systematically identified geographic areas important for this taxon. We based our analysis on a previously published data set of modeled density distribution and on several scenarios that accounted for different spatial scales and conservation targets. Across all scenarios, typically less than one-third of areas we identified as important are currently designated as high-level protected areas (i.e., national park or IUCN category I or II). For example, in the scenario for protecting 50% of all chimpanzees remaining in West Africa (i.e., approximately 26,500 chimpanzees), an area of approximately 60,000 km2 was selected (i.e., approximately 12% of the geographic range), only 24% of which is currently designated as protected areas. The derived maps can be used to inform the geographic prioritization of conservation interventions, including protected area expansion, “no-go-zones” for industry and infrastructure, and conservation sites outside the protected area network. Environmental guidelines by major institutions funding infrastructure and resource extraction projects explicitly require corporations to minimize the negative impact on great apes. Therefore, our results can inform avoidance and mitigation measures during the planning phases of such projects. This study was designed to inform future stakeholder consultation processes that could ultimately integrate the conservation of western chimpanzees with national land-use priorities. Our approach may help in promoting similar work for other primate taxa to inform systematic conservation planning in times of growing threats. © 2019 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Animals have evolved a range of communicative behaviours in the presence of danger. Although the mechanisms and functions of some of these behaviours have been relatively well researched, comparatively little is known about their ontogeny, including how animals learn to inform social partners about impending danger. In adult chimpanzees, behaviours in response to dangers involve several channels, particularly alarm calls and simultaneous gaze alternations with nearby recipients. Gaze alternations may allow inexperienced individuals to learn from more experienced ones by assessing their reactions to unfamiliar objects or events, but they may also provide the basis for more advanced social referencing. Here, we were interested in the development of these two common behaviours, alarm calling and gaze alternations, in wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) confronted with a threat. Using a cross-sectional design, we investigated those in 8 infant and 8 juveniles by experimentally exposing them to an unfamiliar but potentially dangerous object, a large, remotely controlled, moving spider model. For alarm calling, we found a positive relation with age, starting at around 28 months, although alarm calls were not consistently emitted until after 80 months. For gaze alternations, we found no age effect, with some of the youngest infants already showing the behaviour. Although its function remains unclear in infant and juvenile chimpanzees, gaze alternations emerge early in chimpanzee development. Alarm calling may require more advanced developmental stages, such as greater perceptual abilities, categorical capacities or more sophisticated social cognition, i.e. an understanding that danger is a collective experience that requires communication. Significance statement: Alarm calling and other anti-predatory behaviours have been the topic of much research but their ontogenies are still poorly described and understood. Recent studies on the behaviour of wild chimpanzees in threatening contexts have suggested sophisticated social cognitive abilities in adults. How do these behaviours develop in ontogeny? We addressed this question using a field experiment with 8 infants and 8 juveniles exposed to a novel and potentially threatening object in their natural habitat. We found that gaze alternations are present in some of the youngest individuals, potentially revealing early social awareness in chimpanzees. Age did not have an effect on the presence of gaze alternation. We also found that alarm calling was more common in older individuals, suggesting that call production and context of usage must be learnt. We discuss our results in light of developmental theories of social cognition and the role of social learning in the primate lineage. © 2019, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The substantial role of food sharing in human evolution has been widely recognized, and food-soliciting tactics may have been critical in facilitating these transfers. Great apes, our closest living relatives, also use different food-soliciting tactics to obtain food from both kin and non-kin. However, the individual and social factors involved in requests for and subsequent transfers of food have been relatively little studied. Here, we examined which tactics (e.g., tactile gestures, taking actions, and vocalizations) infant chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) employ to solicit food as well as the success of obtaining food from their conspecifics. Using a multimodal approach, we focused on food-related interactions in 14 chimpanzee infants of two different subspecies (P. t. schweinfurthii/verus) living in the communities of Kanyawara, Uganda, and Taï South, Côte d'Ivoire. Overall, we found that infants' solicitation tactics included mainly visual or tactile gestural requests and taking attempts, while vocalizations and gestures involving auditory components were rarely used. With increasing age, infants used more visual gestures when soliciting food from conspecifics other than the mother. If food was solicited from mothers or maternal kin, infants predominantly begged for food via (mechanically effective) taking attempts. In terms of subsequent food transfers, taking attempts were more successful than gestures. In light of the prevalent use of non-contact begging despite low rates of success, food solicitation in young great apes might also function to facilitate social tolerance and gain social information. We thus conclude that the food sharing context might represent a critical platform to learn and practice social rules underlying cooperative interactions, which can later be generalized across collaborative domains. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Placenta accreta is defined as abnormal adherence of the placenta to the uterine wall. Placenta accreta is recognized as a common problem in human medicine, but has apparently not been reported previously in great apes, despite similarity in their reproductive biology. A 36-year-old multiparous female Sumatran orangutan (Pongo abelii) and a 20-year-old nulliparous female chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), with gross uterine and histological uterine vascular changes that are characteristic of placenta accreta, are presented. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Rabies continues to poses serious threats to the public health in many countries. The development of novel inexpensive, safe and effective vaccines has become a high priority for rabies control worldwide. We previously generated a novel recombinant rabies vaccine by cloning rabies virus glycoprotein into a chimpanzee adenoviral vector, termed ChAd68-Gp. The present study evaluated the immune responses and protection afforded by this vaccine in beagle dogs. The results demonstrated that intramuscular immunization with both low-dose and high-dose of ChAd68-Gp induced strong immune responses and provided complete protection in beagles even at low-dose. However, when administered orally, high-dose vaccination was protective while low-dose vaccination was ineffective. Further investigation indicated that the low-pH value of gastric juice in the stomach of beagles might decompose the adenovirus. Therefore, suitable formulation for adenovirus-based oral vaccine should be considered and developed. The chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored rabies vaccine ChAd68-Gp warrants extensive test for clinical application. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Signals of submission, so-called ‘greetings’, represent an important tool for the regulation of social life in primates. In chimpanzees, vocalizations and gestures are commonly employed to communicate greetings, however, the topic of signal complexity (i.e., combinations of signals) during greeting instances has been neglected by research to date. Here, we investigate combinatorial possibilities in vocal greetings in a free-ranging group of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and study how greeter sex, rank relationship between an interacting pair, and strength of the social bond of a greeting dyad influence signal complexity. Results show that the social bond and the dominance distance between individuals engaged in a greeting bout are important determiners for vocal combinations. The findings indicate that greeting signals in chimpanzees, like other vocal signals of the species, can become subject to social influences. © 2019, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Social relationships play an important role in animal behavior. Bonds with kin provide indirect fitness benefits, and those with nonkin may furnish direct benefits. Adult male chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) exhibit social bonds with maternal brothers as well as unrelated adult males, facilitating cooperative behavior, but it is unclear when these bonds develop. Prior studies suggest that social bonds emerge during adolescence. Alternatively, bonds may develop during adulthood when male chimpanzees can gain fitness benefits through alliances used to compete for dominance status. To investigate these possibilities and to determine who formed bonds, we studied the social relationships of adolescent and young adult male chimpanzees (N = 18) at Ngogo in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Adolescent male chimpanzees displayed social bonds with other males, and they did so as often as did young adult males. Adolescent and young adult males frequently joined subgroups with old males. They spent time in proximity to and grooming with old males, although they also did so with their age peers. Controlling for age and age difference, males formed strong association and proximity relationships with their maternal brothers and grooming relationships with their fathers. Grooming bonds between chimpanzee fathers and their adolescent and young adult sons have not been documented before and are unexpected because female chimpanzees mate with multiple males. How fathers recognize their sons and vice versa remains unclear but may be due to familiarity created by relationships earlier in development. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Longitudinal research on manual preferences in humans and non-human primates has mainly been conducted from a developmental perspective, with only a few studies exploring long-term stability of this trait during adulthood. Therefore, we investigated short-term (1 year) and long-term (10 and 11 years) consistency of hand preference in a naturalistic group of 19 juvenile and adult chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) by using two experimental tasks, one unimanual (simple reaching) and one bimanual (tube task). The experimental sessions were conducted in 2007, 2008 and 2018. We found that the direction of hand preference (right vs. left) in the tube task remained stable after both short-time and long-time periods. Conversely, hand preference direction for simple reaching was not consistent after the longest period (11 years), but the handedness indices (HI) between 2007 and 2008 (1-year period) and between 2008 and 2018 (10-year period) were positively correlated. The comparison between tasks confirmed that all the chimpanzees were more strongly lateralised for the tube task. Interestingly, however, the strength of hand preference in the tube task showed an increasing trend in the long term. We hypothesize that this could be a consequence of practice and experience with a particular motor action. © 2019

ABSTRACT: In March 2017, the oldest female of a group of chimpanzees living in the Municipal Zoological Garden in Warsaw, died in her sleep at the age of 53, due to natural causes. The article reports reactions of the eight other individuals in the group, four males and four females, including the daughter and the granddaughter of the old female, the following day. The corpse generally elicited more interest in the females than in the adult males. The females touched the body gently and groomed it more often than the males, who tended simply to look at and sniff it. However, the most diverse reactions, ranging from gentle touching to jumping on and hitting the corpse, were seen in the youngest male. By contrast, the oldest male never approached the corpse. In general, the chimpanzees at the zoo reacted in a manner much milder than is often reported from the wild. © 2019, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Human activities impact the distribution of numerous species. Anthropogenic habitats are often fragmented, and wildlife must navigate through human-influenced and ‘natural’ parts of the landscape to access resources. Different methods to determine the home-range areas of nonhuman primates have not considered the additional complexities of ranging in anthropogenic areas. Here, using 6 months of spatial data on the distribution of chimpanzee presence (feces, feeding traces, nests, opportunistic encounters; n = 833) collected across the wet and dry seasons, we examine different analytical techniques to calculate the home-range size of an unhabituated chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) community inhabiting a forest–farm mosaic at Madina, Cantanhez National Park in Guinea-Bissau. The minimum convex polygon method and the grid cell (500 m × 500 m cell size) method estimated the chimpanzees home-range size at 19.02 and 15.50 km2, respectively with kernel analysis calculating a lower value of 8.52 km2. For the grid cell method, home-range estimates varied with cell size, with larger cells producing larger estimates. We compare our home-range estimates with other chimpanzee research sites across Africa. We recommend the use of kernel analysis for determining primate home ranges, especially for those groups exploiting fragmented habitats including forest–farm mosaics, as this method takes account of inaccessible or infrequently used anthropogenic areas across the complete home range of the primate group. However, care must be taken when using this method, since it is sensitive to small sample sizes that can occur when studying unhabituated communities, resulting in underestimated home ranges. © 2019, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Maternal cannibalism has been reported in several animal taxa, prompting speculations that the behavior may be part of an evolved strategy. In chimpanzees, however, maternal cannibalism has been conspicuously absent, despite high levels of infant mortality and reports of non-maternal cannibalism. The typical response of chimpanzee mothers is to abandon their deceased infant, sometimes after prolonged periods of carrying and grooming the corpse. Here, we report two anomalous observations of maternal cannibalism in communities of wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Ivory Coast and discuss the evolutionary implications. Both infants likely died under different circumstances; one apparently as a result of premature birth, the other possibly as a result of infanticide. In both cases, the mothers consumed parts of the corpse and participated in meat sharing with other group members. Neither female presented any apparent signs of ill health before or after the events. We concluded that, in both cases, cannibalizing the infant was unlikely due to health-related issues by the mothers. We discuss these observations against a background of chimpanzee mothers consistently refraining from maternal cannibalism, despite ample opportunities and nutritional advantages. We conclude that maternal cannibalism is extremely rare in this primate, likely due to early and strong mother–offspring bond formation, which may have been profoundly disrupted in the current cases. © 2019, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Habitat loss and fragmentation, hunting pressure, and human-wildlife conflict threaten the survival of primates across Africa. Particularly dramatic forest losses have occurred outside protected areas in the Guinean forest-savannah transition zone. Using the Boé region, Guinea-Bissau, as a case study, we investigated whether and how this rapidly humanized mosaic of wooded savannah, gallery forests and cropland could sustain viable primate populations. We conducted line transect surveys and reconnaissance (recce) walks to assess populations of one Critically Endangered (chimpanzee Pan troglodytes verus), one Endangered (Temminck's red colobus Piliocolobus badius temminckii), one Vulnerable (king colobus Colobus polykomos), and one Near Threatened (sooty mangabey Cercocebus atys) arboreal primates across a 104 km2 section of Boé in the dry season of 2016. Using the standing crop nest count method we estimated a relatively high chimpanzee density (0.77 individuals per km2, 95% CI 0.45-1.34). An assessment of habitat selection showed that chimpanzees prefer semi-dense forest and fallow fields with remnant old trees for nesting, and locations close to rivers. The other primates studied occurred in extremely low densities and were largely restricted to gallery forests. Our results indicate a need for immediate action to ensure the long-term survival of the primate community in the human-dominated landscape of Boé. Our recommendations include action to maintain hunting pressure at a low level, restoring and protecting gallery forests, introducing incentives for farmers for forest protection and primate-friendly practices, and extending the conservation programme to all arboreal primates in the region. © 2017 Fauna & Flora International.

ABSTRACT: This study reports the first observed case of wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) obtaining animal prey freshly killed by a sympatric leopard (Panthera pardus) and scavenging it with the leopard still nearby. This observation has important implications for the emergence of confrontational scavenging, which may have played a significant role in human evolution. Many scholars agree that eating meat became important during human evolution, and hominins first obtained meat by scavenging. However, it is debatable whether scavenging behavior was “passive” or “confrontational (power).” The latter is more dangerous, as it requires facing the original predator, and it is thus considered to have been important for the evolution of several human traits, including cooperation and language. Chimpanzees do scavenge meat, although rarely, but no previous evidence of confrontational scavenging has hitherto emerged. Thus, it was assumed that they are averse to confrontation with even leopard-sized predators. However, in the observed case the chimpanzees frequently emitted waa barks, which indicated that they were aware of the leopard's presence but they nevertheless continued to eat the scavenged meat. In addition, we compiled and reviewed 49 cases of chimpanzee encounters with animal carcasses in the Mahale Mountains of Tanzania in 1980–2017. Chimpanzees scavenged meat in 36.7% of these cases, and tended to eat the meat when it was fresh or if the animal species was usually hunted by chimpanzees. However, no evidence indicated that carcasses were avoided when leopard involvement was likely. These results suggest that chimpanzee-sized hominins could potentially confront and deprive leopard-size carnivores of meat. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The mosquito-borne chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has become a major global health problem. Upon infection, chikungunya fever (CHIKF) can result in long-term joint pain and arthritis, and despite intense research, no licensed vaccine for CHIKV is available. We have developed two recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccines (ChAdOx1) that induce swift and robust anti-CHIKV immune responses with a single dose, without the need for adjuvants or booster vaccines. Here, we report the vaccines’ protective efficacies against CHIKV infection in a lethal A129 mouse model. Our results indicate that a single, un-adjuvanted ChAdOx1 Chik or ChAdOx1 Chik ∆Cap dose provided complete protection against a lethal virus challenge and prevented CHIKV-associated severe inflammation. These candidate vaccines supported survival equal to the attenuated 181/25 CHIKV reference vaccine but without the vaccine-related side effects, such as weight loss. Vaccination with either ChAdOx1 Chik or ChAdOx1 Chik ∆Cap resulted in high titers of neutralizing antibodies that are associated with protection, indicating that the presence of the capsid within the vaccine construct may not be essential to afford protection under the conditions tested. We conclude that both replication-deficient ChAdOx1 Chik vaccines are safe even when used in A129 mice and afford complete protection from a lethal challenge. © 2019 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: The mother-offspring relationship is paramount in most mammals and infant survival often depends on maternal investment. In species with prolonged periods of development or co-residence, mothers may continue to influence their offspring’s outcomes beyond nutritional independence with benefits biased towards the philopatric sex. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are long-lived mammals with a protracted period of immaturity during which offspring continue to travel with their mothers. In contrast to most mammals, chimpanzees are also typically male philopatric. Here, we use over 50 years of demographic data from two communities in Gombe National Park, Tanzania, to examine the survival and longevity of both male and female chimpanzees that experienced maternal loss during three different age categories. Males who were orphaned between the ages of 0–4.99 years, 5–9.99 years, and 10–14.99 years all faced significantly lower survival than non-orphans and died earlier than expected. Females faced similarly reduced survival probabilities when orphaned between 0–4.99 and 5–9.99 years of age; however, females who experienced maternal loss between 10 and 14.99 years of age were no more likely to die than non-orphans. Females orphaned in this later age class also lived significantly longer beyond maternal loss than their male counterparts. As observed in other mammals, philopatric male chimpanzees may continue to benefit from their mother’s ecological knowledge, whereas maternal influence on female offspring likely fades as they prepare to emigrate. These results emphasize how maternal influence on offspring outcomes can extend well beyond weaning, particularly for the philopatric sex. Significance statement: Mammalian mothers are crucial to their infant’s survival and in species where offspring continue to live with their mothers after weaning, maternal influence may extend beyond dependence on mother’s milk. While in most group-living mammals females remain in their natal group, chimpanzees typically display the opposite pattern with males residing alongside their mothers into adulthood. Using over 50 years of data on wild chimpanzees, we investigated the consequences of maternal loss both before and after weaning. We found that both males and females orphaned up to 10 years of age were less likely to survive than non-orphans; however, only males orphaned between 10 and 15 years also faced lower survival. These results emphasize how chimpanzee mothers continue to matter for offspring beyond infancy and provide novel data on reduced maternal influence on survival for daughters compared to sons. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The Boé sector in southeast Guinea-Bissau harbors a population of western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) that inhabits a mosaic of forest and savanna. The Boé sector contains a substantial bauxite deposit in a region called Ronde Hill, and there are plans for the construction of a mine, which may endanger the chimpanzee population. In 1-week survey in May 2013, we used the standing crop nest counts method to obtain the number of chimpanzee nests and from that estimate the density and abundance of chimpanzees. We carried out five 1-km line transects that covered the bauxite deposit and surrounding valleys. We used density surface modeling to analyze habitat preferences, then predicted chimpanzee nest density and distribution based on environmental variables. We found the projected location of the mine partially coincides with an area of high predicted abundances of chimpanzee nests and is surrounded by highly suitable areas for chimpanzees (northeast and southwest). We conclude the mine could have significant direct and indirect effects on this population of chimpanzees whose impacts must be carefully considered and properly mitigated if the mine is built. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: A key challenge for primates is coordinating behaviour with conspecifics in large, complex social groups. Gestures play a key role in this process and chimpanzees show considerable flexibility communicating through single gestures, sequences of gestures interspersed with periods of response waiting (persistence), and rapid sequences where gestures are made in quick succession, too rapid for the response waiting to have occurred. The previous studies examined behavioural reactions to single gestures and sequences, but whether this complexity is associated with more complex sociality at the level of the dyad partner and the group as a whole is not well understood. We used social network analysis to examine how the production of single gestures and sequences of gestures was related to the duration of time spent in proximity and individual differences in proximity in wild East African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii). Pairs of chimpanzees that spent a longer duration of time in proximity had higher rates of persistence sequences, but not a higher rate of single gestures or rapid sequences. The duration of time spent in proximity was also related to the rate of responding to gestures, and response to gesture by activity change. These results suggest that communicative persistence and the type of response to gestures may play an important role in regulating social interactions in primate societies. © 2018, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: When their mothers die, chimpanzees often adopt younger vulnerable siblings who survive with their care. This phenomenon has been widely reported, but few studies provide details regarding how sibling relationships change immediately following the deaths of their mothers. A disease outbreak that killed several females at Ngogo in Kibale National Park, Uganda, furnished an opportunity to document how maternal death influenced the social relationships of siblings. We describe social interactions between four adolescent and young adult males and their younger immature maternal siblings 9 months before and 8 months after their mothers died. We also show how the behavior of individuals in the four recently orphaned sibling pairs contrasts to the behavior displayed by chimpanzees in 30 sibling pairs whose mothers were alive. Following the death of their mothers, siblings increased the amount of time they associated, maintained spatial proximity, groomed, reassured, and consoled each other. During travel, younger orphans followed their older siblings, who frequently looked back and waited for them. Both siblings showed distress when separated, and older siblings demonstrated heightened vigilance in dangerous situations. Chimpanzees who were recently orphaned interacted in the preceding ways considerably more than did siblings whose mothers were alive. These findings suggest that siblings provide each other support after maternal loss. Further research is needed to determine whether this support buffers grief and trauma in the immediate aftermath of maternal loss and whether sibling support decreases the probability that orphans will suffer long-term consequences of losing a mother if they survive. © 2019, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The long-term effects of early life adversities on social capacities have been documented in humans and wild-caught former laboratory chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). However, former pet and entertainment chimpanzees have received little attention to date. This study aimed to investigate the long-term effects of early life experience on 18 former pet and entertainment chimpanzees, based on social grooming data collected at a primate rescue centre over a 12-year period. Moreover, we also focused on the possible short-term effects that alterations to group composition might have on grooming patterns. For this purpose, we compared stable and unstable periods (i.e. where alterations to group composition occurred). We used two individual social network measures to analyse the grooming activity and the distribution of grooming among group mates for each individual. We could show that wild-caught chimpanzees were significantly more selective regarding their grooming partners and spent less time grooming when compared to their captive born companions. We also found that individuals who were predominantly housed without conspecifics during infancy spent less time grooming compared to those who were predominantly housed with conspecifics during infancy. Furthermore, we found that alterations to the group composition had short-term effects on the distribution of social grooming from a more equal distribution during periods with a stable group composition towards a more unequal and selective distribution during unstable periods. Thus, we conclude that the social grooming networks of former pet and entertainment chimpanzees are shaped not only by long-term effects such as early life experience, but also by short-term effects such as alterations to group composition. Remarkably, we found not only captive born chimpanzees but also wild-caught individuals to adjust their grooming to socially challenging situations by modifying their grooming distribution in a similar way. © 2020 Crailsheim et al.

ABSTRACT: Objectives: The human specific commercially available STRs system are often not tested in non human primates for their cross applicability. The aim of this study is to test Cross-species validation of two commercially available human specific STR kits i.e. SureID® 21G and SureID® 23comp (Health Gene Technologies) for their positive application in Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes). Result: In SureID® 21G, 19 loci amplified and while 20 loci amplified in SureID® 23comp. All the amplified loci in both STR kits were found polymorphic and the locus Amelogenin showed differential banding patterns between male and female revealing their known gender. The present study validates the applicability of these human specific STR kits in Chimpanzee that can be used in forensics analysis, paternity testing and population genetic studies. © 2019 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Many studies investigating culture in nonhuman animals tend to focus on the inferred need of social learning mechanisms that transmit the form of a behavior to explain the population differences observed in wild animal behavioral repertoires. This research focus often results in studies overlooking the possibility of individuals being able to develop behavioral forms without requiring social learning. The disregard of individual learning abilities is most clearly observed in the nonhuman great ape literature, where there is a persistent claim that chimpanzee behaviors, in particular, require various forms of social learning mechanisms. These special social learning abilities have been argued to explain the acquisition of the relatively large behavioral repertoires observed across chimpanzee populations. However, current evidence suggests that although low-fidelity social learning plays a role in harmonizing and stabilizing the frequency of behaviors within chimpanzee populations, some (if not all) of the forms that chimpanzee behaviors take may develop independently of social learning. If so, they would be latent solutions—behavioral forms that can (re-)emerge even in the absence of observational opportunities, via individual (re)innovations. Through a combination of individual and low-fidelity social learning, the population-wide patterns of behaviors observed in great ape species are then established and stably maintained. This is the Zone of Latent Solutions (ZLS) hypothesis. The current study experimentally tested the ZLS hypothesis for pestle pounding, a wild chimpanzee behavior. We tested the reinnovation of this behavior in semi-wild chimpanzees at Chimfunshi Wildlife Orphanage in Zambia, Africa, (N = 90, tested in four social groups). Crucially, all subjects were naïve to stick pounding before testing. Three out of the four tested groups reinnovated stick pounding—clearly demonstrating that this behavioral form does not require social learning. These findings provide support for the ZLS hypothesis alongside further evidence for the individual learning abilities of chimpanzees. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: One of the challenges of collaboration is to coordinate decisions with others, and recent theories have proposed that humans, in particular, evolved skills to address this challenge. To test this hypothesis, we compared the coordination abilities of 4-year-old children and chimpanzees with a simple coordination problem. To retrieve a reward from a "puzzle box," pairs of individuals were simply required to choose the same 1 of 4 options. If successful, they each received the same reward, so there were no conflicts of interest. Individuals were paired with multiple partners over time. Both species were able to coordinate, but there were marked differences in the way they did so. Children were able to coordinate quickly and flexibly, adjusting easily to new partners, suggesting an understanding of the coordination process. In contrast, chimpanzees took time to converge on a single solution with each new partner, with no gains across partners, suggesting that their coordination was based only on repeating successful past choices. Together, these results support the hypothesis that humans have evolved unique skills for coordinating decisions and actions with others in the pursuit of common interests. © 2020 American Psychological Association.

ABSTRACT: Although infanticide by wild adult male chimpanzees has been reported from multiple sites, affiliative infant carrying by males is rare. We observed infant carrying by an alpha male chimpanzee at Bulindi (Uganda) on two consecutive mornings and collected faecal samples from the newborn infant female, her mother and all candidate fathers to determine whether the alpha male was the infant’s father using a likelihood-based method of paternity assignment. In contrast to previous observations of male care of orphans, in this case the mother was present during observations. Further, unlike reports of male aggression towards infants, the infant was reunited with her mother on the third morning, and survived. Neither mother nor infant presented visible injuries. The alpha male never directed aggression towards the infant. Rather, he displayed attentive behaviours, for example by holding the infant to his chest, supporting her while moving, grooming her, and ‘cuddling’ and ‘rocking’ her. Paternity results revealed with a high degree of certainty that the alpha male was the infant’s father. There are several alternative explanations for the male’s behaviour, but this unusual case also highlights the need for further studies to determine under what circumstances adult male chimpanzees can recognise their own offspring. © 2019, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The oxytocinergic system is involved in a range of functions, from attachment and social bonding to aggression and stress responses. Whether oxytocin is released in response to a stressor, shows contradictory results across species and potential contexts-dependent differences. To avoid unintended contextual changes due to experimental procedures, we tested this question non-invasively in wild chimpanzees in an ecologically valid context. We collected endogenous hormonal measures during exposure to a known natural stressor, intergroup conflict. Specifically, we tested for potential synchronous activation patterns between urinary oxytocin and cortisol in male and female chimpanzees during stressor exposure. Oxytocinergic system reactivity during chimpanzee intergroup conflict has already been established in this study population. Thus, we first investigated urinary cortisol levels during border patrol and intergroup encounter days, in comparison to another potential stressor, hunting, and control days. We found higher urinary cortisol levels during intergroup encounter days compared with control and hunting days. We then compared secretion patterns of oxytocin and cortisol in relation to increased levels of out-group contact and hostility (‘out-group risk’) during intergroup conflict. We found that increased ‘out-group risk’ was associated with higher cortisol levels, especially when involving direct visual or physical contact with rival groups. Although urinary oxytocin levels were high across intergroup conflict contexts, increasing levels of out-group risk showed no significant variation. Taken together, results indicate independent secretion of oxytocin and cortisol during chimpanzee intergroup conflict, emphasizing that stressor exposure in this context is not the main trigger of oxytocin secretion. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Daily energy intake of adult female mammals is influenced by environmental conditions and physiological requirements, including reproduction. We examined the effects of fruit availability on macronutrient and metabolisable energy (ME) intake by adult female chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) of the Kanyawara community in Kibale National Park, Uganda, from January 2014 through June 2015. Drupe fruits were abundant for 4 months, whereas the other 14 months were dominated by fig fruits. The mean daily intake of food (dry matter) and ME did not differ between drupe-months and fig-months. However, foraging costs were higher during fig-months, as indicated by a 20% increase in feeding time. Furthermore, during drupe-months female chimpanzees ingested more water-soluble carbohydrates and lipids, and less available protein and neutral detergent fibre. Although ME intake did not differ consistently between drupe-months and fig-months, they consumed more on days when ripe fruit dominated the diet than when leaves and pithy stems dominated the diet. Our data suggest that differences in diet quality between drupes and figs can have important effects on frugivore foraging and that they influence net energy gain more by their effects on macronutrient composition or foraging cost than by their direct impact on energy intake. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

ABSTRACT: The significance of aquatic food resources for hominins is poorly understood, despite evidence of consumption as early as 1.95 million years ago (Ma). Here we present the first evidence of a non-human ape habitually catching and consuming aquatic crabs. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) in the rainforest of the Nimba Mountains (Guinea) consumed freshwater crabs year-round, irrespective of rainfall or ripe fruit availability. Parties of females and offspring fished for crabs more than predicted and for longer durations than adult males. Across months, crab-fishing was negatively correlated with ant-dipping, suggesting a similar nutritional role. These findings contribute to our understanding of aquatic faunivory among hominins. First, aquatic faunivory can occur in closed forests in addition to open wetlands. Second, aquatic fauna could have been a staple part of some hominin diets, rather than merely a fallback food. Third, the habitual consumption of aquatic fauna could have been especially important for females and their immature offspring. In addition to providing small amounts of essential fatty acids, crabs might also be eaten for their micronutrients such as sodium and calcium, especially by females and young individuals who may have limited access to meat. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Previous studies have shown that humans experience negative emotions when seeing contextual cues of others’ pain, such as injury (i.e., empathic pain), even without observing behavioral expressions of distress. However, this phenomenon has not been examined in nonhuman primates. We tested six chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) to experimentally examine their reactions to others’ injury. First, we measured viewing responses using eye-tracking. Chimpanzees spontaneously attended to injured conspecifics more than non-injured conspecifics, but did not do so in a control condition in which images of injuries were scrambled while maintaining color information. Chimpanzees did not avoid viewing injuries at any point during stimulus presentation. Second, we used thermal imaging to investigate chimpanzees’ physiological responses to others’ injury. Previous studies reported that reduced nasal temperature is a characteristic of arousal, particularly arousal associated with negative valence. We presented chimpanzees with a realistic injury: a familiar human experimenter with a prosthetic wound and artificial running blood. Chimpanzees exhibited a greater nasal temperature reduction in response to injury compared with the control stimulus. Finally, chimpanzees were presented with a familiar experimenter who stabbed their (fake) thumb with a needle, with no running blood, a situation that may be more challenging in terms of understanding the cause of distress. Chimpanzees did not physiologically distinguish this condition from the control condition. These results suggest that chimpanzees inspect others’ injuries and become aroused by seeing injuries even without observing behavioral cues, but have difficulty doing so without explicit (or familiar) cues (i.e., open wound and blood). © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Even though information on global biodiversity trends becomes increasingly available, large taxonomic and spatial data gaps persist at the scale relevant to planning conservation interventions. This is because data collectors are hesitant to share data with global repositories due to workload, lack of incentives, and perceived risk of losing intellectual property rights. In contrast, due to greater conceptual and methodological proximity, taxon-specific database initiatives can provide more direct benefits to data collectors through research collaborations and shared authorship. The IUCN SSC Ape Populations, Environments and Surveys (A.P.E.S.) database was created in 2005 as a repository for data on great apes and other primate taxa. It aims to acquire field survey data and make different types of data accessible, and provide up-to-date species status information. To support the current update of the conservation action plan for western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) we compiled field surveys for this taxon from IUCN SSC A.P.E.S., 75% of which were unpublished. We used spatial modeling to infer total population size, range-wide density distribution, population connectivity and landscape-scale metrics. We estimated a total abundance of 52 800 (95% CI 17 577-96 564) western chimpanzees, of which only 17% occurred in national parks. We also found that 10% of chimpanzees live within 25 km of four multi-national 'development corridors' currently planned for West Africa. These large infrastructure projects aim to promote economic integration and agriculture expansion, but are likely to cause further habitat loss and reduce population connectivity. We close by demonstrating the wealth of conservation-relevant information derivable from a taxon-specific database like IUCN SSC A.P.E.S. and propose that a network of many more such databases could be created to provide the essential information to conservation that can neither be supplied by one-off projects nor by global repositories, and thus are highly complementary to existing initiatives. © 2019 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Agricultural expansion encroaches on tropical forests and primates in such landscapes frequently incorporate crops into their diet. Understanding the nutritional drivers behind crop-foraging can help inform conservation efforts to improve human-primate coexistence. This study builds on existing knowledge of primate diets in anthropogenic landscapes by estimating the macronutrient content of 24 wild and 11 cultivated foods (90.5% of food intake) consumed by chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) at Bossou, Guinea, West Africa. We also compared the macronutrient composition of Bossou crops to published macronutrient measures of crops from Bulindi, Uganda, East Africa. The composition of wild fruits, leaves, and pith were consistent with previous reports for primate diets. Cultivated fruits were higher in carbohydrates and lower in insoluble fiber than wild fruits, while wild fruits were higher in protein. Macronutrient content of cultivated pith fell within the ranges of consumed wild pith. Oil palm food parts were relatively rich in carbohydrates, protein, lipids, and/or fermentable fiber, adding support for the nutritional importance of the oil palm for West African chimpanzees. We found no differences in the composition of cultivated fruits between Bossou and Bulindi, suggesting that macronutrient content alone does not explain differences in crop selection. Our results build on the current understanding of chimpanzee feeding ecology within forest-agricultural mosaics and provide additional support for the assumption that crops offer primates energetic benefits over wild foods. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Social network analysis provides valuable opportunities to quantify the nature of social relationships in animal societies including aspects of group structure, dynamics and behaviour transmission. Remote monitoring approaches such as camera trapping offer rich data sets from groups and species that are difficult to observe, yet the robustness of these data for constructing social networks remains unexplored. Here we compared networks of party association based on camera traps with those based on direct observations over the same 9-month sampling period in a group of habituated western chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes verus. Networks based on camera traps and direct observations were both stable with sufficient sampling, and had very similar structures, patterns of sex assortment and individual network positions. However, camera trap data led to lower estimates of group density and dyadic association strengths, and slightly higher modularity, illustrating the limitations raised by differences in data collection methods for network comparisons. We then constructed a social network using camera trap data from unhabituated eastern chimpanzees, P.t. schweinfurthii, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach in the absence of extensive prior knowledge of the study subjects. Further, differences between the eastern and western chimpanzee social networks followed expected patterns based on recognized social differences, illustrating the promise of this approach for detecting within-species social variation. Although long-term behavioural observations will continue to provide rich data for many species, camera traps offer a powerful alternative to gain information on social group dynamics in elusive or unhabituated animals, as well as to conduct systematic multisite comparative studies. © 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ABSTRACT: Epitope-targeted HIV vaccine design seeks to focus antibody responses to broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) sites by sequential immunization. A chimpanzee simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) envelope (Env) shares a single bnAb site, the variable loop 2 (V2)-apex, with HIV, suggesting its possible utility in an HIV immunization strategy. Here, we generate a chimpanzee SIV Env trimer, MT145K, which displays selective binding to HIV V2-apex bnAbs and precursor versions, but no binding to other HIV specificities. We determine the structure of the MT145K trimer by cryo-EM and show that its architecture is remarkably similar to HIV Env. Immunization of an HIV V2-apex bnAb precursor Ab-expressing knockin mouse with the chimpanzee MT145K trimer induces HIV V2-specific neutralizing responses. Subsequent boosting with an HIV trimer cocktail induces responses that exhibit some virus cross-neutralization. Overall, the chimpanzee MT145K trimer behaves as expected from design both in vitro and in vivo and is an attractive potential component of a sequential immunization regimen to induce V2-apex bnAbs. Design of immunogens and strategies that can induce protective broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) is a priority for HIV vaccine development. Andrabi et al. design a chimpanzee simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) envelope trimer immunogen that binds specifically to HIV V2-apex bnAbs and their unmutated versions. The SIV trimer immunogen induces HIV-specific neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) in a favorable animal model. © 2019 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Although social transmission mechanisms of animal cultures are well studied, little is known about the origins of behavioral innovations, even in established tool users such as chimpanzees. Previous work has suggested that wild chimpanzees are especially prone to engaging with tools during extended periods of low food availability and after long travel, supporting the hypothesis that cultural innovation is facilitated by necessity revealing opportunities. Here, we tested this hypothesis with a field experiment that directly compared subjects' immediate variation in measures of current energy balance with their interest in a novel foraging problem, liquid honey enclosed in an apparatus accessible by tool use. We found that the previous distance traveled directly predicted subjects' manipulations of both the apparatus and the tool, whereas previous feeding time was negatively correlated to manipulation time. We conclude that "necessity" augments chimpanzees' likelihood of engaging with ecological "opportunities," suggesting that both factors are scaffolding foraging innovation in this and potentially other species. © The Author(s) 2019.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees have been found to show the inversion effect to visual stimuli of intact chimpanzee bodies, suggesting that they have a specific way of body processing. In this study, we examined how changes of body structures affect the inversion effect to reveal the properties of their body processing. We focused on two aspects of body structures: the first-order relations (i.e., body part arrangements) and body proportions. The experimental conditions had stimuli of chimpanzee bodies with scrambled first-order relations in Experiment 1 and chimpanzee bodies with distorted body proportions in Experiment 2. Both experiments had a control condition consisting of stimuli of intact chimpanzee bodies. A total of 7 chimpanzees participated in matching-to-sample tasks on touch screens. In each trial, the stimuli were chimpanzee bodies with the same kind of manipulation of body structures and were either all upright or all inverted. We compared their performances in the upright and inverted trials to examine the inversion effect. The chimpanzees did not show any inversion effect to scrambled bodies but showed the inversion effect to distorted bodies and to intact bodies. The results suggest that chimpanzees’ configural body processing relies on correct first-order relations, and distorted body proportions do not interfere with configural processing. It also implies that chimpanzees may have knowledge of the arrangement of body parts, but they may be less sensitive to body proportions. This study could facilitate the understanding of the evolution of visual processing of bodies, faces, and other objects.

ABSTRACT: Recent efforts to comprehensively characterize great ape genetic diversity using short-read sequencing and single-nucleotide variants have led to important discoveries related to selection within species, demographic history, and lineage-specific traits. Structural variants (SVs), including deletions and inversions, comprise a larger proportion of genetic differences between and within species, making them an important yet understudied source of trait divergence. Here, we used a combination of long-read and-range sequencing approaches to characterize the structural variant landscape of two additional Pan troglodytes verus individuals, one of whom carries 13% admixture from Pan troglodytes troglodytes. We performed optical mapping of both individuals followed by nanopore sequencing of one individual. Filtering for larger variants (>10 kbp) and combined with genotyping of SVs using short-read data from the Great Ape Genome Project, we identified 425 deletions and 59 inversions, of which 88 and 36, respectively, were novel. Compared with gene expression in humans, we found a significant enrichment of chimpanzee genes with differential expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines and induced pluripotent stem cells, both within deletions and near inversion breakpoints. We examined chromatin-conformation maps from human and chimpanzee using these same cell types and observed alterations in genomic interactions at SV breakpoints. Finally, we focused on 56 genes impacted by SVs in >90% of chimpanzees and absent in humans and gorillas, which may contribute to chimpanzee-specific features. Sequencing a greater set of individuals from diverse subspecies will be critical to establish the complete landscape of genetic variation in chimpanzees. © 2020 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Cardiovascular disorders and predominantly idiopathic myocardial fibrosis are frequently associated with mortality among zoo-housed chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Formalin-fixed whole hearts of deceased chimpanzees housed in zoos (n = 33) and an African sanctuary (n = 2) underwent detailed macroscopic and histopathologic examination using a standardized protocol. Archived histological slides from the hearts of 23 additional African sanctuary-housed chimpanzees were also examined. Myocardial fibrosis (MF) was identified in 30 of 33 (91%) of the zoo-housed chimpanzees but none of the 25 sanctuary-housed chimpanzees. MF was shown to be characterized by both interstitial and replacement fibrosis. Immunophenotyping demonstrated that the fibrotic lesions were accompanied by the increased presence of macrophages, alpha smooth muscle actin-positive myofibroblasts, and a minimal to mild T-cell-dominant leukocyte infiltration. There was no convincing evidence of cardiotropic viral infection or suggestion that diabetes mellitus or vitamin E or selenium deficiency were associated with the presence of the lesion. However, serum vitamin D concentrations among zoo-housed chimpanzees were found to be lower in seasons of low ultraviolet light levels. © The Author(s) 2019.

ABSTRACT: Personality factors analogous to the Big Five observed in humans are present in the great apes. However, few studies have examined the long-term stability of great ape personality, particularly using factor-based personality instruments. Here, we assessed overall group, and individual-level, stability of chimpanzee personality by collecting ratings for chimpanzees (N = 50) and comparing them with ratings collected approximately 10 years previously, using the same personality scale. The overall mean scores of three of the six factors differed across the two time points. Sex differences in personality were also observed, with overall sex differences found for three traits, and males and females showing different trajectories for two further traits over the 10 year period. Regardless of sex, rank-order stability analysis revealed strong stability for dominance; individuals who were dominant at the first time point were also dominant 10 years later. The other personality factors exhibited poor to moderate rank-order stability, indicating that individuals were variable in their rank-position consistency over time. As many studies assessing chimpanzee cognition rely on personality data collected several years prior to testing, these data highlight the importance of collecting current personality data when correlating them with cognitive performance.  © 2020 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: At times severe, and occasionally fatal, aggression plays an intrinsic role in chimpanzee behavior and social dynamics, particularly among male chimpanzees in both managed and free-ranging troops. At the Los Angeles Zoo, one adult male's natural aggressive behavior developed into unmanageable violence during a period of social and emotional instability consequent to the lack of an established alpha male in the colony. The severity and duration of resulting attacks on a subdominant member of the community, despite environmental and behavioral modification, indicated the need for psychopharmaceutical intervention. Prior treatment of this animal with haloperidol and gabapentin had produced undesirable side effects. Administration of citalopram hydrobromide, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, successfully reduced both the intensity and duration of this male chimpanzee's attacks upon a conspecific animal with minimal observable side effects or adverse behavioral changes. © 2019 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: In this bottom-up study of gesture, we focused on the details of a single gesture, Touch. We compared characteristics of use by three young chimpanzees with those of 11 adults, their interactive partners, housed in a semi-natural social group at the Kyoto University Primate Research Institute (KUPRI) in Japan. Five hundred eighty-one observations of the gesture Touch were collected across a four-year time span. This single gesture had 36 different forms, was directed to 70 different target locations on the body of social partners, and occurred in 26 different contexts. Significant differences were found between infant and adult initiators in the form, target locations, and contexts of the gesture Touch. There was a wide diversity in form–location patterns within each context, and there were no form–location patterns specific to particular contexts. Thus, we demonstrate that this gesture exhibits flexibility in form and flexibility in use. The results from this study illustrate the importance of contextualized meaning in understanding flexibility in the gesture use of great apes. © 2017, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Disease surveillance in wildlife is rapidly expanding in scope and methodology, emphasizing the need for formal evaluations of system performance. We examined a syndromic surveillance system for respiratory disease detection in Gombe National Park, Tanzania, from 2004 to 2012, with respect to data quality, disease trends, and respiratory disease detection. Data quality was assessed by examining community coverage, completeness, and consistency. The data were examined for baseline trends; signs of respiratory disease occurred at a mean frequency of less than 1 case per week, with most weeks containing zero observations of abnormalities. Seasonal and secular (i.e., over a period of years) trends in respiratory disease frequency were not identified. These baselines were used to develop algorithms for outbreak detection using both weekly counts and weekly prevalence thresholds and then compared retrospectively on the detection of 13 respiratory disease clusters from 2005 to 2012. Prospective application of outbreak detection algorithms to real-time syndromic data would be useful in triggering a rapid outbreak response, such as targeted diagnostic sampling, enhanced surveillance, or mitigation. © 2019, EcoHealth Alliance.

ABSTRACT: The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes play a critical role within the immune system, both by the presentation of antigens from intracellular pathogens to immunocompetent cells and by the interaction with killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) on natural killer cells (NK cells). Genes of the MHC are highly diverse, and MHC variation can have effects on the immune functionality of individuals; hence, comparisons of MHC diversity among closely related phylogenetic taxa may give insight into the factors responsible for the shaping of its diversity. The four geographically separated chimpanzee subspecies differ in their overall genetic diversity, have different population histories, and are confronted with different pathogens in their natural habitat, all of which may affect MHC class I DNA sequence diversity. Here, we compare the MHC-B exon two DNA sequence diversity from 24 wild western and 46 wild eastern chimpanzees using necropsy and noninvasively collected fecal samples, respectively. We found a higher MHC-B exon two nucleotide diversity, in our western than eastern chimpanzees. The inclusion of previously published MHC-B exon two data from other western and eastern chimpanzees supported this finding. In addition, our results confirm and extend the finding of a very low C1 epitope frequency at eastern chimpanzee MHC-B molecules, which likely affects the ability of these molecules to interact with NK cells. While the understanding of the differing pathogen environments encountered by disparate populations of a species is a challenging endeavor, these findings highlight the potential for these pathogens to selectively shape immune system variation. © 2019, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Nut-cracking is often cited as one of the most complex behaviours observed in wild chimpanzees. However, the cognitive mechanisms behind its acquisition are still debated. The current null hypothesis is that the form of nut-cracking behaviour relies on variants of social learning, with some researchers arguing, more precisely, that copying variants of social learning mechanisms are necessary. However, to date, very few experiments have directly investigated the potentially sufficient role of individual learning in explaining the behavioural form of nut-cracking. Despite this, the available data provides some evidence for the spontaneous acquisition of nut-cracking by chimpanzees; later group acquisition was then found to be at least facilitated by (unspecified) variants of social learning. The latter findings are in line with both suggested hypotheses, i.e., that copying social learning is required and that other (noncopying) social learning mechanisms are at play. Here we present the first study which focused (initially) on the role of individual learning for the acquisition of the nutcracking behavioural form in chimpanzees.Wetested task-naïve chimpanzees (N D13) with an extended baseline condition to examine whether the behaviour would emerge spontaneously. After the baseline condition (which was unsuccessful), we tested for the role of social learning by providing social information in a step-wise fashion, culminating in a full action demonstration of nut-cracking by a human demonstrator (this last condition made it possible for the observers to copy all actions underlying the behaviour). Despite the opportunities to individually and/or socially learn nutcracking, none of the chimpanzees tested here cracked nuts using tools in any of the conditions in our study; thus, providing no conclusive evidence for either competing hypothesis. We conclude that this failure was the product of an interplay of factors, including behavioural conservatism and the existence of a potential sensitive learning period for nut-cracking in chimpanzees. The possibility remains that nut-cracking is a behaviour that chimpanzees can individually learn. However, this behaviour might only be acquired when chimpanzees are still inside their sensitive learning period, and when ecological and developmental conditions allow for it. The possibility remains that nut-cracking is an example of a culture dependent trait in non-human great apes. Recommendations for future research projects to address this question are considered.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Quantifying the costs of mating is key for understanding life-history trade-offs. As a reflection of metabolic rate, body temperature is one metric for assaying these costs. However, conventional methods for measuring body temperature are invasive and unsuitable for the study of free-living populations of endangered species, including great apes. A promising proxy for body temperature is fecal temperature, the internal temperature of fecal deposits shortly following defecation. We validated this method with humans, finding that maximum fecal temperature is a reliable proxy for rectal temperature. We then applied this method to wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda. We collected and analyzed 101 fecal temperature measurements from 43 adult chimpanzees (male: N = 28; female: N = 15). Chimpanzee fecal temperature ranged from 33.4 to 38.9 °C, with a mean of 35.8 °C. Although fecal temperature was not predicted by sex, age, or ambient temperature, male fecal temperature was 1.1 °C higher on days when sexually receptive females were present and was positively correlated with male dominance rank. Post hoc analyses showed that overall copulation rates, but not aggression rates, were positively correlated with fecal temperature, suggesting that sexual physiology and behavior best explain mating-related temperature variation. Together, these results indicate fecal temperature is a reliable proxy for core body temperature in large-bodied mammals, captures metabolic costs associated with male mating behavior, and represents a valuable noninvasive tool for biological field research. Significance statement: Body temperature illuminates an animal’s physiological condition and energy expenditure, but it is difficult to measure in wild animals. Consequently, basic data on body temperature and its socioecological correlates in wild animals are scant, especially when noninvasive measures must be used. To address this problem, we demonstrated that the temperatures of fecal deposits reliably estimate body temperatures in a large bodied primate and are approximately as reliable as invasive, subcutaneous transponder methods used in other mammals. We then found that fecal temperature in chimpanzees varied by ecologically and reproductively relevant variables including time of year, the presence of sexually receptive females, and dominance rank. Sexual behavior was likely responsible for increased male fecal temperature, as overall copulation frequency, but not aggression, was correlated with fecal temperature. We therefore provide evidence that fecal temperature can be used to assay body temperature and address questions regarding physiological condition and metabolic expenditure. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Meat, long hypothesized as an important food source in human evolution, is still a substantial component of the modern human diet, with some humans relying entirely on meat during certain times of the year. Understanding the socio-ecological context leading to the successful acquisition and consumption of meat by chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), our closest living relative, can provide insight into the emergence of this trait because humans and chimpanzees are unusual among primates in that they both (i) hunt mammalian prey, (ii) share meat with community members, and (iii) form long-term relationships and complex social hierarchies within their communities. However, females in both human hunter-gatherer societies as well as chimpanzee groups rarely hunt, instead typically accessing meat via males that share meat with group members. In general, female chimpanzee dominance rank affects feeding competition, but so far, the effect of female dominance rank on meat access found different results within and across studied chimpanzee groups. Here we contribute to the debate on how female rank influences meat access while controlling for several socio-ecological variables. Multivariate analyses of 773 separate meat-eating events collected over more than 25 years from two chimpanzee communities located in the Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire, were used to test the importance of female dominance rank for being present at, and for acquiring meat, during meat-eating events. We found that high-ranking females were more likely to be present during a meat-eating event and, in addition, were more likely to eat meat compared to the subordinates. These findings were robust to both large demographic changes (decrease of community size) and seasonal ecological changes (fruit abundance dynamics). In addition to social rank, we found that other female properties had a positive influence on presence to meat-eating events and access to meat given presence, including oestrus status, nursing of a small infant, and age. Similar to findings in other chimpanzee populations, our results suggest that females reliably acquire meat over their lifetime despite rarely being active hunters. The implication of this study supports the hypothesis that dominance rank is an important female chimpanzee property conferring benefits for the high-ranking females. © 2020 Riedel et al.

ABSTRACT: To induce and maintain naïve pluripotency in mouse embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells (ESCs/iPSCs), chemically defined N2B27 medium with PD0325901, CHIR99021, and leukemia inhibitory factor (2i/LIF) is a classic and simple condition. However, this method cannot be simply extrapolated to human ESCs/iPSCs that are principally stabilized in primed pluripotency and become primitive neuroepithelium-like cells in N2B27+2i/LIF culture. Here, we assessed iPSC reprogramming of fibroblasts from chimpanzee, our closest living relative, in N2B27+2i/LIF culture. Under this condition, chimpanzee cells formed alkaline phosphatase-positive dome-shaped colonies. The colony-forming cells could be stably expanded by serial passaging without a ROCK inhibitor. However, their gene expression was distinct from iPSCs and neuroepithelium. They expressed the OCT3/4 transgene and a subset of transcripts associated with pluripotency, mesenchymal-epithelial transition, and neural crest formation. These cells exhibited a differentiation potential into the three germ layers in vivo and in vitro. The current study demonstrated that iPSC reprogramming in N2B27+2i/LIF culture converted chimpanzee fibroblasts into a multipotent cancerous state with unique gene expression, but not fully pluripotent stem cells. © 2020 International Society of Differentiation

ABSTRACT: Same-sex sexual behaviour has been documented across the animal kingdom, and is thought to reflect and enhance dyadic cooperation and tolerance. For instance, same-sex fellatio — the reception of a partner’s penis into another’s mouth — has been reported in several mammalian species other than humans. Although same-sex sexual behaviour is observed in our close relatives, the chimpanzees, fellatio appears to be very rare — as yet there are no published reports clearly documenting its occurrence. At Chimfunshi Wildlife Orphanage in Zambia, we observed an instance of fellatio occurring during a post-conflict period between two adult male chimpanzees (born and mother-reared at the sanctuary) where one of the males was the victim. We discuss this event with respect to the putative functions of homosexual behaviour in great apes. Given its rarity in chimpanzees, this fellatio between adult males also highlights the apparent behavioural flexibility present in our close relatives. © The authors, 2021

ABSTRACT: Despite scientific evidence suggesting close phylogenetic relationship between chimpanzees and humans, the inclusion of these apes in the genus Homo is controversial. Several tools have been used to analyse this issue such as fossils, molecular clock and genome. This work intended to understand the biology teachers’ conceptions about the humans’ and chimpanzee’s position. It was carried out in three countries with contrasting secularism conditions: Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay. Teachers were asked to answer to the BIOHEAD-CITIZEN project question: ‘The Chimpanzee should be included in the genus Homo, notably because 98.5% of its DNA is identical to that of Homo sapiens’. Results were analysed within the KVP model framework and the Barbour’s four categories of relationship between science knowledge and religion. Most questioned teachers (80%) of the three countries rejected the idea of including the chimpanzee in the genus Homo (86% of Argentinians, 71% of Brazilians and 71% Uruguayans), suggesting the conception of human beings having a special position in relation to other animal species. This study also indicates that the training of biology teachers needs to be analysed in the three countries to understand how teachers-to-be are being trained and evaluate their knowledge regarding molecular biology, phylogeny and evolution. © 2018, © 2018 Royal Society of Biology.

ABSTRACT: The unique challenges faced by animals living in zoos can lead to the production of anxiety-related behaviours. In this study we aimed to understand what specific factors may cause chimpanzees to display these behaviours. In non-human primates, displacement behaviours, such as self-scratching and yawning, are considered markers of anxiety and stress, and Regurgitation and Reingestion (R/R) is considered an abnormal behaviour with negative consequences for physical health. We examined the possible triggers of R/R, scratching, and yawning in a group of zoo-housed chimpanzees and followed this up with an analysis of long-term data to examine further aspects of R/R behaviour. In the first study we conducted focal observations on 18 adult chimpanzees at Edinburgh Zoo, UK, in addition to all occurrence sampling of visitors using flash photography, screaming and banging on the glass in the exhibit. 158 h of data were analysed and Generalised Linear Mixed Models revealed that yawning was significantly more likely if there was a long period of time since the last feed and when there were moderate numbers of visitors in the zoo. There were trends that yawning was more likely to occur if children screamed and that scratching was more likely to occur if visitors used flash photography. R/R occurred most often within 40 min of a feed, but was not affected by the inter-feed interval preceding that feed, positive or negative social interactions, or visitor numbers or behaviour. As there was no obvious daily trigger for R/R, an analysis of long-term data (2009 to 2015) was conducted to investigate if social or dietary factors affected rates of R/R over a larger timescale. It was found that R/R rates in the months before a significant diet change were not different from R/R rates in the months after, but it was found that R/R rates decreased over the five-year period. Lastly, we found no evidence that the introduction of individuals engaging in R/R lead to resident chimpanzees habitually adopting the behaviour, despite considerable opportunities to observe it. These findings have implications for welfare interventions aimed to reduce R/R and/or anxiety behaviours in captive populations and for the translocation of individuals that are known to engage in R/R between groups. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Personality has been linked to individual variation in interest and performance in cognitive tasks. Nevertheless, this relationship is still poorly understood and has rarely been considered in animal cognition research. Here, we investigated the association between personality and interest, motivation and task performance in 13 sanctuary chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) housed at Fundació Mona (Spain). Personality was assessed with a 12-item questionnaire based on Eysenck's Psychoticism-Extraversion-Neuroticism model completed by familiar keepers and researchers. Additionally, personality ratings were compared to behavioral observations conducted over an 11-year period. Experimental tasks consisted in several puzzle boxes that needed to be manipulated in order to obtain a food reward. Dependent variables included participation (as an indicator of interest), success and latency (as measures of performance), and losing contact with the task (as an indicator of motivation). As predicted, we obtained significant correlations between Eysenck's personality traits and observed behaviors, although some expected associations were absent. We then analyzed data using Generalized Linear Mixed Models, running a model for each dependent variable. In both sexes, lower Extraversion and lower Dominance were linked to a higher probability of success, but this effect was stronger in females. Furthermore, higher Neuropsychoticism predicted higher probability of success in females, but not in males. The probability of losing contact with the task was higher in young chimpanzees, and in those rated lower on Extraversion and higher on Dominance. Additionally, chimpanzees rated higher on Neuropsychoticism were also more likely to stop interacting with the task, but again this was more evident in females. Participation and latency were not linked to any personality trait. Our findings show that the PEN may be a good model to describe chimpanzee personality, and stress the importance of considering personality when interpreting the results of cognitive research in non-human primates. © 2020 Padrell et al.

ABSTRACT: Geophagy, the intentional consumption of earth materials, has been recorded in humans and other animals. It has been hypothesized that geophagy is an adaptive behavior, and that clay minerals commonly found in eaten soil can provide protection from toxins and/or supplement micronutrients. To test these hypotheses, we monitored chimpanzee geophagy using camera traps in four permanent sites at the Budongo Forest Reserve, Uganda, from October 2015–October 2016. We also collected plants, and soil chimpanzees were observed eating. We analyzed 10 plant and 45 soil samples to characterize geophagic behavior and geophagic soil and determine (1) whether micronutrients are available from the soil under physiological conditions and if iron is bioavailable, (2) the concentration of phenolic compounds in plants, and (3) if consumed soils are able to adsorb these phenolics. Chimpanzees ate soil and drank clay-infused water containing 1:1 and 2:1 clay minerals and > 30% sand. Under physiological conditions, the soils released calcium, iron, and magnesium. In vitro Caco-2 experiments found that five times more iron was bioavailable from three of four soil samples found at the base of trees. Plant samples contained approximately 60 μg/mg gallic acid equivalent. Soil from one site contained 10 times more 2:1 clay minerals, which were better at removing phenolics present in their diet. We suggest that geophagy may provide bioavailable iron and protection from phenolics, which have increased in plants over the last 20 years. In summary, geophagy within the Sonso community is multifunctional and may be an important self-medicative behavior. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees and humans are capable of recognizing their own reflection in mirrors. Little is understood about the selective pressures that led to this evolved trait and about the mechanisms that underlie it. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that mirror self-recognition in chimpanzees is the byproduct of a developed form of self-awareness that was naturally selected for its adaptive use in social cognitive behaviors. We present here the first direct attempt to assess the social cognition hypothesis by analyzing the association between mirror self-recognition in chimpanzees, as measured by a mirror-mark test, and their performance on a variety of social cognition tests. Consistent with the social cognition hypothesis, chimpanzees who showed evidence of mirror self-recognition in the mark test tended to perform significantly better on the social cognition tasks than those who failed the mark test. Additionally, the data as a whole fit the social cognition hypothesis better than the main competing hypothesis of mirror self-recognition in great apes, the secondary representation hypothesis. Our findings strongly suggest that the evolutionary origins of great apes’ and humans’ capacity to understand ourselves, as revealed by our capacity to recognize ourselves in mirrors, are intimately linked to our ability to understand others. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) live in fission–fusion societies where community members form temporary parties that frequently change in size and composition. Chimpanzee party size and composition have been widely studied to identify proximate causes of grouping patterns, and party size estimates are used to assess population sizes and densities. Numerous socio-ecological factors influence chimpanzee party size, but findings differ across studies. Various methods to measure party size exist, including direct observations, motion-triggered camera (MTC) observations, and nest counts. However, comparative analyses of these methods are lacking. Here, we assess relative differences in four commonly used party size methods and we examine socio-ecological factors influencing party size of unhabituated chimpanzees (P. t. verus) at Seringbara, Nimba, Guinea. We also assess which method(s) best reflect the influence of socio-ecological factors on party size. Using data collected over 69 months, we show that night nest counts resulted in relatively larger party size estimates than the other methods, and day nest counts resulted in relatively smaller party size estimates. Direct and MTC observations did not differ in relative estimates of party size and composition. Both fruit abundance and presence of estrous females positively influenced party size, but this effect was only evident when measuring party size with MTCs. Methods thus differ in relative party size estimates and their ability to assess the impact of socio-ecological factors. We conclude that MTC observations best represent party size and the effect of socio-ecological factors at Nimba. MTCs show promising potential for studying grouping patterns in unhabituated chimpanzees. © 2020, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Comparative [“evolutionary”)] thanatology is devoted to investigating how animals respond to signs of death and dying, in conspecifics and other species. Responses to corpses often involve fear and confusion, and “deceased infant carrying” by females is widespread in nonhuman primates. Such behavior could result from “animacy detection malfunctions” (Gonçalves and Biro in Philos Trans R Soc (B) 373:20170263, 2018): corpses have attributes of animate agents, but—like objects—they do not act, but instead are acted upon by outside forces. Many or most nonhuman primates have core cognitive mechanisms for detecting animacy, but these might not resolve this paradox. Skeletons of conspecifics, seriously injured or ill individuals behaving oddly and not responding as expected to social acts and signals, and corpses, skeletons, and sick or injured individuals belonging to other species could trigger milder animacy detection malfunctions. A central question is whether any nonhuman primates learn from experience that death involves permanent loss of biological functionality and is universal. The relevant literature is mostly anecdotal or devoted to case studies, and this question is open. In response to calls for more information, I describe 25 cases of responses to corpses, skeletons, and mortally injured or ill individuals, both conspecifics and heterospecifics, seen during fieldwork on mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii). Observations were generally consistent with the animacy detection malfunction hypothesis, although cases of prolonged deceased infant carrying are problematic. Also, one case in gorillas apparently involved sympathetic concern for a dying individual, and sympathetic concern might have occurred in a chimpanzee case. © 2019, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Due to advances in captive nonhuman primate (NHP) medical care, the number of geriatric chimpanzees (≥35-years old) is growing. With old age comes a variety of physical conditions, including arthritis, stroke, and mobility impairments. Programs aimed at enhancing the welfare of geriatric chimpanzees are now quite common, but there are few published empirical evaluations of the efficacy of such programs. The current study aimed to create, implement, and evaluate the effects of participation in a physical therapy (PT) program on physical health, mobility, welfare, and behavior. Nine chimpanzees with mobility impairments participated in personalized PT routines (using positive reinforcement training) twice per week for 5 months. Additionally, nine control chimpanzees (non-mobility-impaired, matched with PT chimpanzees on age and gender) participated in body exam behavior sessions (also using positive reinforcement training) twice per week. All chimpanzees were rated on 14 health, well-being, and behavior items, as well as level of mobility throughout the PT program. Chimpanzees that participated in the PT program showed significant increases in ratings of physical health, well-being, and activity levels across phases of the program. Furthermore, compared to control chimpanzees, PT chimpanzees showed significant increases in ratings of ease of movement. Because raters were not blind to physical therapy treatment, our results represent an initial evaluation of the program that may suggest that participation in the PT program has physical, behavioral, and welfare benefits. Assessments of novel geriatric-focused care strategies and programs are essential to further enhance the welfare of the captive chimpanzee population, which is currently comprised of many geriatric animals, whose proportion of the captive population will only increase. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: African great apes have large constitutive heterochromatin (C-band) blocks in subtelomeric regions of the majority of their chromosomes, but humans lack these. Additionally, the chimpanzee meiotic cell division process demonstrates unique partial terminal associations in the first meiotic prophase (pachytene). These are likely formed as a result of interaction among subtelomeric C-band blocks. We thus conducted an extensive study to define the features in the subtelomeric heterochromatic regions of chimpanzee chromosomes undergoing mitotic metaphase and meiotic cell division. Molecular cytogenetic analyses with probes of both subterminal satellite DNA (a main component of C-band) and rDNA demonstrated principles of interaction among DNA arrays. The results suggest that homologous and ectopic recombination through persistent subtelomeric associations (post-bouquet association observed in 32% of spermatocytes in the pachytene stage) appears to create variability in heterochromatin patterns and simultaneously restrain subtelomeric genome polymorphisms. That is, the meeting of non-homologous chromosome termini sets the stage for ectopic pairing which, in turn, is the mechanism for generating variability and genomic dispersion of subtelomeric C-band blocks through a system of concerted evolution. Comparison between the present study and previous reports indicated that the chromosomal distribution rate of sutelomeric regions seems to have antagonistic correlation with arm numbers holding subterminal satellite blocks in humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas. That is, the increase of subterminal satellite blocks probably reduces genomic diversity in the subtelomeric regions. The acquisition vs. loss of the subtelomeric C-band blocks is postulated as the underlying engine of this chromosomal differentiation yielded by meiotic chromosomal interaction. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

ABSTRACT: During the World War II jaundice and hepatitis in the US army were observed after vaccination with the yellow fever vaccine containing human plasma for stabilization. This led to first heat experiments with volunteers without knowledge of the causative agents. Finally, experiments of human serum with volunteers and chimpanzees led to the conclusion that the hepatitis B virus (HBV) which had been identified as the responsible agent of the contamination of the vaccine, could not be inactivated at 98°C after 1 min, whereas 2 min in two chimpanzees were enough. Meanwhile, a cell culture system became available showing that 2 min exposure time is not enough depending on the virus strain used whereas 5 min means complete inactivation of HBV. The great stability of the blood-borne HBV was also of interest in hospital hygiene due to the use of moist heat for disinfection of heat-stable medical devices in washer-disinfectants. The requirements for washer-disinfectors and the parameters describing disinfection with moist heat are defined in the EN ISO 15883. In this standard, the efficacy of this thermal disinfection is described by the A0 value. For heat-resistant viruses a higher A0 = 3,000 is often recommended including semi-critical instruments that undergo thermal disinfection and no final sterilization. All experiments including volunteers, chimpanzees and now cell culture were performed with greater A0 values than 3,000. Therefore, an A0 value of 3,000 e.g., being reached by 90°C and 5 min in washer-disinfectants, can easily elevated to 6,000 by prolongation of the exposure time to 10 min. In contrast to the different laboratory experiments with high virus titers it should be considered that in practice the necessary cleaning step upfront will help to reduce virus load and then protect the personnel in the medical area. © Copyright © 2020 Steinmann, Steinmann and Steinmann.

ABSTRACT: Infanticide is well documented in chimpanzees and various hypotheses have been proposed to explain this behavior. However, since infanticide by chimpanzees is relatively rare, it has thus far not been possible to thoroughly test these hypotheses. Here we present an analysis of the largest dataset of infanticides from a single community of chimpanzees, a full record of all intra-community infanticides and failed attempts at infanticide over a 24-year period for the Sonso community of chimpanzees in the Budongo Forest, Uganda. We use these data to test four hypotheses for this behavior: the sexual selection hypothesis, male mating competition, resource competition, and meat acquisition. Our dataset consisted of 33 attacks on 30 victims, 11 of which were ‘definite’ infanticides, four of which ‘almost certain’, and nine were ‘suspected’, while nine were ‘attempted’ infanticides. The majority of attacks where the perpetrators were known (23) had only male attackers and victims were disproportionately young (two-thirds of victims with known ages were under 1 week old). Our data best support the sexual selection hypothesis for infanticide. Cannibalism was infrequent and partial, suggesting meat acquisition was a by-product of infanticide, and there was no evidence to suggest that infanticide was part of a male strategy to eliminate future competitors. Infanticide by females was rare, but we suggest sexual selection, operating through intra-sexual competition, may also be responsible for infanticide by females. © 2019, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that plays an important role in regulating behavior and personality in humans and other mammals. Polymorphisms in genes coding for the serotonin receptor subtype 1A (HTR1A), the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4), and the serotonin degrading enzyme monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) are associated with anxiety, impulsivity, and neurotic personality in humans. In primates, previous research has largely focused on SLC6A4 and MAOA, with few studies investigating the role of HTR1A polymorphic variation on behavior. Here, we examined variation in the coding region of HTR1A across apes, and genotyped polymorphic coding variation in a sample of 214 chimpanzees with matched measures of personality and behavior. We found evidence for positive selection at three amino acid substitution sites, one in chimpanzees-bonobos (Thr26Ser), one in humans (Phe33Val), and one in orangutans (Ala274Gly). Investigation of the HTR1A coding region in chimpanzees revealed a polymorphic site, where a C/A single nucleotide polymorphism changes a proline to a glutamine in the amino acid sequence (Pro248Gln). The substitution is located in the third intracellular loop of the receptor, a region important for serotonin signal transduction. The derived variant is the major allele in this population (frequency 0.67), and is associated with a reduction in anxiety, decreased rates of male agonistic behavior, and an increase in socio-positive behavior. These results are the first evidence that the HTR1A gene may be involved in regulating social behavior in chimpanzees and encourage further systematic investigation of polymorphic variation in other primate populations with corresponding data on behavior. © The Author(s) 2019.

ABSTRACT: In many group-living mammals, mothers may increase the reproductive success of their daughters even after they are nutritionally independent and fully grown [1]. However, whether such maternal effects exist for adult sons is largely unknown. Here we show that males have higher paternity success when their mother is living in the group at the time of the offspring's conception in bonobos (N = 39 paternities from 4 groups) but not in chimpanzees (N = 263 paternities from 7 groups). These results are consistent with previous research showing a stronger role of mothers (and females more generally) in bonobo than chimpanzee societies. Surbeck et al. show direct maternal effects for adult sons in a species with male philopatry/female dispersal and co-dominance between the sexes. Males have higher paternity success when their mother is living in the group in bonobos but not in the closely related chimpanzees, where females are subordinate and intervene less in male conflict. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Information about responses to death in nonhuman primates is important for evolutionary thanatology. This paper reviews the major causes of death in chimpanzees, and how these apes respond to cues related to dying and death. Topics covered include disease, human activities, predation, accidents and intra-species aggression and cannibalism. Chimpanzees also kill and sometimes eat other species. It is argued that, given their cognitive abilities, their experiences of death in conspecifics and other species are likely to equip chimpanzees with an understanding of death as cessation of function and irreversible. Whether they might understand that death is inevitable-including their own death, and biological causes of death is also discussed. As well as gathering more fundamental information about responses to dying and death, researchers should pay attention to possible cultural variations in how great apes deal with death.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees, humans' closest relatives, are in danger of extinction. Aside from direct human impacts such as hunting and habitat destruction, a key threat is transmissible disease. As humans continue to encroach upon their habitats, which shrink in size and grow in density, the risk of inter-population and cross-species viral transmission increases, a point dramatically made in the reverse with the global HIV/AIDS pandemic. Inhabiting central Africa, the four subspecies of chimpanzees differ in demographic history and geographical range, and are likely differentially adapted to their particular local environments. To quantitatively explore s genetic adaptation, we investigated the genic enrichment for SNPs highly differentiated between chimpanzee subspecies. Previous analyses of such patterns in human populations exhibited limited evidence of adaptation. In contrast, chimpanzees show evidence of recent positive selection, with differences among subspecies. Specifically, we observe strong evidence of recent selection in eastern chimpanzees, with highly differentiated SNPs being uniquely enriched in genic sites in a way that is expected under recent adaptation but not under neutral evolution or background selection. These sites are enriched for genes involved in immune responses to pathogens, and for genes inferred to differentiate the immune response to infection by simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in natural vs. non-natural host species. Conversely, central chimpanzees exhibit an enrichment of signatures of positive selection only at cytokine receptors, due to selective sweeps in CCR3, CCR9 and CXCR6 -paralogs of CCR5 and CXCR4, the two major receptors utilized by HIV to enter human cells. Thus, our results suggest that positive selection has contributed to the genetic and phenotypic differentiation of chimpanzee subspecies, and that viruses likely play a predominate role in this differentiation, with SIV being a likely selective agent. Interestingly, our results suggest that SIV has elicited distinctive adaptive responses in these two chimpanzee subspecies. © 2019 Schmidt et al.

ABSTRACT: Studies testing linguistic laws outside language have provided important insights into the organization of biological systems. For example, patterns consistent with Zipf's law of abbreviation (which predicts a negative relationship between word length and frequency of use) have been found in the vocal and non-vocal behaviour of a range of animals, and patterns consistent with Menzerath's law (according to which longer sequences are made up of shorter constituents) have been found in primate vocal sequences, and in genes, proteins and genomes. Both laws have been linked to compression-the information theoretic principle of minimizing code length. Here, we present the first test of these laws in animal gestural communication. We initially did not find the negative relationship between gesture duration and frequency of use predicted by Zipf's law of abbreviation, but this relationship was seen in specific subsets of the repertoire. Furthermore, a pattern opposite to that predicted was seen in one subset of gestures-whole body signals. We found a negative correlation between number and mean duration of gestures in sequences, in line with Menzerath's law. These results provide the first evidence that compression underpins animal gestural communication, and highlight an important commonality between primate gesturing and language. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Background: Ecological immunology proposes that the optimal immune defence, and the costs coming with it, vary across environments. In environments with higher pathogen load, the immune system should experience greater challenges and, therefore, investment in maintaining it should be higher. The biomarker neopterin allows monitoring of innate immune responses, and is therefore an ideal tool to investigate the effects of ecological variables on the immune system. Here, we compared urinary neopterin levels of apparently healthy chimpanzees without acute symptoms of sickness across two environments: In captivity (22 zoos) and in the wild (two populations). Results: Our results revealed that urinary neopterin levels were nearly twice as high in wild compared to captive chimpanzees, independent of chimpanzee subspecies. Conclusion: We conclude that wild chimpanzees experience more frequent immune challenges in comparison to captive individuals. Therefore, wild individuals have to allocate more energy to immune function and away from reproduction and growth. Our data indicate that the generally delayed development of wild animals in comparison to captive individuals might not only be related to lower energy intake but might result from greater energy allocations to immune function. Finally, our data highlight the importance of understanding immune costs for accurate characterization of energy budgets in animals. © 2019 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Group housing of socially-deprived individuals facilitates welfare and socialisation of primates. Here, we studied behavioural and hormonal changes in the course of group formation among nine male chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes. Aggression, reassurance, and grooming were observed in various dyads during group formation. The pattern of fluctuations in salivary cortisol level changed through the process of group formation, with particularly high cortisol levels immediately after group interactions relative to other sampling timings during group formation. Salivary testosterone levels were unaffected by the process of group formation or sampling time. These results suggested that a combination of behavioural observation and hormonal analyses is a powerful approach to assess the impact of group formation. © 2019 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.

ABSTRACT: Background: The highly polymorphic genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I are involved in defense against viruses and other intracellular pathogens. Although several studies found reduced MHC class I diversity in bonobos in comparison to the closely related chimpanzee, it is unclear if this lower diversity also influences the functional ability of MHC class I molecules in bonobos. Here, we use a bioinformatic approach to analyze the viral peptide binding ability of all published bonobo MHC class I molecules (n = 58) in comparison to all published chimpanzee MHC class I molecules (n = 161) for the class I loci A, B, C and A-like. Results: We examined the peptide binding ability of all 219 different MHC class I molecules to 5,788,712 peptides derived from 1432 different primate viruses and analyzed the percentage of bound peptides and the overlap of the peptide binding repertoires of the two species. We conducted multiple levels of analysis on the "species"-, "population"- and "individual"-level to account for the characterization of MHC variation in a larger number of chimpanzees and their broader geographic distribution. We found a lower percentage of bound peptides in bonobos at the B locus in the "population"-level comparison and at the B and C loci in the "individual"-level comparison. Furthermore, we found evidence of a limited peptide binding repertoire in bonobos by tree-based visualization of functional clustering of MHC molecules, as well as an analysis of peptides bound by both species. Conclusion: Our results suggest a reduced MHC class I viral peptide binding ability at the B and C loci in bonobos compared to chimpanzees. The effects of this finding on the immune defense against viruses in wild living bonobos are unclear. However, special caution is needed to prevent introduction and spread of new viruses to bonobos, as their defensive ability to cope with new viruses could be limited compared to chimpanzees. © 2019 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Understanding variations of apes’ laterality between activities is a central issue when investigating the evolutionary origins of human hemispheric specialization of manual functions and language. We assessed laterality of 39 chimpanzees in a non-communication action similar to termite fishing that we compared with data on five frequent conspecific-directed gestures involving a tool previously exploited in the same subjects. We evaluated, first, population-level manual laterality for tool-use in non-communication actions; second, the influence of sociodemographic factors (age, sex, group, and hierarchy) on manual laterality in both non-communication actions and gestures. No significant right-hand bias at the population level was found for non-communication tool use, contrary to our previous findings for gestures involving a tool. A multifactorial analysis revealed that hierarchy and age particularly modulated manual laterality. Dominants and immatures were more right-handed when using a tool in gestures than in non-communication actions. On the contrary, subordinates, adolescents, young and mature adults as well as males were more right-handed when using a tool in non-communication actions than in gestures. Our findings support the hypothesis that some primate species may have a specific left-hemisphere processing gestures distinct from the cerebral system processing non-communication manual actions and to partly support the tool use hypothesis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Studying the relationships between the directions of brain lateralization for handedness and language can shed light on mechanisms underlying hemispheric specialization for manipulation and signalling functions. We investigated the influence of manipulation and communication functions and of recipient species (conspecific- versus human-directed communication) on manual laterality in signalling context, taking several factors into account simultaneously. We assessed laterality in 39 chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), including 4 manipulators (mechanically effective social actions used to get things done) and 18 gestures (mechanically ineffective social actions implying that the signaller takes the recipient’s response into account). We focused on the following factors: interactional context components (e.g., visual fields of both interactants), degree of use of signals (“rare” for signals performed by only a few subjects in the population or “common” for signals performed by many subjects), mechanical effectiveness, subjects’ sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., age and hierarchy), and recipient species. We found a significant population-level right-hand bias for one type of human-directed gesture (slap hand). Mechanical effectiveness influenced laterality: right-hand use was more pronounced for conspecific-directed gestures than for conspecific-directed manipulators. The laterality of conspecific-directed gestures overall did not differ from that of human-directed gestures. However, we found an indirect influence of recipient species on laterality as conspecific- and human-directed gestural lateralities were modulated differently by the position of the recipient in the signaller’s visual field and by signaller’s age. We hypothesize that the communication nature of gestures might have developed from manipulators. Manipulators may have contributed to the emergence and the evolution of the left-lateralized communication system in primates. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Microscopic tooth wear studies on primates have largely focused on interspecific dietary comparisons, while few have addressed intraspecific variations, such as those among age groups. Here, we examined to what extent dietary shifts during ontogeny can be revealed from microscopic tooth wear in a western chimpanzee population using 3D surface texture (3DST) analysis. To this end, we analyzed feeding observation data of 14 chimpanzees of the Taï National Park (Ivory Coast) and matched them to 3DST data analyzed on two wear facets (f9, f3) of deciduous fourth premolars and permanent molars of 41 specimens (infants, juveniles, adolescents, adults) of the same population. We expected to find an age-dependent increase in texture complexity resulting from the more frequent consumption of seeds and insects in older compared to younger individuals. Furthermore, we expected the introduction of phytolith-producing plants to the diet of post-weaned individuals to result in many small and parallel-orientated 3DST features in juveniles, adolescents and adults compared to infants. We found that the 3DST pattern did not mirror the observed increase in dietary breadth from infants to adults. However, we found that age-dependent differences in the consumption of phytolith-producing plants were reflected to some extent in the 3DST pattern: infants and adolescents who spent more time feeding on phytolith-producing plants than older individuals had more parallel orientated 3DSTs with higher peaks, while adults had flatter and more randomly orientated 3DST features. Our results suggest that phytoliths as small abrasive particles may be of greater importance for the 3DST formation than food categories, such as fruits, leaves or seeds. However, compared to the variation in the feeding data, 3DST results show only little variation among age groups. We conclude that 3DST does not explicitly reflect ontogenetic dietary changes in chimpanzees. Rather, other factors, such as individual-or sex-based feeding habits as well as seasonal variation in dust accumulation, may be of greater importance for 3DST formation. © 2019 Stuhlträger, Schulz-Kornas, Wittig and Kupczik.

ABSTRACT: Demographic factors can strongly influence patterns of behavioral variation in animal societies. Traditionally, these factors are measured using longitudinal observation of habituated social groups, particularly in social animals like primates. Alternatively, noninvasive biomonitoring methods such as camera trapping can allow researchers to assess species occupancy, estimate population abundance, and study rare behaviors. However, measures of fine-scale demographic variation, such as those related to age and sex structure or subgrouping patterns, pose a greater challenge. Here, we compare demographic data collected from a community of habituated chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) in the Taï Forest using two methods: camera trap videos and observational data from long-term records. By matching data on party size, seasonal variation in party size, measures of demographic composition, and changes over the study period from both sources, we compared the accuracy of camera trap records and long-term data to assess whether camera trap data could be used to assess such variables in populations of unhabituated chimpanzees. When compared to observational data, camera trap data tended to underestimate measures of party size, but revealed similar patterns of seasonal variation as well as similar community demographic composition (age/sex proportions) and dynamics (particularly emigration and deaths) during the study period. Our findings highlight the potential and limitations of camera trap surveys for estimating fine-scale demographic composition and variation in primates. Continuing development of field and statistical methods will further improve the usability of camera traps for demographic studies. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Human bipedalism is characterized by mediolateral oscillations of the center of mass (CoM) between the feet. The preferred step widths and CoM oscillations used by humans likely represent a trade-off of several factors (e.g., stance and swing phase costs). However, it is difficult to assess whether human frontal plane control strategies are unique given few detailed data on frontal plane motion during facultative bipedalism in apes. Here, we collected three-dimensional kinematic and kinetic data in humans and chimpanzees to investigate the relationship between step width, mediolateral CoM motion, frontal plane trunk kinematics, and CoM power during bipedalism. Chimpanzee bipedalism entails mediolateral CoM oscillations and step widths that are (scaled to lower/hind limb length) three times larger than those of humans. Chimpanzees use a combination of linear and angular motion of the trunk and list the entire trunk, and especially thorax, over the stance side foot, generating large mediolateral shifts in the CoM, whereas humans utilize little angular motion within the trunk. Larger mediolateral CoM motions do not have a significant effect on CoM power. Similarities between bipedal chimpanzees and other bipedal non-human primates (macaques and gibbons) indicate that narrow CoM motions are unique to humans and are likely due to our adducted hips and valgus knees. Valgus knees appear early in the human fossil record (∼3.6 Ma), contemporaneous with the Laetoli footprints. However, fossils attributed to Ardipithecus ramidus (∼4.4 Ma) suggest that the earliest hominins may have lacked a hominin-like degree of knee valgus. If correct, this suggests that this species may have used wide steps, larger mediolateral CoM motions, and perhaps larger trunk motions during bipedal walking. Finally, we present a novel means to estimate mediolateral CoM motion from trackway step width, and estimate that the Laetoli G track maker used CoM motions within the human range. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees have been used for some time as an animal model in research on immune-related diseases in humans. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region of the chimpanzee has also been the subject of studies in which the attention was mainly on the class I genes. Although full-length sequence information is available on the DRB region genes, such detailed information is lacking for the other class II genes and, if present, is based mainly on exon 2 sequences. In the present study, full-length sequencing was performed on DQ, DP, and DRA genes in a cohort of 67 pedigreed animals, thereby allowing a thorough analysis of the MHC class II repertoire. The results demonstrate that the number of MHC class II lineages and alleles is relatively low, whereas haplotype diversity (combination of genes/alleles on a chromosome) seems to have been maximised by crossing-over processes. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees demand specialized housing and care and the highest degree of attention to animal welfare. The current project used a survey method to collate information on chimpanzee housing and behavioral indices of welfare across all 6 of the chimpanzee research facilities in the United States. Data were compiled on 701 chimpanzees ranging from 2 to 62 y old (mean age, 26.0 y). All chimpanzees except for one were socially housed; the median group size was 7 animals, and group sizes ranged from 1 to 14. All of the subjects had access to outdoor spaces each day. Daily access to a natural substrate in the chimpanzee's enclosure was available for 63.8% of the subjects. Overall, 94.1% of the chimpanzees used tools to acquire food, 48.1% built nests, 75.8% copulated, and 83.3% initiated grooming bouts. The following atypical behaviors were reported most often: rocking (13.0%), coprophagy (10.0%), and stereotyped behaviors other than rocking (9.4%). There was widespread evidence of positive animal training techniques, with nearly all (97.7%) subjects reported to generally voluntarily cooperate with shifting in their enclosure, and 72.2% were reported to present for an injection of anesthetic. We include some comparison between these findings and data describing zoo-housed chimpanzees. In addition, we discuss survey findings in reference to recommendations made by the NIH Working Group on the Use of Chimpanzees in NIH-supported Research. The current survey assessed a larger sample of chimpanzees living under human care than has been published previously. This broad analysis can help to guide future improvements in behavioral management to address behavioral problems or deficits. © 2019 American Association for Laboratory Animal Science.

ABSTRACT: Respiratory viruses of human origin infect wild apes across Africa, sometimes lethally. Here we report simultaneous outbreaks of two distinct human respiratory viruses, human metapneumovirus (MPV; Pneumoviridae: Metapneumovirus) and human respirovirus 3 (HRV3; Paramyxoviridae; Respirovirus, formerly known as parainfluenza virus 3), in two chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) communities in the same forest in Uganda in December 2016 and January 2017. The viruses were absent before the outbreaks, but each was present in ill chimpanzees from one community during the outbreak period. Clinical signs and gross pathologic changes in affected chimpanzees closely mirrored symptoms and pathology commonly observed in humans for each virus. Epidemiologic modelling showed that MPV and HRV3 were similarly transmissible (R0 of 1.27 and 1.48, respectively), but MPV caused 12.2% mortality mainly in infants and older chimpanzees, whereas HRV3 caused no direct mortality. These results are consistent with the higher virulence of MPV than HRV3 in humans, although both MPV and HRV3 cause a significant global disease burden. Both viruses clustered phylogenetically within groups of known human variants, with MPV closely related to a lethal 2009 variant from mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei), suggesting two independent and simultaneous reverse zoonotic origins, either directly from humans or via intermediary hosts. These findings expand our knowledge of human origin viruses threatening wild chimpanzees and suggest that such viruses might be differentiated by their comparative epidemiological dynamics and pathogenicity in wild apes. Our results also caution against assuming common causation in coincident outbreaks. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The challenges of life in complex social groups may select for complex communication to regulate interactions among conspecifics. Whereas the association between social living and vocalizations has been explored in nonhuman primates, great apes also have a rich repertoire of gestures, and how the complexity of gestural communication relates to sociality is still unclear. We used social network analysis to examine the relationship between the duration of time pairs of chimpanzees spent in proximity (within 10 m) and the rates of gestural communication accompanied by visual attention of the signaler, one-to-one calls, indicative gestures (collectively self-relevance cues), and synchronized pant-hoot calls. Pairs of chimpanzees that spent a longer duration of time in proximity had a higher rate of visual gestures accompanied by these behaviors. Further, individual chimpanzees that had a greater number of proximity bonds had a larger social network maintained through gestures accompanied by synchronized pant-hoot calls. In contrast, gestures unaccompanied by these behaviors were not positively associated with either proximity bonds in pairs of chimpanzees or individual differences in sociality. These results suggest that self-relevance cues and synchronized pant-hoot calls accompanying gestures may increase the efficiency of gestural communication in social bonding and that multimodal communication may have played a key role in language evolution. © 2018 American Psychological Association.

ABSTRACT: The National Institutes of Health and the Association of Zoos and Aquariums recommend that captive chimpanzees be housed in multi-male, multi-female, age-diverse groups of no less than seven individuals. These recommendations are rooted in the idea that captive chimpanzee groups should be modeled after free-ranging, wild, fission-fusion chimpanzee societies. However, captive chimpanzees do not face the environmental pressures faced by wild chimpanzees, including food scarcity, inter-group competition, and predation. As such, it has been posited that wild, natural conditions may not be the most relevant metric for defining optimal captive chimpanzee group sizes and compositions. Additionally, captive housing poses a set of restrictions on group sizes and compositions, including the need to balance large, multi-male groups with space per animal limitations and intra-group aggression. In the present study, we examined the behavioral effects of group size, within-group age range, and percentage of males in the group. We collected 713 hr of focal animal samples across 120 captive chimpanzees housed in social groups of 4–10 individuals using a 58-behavior ethogram. Chimpanzees housed in groups with a large age range exhibited less inactivity and more locomotion than chimpanzees housed in groups with smaller age ranges. Additionally, chimpanzees in groups of ≥7 with less than half males showed the highest levels of locomotion. Lastly, chimpanzees in groups of ≥7 with at least half males showed the highest levels of affiliation. There were no other significant differences in behavior as a function of these variables or their interactions. These findings lend some support to the existing group size and composition recommendations, providing empirical evidence that there may be certain advantages to housing captive chimpanzees in larger groups with a more diverse age range and/or more males. These results also have practical implications for behavioral management programs across captive settings. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To characterize the cardiopulmonary characteristics of two different anaesthetic protocols (tiletamine/zolazepam ± medetomidine) and their suitability for the immobilization of healthy chimpanzees undergoing cardiac assessment. Study design: Prospective, clinical, longitudinal study. Animals: Six chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) aged 4–16 years weighing 19.5–78.5 kg were anaesthetized on two occasions. Methods: Anaesthesia was induced with tiletamine/zolazepam (TZ) (3–4 mg kg–1) or tiletamine/zolazepam (2 mg kg–1) and medetomidine (0.02 mg kg–1) (TZM) via blow dart [intramuscular (IM)] and maintained with intermittent boluses of ketamine (IV) or zolazepam/tiletamine (IM) as required. The overall quality of the anaesthesia was quantified based on scores given for: quality of induction, degree of muscle relaxation and ease of intubation. The time to achieve a light plane of anaesthesia, number of supplemental boluses needed and recovery characteristics were also recorded. Chimpanzees were continuously monitored and heart rate (HR), pulse rate (PR), respiratory rate (fR) oxygen saturation of haemoglobin (SpO2), systolic arterial pressure (SAP), diastolic arterial pressure (DAP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), rectal temperature, mucous membrane colour and capillary refill time recorded. During the first procedure (TZ) animals underwent a 12-channel electrocardiogram (ECG), haematology, biochemistry and cardiac biomarker assessment to rule out the presence of pre-existing cardiovascular disease. A detailed echocardiographic examination was carried out by the same blinded observer during both procedures. Data were compared using Student's paired t-test or Wilcoxon rank tests as appropriate. Results: There was a significant difference for the area under the curves between anaesthetic protocols for HR, SAP, MAP and fR. No significant differences in the echocardiographic measurements were evident. Quality of anaesthesia was significantly better with TZM and no additional boluses were required. The TZ protocol required multiple supplemental boluses. Conclusions and clinical relevance: Both combinations are suitable for immobilization and cardiovascular evaluation of healthy chimpanzees. Further work is required to evaluate the effect of medetomidine in cardiovascular disease. © 2018 Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists and American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and Analgesia

ABSTRACT: Oxytocin (OT) and arginine-vasopressin (AVP) are involved in the regulation of complex social behaviors across a wide range of taxa. Despite this, little is known about the neuroanatomy of the OT and AVP systems in most non-human primates, and less in humans. The effects of OT and AVP on social behavior, including aggression, mating, and parental behavior, may be mediated primarily by the extensive connections of OT- and AVP-producing neurons located in the hypothalamus with the basal forebrain and amygdala, as well as with the hypothalamus itself. However, OT and AVP also influence social cognition, including effects on social recognition, cooperation, communication, and in-group altruism, which suggests connectivity with cortical structures. While OT and AVP V1a receptors have been demonstrated in the cortex of rodents and primates, and intranasal administration of OT and AVP has been shown to modulate cortical activity, there is to date little evidence that OT-and AVP-containing neurons project into the cortex. Here, we demonstrate the existence of OT- and AVP-containing fibers in cortical regions relevant to social cognition using immunohistochemistry in humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus macaques. OT-immunoreactive fibers were found in the straight gyrus of the orbitofrontal cortex as well as the anterior cingulate gyrus in human and chimpanzee brains, while no OT-immunoreactive fibers were found in macaque cortex. AVP-immunoreactive fibers were observed in the anterior cingulate gyrus in all species, as well as in the insular cortex in humans, and in a more restricted distribution in chimpanzees. This is the first report of OT and AVP fibers in the cortex in human and non-human primates. Our findings provide a potential mechanism by which OT and AVP might exert effects on brain regions far from their production site in the hypothalamus, as well as potential species differences in the behavioral functions of these target regions. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Compositionality refers to a structural property of human language, according to which the meaning of a complex expression is a function of the meaning of its parts and the way they are combined. Compositionality is a defining characteristic of all human language, spoken and signed. Comparative research into the emergence of human language aims at identifying precursors to such key features of human language in the communication of other primates. While it is known that chimpanzees, our closest relatives, produce a variety of gestures, facial expressions and vocalizations in interactions with their group members, little is known about how these signals combine simultaneously. Therefore, the aim of the current study is to investigate whether there is evidence for compositional structures in the communication of chimpanzees. We investigated two semiwild groups of chimpanzees, with focus on their manual gestures and their combinations with facial expressions across different social contexts. If there are compositional structures in chimpanzee communication, adding a facial expression to a gesture should convey a different message than the gesture alone, a difference that we expect to be measurable by the recipient's response. Furthermore, we expect context-dependent usage of these combinations. Based on a form-based coding procedure of the collected video footage, we identified two frequently used manual gestures (stretched arm gesture and bent arm gesture) and two facial expression (bared teeth face and funneled lip face). We analyzed whether the recipients' response varied depending on the signaler's usage of a given gesture + face combination and the context in which these were used. Overall, our results suggest that, in positive contexts, such as play or grooming, specific combinations had an impact on the likelihood of the occurrence of particular responses. Specifically, adding a bared teeth face to a gesture either increased the likelihood of affiliative behavior (for stretched arm gesture) or eliminated the bias toward an affiliative response (for bent arm gesture). We show for the first time that the components under study are recombinable, and that different combinations elicit different responses, a property that we refer to as componentiality. Yet our data do not suggest that the components have consistent meanings in each combination-a defining property of compositionality. We propose that the componentiality exhibited in this study represents a necessary stepping stone toward a fully evolved compositional system. Copyright © 2019 Oña et al.

ABSTRACT: Background: There is substantial interest in the evolutionary forces that shaped the regulatory framework in early human development. Progress in this area has been slow because it is difficult to obtain relevant biological samples. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) may provide the ability to establish in vitro models of early human and non-human primate developmental stages. Results: Using matched iPSC panels from humans and chimpanzees, we comparatively characterize gene regulatory changes through a four-day time course differentiation of iPSCs into primary streak, endoderm progenitors, and definitive endoderm. As might be expected, we find that differentiation stage is the major driver of variation in gene expression levels, followed by species. We identify thousands of differentially expressed genes between humans and chimpanzees in each differentiation stage. Yet, when we consider gene-specific dynamic regulatory trajectories throughout the time course, we find that at least 75% of genes, including nearly all known endoderm developmental markers, have similar trajectories in the two species. Interestingly, we observe a marked reduction of both intra- and inter-species variation in gene expression levels in primitive streak samples compared to the iPSCs, with a recovery of regulatory variation in endoderm progenitors. Conclusions: The reduction of variation in gene expression levels at a specific developmental stage, paired with overall high degree of conservation of temporal gene regulation, is consistent with the dynamics of a conserved developmental process. © 2018 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Ecological niche models (ENMs) are often used to predict species distribution patterns from datasets that describe abiotic and biotic factors at coarse spatial scales. Ground-truthing ENMs provide important information about how these factors relate to species-specific requirements at a scale that is biologically relevant for the species. Chimpanzees are territorial and have a predominantly frugivorous diet. The spatial and temporal variation in fruit availability for different chimpanzee populations is thus crucial, but rarely depicted in ENMs. The genetic and geographic distinction within Nigeria–Cameroon chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes ellioti) populations represents a unique opportunity to understand fine scale species-relevant ecological variation in relation to ENMs. In Cameroon, P. t. ellioti is composed of two genetically distinct populations that occupy different niches: rainforests in western Cameroon and forest–woodland–savanna mosaic (ecotone) in central Cameroon. We investigated habitat variation at three representative sites using chimpanzee-relevant environmental variables, including fruit availability, to assess how these variables distinguish these niches from one another. Contrary to the assumption of most ENM studies that intact forest is essential for the survival of chimpanzees, we hypothesized that the ecotone and human-modified habitats in Cameroon have sufficient resources to sustain large chimpanzee populations. Rainfall, and the diversity, density, and size of trees were higher at the rainforest. The ecotone had a higher density of terrestrial herbs and lianas. Fruit availability was higher at Ganga (ecotone) than at Bekob and Njuma. Seasonal variation in fruit availability was highest at Ganga, and periods of fruit scarcity were longer than at the rainforest sites. Introduced and secondary forest species linked with anthropogenic modification were common at Bekob, which reduced seasonality in fruit availability. Our findings highlight the value of incorporating fine scale species-relevant ecological data to create more realistic models, which have implications for local conservation planning efforts. © 2019 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Updated information on Critically Endangered western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) in Senegal is urgently needed, given that gold mining is rapidly transforming landscapes and livelihoods. Specifically, biodiversity assessments will better elucidate the chimpanzee extinction risk here and yield baselines for monitoring. We compared mammal species richness between Fongoli (unprotected) and Assirik in Niokolo-Koba National Park to assess the efficacy of the only nationally protected area where chimpanzees range in this country. The primary habitat difference between these sites was the degree of human activity. Although Assirik and Fongoli had similar mammal assemblages and were equivalent in primate species richness, the protected area was higher in species richness overall, particularly for ungulates and carnivores. The protected status and management plan of Niokolo-Koba almost certainly resulted in fewer mammal extinctions. In unprotected areas, the flexible behavioural responses of chimpanzees to human-driven landscape dynamics is likely essential to their long-term survival. Furthermore, the near absence of chimpanzee killings in this country greatly facilitates conservation efforts. Given that mineral extraction is a key development strategy in Senegal, we encourage primatologists to collaborate with mining stakeholders to ensure that sustainability programming includes contributions from experts in savannah chimpanzee behavior and ecology. © 2019 S.

ABSTRACT: Sharing environments with humans is linked to heightened stress responses in many wildlife species. In Uganda, deforestation for agriculture has increased competitive interactions between chimpanzees and villagers. To investigate whether this situation is 'stressful’ for chimpanzees we compared faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGCM) concentrations in chimpanzees within an unprotected agricultural landscape and in a nearby protected forest with minimal disturbance. We further examined if changes in diet quality, including crop consumption (a proxy for chimpanzee–villager interactions) and sexually receptive females influenced glucocorticoid output in the ‘village chimpanzee’ population. Similar to findings from other species, FGCMs levels in the village chimpanzees were substantially higher than in chimpanzees in minimally-disturbed habitat. Within the village chimpanzees, overall fruit intake and number of sexually receptive females had a combined effect on elevating FGCM concentrations, probably through increasing social stress. However, crop consumption correlated negatively with FGCM levels, indicating crop feeding per se did not elevate glucocorticoid secretions (associated with increased interactions with humans), as suggested for some other mammals. Eating nutritionally-dense crops might instead buffer chimpanzees against energetic stress, enabling them to cope with consistent high exposure to anthropogenic stressors through moderating negative effects of glucocorticoids on the immune system. Our findings should nevertheless alert wildlife managers to potential detrimental impacts of human-induced stress on endangered mammals interacting frequently with rural farming communities. Initiatives offering villagers viable livelihood alternatives to deforestation, which increase their capacity to accommodate large mammals like great apes, alongside targeted education outreach, would help promote more peaceful, less 'stressful’ coexistence. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The relative importance of individual and social learning in acquiring complex technological skills in animals is debated, especially the influence of processes allowing high copying fidelity (namely, imitation and teaching). We investigated how immature wild chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes troglodytes, acquired the technique for extracting underground honey. This technique is interesting because (1) adults perform exploration, pounding and perforation in nonrandom but highly flexible action sequences to locate underground bee nests, (2) they have individual preferences for how to perforate the ground and (3) the nests are deeply buried and concealed, making success difficult to achieve. We analysed the behaviour of 16 immatures recorded by camera traps at 50 sites, and tested the influence of individual attributes (namely, age and sex) and maternal behaviour; we also tested whether mothers provided learning opportunities for their offspring. We found that, as they aged, immatures of both sexes progressively matched adults’ behaviour in action sequences and observed their social models more continuously. Immature males used the most common grip type used by adults for perforating (namely, the coordinated use of hands and feet) progressively more as they aged, but no effect of maternal preferences was detected. Thus, the adult technique was probably acquired via a combination of physical maturation (i.e. increased body strength and motor coordination) and observational learning, although individual learning could not be completely ruled out. Finally, the proportion of time mothers spent inactive at bee nest sites was high when they were accompanied by young daughters and decreased as daughters aged, while the opposite pattern was found for sons. Mothers may thus stimulate learning by immatures by adjusting their behaviour according to their offspring's sex and age. Overall, we showed that immature chimpanzees acquired this complex tool use behaviour via a combination of social and nonsocial learning processes, including potential maternal stimulation. © 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ABSTRACT: Human evolutionary success is often argued to be rooted in specialized social skills and motivations that result in more prosocial, rational and cooperative decisions. One manifestation of human ultra-sociality is the tendency to engage in social comparison. While social comparison studies typically focus on cooperative behaviour and emphasize concern for fairness and equality, here we investigate the competitive dimension of social comparison: a preference for getting more than others, expressed in a willingness to maximize relative payoff at the cost of absolute payoff. Chimpanzees and human children (5 - 6- and 9 - 10-year-olds) could decide between an option that maximized their absolute payoff (but put their partner at an advantage) and an option that maximized their relative payoff (but decreased their own and their partner's payoff). Results show that, in contrast to chimpanzees and young children, who consistently selected the rational and payoff-maximizing option, older children paid a cost to reduce their partner's payoff to a level below their own. This finding demonstrates that uniquely human social skills and motivations do not necessarily lead to more prosocial, rational and cooperative decision-making. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Data from a large cross-sectional sample of wild chimpanzee mother-infant dyads yield evidence that young chimpanzees' pant grunting unfolds nonlinearly over the early developmental period. Though infants begin pant grunting early, and mothers' rates did not decrease, infant pant grunting declined as infants aged through infancy. Mother-infant dyadic pant grunting discordance therefore increased over infancy, with some discordance observed at even the earliest ages. In half of 90 observed instances involving infants ranging in age from 2 weeks to 69 months, only one member of the mother-infant dyad pant grunted; infants' pant grunting was not influenced by their mother's age, their position on their mother's body at the time of the greeting, or the dominance status of the male greeted. Male infants were more likely to pant grunt than female infants. We discuss the developmental trend in the context of infants' increasing independence, changing social motivations, and male-dominated social hierarchy. © 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel.

ABSTRACT: Despite anatomical similarities, there are differences in susceptibility to cardiovascular disease (CVD) between primates; humans are prone to myocardial ischemia, while chimpanzees are prone to myocardial fibrosis. Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) allow for direct inter-species comparisons of the gene regulatory response to CVD-relevant perturbations such as oxygen deprivation, a consequence of ischemia. To gain insight into the evolution of disease susceptibility, we characterized gene expression levels in iPSC-CMs in humans and chimpanzees, before and after hypoxia and re-oxygenation. The transcriptional response to hypoxia is generally conserved across species, yet we were able to identify hundreds of speciesspecific regulatory responses including in genes previously associated with CVD. The 1,920 genes that respond to hypoxia in both species are enriched for loss-of-function intolerant genes; but are depleted for expression quantitative trait loci and cardiovascular-related genes. Our results indicate that response to hypoxic stress is highly conserved in humans and chimpanzees. © Ward and Gilad.

ABSTRACT: For social species, recognizing and adequately yet quickly responding to the emotions of others is crucial for their survival. The current study investigates attentional biases toward emotions in two closely related species, humans and chimpanzees. Prior research has demonstrated that humans typically show an attentional bias toward emotions. We here build on that literature by studying the underlying unconscious mechanisms within and across humans and chimpanzees and aim to gain insight into the evolutionary continuity of expressions. Experiment 1 tested whether chimpanzees show an attentional bias toward the expressions of conspecifics and whether this putative bias is modulated by the stimulus presentation duration, being 33 ms or 300 ms. The stimuli were followed by a visual mask in the form of a neutral body image. This backward-masking procedure eliminated the visibility of the stimuli that were presented for 33 ms, rendering their presentation subliminal. In contrast to our prediction, no attentional bias toward emotions was observed in chimpanzees. The goal of Experiment 2 was to verify this finding and to investigate chimpanzees' reaction to human stimuli. Replicating Experiment 1, no evidence of an attentional bias toward emotions was observed in chimpanzees. In Experiment 3 we used the same chimpanzee and human expressions in 711 museum visitors and confirmed that humans do have an attentional bias toward emotions. Interestingly, this bias was independent of the stimulus presentation duration and most strikingly, independent of the species that was observed. Implications for theorizing about species differences in attentional mechanisms in processing emotions are discussed, as well as directions for future research, to investigate our preliminary findings and this potential species difference further. © 2018 American Psychological Association.

ABSTRACT: High dominance status is associated with fitness benefits in many social mammals. Yet, attaining and maintaining a high social status often comes with elevated energetic costs. Dominance rank-related exposure to energetic and psychosocial stressors is predicted to vary depending on the type of breeding system, the means a high rank is acquired and maintained, and the stability of the dominance hierarchy. Using behavioral data and urinary cortisol levels, we investigated whether a high dominance rank is associated with elevated energetic costs in Taï male chimpanzees and whether the relationship between male dominance rank and cortisol levels varies between stable and unstable dominance periods. Additionally, we investigated potential sources of energetic and psychosocial stress linked to competition over dominance status and mating opportunities. We found that higher-ranking males gave more aggressions than lower-ranking males in stable and unstable dominance periods, but that dominance rank and urinary cortisol levels were not associated in either period. Urinary cortisol levels were higher in all males in unstable compared to stable dominance periods, whereas aggression rates showed the reversed pattern, with higher rates in stable periods. Our results indicate that dominance maintenance is not associated with elevated physiological stress for dominant Taï male chimpanzees, and that social instability exposed all males to psychosocial stress, despite lower rates of aggressive interactions. Overall, these findings suggest that male chimpanzees adjust competitive behavior to context dependent conditions, possibly by means of predictability of outcomes of social interactions, and use conflict management strategies, such as avoidance of aggression potentially diminishing the risk of escalation. © 2019 Preis, Samuni, Deschner, Crockford and Wittig.

ABSTRACT: Almost all primates experience seasonal fluctuations in the availability of key food sources. However, the degree to which this fluctuation impacts foraging behavior varies considerably. Eastern chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) in Nyungwe National Park, Rwanda, live in a montane forest environment characterized by lower primary productivity and resource diversity than low-elevation forests. Little is known about chimpanzee feeding ecology in montane forests, and research to date predominantly relies on indirect methods such as fecal analyses. This study is the first to use mostly observational data to examine how seasonal food availability impacts the feeding ecology of montane forest chimpanzees. We examine seasonal changes in chimpanzee diet and fallback foods (FBFs) using instantaneous scan samples and fecal analyses, supported by inspection of feeding remains. Chimpanzee fruit abundance peaked during the major dry season, with a consequent change in chimpanzee diet reflecting the abundance and diversity of key fruit species. Terrestrial herbaceous vegetation was consumed throughout the year and is defined as a “filler” FBF. In contrast to studies conducted in lower-elevation chimpanzee sites, figs (especially Ficus lutea) were preferred resources, flowers were consumed at seasonally high rates and the proportion of non-fig fruits in the diet were relatively low in the current study. These divergences likely result from the comparatively low environmental diversity and productivity in higher-elevation environments. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: There are two questions that may be answered through the study of chimpanzee cognitive development: First, ‘what are the common cognitive traits shared by humans and chimpanzees?' and second, ‘what traits are uniquely human?' Comparative studies have demonstrated similarities between humans and chimpanzees, and also illuminated the fundamental differences. Nonhuman primates climb trees with all four limbs and are well adapted to arboreal life. Nonhuman primate infants cling actively to their mothers; in return, they receive frequent embraces. Mother-infant relationship in these primates, especially simians, is clearly characterized by this clinging-embracing. However, human mothers and their infants are often physically separated from each other. Human infants cannot cling to their mothers. The stability of infants in the supine posture (lying on one’s back on the ground or other surface) is an important but neglected issue related to human posture. Chimpanzee and other nonhuman primate infants are not stable when they are laid on their backs. Human infants are exceptional among primates in this respect; they can assume a stable supine posture and will lie quietly on their back. The stable supine posture gives a firm foundation for face-to-face communication, vocal exchange, and also tool use. This article provides the evolutionary scenario of sociocognitive development that is unique to humans. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Comparative analyses of neuronal phenotypes in closely related species can shed light on neuronal changes occurring during evolution. The study of post-mortem brains of nonhuman primates (NHPs) has been limited and often does not recapitulate important species-specific developmental hallmarks. We utilize induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology to investigate the development of cortical pyramidal neurons following migration and maturation of cells grafted in the developing mouse cortex. Our results show differential migration patterns in human neural progenitor cells compared to those of chimpanzees and bonobos both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting heterochronic changes in human neurons. The strategy proposed here lays the groundwork for further comparative analyses between humans and NHPs and opens new avenues for understanding the differences in the neural underpinnings of cognition and neurological disease susceptibility between species. © Marchetto et al.

ABSTRACT: Cooperative hunting and meat sharing are hypothesized as fundamental to human life history adaptations and biological success. Wild chimpanzees also hunt in groups, and despite the potential of inferring ancestral hominid adaptations, it remains unclear whether chimpanzee hunting is a cooperative act. Here we show support for cooperative acquisition in wild chimpanzees since hunters are more likely to receive meat than bystanders, independent of begging effort. Engagement in prey searches and higher hunt participation independently increase hunting success, suggesting that coordination may improve motivation in joint tasks. We also find higher levels of urinary oxytocin after hunts and prey searches compared with controls. We conclude that chimpanzee hunting is cooperative, likely facilitated by behavioral and neuroendocrine mechanisms of coordination and reward. If group hunting has shaped humans’ life history traits, perhaps similar pressures acted upon life history patterns in the last common ancestor of human and chimpanzee. © 2018, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (Pan paniscus) are both our evolutionary closest living relatives. Human and Pan lineages diverged around 7 million years ago, and the chimpanzee and the bonobo branched 1–2 million years ago. Accordingly, the two species have a lot of similarities in their appearance, behavior, and societies; however, research highlights some striking differences between these close sister species. There are a number of traits in which bonobos and chimpanzees are more similar to humans than they are each other have been recognized recently. This comparison provides an extremely powerful test of ideas about human uniqueness. Given that both species are equally related to us, balanced insights are needed from both chimpanzees and bonobos in order to understand the selective pressures which may have shaped the human mind. Here we concisely review their evolution, society, and cognition, and suggest its implication for the evolutionary processes by which cognitive traits evolve in apes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: We present the case of Ruby, a 21-year-old hand-reared chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) who had an obstetric history significant for a premature stillborn infant that was conceived while on oral contraceptive pills, followed by a full term healthy delivery complicated by neonatal demise attributed to inappropriate maternal care. She was recommended for permanent sterilization due to her history of conception while on oral contraceptives. She underwent uncomplicated laparoscopic bilateral tubal ligation. Due to the similar anatomy to humans, human OB/GYN surgical consultants were used. The objective of this case report is to describe a modern technique for approaching and employing laparoscopic surgery in primates. Minimally invasive surgery allows for faster recovery and fewer complications, and has become the preferred approach for surgical intervention in many animals. The information presented in this case report can be expanded to benefit not only Chimpanzees but other large primate species as well. However, subtle anatomical differences among species must be recognized in order to be carried out safely. © 2019 Laura K. Newcomb et al.

ABSTRACT: Habitat fragmentation is a leading threat to global biodiversity. Dispersal plays a key role in gene flow and population viability, but the impact of fragmentation on dispersal patterns remains poorly understood. Among chimpanzees, males typically remain in their natal communities while females often disperse. However, habitat loss and fragmentation may cause severe ecological disruptions, potentially resulting in decreased fitness benefits of male philopatry and limited female dispersal ability. To investigate this issue, we genotyped nearly 900 non-invasively collected chimpanzee fecal samples across a fragmented forest habitat that may function as a corridor between two large continuous forests in Uganda, and used the spatial associations among co-sampled genotypes to attribute a total of 229 individuals to 10 distinct communities, including 9 communities in the corridor habitat and 1 in continuous forest. We then used parentage analyses to infer instances of between-community dispersal. Of the 115 parent–offspring dyads detected with confidence, members of 39% (N = 26) of mother–daughter dyads were found in different communities, while members of 10% (N = 5) of father–son dyads were found in different communities. We also found direct evidence for one dispersal event that occurred during the study period, as a female's sample found first in one community was found multiple times in another community 19 months later. These findings suggest that even in fragmented habitats, chimpanzee males remain in their natal communities while females tend to disperse. Corridor enhancement in unprotected forest fragments could help maintain gene flow in chimpanzees and other species amid anthropogenic pressures. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Voluntary participation in behavioural studies offers several scientific, management, and welfare benefits to non-human primates (NHPs). Aside from the scientific benefit of increased understanding of NHP cognition, sociality, and behaviour derived from noninvasive behavioural studies, participation itself has the potential to provide functional simulations of natural behaviours, enrichment opportunities, and increased control over the captive environment, all of which enhance welfare. Despite a developing consensus that voluntary participation offers these welfare enhancements, little research has empirically investigated the ways that participation in behavioural studies may affect welfare. In the current study, we investigated potential relationships between captive chimpanzee welfare and long-term, repeated voluntary participation in noninvasive behavioural studies. We collected behavioural data on 118 chimpanzees at the National Center for Chimpanzee Care (NCCC) in Bastrop, Texas, USA between 2016 and 2018 using 15-minute focal animal samples. Additionally, we collected information on 41 behavioural studies conducted between 2010 and 2018 with the NCCC chimpanzees that involved exposure to a stimulus or manipulation. The total number of behavioural studies in which chimpanzees had participated over the approximately eight-year period was then examined in relation to levels of behavioural diversity, abnormal behaviour, rough scratching, inactivity, and locomotion using a series of regression analyses that controlled for rearing status and age of the chimpanzee at the time of data collection. Analyses revealed significant, positive relationships between the total number of studies in which chimpanzees participated and 1) behavioural diversity scores, R2 adj = 0.21, F(3,114) = 11.25, p < 0.001; and 2) rough scratching, R2 adj =0.11, F(3,114) = 6.01, p = 0.001. The positive relationship between behavioural diversity scores and the total number of studies in which chimpanzees participated seems unsurprising, although we cannot draw conclusions about the directionality of this relationship. The result that rough scratching and the total number of studies in which chimpanzees participated were positively correlated is unexpected. However, rough scratching made up less than 1% of all activity in the current study, and as such, this result may not be biologically meaningful. These findings suggest that participation in behavioural studies is not likely to be detrimental to chimpanzee well-being, and may even be beneficial. Data such as these, which empirically investigate existing recommendations can help inform decisions pertaining to the participation of chimpanzees in behavioural research. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: When humans plan for the future, we recognize not only that one particular event may occur, but that the future can have different, mutually exclusive possible outcomes. A recent study by Suddendorf et al. (Suddendorf 2017 Biol. Lett. 13, 20170170 (doi:10.1098/rsbl.2017.0170)) suggests that young children (less than 3 years) and apes lack this capacity, as demonstrated by their failure to cover each of two tube openings to ensure catching an object that would drop randomly from one of the tubes. Before drawing conclusions based on these negative results, however, it is important to assess subjects' failures and test the reliability of the task itself. To explore whether the apes' performance resulted from an inability to represent mutually exclusive futures or from extraneous factors related to the task, we replicated the methods of Suddendorf et al. (Suddendorf 2017 Biol. Lett. 13, 20170170 (doi:10.1098/rsbl.2017.0170)) with a group of six chimpanzees but included a key control condition in which subjects were expected to cover both tubes on every trial (i.e. the rewards would consistently emerge from both tubes). We show that even in this straightforward condition in which the outcome of the trial was known, only four of the six subjects ever covered both tubes, typically doing so after a minimum of 17 trials, and often reverting back to covering one tube on later trials. We conclude that this task is not valid for testing the ability to represent mutually exclusive futures. We discuss what potential factors may explain the results and outline a new suggested method to continue testing for this capacity in the future. © 2018 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Cumulative culture is rare, if not altogether absent in nonhuman species. At the foundation of cumulative learning is the ability to modify, relinquish, or build upon previous behaviors flexibly to make them more productive or efficient. Within the primate literature, a failure to optimize solutions in this way is often proposed to derive from low-fidelity copying of witnessed behaviors, suboptimal social learning heuristics, or a lack of relevant sociocognitive adaptations. However, humans can also be markedly inflexible in their behaviors, perseverating with, or becoming fixated on, outdated or inappropriate responses. Humans show differential patterns of flexibility as a function of cognitive load, exhibiting difficulties with inhibiting suboptimal behaviors when there are high demands on working memory. We present a series of studies on captive chimpanzees that indicate that behavioral conservatism in apes may be underlain by similar constraints: Chimpanzees showed relatively little conservatism when behavioral optimization involved the inhibition of a well-established but simple solution, or the addition of a simple modification to a well-established but complex solution. In contrast, when behavioral optimization involved the inhibition of a well-established but complex solution, chimpanzees showed evidence of conservatism. We propose that conservatism is linked to behavioral complexity, potentially mediated by cognitive resource availability, and may be an important factor in the evolution of cumulative culture. © 2018 American Psychological Association.

ABSTRACT: Primates were traditionally thought to have a reduced sense of smell. Although there is now evidence that olfaction plays a greater role in primate social life than previously assumed, research on the sense of smell in non-human apes is scarce. Chimpanzees sniff the ground and vegetation on boundary patrols, but the function of this behaviour is unclear. Since chimpanzees are highly territorial and can kill individuals that do not belong to their own community, sniffing might function to gather information about conspecifics, particularly concerning group membership and kinship. To investigate whether chimpanzees recognize group members and kin via olfactory cues, we conducted behavioural bioassays on two groups of chimpanzees at Leipzig Zoo. In a pilot study, we found that chimpanzees responded more strongly to urine than to faeces or body odour. We then presented urine from group members, outgroup individuals and an unscented control in aerated boxes using a simultaneous discrimination task. The first behaviour after a chimpanzee first approached a box was related to olfaction (sniffing, nose within 20 cm, licking) in 83% of cases, highlighting the importance of olfaction as a general investigation mechanism in this species. Chimpanzees sniffed significantly longer at urine stimuli than the control and significantly longer at odours from outgroup individuals than those from group members. Furthermore, the duration of sniffing was positively correlated with relatedness. Our results suggest that chimpanzees use olfactory cues to obtain information about social relationships and fill a gap in our understanding of primate chemical communication. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Natural killer (NK) cells are primary immune effector cells with both innate and potentially adaptive functions against viral infections, but commonly become exhausted or dysfunctional during chronic diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Chimpanzees are the closest genetic relatives of humans and have been previously used in immunology, behavior and disease models. Due to their similarities to humans, a better understanding of chimpanzee immunology, particularly innate immune cells, can lend insight into the evolution of human immunology, as well as response to disease. However, the phenotype of NK cells has been poorly defined. In order to define NK cell phenotypes, we unbiasedly quantified NK cell markers among mononuclear cells in both naive and HIV-infected chimpanzees by flow cytometry. We identified NKG2D and NKp46 as the most dominant stable NK cells markers using multidimensional data reduction analyses. Other traditional NK cell markers such as CD8α, CD16 and perforin fluctuated during infection, while some such as CD56, NKG2A and NKp30 were generally unaltered by HIV infection, but did not delineate the full NK cell repertoire. Taken together, these data indicate that phenotypic dysregulation may not be pronounced during HIV infection of chimpanzees, but traditional NK cell phenotyping used for both humans and other non-human primate species may need to be revised to accurately identify chimpanzee NK cells. © The Japanese Society for Immunology. 2018.

ABSTRACT: Because of their close evolutionary relationship to humans, chimpanzees generate considerable interest in the scientific and lay communities alike. In this contribution, I summarize the recent findings derived from long-term research on the behavior of wild chimpanzees. After outlining selected aspects of the natural history of chimpanzees, including their ecology, social organization, and life history, I review our current understanding of two major aspects of chimpanzee behavior: female competition and male cooperation. This review indicates that female chimpanzees compete for food, space, and reproduction, while male chimpanzees cooperate in several contexts, involving coalitions, meat sharing, and group territoriality. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The previous studies have shown that human infants and domestic dogs follow the gaze of a human agent only when the agent has addressed them ostensively—e.g., by making eye contact, or calling their name. This evidence is interpreted as showing that they expect ostensive signals to precede referential information. The present study tested chimpanzees, one of the closest relatives to humans, in a series of eye-tracking experiments using an experimental design adapted from these previous studies. In the ostension conditions, a human actor made eye contact, called the participant’s name, and then looked at one of two objects. In the control conditions, a salient cue, which differed in each experiment (a colorful object, the actor’s nodding, or an eating action), attracted participants’ attention to the actor’s face, and then the actor looked at the object. Overall, chimpanzees followed the actor’s gaze to the cued object in both ostension and control conditions, and the ostensive signals did not enhance gaze following more than the control attention-getters. However, the ostensive signals enhanced subsequent attention to both target and distractor objects (but not to the actor’s face) more strongly than the control attention-getters—especially in the chimpanzees who had a close relationship with human caregivers. We interpret this as showing that chimpanzees have a simple form of communicative expectations on the basis of ostensive signals, but unlike human infants and dogs, they do not subsequently use the experimenter’s gaze to infer the intended referent. These results may reflect a limitation of non-domesticated species for interpreting humans’ ostensive signals in inter-species communication. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Why share when access to benefits is uncertain is crucial to our understanding of the evolution of humans' extensive cooperation. Here, we investigated some of the different human sharing hypotheses and potential neuroendocrine mechanisms, in one of our closest living relatives, chimpanzees. The strongest predictor of sharing across food types was the presence of enduring and mutually preferred grooming partners, more than harassment, direct signalling, or trade. Moreover, urinary oxytocin levels were higher after the sharing of both individually and jointly acquired resources compared with controls. We conclude that the emotional connection inherent in social bonds was a key factor determining sharing patterns, with the oxytocinergic system potentially facilitating long-term cooperative exchanges. Testing for the role of social bonds in increasing predictability of sharing behaviour, a feature frequently overlooked, may help us to identify the evolutionary drivers of resource sharing and mechanisms that sustain delayed reciprocity between non-kin. © 2018 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The inertial properties of body segments reflect performance and locomotor habits in primates. While Pan paniscus is generally described as more gracile, lighter in body mass, and as having relatively longer and heavier hindlimbs than Pan troglodytes, both species exhibit very similar patterns of (quadrupedal and bipedal) kinematics, but show slightly different locomotor repertoires. We used a geometric model to estimate the inertial properties for all body segments (i.e. head, trunk, upper and lower arms, hand, thigh, shank and foot) using external length and diameter measurements of 12 anaesthetized bonobos (eight adults and four immatures). We also calculated whole limb inertial properties. When we compared absolute and relative segment morphometric and inertial variables between bonobos and chimpanzees, we found that adult bonobos are significantly lighter than adult chimpanzees. The bonobo is also shorter in head length, upper and lower arm lengths, and foot length, and is generally lighter in most absolute segment mass values (except head and hand). In contrast, the bonobo has a longer trunk. When scaled relative to body mass, most differences disappear between the two species. Only the longer trunk and the shorter head of the bonobo remain apparent, as well as the lighter thigh compared with the chimpanzee. We found similar values of natural pendular periods of the limbs in both species, despite differences in absolute limb lengths, masses, mass centres (for the hindlimb) and moments of inertia. While our data contradict the commonly accepted view that bonobos have relatively longer and heavier hindlimbs than chimpanzees, they are consistent with the observed similarities in the quadrupedal and bipedal kinematics between these species. The morphological differences between both species are more subtle than those previously described from postcranial osteological materials. © 2018 Anatomical Society

ABSTRACT: Human parvovirus 4 (PARV4, family Parvoviridae, genus Tetraparvovirus) displays puzzling features, such as uncertain clinical importance/significance, unclear routes of transmission, and discontinuous geographical distribution. The origin, or the general reservoir, of human PARV4 infection is unknown. We aimed to detect and characterize PARV4 virus in faecal samples collected from two wild chimpanzee populations and 19 species of captive non-human primates. We aimed to investigate these species as a potential reservoir and alternate route of transmission on the African continent. From almost 500 samples screened, a single wild Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii sample tested positive. Full genome analysis, as well as single ORF phylogenies, confirmed species-specific PARV4 infection. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Background: Understanding the relationship between great apes and their habitat is essential for the development of successful conservation strategies. The chimpanzee Pan troglodytes ellioti is endemic to Nigeria and Cameroon, and occupies an ecologically diverse range of habitats from forests to forest-savannah mosaic in Mbam-Djerem National Park (MDNP) in Cameroon. The habitat variation in chimpanzees is poorly understood in MDNP which provides an excellent opportunity to assess ecological factors that shape the abundance and distribution patterns of P. t. ellioti over a small geographic scale. Results: We counted 249 nests along 132km of transects in total. Of these, 119 nests along 68km occurred in dense forest and 130 nests along 64km in forest-savannah mosaic. Chimpanzee density was 0.88 [95% CI (0.55-1.41)] individuals/km2 in the dense forest and 0.59 [95% CI (0.19-1.76)] in the forest-savannah mosaic. Nest abundance varied with vegetation type and was higher in areas with dense canopy cover, steeper slopes and relatively higher altitudes. Conclusions: Our estimates of chimpanzee densities were lower than reported in other studied populations in the range of the Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee. However, we found that habitat features, slope and altitude likely play a role in shaping patterns of chimpanzee nesting ecology. Further studies need to be focused on nest decay rates and phenology of useful plants in order to model chimpanzee abundance and distribution in Mbam-Djerem National Park. © 2018 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Biomechanical analyses of arboreal locomotion in great apes in their natural environment are scarce and thus attempts to correlate behavioral and habitat differences with variations in morphology are limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the gait characteristics of vertical climbing in mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in a natural environment to assess differences in the climbing styles that may relate to variation in body size. We investigated temporal variables (i.e., cycle duration, duty factors, and stride frequency) and footfall sequences (i.e., diagonal vs. lateral sequence gaits) during vertical climbing (both ascent and descent) in 11 wild mountain gorillas and compared these data to those of eight semi-free-ranging chimpanzees, using video records ad libitum. Comparisons of temporal gait parameters revealed that large-bodied mountain gorillas exhibited a longer cycle duration, lower stride frequency and generally a higher duty factor than small-bodied chimpanzees. While both apes were similarly versatile in their vertical climbing performance in the natural environment, mountain gorillas most often engaged in diagonal sequence/diagonal couplet gaits and chimpanzees most often used lateral sequence/diagonal couplet gaits. This study revealed that mountain gorillas adapt their climbing strategy to accommodate their large body mass in a similar manner previously found in captive western lowland gorillas, and that chimpanzees are less variable in their climbing strategy than has been documented in captive bonobos. © 2018 The Zoological Society of London

ABSTRACT: Objective: This study was aimed to test the PowerPlex® 21 System (Promega, USA), used for human identification applications for its positive cross-species applicability in Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in order to identify heterologous STRs which can be used for individual identification, paternity testing, relatedness establishment and reconstruction of pedigrees and studbook records for captive and wild chimpanzee breeding populations. Results: Of 21 STRs in PowerPlex® 21 System (Promega, USA), 19 loci amplified and found to be polymorphic. Locus Aml showed differential banding patterns in males and females similar to those seen for humans and correctly assigned sexes of known identity. Altogether, 58 different alleles were found with an average 3.05 ± 0.28 alleles per locus. Mean observed (Ho), and expected heterozygosity (He) were 0.93 ± 0.03 and 0.52 ± 0.05, respectively. © 2018 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Archaeological recovery of chimpanzee Panda oleosa nut cracking tools at the Panda 100 (P100) and Noulo sites in the Taï Forest, Côte d'Ivoire, showed that this behavior is over 4000 years old, making it the oldest known evidence of non-human tool use. In 2002, the first report on the lithic material from P100 was directly compared to early hominin stone tools, highlighting their similarities and proposing the name ‘Pandan’ for the chimpanzee material. Here we present an expanded and comprehensive technological, microscopic, and refit analysis of the late twentieth century lithic assemblage from P100. Our re-analysis provides new data and perspectives on the applicability of chimpanzee nut cracking tools to our understanding of the percussive behaviors of early hominins. We identify several new refit sets, including the longest (>17 m) hammerstone transport seen in the chimpanzee archaeological record. We provide detailed evidence of the fragmentation sequences of Panda nut hammerstones, and characterize the percussive damage on fragmented material from P100. Finally, we emphasize that the chimpanzee lithic archaeological record is dynamic, with the preservation of actual hammerstones being rare, and the preservation of small broken pieces more common. P100 – the first archaeological chimpanzee nut cracking lithic assemblage – provides a valuable comparative sample by which to identify past chimpanzee behavior elsewhere, as well as similar hominin percussive behavior in the Early Stone Age. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: There are two questions that may be answered through the study of chimpanzee cognitive development: First, ‘what are the common cognitive traits shared by humans and chimpanzees?’ and second, ‘what traits are uniquely human?’ Comparative studies have demonstrated similarities between humans and chimpanzees, and also illuminated the fundamental differences. Nonhuman primates climb trees with all four limbs and are well adapted to arboreal life. Nonhuman primate infants cling actively to their mothers; in return, they receive frequent embraces. Mother–infant relationship in these primates, especially simians, is clearly characterized by this clinging–embracing. However, human mothers and their infants are often physically separated from each other. Human infants cannot cling to their mothers. The stability of infants in the supine posture (lying on one’s back on the ground or other surface) is an important but neglected issue related to human posture. Chimpanzee and other nonhuman primate infants are not stable when they are laid on their backs. Human infants are exceptional among primates in this respect; they can assume a stable supine posture and will lie quietly on their back. The stable supine posture gives a firm foundation for face-to-face communication, vocal exchange, and also tool use. This article provides the evolutionary scenario of sociocognitive development that is unique to humans. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Abstract Male dominance hierarchies occur in many group-living primates and some non-primate mammals. Variation in aspects of agonistic relationships such as how many dyads show bidirectionality in aggression leads to variation in dominance hierarchies along a continuum from egalitarian (relatively small agonistic power differences between adjacently-ranked individuals, shallow hierarchies) to despotic (relatively large differences, steep hierarchies). Ranks usually depend mostly or entirely on individual characteristics that influence fighting ability (e.g., body size) and show inverse-U shaped relationships to age. However, coalitionary support sometimes also influences ranks. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) form multi-male, multi-female communities within which males compete for status. Males typically form dominance hierarchies, and data from multiple study show that rank is positively related to paternity success. Males also often form coalitions and some dyads form long-term alliances. Effective coalitionary support can help individuals improve and maintain their ranks, and some evidence supports the hypothesis that coalitionary aggression generally, and the positions that males hold in coalitions networks specifically, influences paternity success. Hierarchy steepness varies among communities and within communities over time; variation in the number of prime-aged males per community is a likely source of this variation. Long-term data from an extremely large chimpanzee community with unusually many males, at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda, are largely consistent with previous analyses of male chimpanzee dominance hierarchies, but show several notable contrasts. Males at Ngogo formed significantly linear hierarchies and hierarchy steepness was greater than expected if the outcomes of agonistic interactions were random. However, variation in steepness did not show the significant inverse relationship to the number of "prime-aged" males documented for other chimpanzee communities and average steepness was high given the large number of males. Ranks showed an inverse-U shaped relationship to age, although individual rank trajectories varied considerably, but males attained their highest lifetime ranks at later ages and maintained relatively high ranks to later ages than those at other chimpanzee research sites. Two measures of coalition networks, strength and Bonacich power, showed significant positive relationships with male ranks. Strength is the rate at which males joined coalitions. Bonacich power is a measure of network centrality that assesses a male's relational power, or influence (Bonacich, 1987): a male with high Bonacich power formed coalitions with relatively many other males who were also central in the coalition network, i.e., he was strongly connected to powerful others. On average, males also attained maximum values for these and other network measures relatively late and maintained relatively high values to relatively late ages. High coalition network strength, Bonacich power, and eigenvector centrality early in adulthood were associated with high peak ranks at later ages. However, the direction of causality between participation in coalition networks and ranks is not yet clear, and the effects of body size on dominance ranks and individual rank trajectories remains to be explored. Ngogo is a favourable habitat for chimpanzees and survivorship there is unusually high; this presumably facilitates the ability of males to maintain high competitive ability longer than at other sites and shifts rank trajectories toward older ages and leads to relatively steep hierarchies despite the fact that many male dyads have similar competitive ability. Future work will assess the impact of coalitions on dominance relationships in more detail and the relationship of coalitionary aggression to paternity success.

ABSTRACT: With continued expansion of anthropogenically modified landscapes, the proximity between humans and wildlife is continuing to increase, frequently resulting in species decline. Occasionally however, species are able to persist and there is an increased interest in understanding such positive outliers and underlying mechanisms. Eventually, such insights can inform the design of effective conservation interventions by mimicking aspects of the social-ecological conditions found in areas of species persistence. Recently, frameworks have been developed to study the heterogeneity of species persistence across populations with a focus on positive outliers. Applications are still rare, and to our knowledge this is one of the first studies using this approach for terrestrial species conservation. We applied the positive deviance concept to the western chimpanzee, which occurs in a variety of social-ecological landscapes. It is now categorized as Critically Endangered due to hunting and habitat loss and resulting excessive decline of most of its populations. Here we are interested in understanding why some of the populations did not decline. We compiled a dataset of 17,109 chimpanzee survey transects (10,929 km) across nine countries and linked them to a range of social and ecological variables. We found that chimpanzees seemed to persist within three social-ecological configurations: first, rainforest habitats with a low degree of human impact, second, steep areas, and third, areas with high prevalence of hunting taboos and low degree of human impact. The largest chimpanzee populations are nowadays found under the third social-ecological configuration, even though most of these areas are not officially protected. Most commonly chimpanzee conservation has been based on exclusion of threats by creation of protected areas and law enforcement. Our findings suggest, however, that this approach should be complemented by an additional focus on threat reduction, i.e., interventions that directly target individual human behavior that is most threatening to chimpanzees, which is hunting. Although changing human behavior is difficult, stakeholder co-designed behavioral change approaches developed in the social sciences have been used successfully to promote pro-environmental behavior. With only a fraction of chimpanzees and primates living inside protected areas, such new approaches might be a way forward to improve primate conservation. © 2019 Heinicke, Mundry, Boesch, Amarasekaran, Barrie, Brncic, Brugière, Campbell, Carvalho, Danquah, Dowd, Eshuis, Fleury-Brugière, Gamys, Ganas, Gatti, Ginn, Goedmakers, Granier, Herbinger, Hillers, Jones, Junker, Kouakou, Lapeyre, Leinert, Marrocoli, Molokwu-Odozi, N'Goran, Normand, Pacheco, Regnaut, Sop, Ton, van Schijndel, Vendras, Vergnes, Welsh, Wessling and Kühl.

ABSTRACT: Long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) is one of the most abundant retrotransposons in the primate genomes and has contributed to their genome diversity and variations during the primate evolution. Among primate L1 subfamilies, L1Pt subfamilies include Pan troglodytes-specific L1s. L1Pt elements have been successfully expanded in the chimpanzee genome since the divergence of human and chimpanzee lineages. However, only a few full-length L1Pt copies were previously detected in the chimpanzee genome due to incomplete chimpanzee reference genome sequences at the time. In the present study, we aimed to identify chimpanzee-specific L1s using the most recent version of the chimpanzee reference genome (May 2016, panTro5). We identified a total of 3731 chimpanzee-specific L1s. This is much more than previously reported chimpanzee-specific L1 copies. Among these, 223 are full-length (>6 kb), and we annotated their subfamilies and examined their retrotransposition-competency. The result showed that there are two L1Pt subfamilies in the chimpanzee genome, and the nine structurally intact elements belong to L1Pt-1, L1Pt-2, and L1PA2 subfamilies. In addition, we found that the intact full-length L1 group showed significantly higher L1 expression level than the non-intact full-length L1 group using limited RNA-seq data. It is interesting to notice that the number of retrotransposition-competent elements is much less in the chimpanzee genome than that in the human genome. In conclusion, there is increasing evidence to indicate that chimpanzee-specific L1s have changed the chimpanzee genome, causing genomic difference from other primate genomes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Cooperation often comes with the temptation to defect and benefit at the cost of others. This tension between cooperation and defection is best captured in social dilemmas like the Prisoner's Dilemma. Adult humans have specific strategies to maintain cooperation during Prisoner's Dilemma interactions. Yet, little is known about the ontogenetic and phylogenetic origins of human decision-making strategies in conflict scenarios. To shed light on this question, we compared the strategies used by chimpanzees and 5-year old children to overcome a social dilemma. In our task, waiting for the partner to act first produced the best results for the subject. Alternatively, they could mutually cooperate and divide the rewards. Our findings indicate that the two species differed substantially in their strategies to solve the task. Chimpanzees became more strategic across the study period by waiting longer to act in the social dilemma. Children developed a more efficient strategy of taking turns to reciprocate their rewards. Moreover, children used specific types of communication to coordinate with their partners. These results suggest that while both species behaved strategically to overcome a conflict situation, only children engaged in active cooperation to solve a social dilemma. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Despite similar dispersal patterns, models of Pan sociality emphasize sex differences in social bonding between the two species. Such disparities are attributed to hypothesized differences in environmental selective pressures that structure association patterns. However, recent research documents greater within-species variation in social bonds in both species. Here, we examine grooming networks in captive chimpanzees at the North Carolina Zoo, and captive bonobos at the Columbus Zoo. We hypothesized that male–female grooming relationships would be the strongest in both species, but that males and females of both species would not significantly differ between centrality, strength, or clustering. Via Mantel tests, we found that neither bonobos (t = − 0.070, r = − 0.009, two-tailed p = 0.942) nor chimpanzees (t = − 0.495, r = − 0.0939, two-tailed p = 0.6205) had significant differences in grooming between or within sexes. Neither species had significant sex differences in centrality, strength, or clustering. To account for idiosyncratic factors affecting grooming distribution, we examined the effect of origin, kinship, and group tenure on social network position. We found that wild-born bonobos exhibited greater eigenvector centrality (t = − 2.592, df = 9, p = 0.29) and strength (t = − 2.401; df = 9, p = 0.040), and group tenure was significantly correlated with strength (r = 0.608; N = 11, p − 0 = 0.47). None of these factors varied with social network position in chimpanzees. Our findings suggest that in captive settings, idiosyncratic factors related to individual history play a greater role in structuring social networks. Such variation may point to the behavioral flexibility inherent in fission–fusion networks, and mirror between-site variation found in wild chimpanzees. However, some idiosyncratic factors shaping captive networks may be an artifact of captivity. © 2018, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: This study was designed to investigate the foraging behavior of zoo-housed western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and compare it with that of zoo-housed chimpanzees (Pan trogloydytes) tested previously in a similar paradigm. Specifically, we aimed to document how a group of zoo-housed gorillas foraged within a familiar environment to discover novel food sources and whether they sought out more preferred foods, even if they had to travel further to reach them, as they do in the wild. Gorillas were provided plastic tokens to exchange with researchers at two locations—at the same location as the tokens (close) for carrot pieces and another 6.5 m away (far) for grapes. Over the course of 30 sessions, a single individual—the silverback male—accounted for 96% of the 1546 tokens exchanged, all of which took place at the far location. Inter-individual distance measures collected during each session, as well as during matched control sessions, showed that while both gorillas and chimpanzees express similar patterns of social association across the two conditions, the average dyadic association for chimpanzees was stronger than that for gorillas. Together, these findings provide an example of the value of employing identical methodologies to compare cognition and behavior across species as well highlight the importance of the social context in which studies take place. © 2019, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The recently identified Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes severe and fatal acute respiratory illness in humans. However, no approved prophylactic and therapeutic interventions are currently available. The MERS-CoV envelope spike protein serves as a crucial target for neutralizing antibodies and vaccine development, as it plays a critical role in mediating viral entry through interactions with the cellular receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). Here, we constructed a recombinant rare serotype of the chimpanzee adenovirus 68 (AdC68) that expresses full-length MERS-CoV S protein (AdC68-S). Single intranasal immunization with AdC68-S induced robust and sustained neutralizing antibody and T cell responses in BALB/c mice. In a human DPP4 knock-in (hDPP4-KI) mouse model, it completely protected against lethal challenge with a mouse-adapted MERS-CoV (MERS-CoV-MA). Passive transfer of immune sera to naïve hDPP4-KI mice also provided survival advantages from lethal MERS-CoV-MA challenge. Analysis of sera absorption and isolated monoclonal antibodies from immunized mice demonstrated that the potent and broad neutralizing activity was largely attributed to antibodies targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein. These results show that AdC68-S can induce protective immune responses in mice and represent a promising candidate for further development against MERS-CoV infection in both dromedaries and humans. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: Throughout life, physiological homeostasis is challenged and the capacity to cope with such challenges declines with increasing age. In many species, sex differences exist in life expectancy. Sex-specific differences have been related to extrinsic factors like mate competition and/or intrinsic proximate mechanisms such as hormonal changes. In humans, an intrinsic factor related to aging is soluble alpha klotho (α-Kl). Both sexes show an age-related decline in α-Kl, but throughout life women have higher levels than men of the same age. Sex differences in α-Kl have been linked to a shorter lifespan, as well as to specific morbidity factors such as atherosclerosis and arteries calcifications. In non-human animals, information on α-Kl levels is rare and restricted to experimental work. Our cross-sectional study is the first on α-Kl levels in two long-lived species: bonobos (Pan paniscus) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). As in most mammals, female bonobos and chimpanzees have longer life expectancy than males. Methods: We measured serum α-Kl levels of 140 subjects from 16 zoos with an ELISA to examine if α-Kl levels reflect this difference in life expectancy. Results: In both species and in both sexes, α-Kl levels declined with age suggesting that this marker has potential for aging studies beyond humans. We also found species-specific differences. Adult female bonobos had higher α-Kl levels than males, a difference that corresponds to the pattern found in humans. In chimpanzees, we found the opposite: males had higher α-Kl levels than females. Conclusion: We suggest that contrasting sex differences in adult α-Kl levels mirror the dominance relations between females and males of the two Pan species; and that this might be related to corresponding sex differences in their exposure to stress. In humans, higher cortisol levels were found to be related to lower α-Kl levels. We conclude that there is great potential for studying aging processes in hominoids, and perhaps also in other non-human primates, by measuring α-Kl levels. To better understand the causes for sex differences in this aging marker, consideration of behavioural parameters such as competition and stress exposure will be required as well as other physiological markers. © 2018 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: APOBEC3H (A3H) is a mammal-specific cytidine deaminase that potently restricts the replication of retroviruses. Primate A3Hs are known to exert key selective pressures against the cross-species transmission of primate immunodeficiency viruses from chimpanzees to humans. Despite recent advances, the molecular structures underlying the functional mechanisms of primate A3Hs have not been fully understood. Here, we reveal the 2.20-Å crystal structure of the chimpanzee A3H (cpzA3H) dimer bound to a short double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which appears to be similar to two recently reported structures of pig-tailed macaque A3H and human A3H. In the structure, the dsRNA-binding interface forms a specialized architecture with unique features. The analysis of the dsRNA nucleotides in the cpzA3H complex revealed the GC-rich palindrome-like sequence preference for dsRNA interaction, which is largely determined by arginine residues in loop 1. In cells, alterations of the cpzA3H residues critical for the dsRNA interaction severely reduce intracellular protein stability due to proteasomal degradation. This suggests that cpzA3H stability is regulated by the dsRNA-mediated dimerization as well as by unknown cellular machinery through proteasomal degradation in cells. Taken together, these findings highlight unique structural features of primate A3Hs that are important to further understand their cellular functions and regulation. © The Author(s) 2018.

ABSTRACT: Life history strategies for optimizing individual fitness fall on a spectrum between maximizing reproductive efforts and maintaining physical health over time. Strategies across this spectrum are viable and different suites of personality traits evolved to support these strategies. Using data from 538 captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) we tested whether any of the dimensions of chimpanzee personality – agreeableness, conscientiousness, dominance, extraversion, neuroticism, and openness – were associated with longevity, an attribute of slow life history strategies that is especially important in primates given their relatively long lives. We found that higher agreeableness was related to longevity in males, with weaker evidence suggesting that higher openness is related to longer life in females. Our results link the literature on human and nonhuman primate survival and suggest that, for males, evolution has favored the protective effects of low aggression and high quality social bonds. © Altschul et al.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: The extension of distance sampling methods to accommodate observations from camera traps has recently enhanced the potential to remotely monitor multiple species without the need of additional data collection (sign production and decay rates) or individual identification. However, the method requires that the proportion of time is quantifiable when animals can be detected by the cameras. This can be problematic, for instance, when animals spend time above the ground, which is the case for most primates. In this study, we aimed to validate camera trap distance sampling (CTDS) for the semiarboreal western chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) in Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire by estimating abundance of a population of known size and comparing estimates to those from other commonly applied methods. We estimated chimpanzee abundance using CTDS and accounted for limited availability for detection (semiarboreal). We evaluated bias and precision of estimates, as well as costs and efforts required to obtain them, and compared them to those from spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) and line transect nest surveys. Abundance estimates obtained by CTDS and SECR produced a similar negligible bias, but CTDS yielded a larger coefficient of variation (CV = 39.70% for CTDS vs. 1%/19% for SECR). Line transects generated the most biased abundance estimates but yielded a better coefficient of variation (27.40–27.85%) than CTDS. Camera trap surveys were twice more costly than line transects because of the initial cost of cameras, while line transects surveys required more than twice as much time in the field. This study demonstrates the potential to obtain unbiased estimates of the abundance of semiarboreal species like chimpanzees by CTDS. HIGHLIGHTS: Camera trap distance sampling produced accurate density estimates for semiarboreal chimpanzees. Availability for detection must be accounted for and can be derived from the activity pattern. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The question of ‘if and how captive primates are affected by visitors’ has gained increasing attention over the last decades. Although the majority reported undesirable effects on behavior and wellbeing, many studies reported contradicting results. Most of these studies were conducted at zoos, typically with little or no control over visitors’ actions. Yet little is known about the impact under very controlled visitor conditions. In order to fill this gap, we conducted this study at a primate sanctuary which allows public access only via a guided visit under strict supervision. We observed 14 chimpanzees, recording their behavior during, after and in the absence of guided visits over a 10-month period. Furthermore, we categorized the visitors regarding group size and composition to see if certain group types would produce a stronger impact on the chimpanzees’ behavior. As expected, we found visitors at the sanctuary to produce only a neutral impact on the chimpanzees’ behavior, detecting a slight increase of locomotion and decrease of inactivity during visitor activities with chimpanzees demonstrating more interest towards larger sized groups. We argue that the impact has been greatly mitigated by the strict visitor restrictions and care strategies allowing chimpanzees a certain control regarding their visibility. © 2019 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The goal of this study was to explain the patterns of diversity and distribution of arboreal social bees nesting in forests of the Comoé National Park, within the homeranges of wild chimpanzees, consumers of their honey. Investigations were done using a total of sixteen plots of one hectare each, established in three habitat types (mature forest island, secondary forest island and gallery forest). The diversity and distribution of arboreal social bees was assessed using visual searches. The exploitation of the beehives of these bees by chimpanzees was also evaluated using honey dipping tools as indicators. Five bee species belonging to two tribes, namely the Meliponini (Meliponula ferruginea, Meliponula togoensis, Meliponula bocandei, Hypotrigona gribodoi) and the Apini (Apis mellifera) were collected. Furthermore, frequent exploitation of the honey of stingless bees by chimpanzees was observed, excepted for H. gribodoi. Beehives of Meliponula ferruginea were identified as the most exploited ones by chimpanzees. A total of 114 beehives were found in the established plots leading to an estimated density of 2.4 beehives/ha within the study area. Among the surveyed habitats, mature forest island was found to harbor the highest beehives' density (4.2 beehives/ha), followed respectively by secondary forest island (1.9 beehives/ha) and gallery forest (1.1 beehives/ha). Finally, all bee species were found nesting in cavities of trees with a DBH ranging from 15 to 87.3 cm, with a special preference for Dialium guinneense. However, the DBH of the nesting trees and the beehives' height measured from the ground level, were found not significantly influencing the honey exploitation by chimpanzees. In sum bee species diversity and distribution might be the most important variables in the survival of chimpanzees within forest-savanna mosaic landscape. © 2019 Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana.

ABSTRACT: Studies of transmission biases in social learning have greatly informed our understanding of how behaviour patterns may diffuse through animal populations, yet within-species inter-individual variation in social information use has received little attention and remains poorly understood. We have addressed this question by examining individual performances across multiple experiments with the same population of primates. We compiled a dataset spanning 16 social learning studies (26 experimental conditions) carried out at the same study site over a 12-year period, incorporating a total of 167 chimpanzees. We applied a binary scoring system to code each participant’s performance in each study according to whether they demonstrated evidence of using social information from conspecifics to solve the experimental task or not (Social Information Score—‘SIS’). Bayesian binomial mixed effects models were then used to estimate the extent to which individual differences influenced SIS, together with any effects of sex, rearing history, age, prior involvement in research and task type on SIS. An estimate of repeatability found that approximately half of the variance in SIS was accounted for by individual identity, indicating that individual differences play a critical role in the social learning behaviour of chimpanzees. According to the model that best fit the data, females were, depending on their rearing history, 15–24% more likely to use social information to solve experimental tasks than males. However, there was no strong evidence of an effect of age or research experience, and pedigree records indicated that SIS was not a strongly heritable trait. Our study offers a novel, transferable method for the study of individual differences in social learning. © 2018, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: In the last few decades, Ebola virus (EBOV) has emerged periodically and infected people in Africa, resulting in an extremely high mortality rate. With no available prophylaxis or cure so far, a highly effective Ebola vaccine is urgently needed. In this study, we developed a novel chimpanzee adenovirus-based prime-boost vaccine by exploiting two recombinant replication-deficient chimpanzee adenoviral vectors, AdC7 and AdC68, which express glycoproteins (GP) of the EBOV strain identified in the 2014 outbreak. Our results indicated that a single immunization using AdC7 or AdC68 could stimulate potent EBOV-specific antibody responses, whereas the AdC7 prime-AdC68 boost regimen induced much stronger and sustained humoral and cellular immune responses in both mice and rhesus monkeys, compared with AdC7 or AdC68 single vaccination or the AdC68 prime-AdC7 boost regimen. This prime-boost vaccine could also protect mice from the simulated infection with EBOV-like particle (EBOVLP) in biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) laboratories, and antibodies from the prime-boost immunized rhesus macaques could passively provide protection against EBOVLP infection. Altogether, our results show that the AdC7 prime-AdC68 boost vaccine is a promising candidate for further development to combat EBOV infections. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Friendship naturally leads to treating some people differently from the way we treat everyone else. One manifestation of such preferential treatment is in the domain of prosociality: we are more likely to extend favors towards our friends. Little is known about the developmental and evolutionary roots of such preferential prosociality. Here, we investigate whether young children and chimpanzees show partiality towards friends in helping contexts. Results show that young children at the age of three – when they first form preferential peer relationships – already bias their helping decisions in favor of their friends, both when they have to make a choice whether to help a friend or a neutral peer (Study 1) and when measuring their overall motivation to help (Study 2). In Study 3, by combining observational and experimental methods, we demonstrate similar though less robust motivations to provide help preferentially to friends in our closest living relatives, chimpanzees. Taken together, these studies suggest that partiality towards friends is grounded early in ontogeny and human evolution. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Using a two-bottle choice test of short duration, we determined taste preference thresholds for sucrose, fructose, glucose, lactose, and maltose in three Western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus). Further, we assessed relative preferences for these five saccharides when presented at equimolar concentrations and determined taste preference difference thresholds for sucrose, that is, the smallest concentration difference at which the chimpanzees display a preference for one of the two options. We found that the chimpanzees significantly preferred concentrations as low as 20 mM sucrose, 40 mM fructose, and 80 mM glucose, lactose, and maltose over tap water. When given a choice between all binary combinations of these five saccharides presented at equimolar concentrations of 100, 200, and 400 mM, respectively, the animals displayed significant preferences for individual saccharides in the following order: sucrose > fructose > glucose = maltose = lactose. The taste difference threshold for sucrose, expressed as Weber ratio (ΔI/I), was 0.3 and 0.4, respectively, at reference concentrations of 100 and 200 mM. The taste sensitivity of the chimpanzees to the five saccharides falls into the same range found in other primate species. Remarkably, their taste preference thresholds are similar, and with two saccharides even identical, to human taste detection thresholds. The pattern of relative taste preferences displayed by the chimpanzees was similar to that found in platyrrhine primates and to the pattern of relative sweetness as reported by humans. Taken together, the results of the present study are in line with the notion that taste sensitivity for food-associated carbohydrates may correlate positively with phylogenetic relatedness. Further, they support the notion that relative preferences for food-associated carbohydrates, but not taste difference thresholds, may correlate with dietary specialization in primates. © 2018, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Because of their close evolutionary relationship to humans, chimpanzees generate considerable interest in the scientific and lay communities alike. In this contribution, I summarize the recent findings derived from long-term research on the behavior of wild chimpanzees. After outlining selected aspects of the natural history of chimpanzees, including their ecology, social organization, and life history, I review our current understanding of two major aspects of chimpanzee behavior: female competition and male cooperation. This review indicates that female chimpanzees compete for food, space, and reproduction, while male chimpanzees cooperate in several contexts, involving coalitions, meat sharing, and group territoriality. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees have been studied for nearly 300 combined years across Africa, but aside from their roles as predators or prey, remarkably little is known about the diverse species with whom they share habitats. We calculated likely chimpanzee encounter rates with sympatric mammals in the Issa Valley, Tanzania, through modelling actual researcher encounter rates with all medium and large mammals. Compared to other long-term chimpanzee study sites, Issa had a relatively high diversity in medium and large mammal species present, with 36 species documented. We encountered common duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia) most frequently, followed by yellow baboons (Papio cynocephalus) and bushbuck. Chimpanzees ranked fifth overall. Chimpanzees, on the other hand, were predicted to most frequently encounter bushbuck, klipspringer and hartebeest—all woodland species. We compare these results to published literature and contextualise them in light of reconstructing diverse mammalian communities in which hominins lived during the Plio-Pleistocene and the use of chimpanzees as flagship species for conservation policy. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (Pan paniscus) are both our evolutionary closest living relatives. Human and Pan lineages diverged around 7 million years ago, and the chimpanzee and the bonobo branched 1-2 million years ago. Accordingly, the two species have a lot of similarities in their appearance, behavior, and societies; however, research highlights some striking differences between these close sister species. There are a number of traits in which bonobos and chimpanzees are more similar to humans than they are each other have been recognized recently. This comparison provides an extremely powerful test of ideas about human uniqueness. Given that both species are equally related to us, balanced insights are needed from both chimpanzees and bonobos in order to understand the selective pressures which may have shaped the human mind. Here we concisely review their evolution, society, and cognition, and suggest its implication for the evolutionary processes by which cognitive traits evolve in apes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Zika virus (ZIKV) emerged on a global scale and no licensed vaccine ensures long-lasting anti-ZIKV immunity. Here we report the design and comparative evaluation of four replication-deficient chimpanzee adenoviral (ChAdOx1) ZIKV vaccine candidates comprising the addition or deletion of precursor membrane (prM) and envelope, with or without its transmembrane domain (TM). A single, non-adjuvanted vaccination of ChAdOx1 ZIKV vaccines elicits suitable levels of protective responses in mice challenged with ZIKV. ChAdOx1 prME ΔTM encoding prM and envelope without TM provides 100% protection, as well as long-lasting anti-envelope immune responses and no evidence of in vitro antibody-dependent enhancement to dengue virus. Deletion of prM and addition of TM reduces protective efficacy and yields lower anti-envelope responses. Our finding that immunity against ZIKV can be enhanced by modulating antigen membrane anchoring highlights important parameters in the design of viral vectored ZIKV vaccines to support further clinical assessments. © 2018 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Diaguiri is a non-protected area situated in south-eastern Senegal. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) have been living here since 1999 but information on the characteristics of their nest sites have been lacking until now. Furthermore, we implemented nest survey methods recently standardised to arid landscapes during a national chimpanzee survey. Variations in nest decay rates are poorly understood in savanna-woodland mosaic habitats. This study aims to describe in Diaguiri: (1) the distribution of chimpanzee nests and the location of their core sleeping area, (2) the tree species used for nest building, (3) the association between nests and nesting tree heights, and (4) differences in nest decay rates between habitats. We surveyed 43 km of chimpanzee nesting habitats and recorded 871 nests in gallery forest and woodland habitats between March 2015 and June 2016. Diaguiri chimpanzees used at least 17 tree species for nest building, and 58.8% of nests were in only 3 tree species: Pterocarpus erinaceus, Anogeissus leiocarpus and Diospyros mespiliformis. Nest decay rate was faster in gallery forests than in woodlands. These data are of great value for understanding habitat use by a Critically Endangered subspecies of savanna chimpanzee, for population density estimates of the species and for conservation programmes in this region and in savanna biomes. © 2018 S.

ABSTRACT: Background: Nearly 3 million people worldwide are coinfected with HIV and HCV. Affordable strategies for prevention are needed. We developed a novel vaccination regimen involving replication-defective and serologically distinct chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAd3, ChAd63) vector priming followed by modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) boosts, for simultaneous delivery of HCV non-structural (NSmut) and HIV-1 conserved (HIVconsv) region immunogens. Methods: We conducted a phase I trial in which 33 healthy volunteers were sequentially enrolled and vaccinated via the intramuscular route as follows: 9 received ChAd3-NSmut [2.5 × 1010 vp] and MVA-NSmut [2 × 108 pfu] at weeks 0 and 8, respectively; 8 received ChAdV63.HIVconsv [5 × 1010 vp] and MVA.HIVconsv [2 × 108 pfu] at the same interval; 16 were co-primed with ChAd3-NSmut [2.5 × 1010 vp] and ChAdV63.HIVconsv [5 × 1010 vp] followed at week 8 by MVA-NSmut and MVA.HIVconsv [both 1 × 108 pfu]. Immunogenicity was assessed using peptide pools in ex vivo ELISpot and intracellular cytokine assays. Vaccine-induced whole blood transcriptome changes were assessed by microarray analysis. Results: All vaccines were well tolerated and no vaccine-related serious adverse events occurred. Co-administration of the prime-boost vaccine regimens induced high magnitude and broad T cell responses that were similar to those observed following immunization with either regimen alone. Median (interquartile range, IQR) peak responses to NSmut were 3,480 (2,728-4,464) and 3,405 (2,307-7,804) spot-forming cells (SFC)/106 PBMC for single and combined HCV vaccinations, respectively (p = 0.8). Median (IQR) peak responses to HIVconsv were 1,305 (1,095-4,967) and 1,005 (169-2,482) SFC/106 PBMC for single and combined HIV-1 vaccinations, respectively (p = 0.5). Responses were maintained above baseline to 34 weeks post-vaccination. Intracellular cytokine analysis indicated that the responding populations comprised polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Canonical pathway analysis showed that in the single and combined vaccination groups, pathways associated with antiviral and innate immune responses were enriched for upregulated interferon-stimulated genes 24 h after priming and boosting vaccinations. Conclusions: Serologically distinct adenoviral vectors encoding HCV and HIV-1 immunogens can be safely co-administered without reducing the immunogenicity of either vaccine. This provides a novel strategy for targeting these viruses simultaneously and for other pathogens that affect the same populations. © 2019 Hartnell, Brown, Capone, Kopycinski, Bliss, Makvandi-Nejad, Swadling, Ghaffari, Cicconi, Del Sorbo, Sbrocchi, Esposito, Vassilev, Marriott, Gardiner, Bannan, Bergin, Hoffmann, Turner, Nicosia, Folgori, Hanke, Barnes and Dorrell.

ABSTRACT: Data on cognitive aging in chimpanzees are extremely sparse, yet can provide an invaluable phylogenetic perspective, especially because Alzheimer disease (AD)–like neuropathology has recently been described in the oldest chimpanzee brains. This finding underscores the importance of data on cognitive aging in this fellow hominin, our closest biological relative. We tested 30 female chimpanzees, 12–56 years old, on a computerized analog of the Wisconsin Card Sort test. This test assesses cognitive flexibility, which is severely impaired in normal aging and AD. Subjects selected stimuli according to color or shape; the rewarded dimension (i.e., color or shape) switched without warning and the chimpanzee had to adapt her responses accordingly. We found that increasing age was associated with an increased number of perseverative errors and an increased number of trials to reach criterion in each switching dimension. The number of aborted trials was similar across age groups. These data show that similar to humans, chimpanzees show a clear age-related decline in cognitive flexibility that is already observed at middle age. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: To improve our understanding of the evolutionary origins of culture and technology in humans, it is vital that we document the full extent of behavioural diversity in our great ape relatives. About half of the world's remaining chimpanzees (Pan spp.) live in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), yet until now we have known almost nothing about their behaviour. Here we describe the insect-related tool technology of Bili-Uéré chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) inhabiting an area of at least a 50,000-km2 area in northern DRC, as well as their percussive technology associated with food processing. Over a 12-year period, we documented chimpanzee tools and artefacts at 20 survey areas and gathered data on dung, feeding remains and sleeping nests. We describe a new chimpanzee tool kit: long probes used to harvest epigaeic driver ants (Dorylus spp.), short probes used to extract ponerine ants and the arboreal nests of stingless bees, wands to dip for D. kohli and stout digging sticks used to access underground meliponine bee nests. Epigaeic Dorylus tools were significantly longer than the other tool types, and D. kohli tools were significantly thinner. Tools classified as terrestrial honey-digging sticks were a significant predictor for brushed and blunted tool ends, consistent with their presumed use. We describe two potential new tool types, an "ant scoop" and a "fruit hammer." We document an extensive percussive technology used to process termite mounds of Cubitermes sp. and Thoracotermes macrothorax and hard-shelled fruits such as Strychnos, along with evidence of the pounding open of African giant snails and tortoises. We encountered some geographic variation in behaviour: we found honey-digging tools, long driver ant probes and fruit-pounding sites only to the north of the Uele River; there were more epigaeic Dorylus tools to the north and more ponerine ant tools to the south. We found no evidence of termite-fishing, despite the availability of Macrotermes muelleri mounds throughout the region. This lack of evidence is consistent with the results of dung washes, which revealed a substantial proportion of driver ants, but no evidence of Macrotermes or other termites. Our results allow us to describe a new chimpanzee behavioural complex, characterised by a general similarity of multiple behaviours across a large, ecologically diverse region but with subtle differences in prey choice and techniques. We propose that this widespread and related suite of behaviours be referred to as the Bili-Uéré Chimpanzee Behavioural Realm. Possible explanations for this pattern are a recent chimpanzee expansion across the region and the interconnectedness of this population across at least the entirety of northern DRC. © 2019 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Scientific evaluation of management strategies for captive species is part of the establishment of best practices for animal welfare. Here we report the effects of sex, rearing, and a sex-by-rearing interaction on adult, captive chimpanzees’ (Pan troglodytes) behavior, health, well-being, personality, and orientation towards humans based on multiple methods (observation, animal records, and surveys). Chimpanzees raised in three conditions, mother-reared (MR), standard nursery (ST) and an experimental nursery (RC), were assessed approximately 20 years after their differential rearing experiences concluded. Sex had a significant effect on behavior towards conspecifics (aggression [M > F]; affiliation [F > M]), on abnormal behavior (rocking [M > F]), and on likelihood of incurring at least one injury (between ages 6 and 10 [M > F]). Rearing condition had a significant impact on behavior towards humans (negative solicitation [RC = ST > MR = ST]; neutral behavior [RC > ST > MR], yawning (RC = ST > MR = ST), subjective well-being (MR = ST > RC = ST), and on GI illness frequency (RC > ST = MR). Sex interacted with rearing on aggression towards humans (for males, RC > MR = ST), frequency of upper respiratory infection (URI: for males RC > MR = ST)) and likelihood of at least one URI between the ages of 11 and 15 (RC males > ST males). Our findings support the conclusion that there are long-term effects of both early rearing and sex on captive adult chimpanzee welfare. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Some animals have basic culture, but to date there is not much evidence that cultural traits evolve as part of a cumulative process as seen in humans. This may be due to limits in animal physical cognition, such as an inability to compare the efficiency of a novel behavioural innovation with an already existing tradition. We investigated this possibility with a study on a natural tool innovation in wild chimpanzees: moss-sponging, which recently emerged in some individuals to extract mineral-rich liquids at a natural clay-pit. The behaviour probably arose as a variant of leaf-sponging, a tool technique seen in all studied chimpanzee communities. We found that moss-sponges not only absorbed more liquid but were manufactured and used more rapidly than leaf-sponges, suggesting a functional improvement. To investigate whether chimpanzees understood the advantage of mossover leaf-sponges, we experimentally offered small amounts of rainwater in an artificial cavity of a portable log, together with both sponge materials, moss and leaves. We found that established moss-spongers (having used both leaves and moss to make sponges) preferred moss to prepare a sponge to access the rainwater, whereas leaf-spongers (never observed using moss) preferred leaves. Survey data finally demonstrated that moss was common in forest areas near clay-pits but nearly absent in other forest areas, suggesting that natural moss-sponging was at least partly constrained by ecology. Together, these results suggest that chimpanzees perceive functional improvements in tool quality, a crucial prerequisite for cumulative culture. © 2018 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The 2009-2010 Sierra Leone National Chimpanzee Census Project estimated there was a population of 5,580 chimpanzees Pan troglodytes verus distributed across the country, with > 50% occurring outside protected areas. The census also highlighted the significance of competition between people and chimpanzees for resources in areas dominated by farming activities where wild chimpanzees forage on crops. We selected four study areas in two districts in Sierra Leone with high chimpanzee density in habitats dominated by agriculture, far from any protected areas. Our objectives were to assess farmers' perceptions of the main challenges to their agricultural yields, and the wildlife involved in crop foraging, and their perceptions of chimpanzees in particular, as well as the main crop protection measures used. We conducted 257 semi-structured interviews with local farmers across the four study areas. We found that (1) farmers reported wild animals as the main challenge to their agricultural practices; (2) most complaints concerned cane rats Thryonomys swinderianus, which targeted almost all crop types, especially rice and cassava; (3) chimpanzees reportedly targeted 21 of the 23 crop types cultivated, but did so less often than cane rats, focusing particularly on oil palm, cassava and domestic fruits; (4) overall, chimpanzees were not among the top three most destructive animals reported; (5) chimpanzees were generally perceived as being more destructive than dangerous and as having declined since before the civil war; and (6) the main crop protection measure employed was fencing interspersed with traps. Our findings show the importance of investigating farmers' perceptions to inform the development of appropriate conservation strategies aimed at promoting coexistence of people and wildlife in degraded landscapes.

ABSTRACT: Many animals living in social groups have evolved behaviors to resolve conflicts between group members, behaviors thought crucial for maintaining stable group life. Several hypotheses, based mainly on observational data, aim to explain how post-conflict (PC) affiliations, such as reconciliation and consolation, resolve conflicts by restoring relationships and/or alleviating anxiety. To examine a potential endocrinological mechanism of PC affiliations, we used an experimental-like procedure to investigate whether the oxytocinergic system is activated during naturally observed reconciliations, receiving bystander PC affiliations and aggressions not followed by PC affiliations in wild male chimpanzees. We compared urinary oxytocin (uOT) levels after reconciliations, receiving bystander PC affiliations or aggressions without affiliations with two control conditions: affiliations without previous aggression and after time periods without social interactions. We furthermore tested the ‘valuable relationship’ hypothesis of reconciliation, as well as the influence of relationship quality between individuals engaged in each of the three behavioral conditions involving aggression on uOT levels. We found that the probability to reconcile a conflict increased with increasing relationship quality between opponents, thus our results support the ‘valuable relationship’ hypothesis. However, relationship quality did not influence uOT levels, while behavioral condition had a significant effect on uOT levels. uOT levels after reconciliations, receiving bystander PC affiliations and affiliations not related to conflicts were higher than after aggressions alone and time periods without social interactions. Overall, our results indicate that the oxytocinergic system is activated during affiliative interactions, whether occurring as reconciliation, bystander PC affiliation or affiliation alone. We conclude that the oxytocinergic system, in addition to building and maintaining social relationships, also takes part in repairing them. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees are well-studied, but raw material acquisition for tool use is still poorly understood as sources are difficult to trace. This study pioneers the use of information that can be gleaned from plant scars made by chimpanzees while they source vegetation parts to manufacture termite fishing tools. Source plant species, raw material types and locations relative to targeted termite mounds were recorded for populations at Gombe, Issa, and Mahale in western Tanzania. Recovered bark, twig, and vine tools were traced to 29 plant species, while grass sources were indeterminable. Bark extraction scars remained detectable for months, and thus possibly for as long as the plant is alive, while twig and vine scars preserved for a few weeks only. Scars preserve better than tools, given that twice as many plant species could be linked to the former than to the latter. Some source species were exploited across all sites for the same type of tool material, while two species were sourced for different types. Compared to apes at Gombe and Mahale, Issa chimpanzees carried material from twice as far away, perhaps because the Issa habitat is more open and dry, which entails greater distances between suitable raw material sources and targeted mounds. Site-specific tools were based on different raw materials, in two cases sourced from the same species, which could suggest learned preferences for particular tool material. “Archaeology of the perishable” as pioneered in this study broadens the methodological approach of the wider field of primate archaeology to include reconstructions of past animal behavior associated with the production of plant based tools. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Successful collaboration often relies on individuals' capacity to communicate with each other. Despite extensive research on chimpanzee communication, there is little evidence that chimpanzees are capable, without extensive human training, of regulating collaborative activities via communication. This study investigated whether pairs of chimpanzees were capable of communicating to ensure coordination during collaborative problem-solving. The chimpanzee pairs needed two tools to extract fruits from an apparatus. The communicator in each pair could see the location of the tools (hidden in one of two boxes), whereas only the recipient could open the boxes. The subjects were first successfully tested for their capacity to understand the pointing gestures of a human who indicated the location of the tools. In a subsequent conspecifics test, the communicator increasingly communicated the tools' location, by approaching the baited box and giving the key needed to open it to the recipients. The recipient used these signals and obtained the tools, transferring one of the tools to the communicator so that the pair could collaborate in obtaining the fruits. The study suggests that chimpanzees have the necessary socio-cognitive skills to naturally develop a simple communicative strategy to ensure coordination in a collaborative task. © 2019 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Studying the communication systems of primates can provide insights into the evolutionary origins of human language. Some theories propose that language evolved to help meet the demands of managing complex social relationships. Examining the associations between sociality and communication in the great apes can help to identify the specific selection pressures that may have been important for language evolution. In particular, gestural communication is believed to be important because it is a relatively recent trait seen only in primates and particularly in the great apes. However, the extent to which more complex gestural communication plays a role in managing social relationships, as compared to less complex gestural communication, is not well understood. Using social network analysis, we examined the association between complex gesturing (indexed as repertoire size) and complexity of social relationships indexed as proximity (the duration of time spent within 10 m, per hour spent in same party) in wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii). Repertoire size (the total number of gesture types a focal subject produced toward other individuals) and dyadic repertoire size (the number of gesture types produced toward the dyad partner, per hour spent within 10 meters) were positively associated with proximity at the level of the group (centrality in the proximity network) and the dyad (proximity duration between dyads), respectively. Further, the repertoire size of visual and auditory short-range gestures was positively associated with proximity, while the repertoire size of tactile gesture was negatively associated with proximity. Overall these results suggest that gestural repertoire size has important implications for maintaining social relationships in wild chimpanzees and more broadly that gestural communication may have played an important role in language evolution. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: In contrast to reports of wild primates, studies of captive primates’ flexibility often reveal conservatism: individuals are unable to switch to new and more efficient strategies when task demands change. We propose that such conservatism might be a result of task design and hypothesize that conservatism might be linked to primates’ lack of causal understanding in relation to experimental apparatuses. We investigated if chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) would show greater flexibility when presented with a causally-clear task. We presented six chimpanzees and seven gorillas with a clear tube from which they had to remove straws to release a reward. To first evaluate the apes’ causal understanding, we recorded the efficiency with which the apes solved the task (i.e., whether they only removed straws below the reward, ignoring redundant ones above it). To further explore how they solved the task, we also recorded the order in which they removed the straws, which allowed us to determine if habitual action sequences emerged. All apes spontaneously solved the task in their first trial and across repeated trials the majority of their solutions were efficient (median = 90.9%), demonstrating their understanding of the puzzle. There was individual variation in the consistency of straw removal patterns exhibited by the apes, but no ape developed an exclusive habit in the order with which they removed the straws, further indicating their causal understanding of the task. Next, we presented the apes with a new configuration of the same task that required the apes to remove fewer straws to obtain the reward. All apes switched to a more efficient straw removal sequence even though their previously-successful, but now less-efficient, solution remained available. We theorize that because the apes understood the causality of the task, they did not form habits and were not conservative. Copyright 2019 Jacobson and Hopper.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees are traditionally described as ripe fruit specialists with large incisors but relatively small postcanine teeth, adhering to a somewhat narrow dietary niche. Field observations and isotopic analyses suggest that environmental conditions greatly affect habitat resource utilisation by chimpanzee populations. Here we combine measures of dietary mechanics with stable isotope signatures from eastern chimpanzees living in tropical forest (Ngogo, Uganda) and savannah woodland (Issa Valley, Tanzania). We show that foods at Issa can present a considerable mechanical challenge, most saliently in the external tissues of savannah woodland plants compared to their tropical forest equivalents. This pattern is concurrent with different isotopic signatures between sites. These findings demonstrate that chimpanzee foods in some habitats are mechanically more demanding than previously thought, elucidating the broader evolutionary constraints acting on chimpanzee dental morphology. Similarly, these data can help clarify the dietary mechanical landscape of extinct hominins often overlooked by broad C3/C4 isotopic categories. © 2018, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Pathogen analysis in wild great apes is both time- and resource-consuming. Therefore, we examined the potential use of urinary neopterin, a sensitive marker of cell-mediated immune system activation, as a disease marker and unspecific screening tool to facilitate informed pathogen analysis in great ape health monitoring. To test this, urinary neopterin was correlated to other disease markers such as sickness behaviors, fever, and urine parameters. Seasonal variation in urinary neopterin levels was investigated as well. The study encompassed noninvasively collected longitudinal data of young wild chimpanzees from the Taï National Park, Côte d´Ivoire. Relationships between disease markers were examined using a linear mixed model and a case study approach. Seasonal variation in urinary neopterin was tested using a linear mixed model. While the linear mixed model found no obvious relationship between urinary neopterin levels and other disease markers, the case study approach revealed a pattern resembling those found in humans. Urinary neopterin levels indicated seasonal immune system activation peaking in times of low ambient temperatures. We suggest the use of urinary neopterin as an unspecific screening tool in great ape health monitoring to identify relevant samples, individuals, and time periods for selective pathogen analysis and zoonotic risk assessment. © 2018, EcoHealth Alliance.

ABSTRACT: Complex ecological pressures affect the social dynamics of many primate species, but it is unclear how they affect primate speciation. Molecular tools are often used to answer questions about the evolutionary histories and social systems of primates. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), in particular, is frequently used to answer many of these questions, but because it is passed from mothers to offspring it reveals only the histories of females. In many species, including chimpanzees, females generally disperse from their natal groups while males are philopatric, and thus differences in dispersal patterns likely leave different signatures in the genome. We previously analyzed samples from 187 unrelated male and female chimpanzees in Nigeria and Cameroon using 21 autosomal microsatellites and mtDNA sequences. Here, we examine the contributions of males and females in shaping the genetic history of these chimpanzees by genotyping a subset of 56 males at 12 Y-chromosome microsatellites. We found that Y-chromosome population structure differed from the results of analysis of mtDNA haplotypes. The results also revealed that males in rainforest habitats (Guinean and Congolian rainforests) are more closely related to one another than those inhabiting the savanna-woodland mosaic ecotone in central Cameroon. In contrast, the pattern of female relatedness did not differ across habitats. We hypothesize that these differences in population structure and patterns of relatedness among males in different habitat types may be due to differences in the community dynamics of chimpanzees in the ecotone vs. rainforests, and that these factors contribute to making Cameroon an engine of diversification for chimpanzees. Broadly, these results demonstrate the importance of habitat variation in shaping social systems, population genetics, and primate speciation. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Several studies across anthropoid species have demonstrated how primates respond to the increased risk of conflict during space restriction with various behavioral strategies. Three strategies have been proposed relating to tension regulation, conflict avoidance, and inhibition. Prior research supporting these strategies has focused on individual- and dyadic-level analyses, yet group-living animals live within a web of inter-individual connections. Here, for the first time, we used a network approach to investigate how social structure and individuals’ connectedness change during space restriction. We collected grooming and aggression data during a 6-week control period and a 5-week period of space restriction in a large group of zoo chimpanzees. We compared network density and individual centrality measures (degree, eigenvector, and betweenness centrality) between these two periods using permutation tests. The density of the unidirectional grooming network was significantly lower during space restriction, indicating fewer grooming partners and a less cohesive network. This was mainly due to a reduction in females’ grooming partners (degree) and an increase in females’ betweenness centrality. We found no differences in the mutual grooming or aggression networks. Our findings are consistent with a conflict avoidance strategy and complement previous findings from the same dataset based on individual behavioral rates that supported a selective inhibition strategy. The results highlight the dynamic nature of social structure and its inherent flexibility to respond effectively to short-term changes in the environment. © 2018, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: In an effort to enhance welfare, behavioural management continually refines methods of non-human primate (NHP) care. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are one of the most cognitively complex captive NHPs and they have been observed to self-medicate in the wild. The population of captive chimpanzees in the US is aged (due to a breeding moratorium instituted in 1998) and will progressively require more medical care as they get older. To functionally simulate natural self-medication behaviour, provide chimpanzees with the opportunity to voluntarily participate in their own healthcare, and open new avenues of communication between caregivers and chimpanzees, we used a medication choice paradigm that allowed chimpanzees to choose their daily arthritis medication. We provided four arthritic, mobility-impaired chimpanzees with meloxicam or ibuprofen in blue or green Gatorade(r) to establish associations between the coloured drinks and the effects of the medications. We subsequently gave each chimpanzee a choice between the two medications. Behaviour was recorded using 15-min focal animal observations. Mobility was assessed using interactive mobility tests and a caregiver-rating system. One chimpanzee showed a medication preference (ibuprofen over meloxicam). The chimpanzees exhibited no significant behavioural or mobility differences over time, suggesting that ibuprofen and meloxicam may not differ significantly in their ability to alleviate arthritic symptoms. Whether or not the chimpanzees show a medication preference, the opportunity to make meaningful choices and the functional simulation of a complex behaviour, self-medication, is present when using this medication choice technique. Furthermore, the paradigm itself could have potential applications for additional medication options and treatment regimens. © 2018 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare.

ABSTRACT: This case report illustrates the teeth morphology of a chimpanzee and its anatomical variations. A well-preserved skull of a male Pan troglodytes troglodyte chimpanzee was scanned using a cone-beam computed tomography machine. Measurements included tooth and crown height, root length, root canal length and width (posterior teeth), and pulp cavity length (anterior teeth). Nonmetrical parameters included number of canals and foramina per root of every root. Interestingly, the mandibular central incisor was longer than the lateral incisor, and all the mandibular anterior teeth presented with a solitary flame-shaped or conical-calcified structure in their pulp cavity. The premolars are usually dual rooted except for the first maxillary premolar that displayed 3 roots. Other unusual discoveries were the presence of bilateral radicular dens invaginatus in the mandibular first premolars and the possibility of having 2 canals and 2 foramina in the roots of the posterior teeth. The presence of conical stone mineralizations at the pulp cavity and the presence of dens invaginatus were of particular interest. © The Author(s) 2018.

ABSTRACT: Growing evidence from studies on primates and other taxa has shown that the maintenance of long-term affiliative patterns influences fitness. Thus, understanding how individuals regulate social interactions in response to environmental and social factors contributes to our understanding of the evolutionary basis of sociality. We investigated the durability of affiliation patterns in chimpanzees across three 3-month periods of varying social uncertainty depending on the degree of stability in the male hierarchy, with a 2-year gap between each period. Periods were unstable (no clear alpha male), recently stable (new alpha male just established) and stable (alpha male in place for 2 years). We focused on three features of social exchange shared by human and non-human primates: consistency of exchanges across periods, durability of preferred partners, and degree of reciprocity in each period. We compared male-to-male, female-to-female, male-to-female, and female-to-male grooming patterns. Overall, more grooming was exchanged in the stable period. Grooming patterns were not consistent across the three periods, but were only consistent between the recently stable and stable periods for female-to-female and male-to-female dyads. As predicted from the opportunistic nature of male relationships, male-to-male grooming was least likely to be correlated across all periods and males had relatively fewer durable (i.e., preferred partners in all periods) same-sex partners than females. Our predictions that grooming reciprocity would be less likely during the unstable period and in male–male dyads were only partially supported. We found grooming reciprocity in all periods for female–female dyads but only in the stable period for male–male and female–male dyads. Although long-term affiliative patterns are well studied in primates, this is the first study to investigate the association between social uncertainty and durability of affiliative patterns. Our findings suggest social uncertainty influences social exchange and highlight the importance of considering group instability in studies of social relationships. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Although splicing is widespread and evolves rapidly among species, the mechanisms driving this evolution, as well as its functional implications, are not yet fully understood. We analyzed the evolution of splicing patterns based on transcriptome data from five tissues of humans, chimpanzees, rhesus macaques and mice. In total, 1526 exons and exon sets from 1236 genes showed significant splicing differences among primates. More than 60% of these differences represent constitutive-toalternative exon transitions while an additional 25% represent changes in exon inclusion frequency. These two dominant evolutionary patterns have contrasting conservation, regulation and functional features. The sum of these features indicates that, despite their prevalence, constitutive-to-alternative exon transitions do not substantially contribute to long-term functional transcriptome changes. Conversely, changes in exon inclusion frequency appear to be functionally relevant, especially for changes taking place in the brain on the human evolutionary lineage. © The Author(s) 2018.

ABSTRACT: Humans help others even without direct benefit for themselves. However, the nature of altruistic (i.e., only the other benefits) and prosocial (i.e., self and other both benefit) behaviors in our closest living relative, the chimpanzee, remains controversial. To address this further, we developed a touch-screen-guided task that allowed us to increase the number of trials for a thorough test of chimpanzees' prosocial and altruistic tendencies. Mother-offspring dyads were tested in the same compartment; one was the actor while the other was the recipient. In Experiment 1, the actor chose among three options: prosocial, selfish (only the actor benefited) and altruistic. To better understand the nature of the chimpanzees' choices and to improve experimental control, we conducted two additional experiments. Experiment 2 consisted of two-option choices interspersed with three-option choices, and in Experiment 3 the two-option choice were blocked across all trials. The results of Experiment 1 clearly showed that chimpanzees acted prosocially in the touch-screen-guided task, choosing the prosocial option on an average of 79% of choices. Five out of the six chimpanzees showed the preference to act prosocially against chance level. The preference for the prosocial option persisted when conditions were changed in Experiments 2 and 3. When only selfish and altruistic options were available in Experiments 2 and 3, chimpanzees preferred the selfish option. These results suggest that (1) most individuals understood the nature of the task and modified their behavior according to the available options, (2) five out of the six chimpanzees chose to act prosocially when they had the option to, and (3) offspring counterbalanced between altruistic and selfish, when given those two options perhaps to avoid suffering repercussions from the mother. © 2018 Mendonça et al.

ABSTRACT: Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is the primary antibody responsible for mucosal defense in mammals and has been used as a marker for chronic stress and immune status. Therefore, this antibody may provide a more reliable indicator of an individual's immunocompetence than is currently available through other methods. Immunoglobulin A has never before been quantified in a wild population of non-human primates using non-invasive sample collection techniques. In this study, we present methodology for non-invasive IgA extraction in the field and provide quantification of mean fecal IgA concentrations in wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii). During the study period (November 2009–October 2010), we collected fecal samples (N = 1463) from 59 individuals at Gombe National Park, Tanzania. We modified a field extraction technique for steroidal hormones to extract IgA from the fecal samples and then quantified mean IgA concentrations (ng/g) using a commercial human IgA enzyme immunoassay. Mean IgA concentration varied among individuals but not by sex or reproductive status. Mature animals tended toward higher mean IgA concentration than immature. Mean IgA concentration differed by quartile season, following a similar pattern previously observed for respiratory illness rates in this population, with the late dry season having significantly higher averages than the late wet. A circadian rhythm was also evident with mean IgA concentrations higher in samples collected in the latter half of the day. These demographic and temporal patterns of IgA concentration provide baseline values necessary to interpret future results, which may be combined with other health values to better understand the role of health and long-term stress in wild great ape populations.

ABSTRACT: There is broad consensus among paleoanthropologists that meat-eating played a key role in the evolution of Homo, but the details of where, when, and why are hotly debated. It has been argued that increased faunivory was causally connected with hominin adaptation to open, savanna habitats. If savanna-dwelling chimpanzees eat meat more frequently than do forest chimpanzees, it would support the notion that open, dry, seasonal habitats promote hunting or scavenging by hominoids. Here we present observational and fecal analysis data on vertebrate consumption from several localities within the dry, open Ugalla region of Tanzania. Combining these with published fecal analyses, we summarize chimpanzee vertebrate consumption rates, showing quantitatively that savanna chimpanzee populations do not differ significantly from forest populations. Compared with forest populations, savanna chimpanzees consume smaller vertebrates that are less likely to be shared, and they do so more seasonally. Analyses of chimpanzee hunting that focus exclusively on capture of forest monkeys are thus difficult to apply to chimpanzee faunivory in open-country habitats and may be misleading when used to model early hominin behavior. These findings bear on discussions of why chimpanzees hunt and suggest that increases in hominin faunivory were related to differences between hominins and chimpanzees and/or differences between modern and Pliocene savanna woodland environments. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Body mass directly affects how an animal relates to its environment and has a wide range of biological implications. However, little is known about the mass of the last common ancestor (LCA) of humans and chimpanzees, hominids (great apes and humans), or hominoids (all apes and humans), which is needed to evaluate numerous paleobiological hypotheses at and prior to the root of our lineage. Here we use phylogenetic comparative methods and data from primates including humans, fossil hominins, and a wide sample of fossil primates including Miocene apes from Africa, Europe, and Asia to test alternative hypotheses of body mass evolution. Our results suggest, contrary to previous suggestions, that the LCA of all hominoids lived in an environment that favored a gibbon-like size, but a series of selective regime shifts, possibly due to resource availability, led to a decrease and then increase in body mass in early hominins from a chimpanzee-sized LCA. © 2017 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Since the preclinical results about chimpanzee adenovirus serotype-68 (AdC68)-based vaccine showed an encouraging results, it reminded us that AdC68 may be a suitable cancer vaccine vector. Previous study indicated that the seroprevalence of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against adenovirus was different between cancer patients and healthy volunteers. Knowledge regarding the prevalence rates of AdC68 NAbs for cancer patients is lacking. Therefore, assessing the preexistence of NAbs against AdC68 in cancer patients could provide useful insights for developing future AdC68-based cancer vaccines. In this study, 440 patients with different pathological types of tumors and 204 healthy adult volunteers were enrolled to evaluate the NAbs against AdC68 and human adenovirus serotype-5 (AdHu5). The seroprevalence of NAbs against AdC68 was much lower than that against AdHu5 in cancer subjects (43.64 vs. 67.05%, P < 0.01). The seroprevalence rates of NAbs to AdC68 in the cancer subjects were statistically higher than those detected in the healthy adult volunteers (43.64 vs. 23.53%, P = 0.000). The seroprevalence rates of AdC68 NAbs were much lower in lung, laryngeal, esophageal, and cervical cancer patients compared with oropharyngeal, colon, and rectal cancer patients. Furthermore, the seroprevalence rates of AdC68 NAbs were much lower in lung adenocarcinoma patients than in lung squamous cell carcinoma patients (35.00 vs. 70.00%, P < 0.05). No significant difference in the AdC68 NAbs among patients with different clinical stages of cancer was detected. The percentage of NAbs against AdC68 was significantly lower than that against AdHu5 (P < 0.05) in stage-I, -II, and -III cancer patients. No significant difference between the percentage of NAbs against AdC68 and AdHu5 in the subjects with stage-IV cancer was detected. The study also demonstrated the distribution of AdHu5 and AdC68 NAb titers for the positive samples. It showed that very low NAb titers against AdC68 with respect to AdHu5 in both healthy subjects and cancer subjects, especially in lung, laryngeal, esophageal, gastric, and cervical carcinomas. Also, the titer of NAbs against AdC68 was significantly lower than that against AdHu5 in the same clinical stage and age group (P < 0.05). Taken together, the present study showed that NAbs against AdC68 is much lower than AdHu5, especially in lung adenocarcinoma, laryngeal cancer, esophageal cancer, and cervical cancer patients. These results provided strong support for candidating AdC68 as a suitable vector of cancer vaccines. © 2018 Zhao, Xu, Luo, Wei, Wang, Shi and Ren.

ABSTRACT: Feeding competition is thought to play a role in primate social organization as well as cognitive evolution. For chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), social and ecological factors can affect competition, yet how these factors interact to affect feeding behavior is not fully understood; they can be difficult to disentangle in wild settings. This experiment investigated the differential effects of food quantity, the presence of a co-feeding partner, and the contestability of a food patch on feeding rate. We presented tolerant pairs of chimpanzees from a semi-captive social group with an apparatus comprising a matrix of transparent tubes between two adjacent rooms, of which, either all (abundant condition) or only a small proportion (scarce condition) were baited with peanuts. Dyads were either grouped into the competitive treatment, in which peanuts were accessible from both sides of the apparatus simultaneously, or the non-competitive treatment, in which the peanuts were pre-divided; half of the tubes were accessible to one chimpanzee from one side, and the other half were accessible only from the opposite side of the apparatus. We compared dyadic tolerance levels with individual feeding rates across quantity conditions and between competitive treatments. While tolerance and food quantity had no effect on feeding rate, partner presence significantly increased feeding rate relative to individual feeding. This increase was much larger when the dyads directly competed over the peanuts than when they were co-feeding on a pre-divided set of peanuts. Thus, in a co-feeding situation, the presence of another individual and, to an even larger extent, the contestability of the food source play a larger role in chimpanzee feeding behavior than dyadic tolerance or food quantity. These findings highlight the relative impact of social facilitation and direct competition on co-feeding behavior between pairs of chimpanzees. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Digital devices, including tablet computers and other touchscreens, can potentially serve as flexible and convenient means for providing behavioral enrichment activities to captive primates. Despite increased interest in incorporating technology into enrichment programs, no direct quantitative comparison has previously been made between the effectiveness of typical tactile enrichment activities and enrichment activities on digital devices. One way in which these activities differ is in the degree of controllability afforded the animals in interacting with the enrichment objects, since digital devices will be limiting to varying degrees based on the particulars of software and the interface format. This study compared the effects of painting with brush on paper to those of a painting application on a digital tablet device (iPad™) in eight group-living chimpanzees at the Honolulu Zoo. Observations were analyzed across baseline, enrichment, and post-enrichment periods to measure significant differences in the reduction of displacement and stereotypic behaviors. We found that the digital tablet device running an application that permits production of semi-automated visualizations, was as effective as painting with brush on paper in reducing some stereotypic and displacement behaviors, including yawning and self-picking. However, the digital tablet was not as effective in reducing other displacement behaviors, nor was it as effective in retaining the chimpanzee's attention. These results confirm a useful role for digital devices in enrichment programs but suggest a need to assess individual device applications in their capacity to promote greater controllability and sensory breadth of the enrichment experience. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The population of NIH-owned or NIH-supported captive research chimpanzees is quickly becoming aged, and the 1998 NIH breeding moratorium has resulted in a skewed age distribution. As such, behavioral management programs aimed at refining the care of an aging captive chimpanzee population have become increasingly important. However, little research exists that addresses the ways in which captive chimpanzee behavior differs as a function of the interaction of age and aspects of the captive environment. We examined overall differences in behavior between elderly (35 y and older) and nonelderly (younger than 35 y) captive chimpanzees. Elderly chimpanzees exhibited significantly more rough scratching (a behavioral indicator of anxiety) and inactivity, less behavioral diversity, and less affiliation than their nonelderly counterparts. We also assessed whether elderly chimpanzee behavior and wounding rates differed as a function of housing in geriatric (group average age, 35 y or older) or nongeriatric (group average age, younger than 35 y) groups. In our program, geriatric social groups were characterized by smaller group size, more females within the group, and higher levels of individual mobility impairment compared with nongeriatric groups. Furthermore, elderly chimpanzees housed in geriatric groups displayed significantly increased rough scratching, decreased locomotion and submission than nongeriatric animals but no difference in wounding. These findings suggest that housing elderly chimpanzees in nongeriatric groups may be beneficial, given that doing so may stimulate locomotion. However, the establishment and maintenance of geriatric groups may be unavoidable as the demographics of the population of captive former research chimpanzees continues to age. Therefore, refinements to captive geriatric care strategies for chimpanzees should focus on methods of evaluating and enhancing functionally appropriate captive environments within geriatric groups. © 2019 by the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science.

ABSTRACT: Scat (faeces) decay rate estimates are used to calculate animal species abundance and density. For African great apes, this has been measured only for Gorilla; chimpanzee scats are assumed to decay at a faster rate due to lower fibre content. We provide the first systematic measure of scat decay rate duration for Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, in Kanyawara, Kibale National Park, Uganda. We used two methods: (1) multiple visits to obtain prospective decay rates (PDR) (N = 96 scats) and (2) a novel approach of time-lapse photography (TLP) (N = 17 scats). Most of the visited scats (67%) decayed in ≤24 hr, and median decay rate duration from photographic documentation was 18 hr. Using regression analyses, we tested 11 covariables to determine predictors for decay rate duration. Greater volume of scat and reduced levels of diurnal dung beetle activity were positively associated with longer decay rate duration. Given a high prevalence of dung beetle activity (88% of scats), particularly within 3 hr post-defaecation, we suggest the use of the alternative term, disappearance rate of scats. With a rapid disappearance rate, scat count surveys of unhabituated chimpanzees are challenging; further work is then needed for Pan spp. to determine spatial and temporal differences at intra- and inter-species level. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

ABSTRACT: We have analyzed anatomic variations in the pectoralis major and pectoralis minor muscles of common chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (Pan paniscus) and compared them to anatomic variations in these muscles in humans (Homo sapiens). We have macroscopically dissected these muscles in six adult Pan troglodytes, five Pan paniscus of ages ranging from fetus to adult, and five adult Homo sapiens. Although Pan troglodytes are thought to lack a separate pectoralis abdominis muscle, we have identified this muscle in three of the Pan troglodytes; none of the Pan paniscus, however, had this muscle. We have also found deep supernumerary fascicles in the pectoralis major of two Pan troglodytes and all five Pan paniscus. In all six Pan troglodytes, the pectoralis minor was inserted at the supraspinatus tendon, while, in Pan paniscus and Homo sapiens, it was inserted at the coracoid process of the scapula. Some of the anatomic features and variations of these muscles in common chimpanzees and bonobos are similar to those found in humans, therefore enhancing our knowledge of primate comparative anatomy and evolution and also shedding light on several clinical issues. © 2018 J.

ABSTRACT: Despite many observations of cooperation in nature, laboratory studies often fail to find careful coordination between individuals who are solving a cooperative task. Further, individuals tested are often naïve to cooperative tasks and there has been little exploration of partnerships with mixed expertise. In the current study, we examined acquisition of a cooperative pulling task in a group with both expert (N = 4) and novice (N = 11) chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). We used five measures of competence and understanding: (1) success at the task, (2) latency to succeed, (3) efficiency, (4) uncoordinated pulling, and (5) pulling when a partner was present versus absent. We found that novices showed evidence of trial and error learning and developed competence over time, whereas the behavior of experts did not change throughout the course of the study. In addition to looking at patterns over time, we compared the performance of novices in this mixed-expertise group to an earlier study of novices in a group of all-novices. Novices in the mixed-expertise group pulled the same overall amount but for shorter periods of time, leading to higher pulling rates than individuals in the all-novice group. Taken together, these results suggest that learning in the presence of experts led to rapid and frequent success, although not necessarily careful coordination. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Models of the origin of human prosociality towards non-kin have been primarily developed from chimpanzee studies. Substantially less effort has been made to consider the prosociality of bonobos. Like chimpanzees, bonobos cooperate with non-kin extensively but, unlike chimpanzees, immigrating members are central to bonobo cooperation. In experiments bonobos are tolerant during encounters with strangers and during co-feeding. They help strangers without immediate tangible reward, and forfeit monopolizable food to facilitate a physical interaction with them. Such prosociality seems proactive as it is not elicited by solicitation. Bonobos also seem to prefer sharing food over non-food objects, while chimpanzees reliably transfer non-food objects rather than food. These findings highlight the possibility that human sharing with strangers might have also evolved as a mutualistic endeavour to initiate a long-term partnership. Future models of human prosociality will need to incorporate findings from both Pan species. © Oxford University Press 2017.

ABSTRACT: Cross-species comparison of great ape gesturing has so far been limited to the physical form of gestures in the repertoire, without questioning whether gestures share the same meanings. Researchers have recently catalogued the meanings of chimpanzee gestures, but little is known about the gesture meanings of our other closest living relative, the bonobo. The bonobo gestural repertoire overlaps by approximately 90% with that of the chimpanzee, but such overlap might not extend to meanings. Here, we first determine the meanings of bonobo gestures by analysing the outcomes of gesturing that apparently satisfy the signaller. Around half of bonobo gestures have a single meaning, while half are more ambiguous. Moreover, all but 1 gesture type have distinct meanings, achieving a different distribution of intended meanings to the average distribution for all gesture types. We then employ a randomisation procedure in a novel way to test the likelihood that the observed between-species overlap in the assignment of meanings to gestures would arise by chance under a set of different constraints. We compare a matrix of the meanings of bonobo gestures with a matrix for those of chimpanzees against 10,000 randomised iterations of matrices constrained to the original data at 4 different levels. We find that the similarity between the 2 species is much greater than would be expected by chance. Bonobos and chimpanzees share not only the physical form of the gestures but also many gesture meanings. © 2018 Graham et al.

ABSTRACT: Loud calls are used by many species as long-distance signals for group defense, mate attraction, and inter- and intragroup spacing. Chimpanzee loud calls, or pant hoots, are used in a variety of contexts including group coordination and during male contests. Here, we observed an alpha male takeover in wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) during which the leaf clipping gesture re-emerged after disappearing for almost two years in this community. Leaf clipping only occurred in males and was observed almost exclusively prior to pant hoot vocalizations, as has been observed in other chimpanzee communities of the Taï forest in Côte d'Ivoire. Consequently, we hypothesized that leaf clipping may be important for male-male competition by affecting variation in the acoustic properties of male chimpanzee loud calls. We therefore investigated whether pant hoots preceded by leaf clipping differed acoustically from those without, while also testing the influence of social context on pant hoot variation, namely male dominance rank and hierarchy instability, i.e., before, during and after the alpha takeover. Wefound that pant hoots preceded by leaf clipping were longer, contained more call elements and drum beats, and lower fundamental and peak frequencies. Moreover, during the alpha takeover pant hoots were shorter, contained fewer drum beats and higher fundamental frequencies. Additionally, pant hoot and aggression rates were also highest during the alpha takeover with leaf clipping more likely to occur on days when pant hooting rates were high. Overall social rank had limited effects on pant hoot variation. Wesuggest that elevated arousal and aggression during the alpha takeover triggered the re-emergence of leaf clipping and the associated acoustic changes in pant hoots. Further research should focus on the potential mechanisms by which leaf clipping is connected to variation in pant hoots and cross-population comparisons of the behaviour. © 2018 Kalan and Boesch.

ABSTRACT: Populations of the endangered eastern chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) are declining throughout their range. Although Nyungwe National Park (NNP) harbors the largest remaining eastern chimpanzee population in Rwanda, we know little about their space use and dietary patterns. We studied home range, movement, and diet of two communities of chimpanzees in NNP using daily tracking data (6:00 am to 6:00 pm) collected from 2000 to 2015. One community, Mayebe, resided in the forest center, and the other community, Cyamudongo, inhabited a forest fragment located about 10 km from the main forest. Home range estimated with the 95% kernel density estimation (KDE) method was 21 km2 for the Mayebe community and 4 km2 for the Cyamudongo community. Chimpanzee home range sizes were smaller during the dry versus wet season and varied monthly throughout the year. The Mayebe community had an average hourly step length of 75 ± SE 5 m with a daily movement range of 987 ± SE 71 m, while the Cyamudongo community had a shorter hourly step length of 52 ± SE 3 m with a daily movement range of 651 ± SE 71 m. Both chimpanzee communities fed primarily on Ficus spp. Other important dietary items included fruits of Symphonia globulifera, Syzygium guineense, and Chrysophyllum gorungosanum for the Mayebe community and Trilepisium madagascariense for the Cyamudongo community. Food choice varied monthly and seasonally for each chimpanzee community. Our study provides the first estimates of home range size and movement parameters for chimpanzees in Rwanda and documents their food habits and seasonal variations therein. We also identified the 50% core home range for each chimpanzee community and suggest this area as the focus of management actions. These results could help park management reduce threats to chimpanzees and other sympatric species by improving the efficiency of ranger patrols. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Disease and other health hazards pose serious threats to the persistence of wild ape populations. The total chimpanzee population at Gombe National Park, Tanzania, has declined from an estimated 120 to 150 individuals in the 1960's to around 100 individuals by the end of 2013, with death associated with observable signs of disease as the leading cause of mortality. In 2004, we began a non-invasive health-monitoring program in the two habituated communities in the park (Kasekela and Mitumba) with the aim of understanding the prevalence of health issues in the population, and identifying the presence and impacts of various pathogens. Here we present prospectively collected data on clinical signs (observable changes in health) in the chimpanzees of the Kasekela (n = 81) and Mitumba (n = 32) communities over an 8-year period (2005–2012). First, we take a population approach and analyze prevalence of clinical signs in five different categories: gastrointestinal system (diarrhea), body condition (estimated weight loss), respiratory system (coughing, sneezing etc.), wounds/lameness, and dermatologic issues by year, month, and community membership. Mean monthly prevalence of each clinical sign per community varied, but typically affected <10% of observed individuals. Secondly, we analyze the presence of clinical signs in these categories as they relate to individual demographic and social factors (age, sex, and dominance rank) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVcpz) infection status. Adults have higher odds of being observed with diarrhea, loss of body condition, and wounds or lameness when compared to immatures, while males have a higher probability of being observed with wounds or lameness than females. In contrast, signs of respiratory illness appear not to be related to chimpanzee-specific factors and skin abnormalities are very rare. For a subset of known-rank individuals, dominance rank predicts the probability of wounding/lameness in adult males, but does not predict any adverse clinical signs in adult females. Instead, adult females with SIVcpz infection are more likely to be observed with diarrhea, a finding that warrants further investigation. Comparable data are needed from other sites to determine whether the prevalence of clinical signs we observe are relatively high or low, as well as to more fully understand the factors influencing health of wild apes at both the population and individual level.

ABSTRACT: With data accumulating from a growing pool of chimpanzee field studies, new behaviors as well as novel variants on common behaviors continue to be described. Nest construction is a universal behavior in wild great apes. Among chimpanzee populations, reported variation in nest building behavior mostly reflects environmental constraints. Despite the ubiquity of nest making by chimpanzees, only ground nesting has been recognized as a behavioral variant, potentially determined by both environmental and social factors. In a study of nests made by chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) in Bulindi, Uganda, I identified a hitherto undescribed nest construction technique, termed ‘nest tying’. Five observed nests lacked strong weight-bearing structures beneath them, such as large branches or a supporting trunk. Instead, the nests appeared ‘tied’ (or ‘tethered’) to an adjacent trunk by looping leafy stems or palm fronds around it and interweaving these into the nest mattress, securing the nest against the trunk; thus, nest tying presumably functions to provide added stability and support. This preliminary report presents a description of the observed nests. Irrespective of whether nest tying constitutes true knot making—commonly considered absent in wild great apes—this nest construction technique would seem to require advanced dexterity and a sophisticated understanding of the mechanical properties of the plants used. Forest fragments in Bulindi are highly degraded. Thus, nest tying—and construction of integrated nests (i.e., utilizing multiple plants, often small trees and shrubs) generally—may be promoted by a relative paucity of suitable nesting trees at this site. Still, insofar as nest building is learned in chimpanzees, different construction techniques including nest tying are potentially acquired through social learning. Further investigation is required to ascertain the prevalence and acquisition of this nest construction technique at Bulindi, and to verify its presence or absence in other habitats. © 2018, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Many researchers consider language to be definitionally unique to humans. However, increasing evidence suggests that language emerged via a series of adaptations to neural systems supporting earlier capacities for visuomotor integration and manual action. This paper reviews comparative neuroscience evidence for the evolutionary progression of these adaptations. An outstanding question is how to mechanistically explain the emergence of new capacities from pre-existing circuitry. One possibility is that human brains May have undergone selection for greater plasticity, reducing the extent to which brain organization is hard-wired and increasing the extent to which it is shaped by socially transmitted, learned behaviors. Mutations that made these new abilities easier or faster to learn would have undergone positive selection, and over time, the neural changes once associated with individual neural plasticity would tend to become heritable, innate, and fixed. Clearly, though, language is not entirely “innate;” it does not emerge without the requisite environmental input and experience. Thus, a mechanistic explanation for the evolution of language must address the inherent trade-off between the evolutionary pressure for underlying neural systems to be flexible and sensitive to environmental input vs. the tendency over time for continually adaptive behaviors to become reliably expressed in an early-emerging, canalized, less flexible manner. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.

ABSTRACT: Early life experiences are known to influence hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis development, which can impact health outcomes through the individual's ability to mount appropriate physiological reactions to stressors. In primates, these early experiences are most often mediated through the mother and can include the physiological environment experienced during gestation. Here, we investigate stress physiology of dependent offspring in wild chimpanzees for the first time and examine whether differences in maternal stress physiology are related to differences in offspring stress physiology. Specifically, we explore the relationship between maternal rank and maternal fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) concentration during pregnancy and early lactation (first 6 months post-partum) and examine whether differences based on maternal rank are associated with dependent offspring FGM concentrations. We found that low-ranking females exhibited significantly higher FGM concentrations during pregnancy than during the first 6 months of lactation. Furthermore, during pregnancy, low-ranking females experienced significantly higher FGM concentrations than high-ranking females. As for dependent offspring, we found that male offspring of low-ranking mothers experienced stronger decreases in FGM concentrations as they aged compared to males with high-ranking mothers or their dependent female counterparts. Together, these results suggest that maternal rank and FGM concentrations experienced during gestation are related to offspring stress physiology and that this relationship is particularly pronounced in males compared to females. Importantly, this study provides the first evidence for maternal effects on the development of offspring HPA function in wild chimpanzees, which likely relates to subsequent health and fitness outcomes.

ABSTRACT: In contrast to a wealth of human studies, little is known about the ontogeny and consistency of empathy-related capacities in other species. Consolation - post-conflict affiliation from uninvolved bystanders to distressed others - is a suggested marker of empathetic concern in non-human animals. Using longitudinal data comprising nearly a decade of observations on over 3000 conflict interactions in 44 chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), we provide evidence for relatively stable individual differences in consolation behaviour. Across development, individuals consistently differ from one another in this trait, with higher consolatory tendencies predicting better social integration, a sign of social competence. Further, similar to recent results in other ape species, but in contrast to many human self-reported findings, older chimpanzees are less likely to console than are younger individuals. Overall, given the link between consolation and empathy, these findings help elucidate the development of individual socio-cognitive and -emotional abilities in one of our closest relatives. © 2017 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Tropical forests and the biodiversity within them are rapidly declining in the face of increasing human populations. Resource management and conservation of endangered species requires an understanding of how species perceive and respond to their environments. Species distribution modeling (SDM) is an appropriate tool for identifying conservation areas of concern and importance. In this study, SDM was used to identify areas of suitable chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) habitat within the Greater Nimba Landscape, Guinea, West Africa. This location was ideal for investigating the effects of landscape structure on habitat suitability due to the topographic variation of the landscape and the Critically Endangered status of the Western chimpanzee. Additionally, this is the only mountainous, long-term chimpanzee study site and little is known about the effects of topography on chimpanzee behavior. Suitable habitat was predicted based on the location of direct and indirect signs of chimpanzee presence and the spatial distribution of 12 biophysical variables within the study area. Model performance was assessed by examining the area under the curve. The overall predictive performance of the model was 0.721. The variables most influencing habitat suitability were the normalized difference vegetation index (37.8%), elevation (27.3%), hierarchical slope position (11.5%), surface brightness (6.6%), and distance to rivers (5.4%). The final model highlighted the isolation and fragmentation of chimpanzee habitat within the Greater Nimba Landscape. Understanding the factors influencing chimpanzee habitat suitability, specifically the biophysical variables considered in this study, will greatly contribute to conservation efforts by providing quantitative habitat information and improving survey efficiency. © 2018, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Surveying and monitoring primate populations is key for conservation decision-making. The western chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) has recently been up-listed to “Critically Endangered” on the IUCN Red List. Population status and trends of the remaining populations of chimpanzees almost always rely on counts of sleeping nests along line transects. In tropical forests, permanent line transects can facilitate survey work but may also be avoided by animals, complicating data analysis and possibly resulting in erroneous estimates. We conducted surveys in Liberia’s Sapo National Park and its buffer zone along clear-cut (‘permanent’) and uncut (‘temporary’) line transects to estimate chimpanzee abundance and compare chimpanzee densities inside and outside the park. We recorded all indirect signs of chimpanzee presence and human activities on 16 permanent transects in Sapo and six temporary transects in the surrounding buffer zone. Our analysis revealed a population density of 0.83 individuals/km2 across the park and its buffer zone. Compared to previous estimates, this suggests a relatively stable population over the past eight years of roughly 1,000 chimpanzees. It appears that poaching and habitat encroachment, which has persisted in the area since the first chimpanzee survey in 2009, did not have a significant negative affect on population growth over time. Possible reasons for this include local taboos against killing chimpanzees, poachers not targeting chimpanzees directly, and the chimpanzees’ behavioral flexibility. Nest encounter rate inside the park was considerably lower than in the buffer zone and significantly fewer nests were found on or near permanent transect lines (19%) than temporary transects (44%), indicating an avoidance effect of chimpanzees towards the former. The study also shows that permanent transects were frequently used by illegal miners and poachers, providing direct evidence of the impact that humans have on chimpanzee habitat use and the potential negative implications of cutting permanent transect lines on wildlife in the park. We call for an increase in conservation and law enforcement efforts to protect depletion of wildlife resources from the park. We also stress the need for legal enforcement of the park’s buffer zone, in order to effectively protect wildlife against poaching, habitat destruction and disease, to ensure the continued survival of chimpanzees in Liberia’s oldest national park. © 2018 Primate Specialist Group.All right reserved.

ABSTRACT: Introduction: In recent years, replication-defective chimpanzee-derived adenoviruses have been extensively evaluated as genetic vaccines. These vectors share desirable properties with human adenoviruses like the broad tissue tropism and the ease of large-scale manufacturing. Additionally, chimpanzee adenoviruses have the advantage to overcome the negative impact of pre-existing anti-human adenovirus immunity. Areas covered: Here the authors review current pre-clinical research and clinical trials that utilize chimpanzee-derived adenoviral vectors as vaccines. A wealth of studies are ongoing to evaluate different vector backbones and administration routes with the aim of improving immune responses. The challenges associated with the identification of an optimal chimpanzee vector and immunization strategies for different immunological outcomes will be discussed. Expert commentary: The demonstration that chimpanzee adenoviruses can be safely used in humans has paved the way to the use of a whole new array of vectors of different serotypes. However, so far no predictive signature of vector immunity in humans has been identified. The high magnitude of T cell responses elicited by chimpanzee adenoviruses has allowed dissecting the qualitative aspects that may be important for protective immunity. Ultimately, only the results from the most clinically advanced products will help establish the efficacy of the vaccine vector platform in the field of disease prevention. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to investigate whether chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) could learn a transverse pattern by being trained in the rules of the rock–paper–scissors game in which “paper” beats “rock,” “rock” beats “scissors,” and “scissors” beats “paper.” Additionally, this study compared the learning processes between chimpanzees and children. Seven chimpanzees were tested using a computer-controlled task. They were trained to choose the stronger of two options according to the game rules. The chimpanzees first engaged in the paper–rock sessions until they reached the learning criterion. Subsequently, they engaged in the rock–scissors and scissors–paper sessions, before progressing to sessions with all three pairs mixed. Five of the seven chimpanzees completed training after a mean of 307 sessions, which indicates that they learned the circular pattern. The chimpanzees required more scissors–paper sessions (14.29 ± 6.89), the third learnt pair, than paper–rock (1.71 ± 0.18) and rock–scissors (3.14 ± 0.70) sessions, suggesting they had difficulty finalizing the circularity. The chimpanzees then received generalization tests using new stimuli, which they learned quickly. A similar procedure was performed with children (35–71 months, n = 38) who needed the same number of trials for all three pairs during single-paired sessions. Their accuracy during the mixed-pair sessions improved with age and was better than chance from 50 months of age, which indicates that the ability to solve the transverse patterning problem might develop at around 4 years of age. The present findings show that chimpanzees were able to learn the task but had difficulties with circularity, whereas children learned the task more easily and developed the relevant ability at approximately 4 years of age. Furthermore, the chimpanzees’ performance during the mixed-pair sessions was similar to that of 4-year-old children during the corresponding stage of training. © 2017, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan KK.

ABSTRACT: The 2014-15 Ebola outbreak in West Africa highlighted the potential for large disease outbreaks caused by emerging pathogens and has generated considerable focus on preparedness for future epidemics. Here we discuss drivers, strategies and practical considerations for developing vaccines against outbreak pathogens. Chimpanzee adenoviral (ChAd) vectors have been developed as vaccine candidates for multiple infectious diseases and prostate cancer. ChAd vectors are safe and induce antigen-specific cellular and humoral immunity in all age groups, as well as circumventing the problem of pre-existing immunity encountered with human Ad vectors. For these reasons, such viral vectors provide an attractive platform for stockpiling vaccines for emergency deployment in response to a threatened outbreak of an emerging pathogen. Work is already underway to develop vaccines against a number of other outbreak pathogens and we will also review progress on these approaches here, particularly for Lassa fever, Nipah and MERS. © 2017 Katie Ewer, Sarah Sebastian, Alexandra J.

ABSTRACT: During the demographic history of the Pan clade, there has been gene-flow between species, likely >200,000 years ago. Bonobo haplotypes in three subspecies of chimpanzee have been identified to be segregating in modern-day chimpanzee populations, suggesting that these haplotypes, with increased differentiation, may be a target of natural selection. Here, we investigate signatures of adaptive introgression within the bonobo-like haplotypes in chimpanzees using site frequency spectrum-based tests. We find evidence for subspecies-specific adaptations in introgressed regions involved with male reproduction in central chimpanzees, the immune system in eastern chimpanzees, female reproduction and the nervous system in Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzees. Furthermore, our results indicate signatures of balancing selection in some of the putatively introgressed regions. This might be the product of long-term balancing selection resulting in a similar genomic signature as introgression, or possibly balancing selection acting on alleles reintroduced through gene flow. © The Author(s) 2018.

ABSTRACT: If Wolff's law is valid, then quantifying the three-dimensional architecture of trabecular bone, specifically 3D principal trabecular orientation (3D-PTO), can reveal joint loading direction among different taxa. This study measured the architecture of trabecular bone in the 3rd metacarpal head of humans and chimpanzees, and then tested their association with expected joint loading direction. We postulate that since chimpanzees, unlike humans, directly load their metacarpal bones during knuckle-walking, trabecular structure in the dorsal aspect of the 3rd metacarpal head will be significantly more organized and robust in chimpanzees. To test this hypothesis, we micro-CT scanned the 3rd metacarpal from 11 chimpanzees and 12 humans. Three 6 mm volumes of interest (VOI; palmar, center and dorsal) were selected and trabecular bone properties and 3D-PTO were measured. The results revealed many similarities between humans and chimpanzees: in both taxa the dorsal VOI demonstrated the lowest bone volume fraction (BV/TV), the most rod-like trabecular structure, the fewest and thinnest trabeculae, and low organization of the trabecular architecture (degree of anisotropy). Nevertheless, 3D-PTO in the dorsal VOI differed significantly between humans and chimpanzees. While 3D-PTO in humans was clustered together and aligned nearly along the bone long axis, in chimpanzees 3D-PTO was divided into two distinct groups and aligned with an angle toward either the medial or lateral orientations. Our results suggest that loading effects on trabecular bone properties such as BV/TV might be partially constrained by genetic factors. On the other hand, 3D-PTO is continually affected by active loading (i.e., modeling) and thus may serve as a useful tool to infer differences in joint loading directions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The common deletion of the glutathione S-transferase Mu 1 (GSTM1) gene in humans has been shown to be involved in xenobiotic metabolism and associated with bladder cancer. However, the evolution of this deletion has not been investigated. RESULTS: In this study, we conducted comparative analyses of primate genomes. We demonstrated that the GSTM gene family has evolved through multiple structural variations, involving gene duplications, losses, large inversions and gene conversions. We further showed experimentally that the GSTM1 was polymorphically deleted in both humans and also in chimpanzees, through independent deletion events. To generalize our results, we searched for genic deletions that are polymorphic in both humans and chimpanzees. Consequently, we found only two such deletions among the thousands that we have searched, one of them being the GSTM1 deletion and the other surprisingly being another metabolizing gene, the UGT2B17. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results support the emerging notion that metabolizing gene families, such as the GSTM, NAT, UGT and CYP, have been evolving rapidly through gene duplication and deletion events in primates, leading to complex structural variation within and among species with unknown evolutionary consequences.

ABSTRACT: Adenoviral vector has been employed as one of the most efficient means against infectious diseases and cancer. It can be genetically modified and armed with foreign antigens to elicit specific antibody responses and T cell responses in hosts as well as engineered to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. The chimpanzee adenovirus-based vector is one kind of novel vaccine carriers whose unique features and non-reactivity to pre-existing human adenovirus neutralizing antibodies makes it an outstanding candidate for vaccine research and development. Here, we review the different strategies for constructing chimpanzee adenoviral vectors and their applications in recent clinical trials and also discuss the oncolytic virotherapy and immunotherapy based on chimpanzee adenoviral vectors. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

ABSTRACT: Play is sometimes considered as an indicator of positive animal welfare. However, it is not yet sufficiently understood whether or not social play among adults can be considered as such an indicator because it is rare in adult animals. This study investigates the factors that influence social play in adult captive chimpanzees in order to discuss its function and use as a welfare indicator. The subjects were 37 adult chimpanzees (17 males and 20 females) living in Kumamoto Sanctuary, Kyoto University, Japan. We completed 367 h of behavioural observation of mixed-sex and all-male groups of chimpanzees between June and July 2014, and December 2014 and March 2015, respectively. We collected data on social play, social grooming (mutual and unilateral grooming), aggressive interactions, self-directed behaviours and abnormal behaviours. We checked the relationship between social play and age, sex, timing, social group formation and different social behaviours. The results reveal that social play increased in males of all-male groups compared to those of mixed-sex groups. Furthermore, we analysed behaviours in individuals from all-male groups and found that social play increased before feeding. In addition, although mutual social grooming showed a negative correlation with aggressive interactions, social play did not show such a relationship. Furthermore, social play and mutual social grooming were negatively correlated. These results suggest that social play may be used as a means to reduce social tension and that it does not necessarily indicate that the individuals formed affiliative social relationships such as mutual social grooming indicates. Therefore, although social play is important to enable the coexistence of multiple adult males who do not always get along well, we need to be cautious when interpreting social play from the view of animal welfare. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Adrenergic α2C receptor (ADRA2C) is an inhibitory modulator of the sympathetic nervous system. Knockout mice for this gene show physiological and behavioural alterations that are associated with the fight-or-flight response. There is evidence of positive selection on the regulation of this gene during chicken domestication. Here, we find that the neuronal expression of ADRA2C is lower in human and chimpanzee than in other primates. On the basis of three-dimensional chromatin structure, we identified a cis-regulatory region whose DNA sequences have been significantly accelerated in human and chimpanzee. Active histone modification marks this region in rhesus macaque but not in human and chimpanzee; instead, repressive marks are enriched in various human brain samples. This region contains two neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF) binding motifs, each of which harbours a polymorphism. Our genotyping and analysis of population genome data indicate that at both polymorphic sites, the derived allele has reached fixation in humans and chimpanzees but not in bonobos, whereas only the ancestral allele is present among macaques. Our CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and reporter assays show that both derived nucleotides repress ADRA2C, most likely by increasing NRSF binding. In addition, we detected signatures of recent positive selection for lower neuronal ADRA2C expression in humans. Our findings indicate that there has been selective pressure for enhanced sympathetic nervous activity in the evolution of humans and chimpanzees. © 2018 Lee et al.

ABSTRACT: While West African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) were elevated to Critically Endangered status by the IUCN in 2016 as a result of significant population declines in recent decades, little is known about the population in Senegal. We surveyed the West African chimpanzees outside protected areas in the Kedougou region of southeastern Senegal between November 2014 and July 2015 using recce walks (n = 57, totalling 300 km of pedestrian survey distance) in potential chimpanzee habitats. We recorded direct observations of chimpanzees or indices of chimpanzee activity, such as sleeping nests, footprints and faeces. We accumulated 21 direct contacts with chimpanzees and recorded 3489 chimpanzee nests. We mapped the distribution of chimpanzee sleeping sites and indicators of anthropogenic activity by regional administrative units to facilitate species management and conservation planning in the immediate future. In addition, we identified the habitats and tree species used by chimpanzees to construct their nests in order to explore nesting tree preferences. Chimpanzees used almost 40 tree species in the Kedougou region but 84% of nests were associated with eight tree species, namely Pterocarpus erinaceus, Diospyrosmespiliformis, Anogeissus leiocarpus, Hexalobus monopetalus, Cola cordifolia, Lannea sp., Parkia biglobosa and Piliostigma thonningii. Among these eight nesting tree species, 60% of the corresponding nests were located in three species: P. erinaceus, D. mespiliformis and A. leiocarpus. Chimpanzees nested more often in woodland habitat than in gallery forests, although the latter accounts for only a small percentage of available habitat. This study is the most geographically extensive survey of chimpanzees in Senegal to date, broadening our knowledge of the species' northwestern-most distribution in West Africa. © 2021 African Journal of Wildlife Research.

ABSTRACT: Cultural diversity among social groups has recently been documented in multiple animal species. Investigations of the origin and spread of diverse behaviour at group level in wild-ranging animals have added valuable information on social learning mechanisms under natural conditions. Behavioural diversity has been especially informative in the case of dispersal, where the transfer of individuals between groups leads to a sudden exposure to unfamiliar behaviour. Little is known, however, about the underlying costs and benefits of cultural transmission in animals and humans alike, as efficiency of cultural variants is often difficult to measure. The chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, of the Taï National Park in Ivory Coast are known to exhibit a number of cultural differences between social groups, including hammer selection for nut cracking. This provides the unique opportunity to quantify the efficiency of cultural variants. We compared foraging speed and number of hits applied during nut-cracking events between three neighbouring chimpanzee groups. Our results showed significant differences in nut-cracking efficiency, caused by hammer material selection and differences in the applied power of impact per nut. Persistent behavioural coherence within the respective groups implies that immigrants adjust their behaviour to local nut-cracking techniques, even when individual foraging success might be compromised. This suggests that the benefit of belonging to a social group might outweigh the benefits of maximizing individual foraging efficiency. The differences in nut-cracking efficiency between chimpanzee groups add to the ever-growing body of cultural variants in wild chimpanzees and expand our knowledge of the importance of group belonging and conformity in wild chimpanzees. © 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ABSTRACT: The objective assessment of animal welfare is important for building consensus among people concerned with animals and for advancing our understanding of animals in our care. The analysis of physiological stress response using glucocor-ticoids is one of the major approaches for animal welfare assessment. Recently, cortisol accumulated in hair or other keratinous materials of animals has been considered as an indicator of the long-term activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Particularly, there is evidence that hair cortisol (HC) can be used as a measure of the long-term activation of the HPA axis in various mammals. This review discusses the utility and limitations of HC analysis for welfare assessment, mainly based on findings from captive chimpanzees living in a sanctuary in Japan. First, the methodological and physiological perspectives of how to to obtain reliable results from HC analysis will be discussed; and second, the potential of using HC analysis for welfare assessment will be reviewed. A series of studies on captive chimpanzees show that HC is useful for monitoring the effects of social management on the long-term stress levels in captive chimpanzees. Although further studies are needed to clarify the extent to which HC monitoring can help us understand and improve animal welfare, application of HC analysis might be useful in investigating similar issues in marine mammals. © 2018, European Association for Aquatic Mammals.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Apart from the crucial bonds between mothers and offspring, siblings are an important first social partner in most primate species. Socioecological theory predicts that sibling-infant interactions may differ depending on whether the older immature sibling is male or female. Here, we used 24 years of long-term data from wild chimpanzees in Gombe National Park, Tanzania, to characterize maternal sibling-infant relationships and investigate sex differences therein. Since young female primates typically exhibit higher rates of interest in infants, we hypothesized that older sisters would be more likely than older brothers to groom, play with, and carry infant siblings. Alternatively, due to male-biased philopatry in this species, older brothers may be equally or more likely to interact with these potential future allies. We also examined whether sibling-infant interactions differed according to sibling age and sex of the infant. For both play and grooming, we found a significant interaction between sibling age and sibling sex. Older brothers had increased likelihood of playing and grooming with infant siblings as they themselves aged. Additionally, male-male siblings played significantly more than any other dyad type. Older sisters had decreased likelihood of playing with age and maintained relatively consistent likelihood of grooming; they also spent more time with their infant siblings at later ages. Instances of carrying young infants were exceedingly rare and did not differ by sibling sex. Thus, the sex combination of sibling-infant dyads may have substantial consequences for the social development of both individuals, which we argue is an important focus of future research. Significance statement: The role of siblings in nonhuman primate social development is relatively understudied, and socioecological theory predicts that male and female siblings may interact differently with infants. We conducted the most detailed investigation to date of sibling relationships in wild chimpanzees and found distinct differences in how immature brothers and sisters interact with infant siblings. Older brothers have an increased likelihood of playing and grooming with infant siblings as they themselves age. We also found that male-male siblings played more than all other dyad types, which may have consequences for fostering alliances in adulthood. Older sisters show decreased likelihood of playing with age and maintain relatively consistent likelihood of grooming; they also spend more time with their infant siblings at later ages. We argue that a renewed focus on understanding the importance of siblings on primate social development is warranted. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees are important referential models for the study of life history in hominin evolution. Age at sexual maturity and first reproduction are key life history milestones that mark the diversion of energy from growth to reproduction and are essential in comparing life history trajectories between chimpanzees and humans. Yet, accurate information on ages at these milestones in wild chimpanzees is difficult to obtain because most females transfer before breeding. Precise age at first birth is only known from a relatively small number of non-dispersing individuals. Moreover, due to small sample sizes, the degree to which age at maturation milestones varies is unknown. Here we report maturation milestones and explore sources of variance for 36 wild female chimpanzees of known age, including eight dispersing females born in Gombe National Park, Tanzania. Using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, including censored intervals, we find an average age of 11.5 years (range 8.5–13.9) at sexual maturity and 14.9 years (range 11.1–22.1) at first birth. These values exceed previously published averages for wild chimpanzees by one or more years. Even in this larger sample, age at first birth is likely underestimated due to the disproportionate number of non-dispersing females, which, on average, give birth two years earlier than dispersing females. Model selection using Cox Proportional Hazards models shows that age at sexual maturity is delayed in females orphaned before age eight years and those born to low-ranking mothers. Age at first birth is most delayed in dispersing females and those orphaned before age eight years. These data provide improved estimates of maturation milestones in a population of wild female chimpanzees and indicate the importance of maternal factors in development. © 2017 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Despite the fact that many primates consume vertebrate prey, surprisingly little is known about the nutritional benefits of eating meat for members of this diverse order. Although chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) primarily eat plant source foods, especially fruit, they consume vertebrate prey with excitement, attesting to its nutritional value. Meat is a concentrated source of macro- and micronutrients; however, a carcass is not a uniform package. For example, the mammalian brain has considerably higher fat content than lean muscle tissue. The brain both has great caloric value and contains high concentrations of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are critical for normal brain function. It thus represents a large, nutrient-dense source of energy and essential nutrients that should be highly valued. We filmed consumption of 29 arboreal monkeys by chimpanzees at Gombe National Park, Tanzania, and recorded the order in which general regions of the body were consumed. Overall, the head was significantly more likely to be targeted first than either the torso (including viscera) or appendages. This result was driven by subadult prey, 91% of which were eaten head-first, probably because their skulls were relatively easy for chimpanzees to break with a single bite. Possessors of adult prey (with robust skulls) often first selected the viscera, probably to harvest the fat-rich liver, thus maximizing immediate return in the face of the threat of harassment or theft. This has important implications for our understanding of the nutritional benefits of meat eating among primates, and highlights the need for future studies that measure the nutritional content of specific tissues and examine which are preferentially consumed or shared. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Comparative data on the diets of extant primates inform hypotheses about hominin resource use. Historically, data describing chimpanzee diets stem primarily from forest-dwelling communities, and we lack comparative data from chimpanzees that live in mosaic habitats that more closely resemble those reconstructed for Plio-Pleistocene hominins. We present data on the diet of a partially-habituated community of open habitat chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) from the Issa valley, western Tanzania, collected over a four-year period. Based mostly on macroscopic faecal analysis, Issa chimpanzees consumed a minimum of 69 plant species. There was no relationship between plant consumption and either fruit availability or feeding tree density; the most frequently consumed plant species were found in riverine forests, with woodland species consumed more frequently during the late dry season. We conclude by contextualising these findings with those of other open-habitat chimpanzee sites, and also by discussing how our results contribute towards reconstructions of early hominin exploitation of mosaic landscapes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: As our closest primate relatives, chimpanzees offer tantalizing clues about the behavior of early human ancestors. This book provides a rich and detailed portrait of chimpanzee social life in the wild, synthesizing hundreds of thousands of hours of research at seven long-term field sites. Why are the social lives of males and females so different? Why do groups of males sometimes seek out and kill neighboring individuals? Do chimpanzees cooperate when they hunt monkeys? Is their vocal behaviour like human speech? Are there different chimpanzee 'cultures'? Addressing these questions and more, Adam Arcadi presents a fascinating introduction to the chimpanzee social universe and the challenges we face in trying to save this species from extinction. With extensive notes organized by field site and an appendix describing field methods, this book is indispensable for students, researchers, and anyone else interested in the remarkable and complex world of these intelligent apes. © Adam Clark Arcadi 2018.

ABSTRACT: Social play is common among many group-living animals, but the benefits are not well understood. Proposed benefits include increased muscle coordination as the result of increased locomotor versatility and development, and strengthened social bonds through interactions with like-aged individuals. In this study, we used 33 years of long-term behavioral data on infant chimpanzees in Gombe National Park, Tanzania, to examine these potential benefits of social play, specifically how the percentage of time engaged in social play relates to motor and social developmental milestones. We predicted that infants who engaged in more social play would achieve motor and social milestones at younger ages. We found that individuals that spent more time engaging in social play achieved the motor milestones of riding dorsally and traveling independently at earlier ages. Additionally, we found that the amount of play was correlated with earlier ages for reaching the social milestones of spatial independence from mother, first grooming of non-maternal kin, and first observed mating attempt. This is the first study in great apes to demonstrate a relationship between play behavior and developmental milestones, supporting the hypotheses that play provides motor, and social benefits. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: For humans, there appears to be a clear link between general intelligence and self-control behavior, such as sustained delay of gratification [1–9]. Chimpanzees also delay gratification [10–12] and can be given tests of general intelligence (g) [13–15], but these two constructs have never been compared within the same sample of nonhuman animals. We presented 40 chimpanzees with the hybrid delay task (HDT) [16, 17], which measures inter-temporal choices and the capacity for sustained delay of gratification, and the primate cognitive test battery (PCTB), which measures g in chimpanzees [13–15]. Importantly, none of the sub-tasks in the PCTB directly assesses self-control or other forms of behavioral inhibition. Rather, they assess areas of physical cognition (e.g., quantity discrimination) or social cognition (e.g., gaze following). In three phases of testing, we consistently found that the strongest relation was between chimpanzee g scores and efficiency in the HDT. Chimpanzee g was not most closely related to the proportion of trials the chimpanzees chose to try to wait for delayed rewards, but rather most closely related to how good they were at waiting for those rewards when they chose to do so. We also found the same strong relation between HDT efficiency and those factors in the PCTB that loaded most strongly on chimpanzee g. These results highlight that, as with humans, there is a strong relation between chimpanzees’ self-control and overall intelligence—a relation that likely reflects the role of successful inhibitory control during cognitive processing of information and intelligent decision-making. In humans, there is a consistent relation that has been reported between self-control and general intelligence. Beran and Hopkins report the same relation in chimpanzees that were given a test of delay of gratification and a battery of social and cognitive tasks that measure general intelligence. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Savanna-mosaic habitats are thought to represent exceptional circumstances for chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), and owing to the virtues of their habitat as well as peripheral biogeographic location, they are often regarded as marginal to the chimpanzee ecological niche. If these habitats are marginal, then we should expect that chimpanzees living in these habitats demonstrate physiological consequences of the extremity of this environment. We therefore compared seasonal variation in physiological responses to climatic and ecological factors in chimpanzees inhabiting Fongoli, a savanna-mosaic habitat at the margins of the chimpanzee range with chimpanzees from Taï National Park, a lowland rainforest centrally located within the West African chimpanzee subspecies (P. troglodytes verus) range. We accomplished this using urinary biomarkers of hydration (creatinine), energetic status (c-peptide), and stress (cortisol) collected simultaneously from research stations at each location. We found that Fongoli was both more extreme and seasonal in climatic measures like temperature and rainfall, although food availability was more variable at Taï than at Fongoli. Although living in an extreme and seasonally more variable environment, Fongoli chimpanzees were more stable in their c-peptide values than Taï chimpanzees, but showed more extreme variation in their cortisol values. Although chimpanzees at both sites demonstrated significant seasonal effects of dehydration (creatinine), the more extreme environmental variation at Fongoli promoted higher physiological seasonal costs in the form of elevated cortisol levels. Overall, these results supported the assertion that Fongoli as a savanna-mosaic habitat is more extreme in its climate and ecology than a forested site. It appears that extreme savanna-mosaic habitats represent a limit to the chimpanzee ecological niche with regard to thermoregulation, in that seasonal environmental conditions, namely the hot and dry conditions of the dry season, strain an individual's ability to maintain homeostasis. However, Taï chimpanzees also faced dehydration as a limitation, which highlights that chimpanzees may experience certain challenges ubiquitously across their range, while other challenges remain habitat-specific. Hence, categorizing savanna habitats as universally more severe and challenging to chimpanzees than more heavily forested habitats does not yet appear to be warranted. © 2018 Wessling, Deschner, Mundry, Pruetz, Wittig and Kühl.

ABSTRACT: Due to their genetic relatedness, great apes are highly susceptible to common human respiratory pathogens. Although most respiratory pathogens, such as human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV), rarely cause severe disease in healthy human adults, they are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality in wild great apes habituated to humans for research or tourism. To prevent pathogen transmission, most great ape projects have established a set of hygiene measures ranging from keeping a specific distance, to the use of surgical masks and establishment of quarantines. This study investigates the incidence of respiratory symptoms and human respiratory viruses in humans at a human-great ape interface, the Taï Chimpanzee Project (TCP) in Côte d'Ivoire, and consequently, the effectiveness of a 5-day quarantine designed to reduce the risk of potential exposure to human respiratory pathogens. To assess the impact of quarantine as a preventative measure, we monitored the quarantine process and tested 262 throat swabs for respiratory viruses, collected during quarantine over a period of 1 year. Although only 1 subject tested positive for a respiratory virus (HRSV), 17 subjects developed symptoms of infection while in quarantine and were subsequently kept from approaching the chimpanzees, preventing potential exposure in 18 cases. Our results suggest that quarantine—in combination with monitoring for symptoms—is effective in reducing the risk of potential pathogen exposure. This research contributes to our understanding of how endangered great apes can be protected from human-borne infectious disease. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Background: All symptoms of malaria are caused by the intraerythrocytic proliferation of Plasmodium merozoites. Merozoites invade erythrocytes using multiple binding ligands that recognise specific surface receptors. It has been suggested that adaptation of Plasmodium parasites to infect specific hosts is driven by changes in genes encoding Plasmodium erythrocyte-binding ligands (EBL) and reticulocyte-binding ligands (RBL). Homologs of both EBL and RBL, including the EBA-140 merozoite ligand, have been identified in P. falciparum and P. reichenowi, which infect humans and chimpanzees, respectively. The P. falciparum EBA-140 was shown to bind human glycophorin C, a minor erythrocyte sialoglycoprotein. Until now, the erythrocyte receptor for the P. reichenowi EBA-140 remained unknown. Methods: The baculovirus expression vector system was used to obtain the recombinant EBA-140 Region II, and flow cytometry and immunoblotting methods were applied to characterise its specificity. Results: We showed that the chimpanzee glycophorin D is the receptor for the P. reichenowi EBA-140 ligand on chimpanzee red blood cells. Conclusions: We propose that the development of glycophorin C specificity is spurred by the P. falciparum lineage. We speculate that the P. falciparum EBA-140 evolved to hijack GPC on human erythrocytes during divergence from its ape ancestor. © 2017 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Theory of mind-the ability to reason about the thoughts and emotions of others-is central to what makes us human. Chimpanzees too appear to understand some psychological states. While less is known about bonobos, several lines of evidence suggest that the social-cognitive abilities of the two sister taxa may differ in key respects. This chapter outlines a framework to guide future research on bonobo social cognition based on the predictions of two potentially complementary hypotheses. The self-domestication hypothesis suggests that selection against aggression and for prosociality in bonobos may have impacted the ontogeny of their social-cognitive skills relative to chimpanzees. The empathizing-systemizing hypothesis links degree of prenatal brain masculinization, a potential result of self-domestication, to adult cognition. Specifically, relative feminization may yield more flexible theory of mind skills in bonobos than chimpanzees. Finally, directions for future study, including development of new paradigms that maximize ecological validity for bonobos, are discussed. © Oxford University Press 2017.

ABSTRACT: Background: Cross-sectional surveys of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) communities across sub-Saharan Africa show large geographical variation in malaria parasite (Plasmodium spp.) prevalence. The drivers leading to this apparent spatial heterogeneity may also be temporally dynamic but data on prevalence variation over time are missing for wild great apes. This study aims to fill this fundamental gap. Methods: Some 681 faecal samples were collected from 48 individuals of a group of habituated chimpanzees (Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire) across four non-consecutive sampling periods between 2005 and 2015. Results: Overall, 89 samples (13%) were PCR-positive for malaria parasite DNA. The proportion of positive samples ranged from 0 to 43% per month and 4 to 27% per sampling period. Generalized Linear Mixed Models detected significant seasonal and inter-annual variation, with seasonal increases during the wet seasons and apparently stochastic inter-annual variation. Younger individuals were also significantly more likely to test positive. Conclusions: These results highlight strong temporal fluctuations of malaria parasite detection rates in wild chimpanzees. They suggest that the identification of other drivers of malaria parasite prevalence will require longitudinal approaches and caution against purely cross-sectional studies, which may oversimplify the dynamics of this host-parasite system. © 2018 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Examples abound of national and international legal developments that indicate growing concern and respect for animals. However, a key barrier remains: animals are not recognized as legal persons and therefore do not have standing to pursue independent legal action. This significantly limits the scope for legal redress when animals' interests are harmed. This article examines recent attempts in the United States and Europe to establish standing for animals via strategic litigation and the barriers that have so far undermined this project. The article argues that, despite their lack of success to date, cases that seek to establish standing for animals should continue to be pursued. Societal views about the value of animals' lives are continually evolving such that these cases may soon be successful. Furthermore, even if unsuccessful, these cases help in creating the socio-cultural space required to redefine the human-animal divide and potentially transform animals into rights bearers. © 2017 Cambridge University Press.

ABSTRACT: Many primate studies have investigated discrimination of individual faces within the same species. However, few studies have looked at discrimination between primate species faces at the categorical level. This study systematically examined the factors important for visual discrimination between primate species faces in chimpanzees, including: colour, orientation, familiarity, and perceptual similarity. Five adult female chimpanzees were tested on their ability to discriminate identical and categorical (non-identical) images of different primate species faces in a series of touchscreen matching-to-sample experiments. Discrimination performance for chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan faces was better in colour than in greyscale. An inversion effect was also found, with higher accuracy for upright than inverted faces. Discrimination performance for unfamiliar (baboon and capuchin monkey) and highly familiar (chimpanzee and human) but perceptually different species was equally high. After excluding effects of colour and familiarity, difficulty in discriminating between different species faces can be best explained by their perceptual similarity to each other. Categorical discrimination performance for unfamiliar, perceptually similar faces (gorilla and orangutan) was significantly worse than unfamiliar, perceptually different faces (baboon and capuchin monkey). Moreover, multidimensional scaling analysis of the image similarity data based on local feature matching revealed greater similarity between chimpanzee, gorilla and orangutan faces than between human, baboon and capuchin monkey faces. We conclude our chimpanzees appear to perceive similarity in primate faces in a similar way to humans. Information about perceptual similarity is likely prioritized over the potential influence of previous experience or a conceptual representation of species for categorical discrimination between species faces. © 2018, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The extraction of timber often conflicts with the well-being and conservation of wildlife. In particular, there is a need to better understand the impact of tree removal under selective logging regimes on local ecological communities. We conducted ape nest counts along line transects before, during, and after logging to assess the impact of timber harvesting and associated activities on sympatric chimpanzees and gorillas in a forestry concession in northern Republic of Congo. We used generalized linear models to relate ape nest counts to a set of predictor variables, representing the impact of logging and controlled for variation in environmental conditions including food availability, habitat and rainfall. Commercial forest inventory data were used to assess the baseline influence of food availability and forest structure on ape distribution. Higher numbers of chimpanzees were found in proximity to their preferred tree foods, whereas gorillas were associated with more heterogeneous habitats. Chimpanzee nest encounter rates decreased with increasing intensity of human impacts. Gorillas also avoided areas with active timber exploitation and roads, but were attracted to recently logged areas with abundant terrestrial herbaceous vegetation. Species-specific responses were consistent with theoretical predictions of niche partitioning and cumulative human influence. Based on these findings, we provide recommendations to improve existing guidelines and forest certification standards aimed at safeguarding ape populations. © 2017 The Authors

ABSTRACT: How animal communities arrive at homogeneous behavioural preferences is a central question for studies of cultural evolution. Here, we investigated whether chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) would relinquish a pre-existing behaviour to adopt an alternative demonstrated by an overwhelming majority of group mates; in other words, whether chimpanzees behave in a conformist manner. In each of five groups of chimpanzees (N = 37), one individual was trained on one method of opening a two-action puzzle box to obtain food, while the remaining individuals learned the alternative method. Over 5 h of open access to the apparatus in a group context, it was found that 4/5 ‘minority’ individuals explored the majority method and three of these used this new method in the majority of trials. Those that switched did so after observing only a small subset of their group, thereby not matching conventional definitions of conformity. In a further ‘Dyad’ condition, six pairs of chimpanzees were trained on alternative methods and then given access to the task together. Only one of these individuals ever switched method. The number of observations that individuals in the minority and Dyad individuals made of their untrained method was not found to influence whether or not they themselves switched to use it. In a final ‘Asocial’ condition, individuals (N = 10) did not receive social information and did not deviate from their first-learned method. We argue that these results demonstrate an important influence of social context upon prioritisation of social information over pre-existing methods, which can result in group homogeneity of behaviour. © 2018, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Enteric dysbiosis is a characteristic feature of progressive human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection but has not been observed in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac)-infected macaques, including in animals with end-stage disease. This has raised questions concerning the mechanisms underlying the HIV-1 associated enteropathy, with factors other than virus infection, such as lifestyle and antibiotic use, implicated as playing possible causal roles. Simian immunodeficiency virus of chimpanzees (SIVcpz) is also associated with increased mortality in wild-living communities, and like HIV-1 and SIVmac, can cause CD4+ T cell depletion and immunodeficiency in infected individuals. Given the central role of the intestinal microbiome in mammalian health, we asked whether gut microbial constituents could be identified that are indicative of SIVcpz status and/or disease progression. Here, we characterized the gut microbiome of SIVcpz-infected and -uninfected chimpanzees in Gombe National Park, Tanzania. Subjecting a small number of fecal samples (N = 9) to metagenomic (shotgun) sequencing, we found bacteria of the family Prevotellaceae to be enriched in SIVcpz-infected chimpanzees. However, 16S rRNA gene sequencing of a larger number of samples (N = 123) failed to show significant differences in both the composition and diversity (alpha and beta) of gut bacterial communities between infected (N = 24) and uninfected (N = 26) chimpanzees. Similarly, chimpanzee stool-associated circular virus (Chi-SCV) and chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAdV) identified by metagenomic sequencing were neither more prevalent nor more abundant in SIVcpz-infected individuals. However, fecal samples collected from SIVcpz-infected chimpanzees within 5 months before their AIDS-related death exhibited significant compositional changes in their gut bacteriome. These data indicate that SIVcpz-infected chimpanzees retain a stable gut microbiome throughout much of their natural infection course, with a significant destabilization of bacterial (but not viral) communities observed only in individuals with known immunodeficiency within the last several months before their death.

ABSTRACT: Humans share an extraordinary degree of sociality with other primates, calling for comparative work into the evolutionary drivers of the variation in social engagement observed between species. Of particular interest is the contrast between the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and bonobo (Pan paniscus), the latter exhibiting increased female gregariousness, more tolerant relationships, and elaborate behavioral adaptations for conflict resolution. Here, we test predictions from 3 socioecological hypotheses regarding the evolution of these traits using data on wild bonobos at LuiKotale, Democratic Republic of Congo. Focusing on the behavior of co-feeding females and controlling for variation in characteristics of the feeding patch, food intake rate moderately increased while feeding effort decreased with female dominance rank, indicating that females engaged in competitive exclusion from high-quality food resources. However, these rank effects did not translate into variation in energy balance, as measured from urinary C-peptide levels. Instead, energy balance varied independent of female rank with the proportion of fruit in the diet. Together with the observation that females join forces in conflicts with males, our results support the hypothesis that predicts that females trade off feeding opportunities for safety against male aggression. The key to a full understanding of variation in social structure may be an integrated view of cooperation and competition over access to the key resources food and mates, both within and between the sexes. © 2018 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Aspects of trabecular bone architecture are thought to reflect regional loading of the skeleton, and thus differ between primate taxa with different locomotor and postural modes. However, there are several systemic factors that affect bone structure that could contribute to, or be the primary factor determining, interspecific differences in bone structure. These systemic factors include differences in genetic regulation, sensitivity to loading, hormone levels, diet, and activity levels. Improved understanding of inter-/intraspecific variability, and variability across the skeleton of an individual, is required to interpret properly potential functional signals present within trabecular structure. Using a whole-region method of analysis, we investigated trabecular structure throughout the skeleton of humans and chimpanzees. Trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV), degree of anisotropy (DA) and trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) were quantified from high resolution micro-computed tomographic scans of the humeral and femoral head, third metacarpal and third metatarsal head, distal tibia, talus and first thoracic vertebra. We found that BV/TV is, in most anatomical sites, significantly higher in chimpanzees than in humans, suggesting a systemic difference in trabecular structure unrelated to local loading regime. Differences in BV/TV between the forelimb and hindlimb did not clearly reflect differences in locomotor loading in the study taxa. There were no clear systemic differences between the taxa in DA and, as such, this parameter might reflect function and relate to differences in joint loading. This systemic approach reveals both the pattern of variability across the skeleton and between taxa, and helps identify those features of trabecular structure that may relate to joint function. © 2018 Anatomical Society

ABSTRACT: Investigating the repeatability of trait variation between individuals, that is the amount of individual variation in relation to overall phenotypic variation, indicates an upper level of heritability and reveals whether a given trait may be subject to selection. Labile traits are characterized by high levels of flexibility and consequently low trait repeatability is expected. Indeed, research examining glucocorticoid levels in various non-mammal species found low repeatability scores. However, mammals may be different in this respect as (i) differential maternal care early in life has the potential to prime hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning and (ii) allelic variation affecting hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning has been reported. Individuals often differ from each other in average and/or plastic labile trait expression, two aspects that can be described using a reaction norm approach. Both consistent and flexible reaction norm expression has been argued to serve adaptive purposes, depending on the stability and predictability of environmental conditions. Here, we investigated both trait and reaction norm repeatability of urinary cortisol levels in wild adult male chimpanzees. To capture the expression of the circadian urinary cortisol rhythm of individual males over time, urine samples were collected throughout the day. In total data of 30 males collected over a period of 8 years were included in the dataset. No male was sampled over the whole 8-year period however. We found minor levels of trait repeatability but considerable reaction norm repeatability. This implies a minor role of genetic or priming factors on cortisol excretion, but reveals that males differ consistently in average urinary cortisol levels and the shape of the circadian urinary cortisol rhythm. Relating these results to fitness parameters will provide answers to questions on the adaptive value of reaction norm repeatability of this labile hormonal trait in the future. © 2018 Sonnweber, Araya-Ajoy, Behringer, Deschner, Tkaczynski, Fedurek, Preis, Samuni, Zommers, Gomes, Zuberbühler, Wittig and Crockford.

ABSTRACT: Behavioural studies on animals incorporate data on morphology, physiology and energetic status, as well as kinship and genetic information. Such measures have become the state of the art when assessing the function of a given behaviour. Zoos provide opportunities for research of a kind that is difficult to undertake in the wild. In this article several advantages of studying captive animals are highlighted; for example, accessibility, ease of sample collection, control of environmental factors, long-term monitoring and known life histories, which can be tracked throughout the life of an individual. The data collected from such studies can be used to provide benchmarks for physiological and life-history features. To demonstrate the type of studies to which zoos can contribute, examples are given from work with Bonobos Pan paniscus and Chimpanzees Pan troglodytes. Such studies improve our basic understanding of physiological processes in these apes, which could be applied to other non-human primates. Data from zoo-living animals promote validation and refinement of methods, add information that may be difficult to obtain from wild specimens and provide the means by which to scrutinize specific questions in experimental settings. Such data can serve as a benchmark for studies on wild conspecifics and inspire field studies by providing novel tools for data collection. © 2018 The Zoological Society of London

ABSTRACT: Space per animal, or animal density, and enclosure type are important elements of functionally appropriate captive environments (FACEs) for chimpanzees. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommends that captive chimpanzees be maintained in areas of >250 ft2/animal. Several studies have investigated chimpanzee behavior in relation to space per animal, but only two studies have examined these variables while attempting to hold environmental complexity constant. Both have found few, if any, significant differences in behavior associated with increased space per animal. The NIH does not provide recommendations pertaining to enclosure type. Although Primadomes™ and corrals are considered acceptable FACE housing, no studies have investigated chimpanzee behavior in relation to these two common types of enclosures. We examined the NIH space per animal recommendation, and the effects of enclosure type, while maintaining similar levels of environmental complexity. We used focal animal observations to record the behavior of 22 chimpanzees in three social groups following within-facility housing transfers. Chimpanzees that were moved from an area with space below the NIH recommendation to the same type of enclosure with space above the recommendation (dome to double dome) exhibited significantly more locomotion and behavioral diversity post-transfer. Chimpanzees that were moved from an area with space below the recommendation to a different type of enclosure with space above the recommendation (dome to corral) exhibited significant increases in foraging and behavioral diversity, and a decrease in rough scratching. Lastly, chimpanzees that were moved from an area above the recommendation to a different enclosure type with space equal to the recommendation (corral to double dome) exhibited an increase in behavioral diversity. These results add to the body of literature that addresses the concept of specific minimum space requirements per chimpanzee, and highlight the need for more empirical investigation of the relationship between space per chimpanzee, behavior, and welfare. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Understanding how social relationships affect long-term stress is important because stress has a profound impact on the welfare of animals and social relationships often exert a strong influence on their stress responses. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between social behaviors and long-term stress levels as assessed by hair cortisol (HC) concentration. The subjects were 11 chimpanzees living in an all-male group (divided into two sub-groups) in Kumamoto Sanctuary, Kyoto University, Japan. Behavioral data were collected between December 2014 and March 2015. The total observation time was 129 h. Hair samples were collected in late March and early April 2015, and cortisol was extracted from the hair and measured with enzyme immunoassay. The hair growth rate was estimated to be 1.33 ± 0.06 cm/month. The results revealed that there was a positive correlation between the rate of receiving aggression and HC levels. We also found a significant negative correlation between the balance between giving and receiving grooming (grooming balance index: GBI), which was calculated by subtracting the rate with which grooming is given from that with which it is received, and the rate of receiving aggression and between the GBI and HC levels. Thus, individuals receiving higher levels of aggression also tended to give grooming for relatively long periods compared to the time they were being groomed. In contrast, the rate of initiating aggression did not have a relationship with either HC levels or any measure of social grooming. We did not find social buffering effects, as there was no correlation between mutual social grooming and HC levels. These results show that not only aggressive interactions but also overall social situations in which animals do not have balanced relationships with others might result in the long-term elevation of cortisol levels in captive male chimpanzees. © 2017, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Video cameras are increasingly being used to monitor captive animals in zoo, laboratory, and agricultural settings. This technology may also be useful in sanctuaries with large and/or complex enclosures. However, the cost of camera equipment and a lack of formal evaluations regarding the use of cameras in sanctuary settings make it challenging for facilities to decide whether and how to implement this technology. To address this, we evaluated the feasibility of using a video camera system to monitor chimpanzees at Chimp Haven. We viewed a group of resident chimpanzees in a large forested enclosure and compared observations collected in person and with remote video cameras. We found that via camera, the observer viewed fewer chimpanzees in some outdoor locations (GLMM post hoc test: est. = 1.4503, SE = 0.1457, Z = 9.951, p < 0.001) and identified a lower proportion of chimpanzees (GLMM post hoc test: est. = −2.17914, SE = 0.08490, Z = −25.666, p < 0.001) compared to in-person observations. However, the observer could view the 2 ha enclosure 15 times faster by camera compared to in person. In addition to these results, we provide recommendations to animal facilities considering the installation of a video camera system. Despite some limitations of remote monitoring, we posit that there are substantial benefits of using camera systems in sanctuaries to facilitate animal care and observational research. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Short tandem repeats (STRs), also known as microsatellites, are commonly used tononinvasively genotype wild-living endangered species, including African apes. Untilrecently, capillary electrophoresis has been the method of choice to determine thelength of polymorphic STR loci. However, this technique is labor intensive, difficult tocompare across platforms, and notoriously imprecise. Here we developed a MiSeqbased approach and tested its performance using previously genotyped fecal samples from long-term studied chimpanzees in Gombe National Park, Tanzania. Usingdata from eight microsatellite loci as a reference, we designed a bioinformatics platform that converts raw MiSeq reads into locus-specific files and automatically callsalleles after filtering stutter sequences and other PCR artifacts. Applying this methodto the entire Gombe population, we confirmed previously reported genotypes, butalso identified 31 new alleles that had been missed due to sequence differences andsize homoplasy. The new genotypes, which increased the allelic diversity and heterozygosity in Gombe by 61% and 8%, respectively, were validated by replicate amplification and pedigree analyses. This demonstrated inheritance and resolved one caseof an ambiguous paternity. Using both singleplex and multiplex locus amplification,we also genotyped fecal samples from chimpanzees in the Greater Mahale Ecosystem. © 2018 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Changes in splicing are known to affect the function and regulation of genes. We analyzed splicing events that take place during the postnatal development of the prefrontal cortex in humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus macaques based on data obtained from 168 individuals. Our study revealed that among the 38,822 quantified alternative exons, 15% are differentially spliced among species, and more than 6% splice differently at different ages. Mutations in splicing acceptor and/or donor sites might explain more than 14% of all splicing differences among species and up to 64% of high-amplitude differences. A reconstructed trans-regulatory network containing 21 RNA-binding proteins explains a further 4% of splicing variations within species. While most age-dependent splicing patterns are conserved among the three species, developmental changes in intron retention are substantially more pronounced in humans. © 2018 Mazin et al.

ABSTRACT: The inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) encompasses Broca's area, a brain region implicated in a variety of cognitive and linguistic functions. For instance, clinical and experimental data suggest that the left IFG plays an important role in language and speech. In this paper, I briefly summarize data on the sulci and morphological landmarks that define the IFG in humans, chimpanzees and monkeys. I also present some preliminary data on the surface area, mean depth and gray matter thickness of the three primary sulci that comprise the IFG in the chimpanzee brain including the fronto-orbital, precentral inferior and inferior frontal sulci. I further present data on associations between individual variation in asymmetries of each sulcus with measures of oro-facial motor control and tool use skill. The implications of these findings for different theories on the evolution of language and higher order motor and cognitive functions in primates are discussed. © Peter Lang GmbH Internationaler Verlag der Wissenschaften Frankfurt am Main 2017.

ABSTRACT: Infectious diseases including those acquired through direct or indirect contact with people and livestock threaten the survival of wild great apes. Few studies have reported enterobacterial pathogens in chimpanzees. We used multiplex PCR to screen faeces of chimpanzees sharing a landscape with villagers and livestock in Bulindi, Uganda for Salmonella spp., enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Shigella spp./enteroinvasive E. coli. All three potentially zoonotic pathogens were detected. Individual prevalence ranged between 7 and 20%, with most infections observed in mature male chimpanzees. These preliminary findings suggest detailed investigation of enterobacterial infections in people, primates and livestock in this ecosystem is warranted. © 2017, EcoHealth Alliance.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees' natural propensity to explore and play with objects is likely to be an important precursor of tool use. Manipulating objects provides individuals with pivotal perceptual-motor experience when interacting with the material world, which may then pave the way for subsequent tool use. In this study, we were interested in the influence of social models on the developmental patterns of object manipulation in young chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, of the Sonso community of Budongo Forest, Uganda. This community is interesting because of its limited tool repertoire, with no records of stick-based foraging in over 20 years of continuous observations. Using cross-sectional data, we found evidence for social learning in that young individuals preferentially played with and explored materials manipulated by their mothers. We also found that object manipulation rates decreased with age, whereas the goal directedness of these manipulations increased. Specifically, stick manipulations gradually decreased with age, which culminated in complete disregard of sticks around the age of 10 years, a pattern not found for other tool materials, which were all used throughout adulthood. Overall, young chimpanzees initially explored and played unselectively with any object found in the environment before becoming increasingly influenced by their mothers' goal-directed object manipulations. © 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ABSTRACT: There is much experimental evidence suggesting that chimpanzees understand that others see. However, previous research has never experimentally ruled out the alternative explanation that chimpanzees are just responding to the geometric cue of ‘direct line of gaze’, the observable correlate of seeing in others. Here, we sought to resolve this ambiguity by dissociating seeing from direct line of gaze using a mirror. We investigated the frequency of chimpanzees' visual gestures towards a human experimenter who could see them (as a result of looking into a mirror) but who lacked a direct line of gaze to them (as a result of having his/her head turned away). Chimpanzees produced significantly more visual gestures when the experimenter could see them than when he/she could not, even when the experimenter did not have a direct line of gaze to them. Results suggest that chimpanzees, through a possible process of experience projection based on their own prior experience with mirrors, infer that an experimenter looking at the mirror can see them. We discuss our results in relation to the theory of mind hypothesis that chimpanzees understand seeing in others, and we evaluate possible alternative low-level explanations. © 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ABSTRACT: Adenoviruses are a widespread cause of diverse human infections with recently confirmed zoonotic roots in African great apes. We focused on savanna-dwelling chimpanzees in the Issa Valley (Tanzania), which differ from those from forested sites in many aspects of behavior and ecology. PCR targeting the DNA polymerase gene detected AdV in 36.7% (69/188) of fecal samples. We detected five groups of strains belonging to the species Human mastadenovirus E and two distinct groups within the species Human mastadenovirus C based on partial hexon sequence. All detected AdVs from the Issa Valley are related to those from nearby Mahale and Gombe National Parks, suggesting chimpanzee movements and pathogen transmission. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria.

ABSTRACT: The recent outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) has emerged as a global health concern. ZIKV can persist in human semen and be transmitted by sexual contact, as well as by mosquitoes, as seen for classical arboviruses. We along with others have previously demonstrated that ZIKV infection leads to testis damage and infertility in mouse models. So far, no prophylactics or therapeutics are available; therefore, vaccine development is urgently demanded. Recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus has been explored as the preferred vaccine vector for many pathogens due to the low preexisting immunity against the vector among the human population. Here, we developed a ZIKV vaccine based on recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus type 7 (AdC7) expressing ZIKV M/E glycoproteins. A single vaccination of AdC7-M/E was sufficient to elicit potent neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity against ZIKV in both immunocompetent and immunodeficient mice. Moreover, vaccinated mice rapidly developed neutralizing antibody with high titers within 1 week postvaccination, and the elicited antiserum could crossneutralize heterologous ZIKV strains. Additionally, ZIKV M- and E-specific T cell responses were robustly induced by AdC7-M/E. Moreover, one-dose inoculation of AdC7-M/E conferred mouse sterilizing immunity to eliminate viremia and viral burden in tissues against ZIKV challenge. Further investigations showed that vaccination with AdC7-M/E completely protected against ZIKV-induced testicular damage. These data demonstrate that AdC7-M/E is highly effective and represents a promising vaccine candidate for ZIKV control. © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.

ABSTRACT: Polyspecific associations occur when species overlap in their environment by chance, converge at common resources, or in response to predation pressure. However, because larger groups may themselves attract the attention of predators, species forming associations must balance the costs and benefits of comingling. Experimental and observational research suggests red colobus (Piliocolobus badius) associate with Diana monkeys (Cercopithecus diana) in Taï National Park, Côte d’Ivoire in response to seasonally shifting predation pressure from chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus). Research on this system has focused on immediate behavioral effects of comingling by red colobus and Diana monkeys. We expand on these analyses and explore longer-term changes in Diana monkey behavior. We use scan samples (N = 7025) collected on three Diana monkey groups over 5 years (N = 380 days) to assess differences in diet, activity budget, and strata use in relation to associating with red colobus and chimpanzee hunting seasonality and test for interaction effects between these two variables. We found limited evidence showing Diana monkeys make more than ephemeral behavioral changes in response to comingling with red colobus during chimpanzees’ hunting season (September–November). Synergistic effects of association and hunting season include expanded use of the main canopy, decreased fruit consumption, and increased invertebrate consumption. We find little evidence indicating Diana monkeys minimize behaviors that increase risk of predation from chimpanzees while associated with red colobus during the season when chimpanzees hunt most often. We conclude that when there are few member costs to forming mixed groups, participating species may tolerate associations even without accruing any benefits. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: When humans are about to manipulate an object, our brains use visual cues to recall an internal representation to predict its weight and scale the lifting force accordingly. Such a long-term force profile, formed through repeated experiences with similar objects, has been proposed to improve manipulative performance. Skillful object manipulation is crucial for many animals, particularly those that rely on tools for foraging. However, despite enduring interest in tool use in non-human animals, there has been very little investigation of their ability to form an expectation about an object’s weight. In this study, we tested whether wild chimpanzees use long-term force profiles to anticipate the weight of a nut-cracking hammer from its size. To this end, we conducted a field experiment presenting chimpanzees with natural wooden hammers and artificially hollowed, lighter hammers of the same size and external appearance. We used calibrated videos from camera traps to extract kinematic parameters of lifting movements. We found that, when lacking previous experience, chimpanzees lifted hollowed hammers with a higher acceleration than natural hammers (overshoot effect). After using a hammer to crack open one nut, chimpanzees tuned down the lifting acceleration for the hollowed hammers, but continued lifting natural hammers with the same acceleration. Our results show that chimpanzees anticipate the weight of an object using long-term force profiles and suggest that, similarly to humans, they use internal representations of weight to plan their lifting movements. © 2017, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Referential signals, such as manual pointing or deictic words, allow individuals to efficiently locate a specific entity in the environment, using distance-specific linguistic and/or gestural units. To explore the evolutionary prerequisites of such deictic ability, the present study investigates the ability of chimpanzees to adjust their communicative signals to the distance of a referent. A food-request paradigm in which the chimpanzees had to request a close or distant piece of food on a table in the presence/absence of an experimenter was employed. Our main finding concerns the chimpanzees adjusting their requesting behaviours to the distance of the food such that higher manual gestures and larger mouth openings were used to request the distant piece of food. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that chimpanzees are able to use distance-specific gestures. © 2017 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Metacognition refers to thinking about one’s thinking or knowing what one knows. Research suggests that this ability is not unique to humans and may be shared with nonhuman animals. In particular, great apes have shown behaviors on a variety of tasks that are suggestive of metacognitive ability. Here we combine a metacognitive task, the information-seeking task, with tool use and variable forms of initial information provided to chimpanzees to explore how informational states impact behavioral responses in these apes. Three chimpanzees were presented with an apparatus that contained five locations where food could be hidden. If they pointed to the correct location, they received the reward, but otherwise they did not. We first replicated several existing findings using this method, and then tested novel hypotheses. The chimpanzees were given different types of information across the experiments. Sometimes, they were shown the location of the food reward. Other times, they were shown only one empty location, which was not useful information. The chimpanzees also could use a tool to search any of those locations before making a selection. Chimpanzees typically used the tool to search out the location of the reward when they could not already know where it was, but they did not use the tool when they already had been given that information. One chimpanzee made inferences about the location of hidden food, even when that food was never shown in that location. The final experiment involved hiding foods of differing preference values, and then presenting the chimpanzees with different initial knowledge states (i.e., where the best food was located, where the less-preferred food was located, or where no food was located). All chimpanzees used the tool when they needed to use it to find the best possible item on that trial, but responded by choosing a location immediately when they did not need the tool. This finding highlights that their behavior was not the result of a simple rule following such as pointing to where any food had been seen. © 2018 Perdue et al.

ABSTRACT: Life history variables including the timing of locomotor independence, along with changes in preferred locomotor behaviors and substrate use during development, influence how primates use their feet throughout ontogeny. Changes in foot function during development, in particular the nature of how the hallux is used in grasping, can lead to different structural changes in foot bones. To test this hypothesis, metatarsal midshaft rigidity [estimated from the polar second moment of area (J) scaled to bone length] and cross-sectional shape (calculated from the ratio of maximum and minimum second moments of area, Imax/Imin) were examined in a cross-sectional ontogenetic sample of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta; n = 73) and common chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes; n = 79). Results show the hallucal metatarsal (Mt1) is relatively more rigid (with higher scaled J-values) in younger chimpanzees and macaques, with significant decreases in relative rigidity in both taxa until the age of achieving locomotor independence. Within each age group, Mt1 rigidity is always significantly higher in chimpanzees than macaques. When compared with the lateral metatarsals (Mt2–5), the Mt1 is relatively more rigid in both taxa and across all ages; however, this difference is significantly greater in chimpanzees. Length and J scale with negative allometry in all metatarsals and in both species (except the Mt2 of chimpanzees, which scales with positive allometry). Only in macaques does Mt1 midshaft shape significantly change across ontogeny, with older individuals having more elliptical cross-sections. Different patterns of development in metatarsal diaphyseal rigidity and shape likely reflect the different ways in which the foot, and in particular the hallux, functions across ontogeny in apes and monkeys. © 2017 Anatomical Society

ABSTRACT: Prenatal exposure to environmental endocrine disruptors can affect development and induce irreversible abnormalities in both humans and wildlife. The northern part of Kibale National Park, a mid-altitude rainforest in western Uganda, is largely surrounded by industrial tea plantations and wildlife using this area (Sebitoli) must cope with proximity to human populations and their activities. The chimpanzees and baboons in this area raid crops (primarily maize) in neighboring gardens. Sixteen young individuals of the 66 chimpanzees monitored (25%) exhibit abnormalities including reduced nostrils, cleft lip, limb deformities, reproductive problems and hypopigmentation. Each pathology could have a congenital component, potentially exacerbated by environmental factors. In addition, at least six of 35 photographed baboons from a Sebitoli troop (17%) have similar severe nasal deformities. Our inquiries in villages and tea factories near Sebitoli revealed use of eight pesticides (glyphosate, cypermethrin, profenofos, mancozeb, metalaxyl, dimethoate, chlorpyrifos and 2,4-D amine). Chemical analysis of samples collected from 2014 to 2016 showed that mean levels of pesticides in fresh maize stems and seeds, soils, and river sediments in the vicinity of the chimpanzee territory exceed recommended limits. Notably, excess levels were found for total DDT and its metabolite pp′-DDE and for chlorpyrifos in fresh maize seeds and in fish from Sebitoli. Imidacloprid was detected in coated maize seeds planted at the edge the forest and in fish samples from the Sebitoli area, while no pesticides were detected in fish from central park areas. Since some of these pesticides are thyroid hormone disruptors, we postulate that excessive pesticide use in the Sebitoli area may contribute to facial dysplasia in chimpanzees and baboons through this endocrine pathway. Chimpanzees are considered as endangered by IUCN and besides their intrinsic value and status as closely related to humans, they have major economic value in Uganda via ecotourism. Identifying and limiting potential threats to their survival such be a conservation priority. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Different aspects of sociality bear considerable weight on the individual-And group-level welfare of captive nonhuman primates. Social Network Analysis (SNA) is a useful tool for gaining a holistic understanding of the dynamic social relationships of captive primate groups. Gaining a greater understanding of captive chimpanzees through investigations of centrality, preferred and avoided relationships, dominance hierarchy, and social network diagrams can be useful in advising current management practices in sanctuaries and other captive settings. In this study, we investigated the dyadic social relationships, group-level social networks, and dominance hierarchy of seven chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) at Chimpanzee Sanctuary Northwest. We used focal-Animal and instantaneous scan sampling to collect 106.75 total hours of associative, affiliative, and agonistic data from June to September 2016. We analyzed our data using SOCPROG to derive dominance hierarchies and network statistics, and we diagrammed the group's social networks in NetDraw. Three individuals were most central in the grooming network, while two others had little connection. Through agonistic networks, we found that group members reciprocally exhibited agonism, and the group's dominance hierarchy was statistically non-linear. One chimpanzee emerged as the most dominant through agonism but was least connected to other group members across affiliative networks. Our results indicate that the conventional methods used to calculate individuals' dominance rank may be inadequate to wholly depict a group's social relationships in captive sanctuary populations. Our results have an applied component that can aid sanctuary staff in a variety of ways to best ensure the improvement of group welfare. © 2018 Funkhouser et al.

ABSTRACT: Despite many studies of chimpanzee brain size growth, intraspecific variation is under-explored. Brain size data from chimpanzees of the Taï Forest and the Yerkes Primate Research Center enable a unique glimpse into brain growth variation as age at death is known for individuals, allowing cross-sectional growth curves to be estimated. Because Taï chimpanzees are from the wild but Yerkes apes are captive, potential environmental effects on neural development can also be explored. Previous research has revealed differences in growth and health between wild and captive primates, but such habitat effects have yet to be investigated for brain growth. Here, I use an iterative curve fitting procedure to estimate brain growth and regression parameters for each population, statistically comparing growth models using bootstrapped confidence intervals. Yerkes and Taï brain sizes overlap at all ages, although the sole Taï newborn is at the low end of captive neonatal variation. Growth rate and duration are statistically indistinguishable between the two populations. Resampling the Yerkes sample to match the Taï sample size and age group composition shows that ontogenetic variation in the two groups are remarkably similar despite the latter's limited size. Best fit growth curves for each sample indicate cessation of brain size growth at around 2 years, earlier than has previously been reported. The overall similarity between wild and captive chimpanzees points to the canalization of brain growth in this species. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Great apes have been shown to be intuitive statisticians: they can use proportional information within a population to make intuitive probability judgments about randomly drawn samples [1, J.E., J.C., J.H., E.H., and H.R., unpublished data]. Humans, from early infancy onward, functionally integrate intuitive statistics with other cognitive domains to judge the randomness of an event [2–6]. To date, nothing is known about such cross-domain integration in any nonhuman animal, leaving uncertainty about the origins of human statistical abilities. We investigated whether chimpanzees take into account information about psychological states of experimenters (their biases and visual access) when drawing statistical inferences. We tested 21 sanctuary-living chimpanzees in a previously established paradigm that required subjects to infer which of two mixed populations of preferred and non-preferred food items was more likely to lead to a desired outcome for the subject. In a series of three experiments, we found that chimpanzees chose based on proportional information alone when they had no information about experimenters’ preferences and (to a lesser extent) when experimenters had biases for certain food types but drew blindly. By contrast, when biased experimenters had visual access, subjects ignored statistical information and instead chose based on experimenters’ biases. Lastly, chimpanzees intuitively used a violation of statistical likelihoods as indication for biased sampling. Our results suggest that chimpanzees have a random sampling assumption that can be overridden under the appropriate circumstances and that they are able to use mental state information to judge whether this is necessary. This provides further evidence for a shared statistical inference mechanism in apes and humans. Eckert et al. show that chimpanzees, when drawing statistical inferences from population to sample, flexibly consider whether the experimenter is neutral or biased and whether she has visual access or draws blindly. This suggests that great apes possess a sophisticated intuitive statistical reasoning mechanism on a par with that of human infants. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Over the years there has been some controversy regarding the comparison between chimpanzees and bonobos. Whereas some authors have stressed their differences, others have stressed their similarities. One striking difference between wild chimpanzees and bonobos is tool use, especially in foraging contexts. While several chimpanzee populations possess tool kits formed by multiple tools (and their associated techniques) to exploit embedded resources, bonobos display no such tool specialization. However, studies in the laboratory have shown that bonobos are perfectly capable of using tools. In fact, several studies devoted to investigate the cognitive abilities underlying tool use have failed to detect any substantial differences between the two species. This chapter explores three aspects that could explain the difference between chimpanzees and bonobos in their propensity to use tools in the wild: socio-ecological factors, social versus technical cognition, and personality profiles. © Oxford University Press 2017.

ABSTRACT: Carrion scavenging is a well-studied phenomenon, but virtually nothing is known about scavenging on plant material, especially on remnants of cracked nuts. Just like meat, the insides of hard-shelled nuts are high in energetic value, and both foods are difficult to acquire. In the Taï forest, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and red river hogs (Potamochoerus porcus) crack nuts by using tools or strong jaws, respectively. In this study, previously collected non-invasive camera trap data were used to investigate scavenging by sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys), two species of Guinea fowl (Agelestres meleagrides; Guttera verreauxi), and squirrels (Scrunidae spp.) on the nut remnants cracked by chimpanzees and red river hogs. We investigated how scavengers located nut remnants, by analyzing their visiting behavior in relation to known nut-cracking events. Furthermore, since mangabeys are infrequently preyed upon by chimpanzees, we investigated whether they perceive an increase in predation risk when approaching nut remnants. In total, 190 nut-cracking events were observed in four different areas of Taï National Park, Ivory Coast. We could confirm that mangabeys scavenged on the nuts cracked by chimpanzees and hogs and that this enabled them to access food source that would not be accessible otherwise. We furthermore found that mangabeys, but not the other species, were more likely to visit nut-cracking sites after nut-cracking activities than before, and discuss the potential strategies that the monkeys could have used to locate nut remnants. In addition, mangabeys showed elevated levels of vigilance at the chimpanzee nut-cracking sites compared with other foraging sites, suggesting that they perceived elevated danger at these sites. Scavenging on remnants of cracked nuts is a hitherto understudied type of foraging behavior that could be widespread in nature and increases the complexity of community ecology in tropical rainforests. © 2018 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Imitation is a cornerstone of human development, serving both a cognitive function (e.g. in the acquisition and transmission of skills and knowledge) and a social–communicative function, whereby the imitation of familiar actions serves to maintain social interaction and promote prosociality. In nonhuman primates, this latter function is poorly understood, or even claimed to be absent. In this observational study, we documented interactions between chimpanzees and zoo visitors and found that the two species imitated each other at a similar rate, corresponding to almost 10% of all produced actions. Imitation appeared to accomplish a social–communicative function, as cross-species interactions that contained imitative actions lasted significantly longer than interactions without imitation. In both species, physical proximity promoted cross-species imitation. Overall, imitative precision was higher among visitors than among chimpanzees, but this difference vanished in proximity contexts, i.e. in the indoor environment. Four of five chimpanzees produced imitations; three of them exhibited comparable imitation rates, despite large individual differences in level of cross-species interactivity. We also found that chimpanzees evidenced imitation recognition, yet only when visitors imitated their actions (as opposed to postures). Imitation recognition was expressed by returned imitation in 36% of the cases, and all four imitating chimpanzees engaged in so-called imitative games. Previously regarded as unique to early human socialization, such games serve to maintain social engagement. The results presented here indicate that nonhuman apes exhibit spontaneous imitation that can accomplish a communicative function. The study raises a number of novel questions for imitation research and highlights the imitation of familiar behaviours as a relevant—yet thus far understudied—research topic. © 2017, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: APOBEC3s (A3s) are potent restriction factors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1/simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1/SIV), and can repress cross-species transmissions of lentiviruses. HIV-1 originated from a zoonotic infection of SIV of chimpanzee (SIVcpz) to humans. However, the impact of human A3s on the replication of SIVcpz remains unclear. By using novel SIVcpz reporter viruses, we identified that human APOBEC3B (A3B) and APOBEC3H (A3H) haplotype II strongly reduced the infectivity of SIVcpz, because both of them are resistant to SIVcpz Vifs. We further demonstrated that human A3H inhibited SIVcpz by deaminase dependent as well independent mechanisms. In addition, other stably expressed human A3H haplotypes and splice variants showed strong antiviral activity against SIVcpz. Moreover, most SIV and HIV lineage Vif proteins could degrade chimpanzee A3H, but no Vifs from SIVcpz and SIV of gorilla (SIVgor) lineages antagonized human A3H haplotype II. Expression of human A3H hapII in human T cells efficiently blocked the spreading replication of SIVcpz. The spreading replication of SIVcpz was also restricted by stable A3H in human PBMCs. Thus, we speculate that stably expressed human A3H protects humans against the cross-species transmission of SIVcpz and that SIVcpz spillover to humans may have started in individuals that harbor haplotypes of unstable A3H proteins. © 2017 Zhang et al.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are primarily frugivorous but consume a variable amount of meat from a variety of organisms, including other chimpanzees. Cannibalism is rare, usually follows lethal aggression, and does not occur following natural deaths. While chimpanzee cannibalism has been documented at multiple sites, many instances of this behavior go unrecorded. Identification of chimpanzee remains in feces, however, can provide indirect evidence of cannibalism. Hair, in particular, typically passes through the gastrointestinal tract undamaged and is commonly used for purposes of identification in wildlife forensics. Here we test the hypothesis that eastern chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) guard hair morphology can be reliably distinguished from the hairs of their most common prey species. Methods and results are presented in the context of a case study involving a suspected chimpanzee infanticide from Gombe, Tanzania. We find that chimpanzee guard hair morphology is unique among tested mammals and that the presence of abundant chimpanzee hair in feces is likely the result of cannibalism and not incidental ingestion from grooming or other means. Accordingly, morphological analysis of guard hairs from feces is a promising, cost-effective tool for the determination of cannibalistic acts in chimpanzees. © 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel.

ABSTRACT: A nest survey of western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) was conducted in Gola Rainforest National Park (GRNP) and the surrounding community forest in eastern Sierra Leone. The aim was to investigate chimpanzee nest ecology with a focus on nesting tree species selection. Field data were gathered between September 2015 and June 2016 during a nest census along 89 transects covering 158 km—104 km within the protected area and 54 km outside. We documented a total of 96 nests in 54 nest groups. Chimpanzees preferred to nest in areas of primary forest with low or no undergrowth. Twenty-two tree species were used for nesting trees. Tree selection was not random, with chimpanzees showing preference for a subset of tree species. Heritiera utilis, a common timber tree, was the species most selected, with 23% of all nests. The top six tree species accounted for 70% of all nests encountered. Chimpanzees showed a preference for nesting within the boundaries of the protected area and, on average, nested at a higher elevation (20.4 m above ground) than has been found in other studies in West Africa. Our results indicate that P. t. verus in our study area tended to avoid the human-disturbed community forests. These findings will be useful to inform conservation practices both inside and outside the park, as well as community forestry and law enforcement initiatives. © 2018 Primate Specialist Group.All right reserved.

ABSTRACT: We report on prime-boost vaccine regimens with two simian adenovirus (Ad) vectors (SAdV) or two human serotype Ad vectors (HAdV) expressing Gag and gp160 of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)mac239 tested in HAdV-seropositive rhesus macaques (RMs) repeatedly challenged rectally with low doses of SIVmac251. Both vaccine regimens reduced set point and peak viral loads (PVL) and accelerated viral clearance. In SAdV-vaccinated controller genotype RMs resistance against infection correlated with levels of envelope (Env)-specific antibody (Ab) titers. In both vaccine groups CD8+T cells controlled viral loads (VL) upon infection. Circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells showed significant changes in their transcriptome over time following vaccination, which differed between the vaccine groups. T cells from SIV-resistant RMs had unique transcriptional profiles indicating that both follicular T helper (TFH) cell responses and highly activated CD8+ T cells may play a role in protection. © 2018

ABSTRACT: We studied the nesting behavior of the critically endangered West African chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus). We assumed that the nesting data stemmed from a single, unhabituated community at the Bagnomba hill site in the savanna-woodlands of southeastern Senegal. The aim of this study was to examine chimpanzees’ nesting habits in terms of the tree species utilized and sleeping nest heights. We recorded a total of 550 chimpanzee nests at Bagnomba between January 2015 and December 2015. The chimpanzees here made nests in particular tree species more often than others. The majority of nests (63%) were in two tree species: Diospyros mespiliformis and Pterocarpus erinaceus. The average height of nesting trees was 10.54 m (SD 3.91, range, 0.0–29.0 m) and average nest height was 7.90 m (SD 3.62, range, 0.0–25.0 m). The result of a linear regression analysis (r = 0.7874; n = 550; p < 0.05) is consistent with a preference for nesting at a particular height. Bagnomba chimpanzees rarely made ground nests (0.36% of nests), but the presence of any ground nesting was unexpected, given that at least one leopard (Panthera pardus) also occupied the hill. This knowledge will enable stakeholders involved in the protection of chimpanzees specifically and of biodiversity in general to better understand chimpanzee ecology and inform a conservation action plan in Senegal where the survival of this species is threatened. © 2017, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Various non-human animal species have been shown to exhibit behavioural traditions. Importantly, this research has been guided by what we know of human culture, and the question of whether animal cultures may be homologous or analogous to our own culture. In this paper, we assess whether models of human cultural transmission are relevant to understanding biological fundamentals by investigating whether accounts of human payoff-biased social learning are relevant to chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). We submitted 4- and 5-year-old children (N = 90) and captive chimpanzees (N = 69) to a token–reward exchange task. The results revealed different forms of payoff-biased learning across species and contexts. Specifically, following personal and social exposure to different tokens, children’s exchange behaviour was consistent with proportional imitation, where choice is affected by both prior personally acquired and socially demonstrated token–reward information. However, when the socially derived information regarding token value was novel, children’s behaviour was consistent with proportional observation; paying attention to socially derived information and ignoring their prior personal experience. By contrast, chimpanzees’ token choice was governed by their own prior experience only, with no effect of social demonstration on token choice, conforming to proportional reservation. We also find evidence for individual- and group-level differences in behaviour in both species. Despite the difference in payoff strategies used, both chimpanzees and children adopted beneficial traits when available. However, the strategies of the children are expected to be the most beneficial in promoting flexible behaviour by enabling existing behaviours to be updated or replaced with new and often superior ones. © 2017 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Adaptations associated with shifting from a predominately forested habitat to a more open environment are considered a crucial step in hominin evolution. Understanding how chimpanzees, one of our closest-living relatives, are exposed to the selection pressures associated with living in a relatively sparse, hot, and dry environment can inform us about the relative importance of potential environmental stressors involved in adaptations to drier environments. We investigated the extent to which chimpanzees living in an extreme savanna habitat experience seasonal variability in either energy balance or thermoregulation (dehydration and heat exposure), as well as whether these potential environmental constraints are taxing to chimpanzee individuals. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that savanna environments impose seasonally-relevant costs to chimpanzees. To this end, we collected 368 urine samples from one community of chimpanzees at Fongoli, Senegal, and measured c-peptide, creatinine, and cortisol as measures of physiological responses to environmental food, water, and heat constraints, respectively. We then evaluated the influence of climatic and phenological factors on these indicators. Results illustrated significant seasonal variation in all biomarkers, which corresponded to relevant ecological correlates. Furthermore, creatinine but not c-peptide correlated with cortisol levels, suggesting that chimpanzees in this environment endure periods of heat and dehydration stress, but are able to avoid stressful levels of negative energy balance. Using savanna chimpanzees as a referential model, our research lends support to the notion that thermoregulatory challenges were a significant factor in hominin evolution, and suggests these challenges may have overshadowed the challenges of maintaining adequate energetic balance during the expansion of the hominin range from wetter to drier environments. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Background: We present 3 likely cases of testicular dysgenesis syndrome (TDS) within a community of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii). We tested whether genetic drift may be the culprit, as a genetic cause has been suspected to account for TDS among other wildlife. Methods: We successfully sequenced a 367-bp segment spanning the first hypervariable region within the D-loop of the mitochondrial genome for 78 DNA samples. Results: We found 24 polymorphic sequence sites consisting of 7 singletons and 17 parsimony informative sites. This sample contained 9 haplotypes with a diversity index of 0.78 (SD = 0.03). All tests against the null hypothesis of neutral polymorphisms were non-significant (P >.10). The mismatch distribution of pairwise differences does not fit a Poisson's curve (raggedness index = 0.166; SSD = 0.12; P = 1). Conclusions: Thus, we found no significant signs of genetic isolation, population expansion, or genetic bottleneck. Alternative causes of TDS and how they might pertain to this population are discussed. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

ABSTRACT: Behavioural flexibility, the ability to alter behaviour in response to environmental feed- back, and to relinquish previously successful solutions to problems, is a crucial ability in allowing organisms to adapt to novel environments and environmental change; it is essential to cumulative cultural change. To explore this ability in chimpanzees, 18 individuals (Pan troglodytes) were presented with an artificial foraging task consisting of a tube partially filled with juice that could be reached by hand or retrieved using tool materials to hand. Effective solutions were then restricted in the second phase of the study by narrowing the diameter of the tube, necessitating the abandonment of previously successful solutions. Chimpanzees showed limited behavioural flexibility in comparison to some previous studies, increasing their use of effective techniques, but also continuing to attempt solutions that had been rendered ineffective. This adds to a literature reporting divergent evidence for flexibility (the ability to alter behaviour in response to environmental feedback, and to relinquish previously successful solutions to problems) versus conservatism (a reluctance or inability to explore or adopt novel solutions to problems when a solution is already known) in apes. © 2018 Harrison and Whiten.

ABSTRACT: Background: Vocal sequences - utterances consisting of calls produced in close succession - are common phenomena in animal communication. While many studies have explored the adaptive benefits of producing such sequences, very little is known about how the costs and constraints involved in their production affect their form. Here, we investigated this issue in the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) pant hoot, a long and structurally complex vocal sequence comprising four acoustically distinct phases - introduction, build-up, climax and let-down. Results: We found that in each of these phases, and for the sequence as a whole, there was a negative relationship between the number of calls produced and their average duration. There was also a negative relationship between the total duration of some adjacent phases. Significant relationships between the fundamental frequency of calls and their number or duration were found for some phases of the sequence, but the direction of these relationships differed between particular phases. Conclusions: These results indicate that there are trade-offs in terms of signal duration at two levels in pant-hoot production: between call number and duration, and between the relative durations of successive phases. These trade-offs are likely to reflect biomechanical constraints on vocal sequence production. Phase-specific trade-offs also appear to occur between fundamental frequency and call number or duration, potentially reflecting that different phases of the sequence are associated with distinct types of information, linked in different ways to call pitch. Overall, this study highlights the important role of costs and constraints in shaping the temporal and acoustic structure of animal vocal sequences. © 2017 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Bonobos and chimpanzees are closely related, yet they exhibit important differences in their wild socio-ecology. Whereas bonobos live in environments with less seasonal variation and more access to fallback foods, chimpanzees face more competition over spatially distributed, variable resources. This chapter argues that bonobo and chimpanzee cognition show psychological signatures of their divergent wild ecology. Current evidence shows that despite strong commonalities in many cognitive domains, apes express targeted differences in specific cognitive skills critical for wild foraging behaviours. In particular, bonobos exhibit less accurate spatial memory, reduced levels of patience and greater risk aversion than do chimpanzees. These results have implications for understanding the evolution of human cognition, as studies of apes are a critical tool for modelling the last common ancestor of humans with nonhuman apes. © Oxford University Press 2017.

ABSTRACT: To understand the complexity involved in animal signalling, studies have mainly focused on repertoire size and information conveyed in vocalizations of birds and nonhuman primates. However, recent studies on gestural abilities of nonhuman primates have shown that we also need a detailed understanding of other communicative modalities and underlying cognitive skills to grasp this phenomenon in detail. Here, we thus examined gestural signalling of chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, living in two communities in the wild (Kanyawara, Uganda; Taï South, Côte d'Ivoire) with a special focus on the influence of the social environment on signal development. Specifically, we investigated to what extent specific social factors, namely behavioural context, interaction rates and maternal proximity, affect gestural production (i.e. gesture frequency, sequences and repertoire size). We used a combination of video recordings and focal scans obtained from 11 infants aged between 9 and 69 months during 1145 h of observation throughout two consecutive field periods. Overall, we found that social play was the context in which the highest number of gestures occurred. While gesture frequency and repertoire size increased with higher interaction rates with nonmaternal conspecifics and the number of previous interaction partners, no effect was found for interaction rates with mothers. Our results thus imply that infants of social mothers may have a head start in life. Moreover, we provide hitherto undocumented evidence for sex differences in gestural signalling, which may reflect the differential importance of early socialization for chimpanzee males and females. Gestural development thus relies heavily on interactional experiences with conspecifics, which adds support for gestural acquisition via the learning mechanism of ‘social negotiation’ in great apes. © 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ABSTRACT: Bonobos and chimpanzees are two closely relates species of the genus Pan, yet they exhibit marked differences in anatomy, behavior and cognition. For this reason, comparative studies on social behavior, cognition and brain organization between these two species provide important insights into evolutionary models of human origins. This chapter summarizes studies on socio-communicative competencies and social cognition in chimpanzees and bonobos from the authors’ laboratory in comparison to previous reports. Additionally, recent data on species differences and similarities in brain organization in grey matter volume and distribution is presented. Some preliminary findings on microstructural brain organization such as neuropil space and cellular distribution in key neurotransmitters and neuropeptides involved in social behavior and cognition is presented. Though these studies are in their infancy, the findings point to potentially important differences in brain organization that may underlie bonobo and chimpanzees’ differences in social behavior, communication and cognition. © Oxford University Press 2017.

ABSTRACT: Background: Semen from the chimpanzee species becomes a colloidal solid after ejaculation. The formation of this copulatory plug is believed to prevent additional spermatozoa of subsequent mating events from accessing the ova. However, this naturally preserved strategy hampers the processes for sperm preparation. In this study, we investigated whether collagenase can be used to degelify the semen plug and accelerate the semen liquefaction process in zoo captive chimpanzee species (Pan troglodytes). Results: We showed that incubation of chimpanzee ejaculates with 0.1% type I collagenase efficiently and significantly (p < 0.05) releases 2.7-fold more spermatozoa from the coagulated ejaculates, and this degelification process did not alter sperm morphology or viability; nor did it stimulate spontaneous capacitation or an acrosome reaction as assessed by tyrosine phosphorylation and peanut agglutinin stains; moreover, based on computer assisted sperm analysis assay, motility-related parameters remained similar to those of untreated spermatozoa. When collagenase effects were evaluated on cryopreserved sperm samples, we observed post collagenase treatment in which 2.5% glycerol, as a cryoprotectant, preserved sperm acrosome integrity better than 7.8%; however, 7.8% glycerol, as a cryoprotectant, maintained sperm motility better than that of 2.5% glycerol. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated for the first time that type I collagenase can be used to obtain a significantly higher number of spermatozoa from colloid chimpanzee semen ejaculate without affecting the physiological properties of spermatozoa, and these results are critical for the subsequent gamete development. Our results would benefit sperm preparation processes and cryopreservation efficiency per ejaculate, as more unaffected spermatozoa can be released from the semen plug within a shorter period of time. These results would also benefit the genetic diversity of the chimpanzee species, using sperm cells from less dominant individuals, and for achieving better pregnancy success in primates with significantly higher amounts of sperm for artificial insemination. © 2018 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees are the closest phylogenetic relatives to humans, sharing more than 98% genetic sequence identity. These genetic similarities prompted the belief that chimpanzees can serve as an ideal model for human disease conditions and vaccine development. However, in light of the recent NIH decision to phase out biomedical research in chimpanzees and retire NIH-supported chimpanzees, data from the present study will continue to provide value for the care of aged and sick chimpanzees located in zoos, sanctuaries, and primate centers. Surprisingly little information has been published regarding the normal chimpanzee immune system, and most extant studies have been based on small numbers of animals. In the current study, we provide a better understanding of the chimpanzee immune system with regard to age and sex. We examined immune parameters of chimpanzees (n = 94; 51 female, 43 male; age, 6 to 47 y) by using flow cytometry, immune function analysis, and cytokine analysis. Because lymphocytes are key mediators of cellular immune responses, particularly to intracellular pathogens such as viruses, we surveyed the phenotypic and functional attributes of T and B lymphocytes in this healthy and age-stratified population of chimpanzees. We noted a significantly higher percentage of CD16+T cells in male compared with female chimpanzees but no significant changes in percentages of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, or CD4+CD8+ T cells with age or sex. In addition, aging was associated with decreased proliferative responses to mitogens in both sexes. Sex-specific differences also were present in the percentage of NK cells but not in their cytotoxic activity and in circulating cytokine levels in plasma. Going forward, the data presented here regarding immune cell changes associated with aging in healthy chimpanzees will serve to enhance the care of geriatric and ill animals.

ABSTRACT: Background X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a genetic disorder leading to the accumulation of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) due to a mutation in the ABCD1 gene. ABCD1 mutations lead to a variety of phenotypes, including cerebral X-ALD and adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) in affected males and 80% of carrier females. There is no definite genotype-phenotype correlation with intrafamilial variability. Cerebral X-ALD typically presents in childhood, but can also present in juveniles and adults. The most affected tissues are the white matter of the brain and adrenal cortex. MRI demonstrates a characteristic imaging appearance in cerebral X-ALD that is used as a diagnostic tool. Objectives We aim to correlate a mutation in the ABCD1 gene in a chimpanzee to the human disease X-ALD based on MRI features, neurologic symptoms, and plasma levels of VLCFA. Methods Diagnosis of X-ALD made using MRI, blood lipid profiling, and DNA sequencing. Results An 11-year-old chimpanzee showed remarkably similar features to juvenile onset cerebral X-ALD in humans including demyelination of frontal lobes and corpus callosum on MRI, elevated plasma levels of C24:0 and C26:0, and identification of the c.1661G > A ABCD1 variant. Conclusions This case study presents the first reported case of a leukodystrophy in a great ape, and underscores the fidelity of MRI pattern recognition in this disorder across species. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Relatively few assessments of cranial biomechanics formally take into account variation in the material properties of cranial cortical bone. Our aim was to characterize the elastic properties of chimpanzee craniofacial cortical bone and compare these to the elastic properties of dentate human craniofacial cortical bone. From seven cranial regions, 27 cylindrical samples were harvested from each of five chimpanzee crania. Assuming orthotropy, axes of maximum stiffness in the plane of the cortical plate were derived using modified equations of Hooke's law in a Mathcad program. Consistent orientations among individuals were observed in the zygomatic arch and alveolus. The density of cortical bone showed significant regional variation (P < 0.001). The elastic moduli demonstrated significant differences between sites, and a distinct pattern where E3 > E2 > E1. Shear moduli were significantly different among regions (P < 0.001). The pattern by which chimpanzee cranial cortical bone varies in elastic properties resembled that seen in humans, perhaps suggesting that the elastic properties of craniofacial bone in fossil hominins can be estimated with at least some degree of confidence.

ABSTRACT: Limited data are available on hemodynamic responses to anesthetic protocols in wild-born chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Accordingly, this study characterized the heart rate (HR) and blood pressure responses to four anesthetic protocols in 176 clinically healthy, wild-born chimpanzees undergoing routine health assessments. Animals were anesthetized with medetomidine-ketamine (MK) (n = 101), tiletamine-zolazepam (TZ) (n = 30), tiletamine-zolazepam-medetomidine (TZM) (n = 24), or medetomidine-ketamine (maintained with isoflurane) (MKI) (n = 21). During each procedure, HR, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were regularly recorded. Data were grouped according to anesthetic protocol, and mean HR, SBP, and DBP were calculated. Differences between mean HR, SBP, and DBP for each anesthetic protocol were assessed using the Kruskall-Wallis test and a Dunn multiple comparisons post hoc analysis. To assess the hemodynamic time course response to each anesthetic protocol, group mean data (±95% confidence interval CI) were plotted against time postanesthetic induction. Mean HR (beats/min CI) was significantly higher in TZ (86 80-92) compared to MKI (69 61-78) and MK (62 60-64) and in TZM (73 68-78) compared to MK. The average SBP and DBP values (mm Hg CI) were significantly higher in MK (130 126-134 and 94 91-97) compared to TZ (104 96-112 and 58 53-93) and MKI (113 103-123 and 78 69-87) and in TZM (128 120-135 and 88 83-93) compared to TZ. Time course data were markedly different between protocols, with MKI showing the greatest decline over time. Both the anesthetic protocol adopted and the timing of measurement after injection influence hemodynamic recordings in wild-born chimpanzees and need to be considered when monitoring or assessing cardiovascular health. © Copyright 2017 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Social animals need to coordinate with others to reap the benefits of groupliving even when individuals’ interests are misaligned. We compare how chimpanzees, bonobos and children coordinate their actions with a conspecific in a Snowdrift game, which provides a model for understanding how organisms coordinate and make decisions under conflict. In study 1, we presented pairs of chimpanzees, bonobos and children with an unequal reward distribution. In the critical condition, the preferred reward could only be obtained by waiting for the partner to act, with the risk that if no one acted, both would lose the rewards. Apes and children successfully coordinated to obtain the rewards. Children used a ‘both-partner-pull’ strategy and communicated during the task, while some apes relied on an ‘only-one-partner-pulls’ strategy to solve the task, although therewere also signs of strategic behaviour as they waited for their partner to pull when that strategy led to the preferred reward. In study 2, we presented pairs of chimpanzees and bonobos with the same set-up as in study 1 with the addition of a non-social option that provided them with a secure reward. In this situation, apes had to actively decide between the unequal distribution and the alternative. In this set-up, apes maximized their rewards by taking their partners’ potential actions into account. In conclusion, children and apes showed clear instances of strategic decision-making to maximize their own rewards while maintaining successful coordination. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: The bony pelvis of primates is a composite structure serving a variety of functions, and exhibiting a complex pattern of modularity and integration. Still little is known, however, about how patterns of modularity and integration arise, and how they change throughout ontogeny. Here we study the ontogeny of modularity and integration in developmental and functional units of the pelvis of our closest living relatives, the chimpanzees. We use methods of biomedical imaging and geometric morphometrics to quantify pelvic shape change from late fetal stages to adulthood, and to track changes in patterns of covariation within and among pelvic regions. Our results show that both developmental and functional units of the pelvis exhibit significant levels of modularity throughout ontogeny. Modularity of developmental units (ilium, ischium, and pubis) decreases with increasing age, whereas modularity of functional units tends to increase. We suggest that the decreasing modularity and increasing integration of developmental units reflects their gradual fusion. In contrast, increasing modularity of functional pelvic units likely reflects changing functional demands during an individual's lifetime. Overall, ontogenetic changes in patterns of modularity and integration imply that natural selection could act differently on each module, either developmental or functional, at different stages of ontogeny. This further implies that adult patterns of covariation in the pelvis provide only limited information about its evolvability.

ABSTRACT: High-arm grooming is a form of chimpanzee grooming in which two individuals mutually groom while each raising one arm. Palm-to-palm clasping (PPC) is a distinct style of high-arm grooming in which the grooming partners clasp each other's raised palms. In wild communities, samples of at least 100 observed dyads grooming with raised hands showed PPC frequencies varying from <5% (M group, Mahale) to >30% dyads grooming (Kanyawara, Kibale), and in a large free-ranging sanctuary group, the frequency reached >80% dyads (group 1, Chimfunshi) [1, 2]. Because between-community differences in frequency of PPC apparently result from social learning, are stable across generations, and last for at least 9 years, they are thought to be cultural, but the mechanism of transmission is unknown [2]. Here, we examine factors responsible for individual variation in PPC frequency within a single wild community. We found that in the Kanyawara community (Kibale, Uganda), adults of both sexes varied widely in their PPC frequency (from <10% to >50%) and did not converge on a central group tendency. However, frequencies of PPC were highly consistent within matrilines, indicating that individuals maintained lifelong fidelity to the grooming style of their mothers. Matrilineal inheritance of socially learned behaviors has previously been reported for tool use in chimpanzees [3] and in the vocal and feeding behavior of cetaceans [4, 5]. Our evidence indicates that matrilineal inheritance can be sufficiently strong in nonhuman primates to account for long-term differences in community traditions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: We present the spontaneous pathological lesions identified as a result of necropsy or biopsy for 245 chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) over a 35-year period. A review of the pathology database was performed for all diagnoses on chimpanzees from 1980 to 2014. All morphologic diagnoses, associated system, organ, etiology, and demographic information were reviewed and analyzed. Cardiomyopathy was the most frequent lesion observed followed by hemosiderosis, hyperplasia, nematodiasis, edema, and hemorrhage. The most frequently affected systems were the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, urogenital, respiratory, and lymphatic/hematopoietic systems. The most common etiology was undetermined, followed by degenerative, physiologic, neoplastic, parasitic, and bacterial. Perinatal and infant animals were mostly affected by physiologic etiologies and chimpanzee-induced trauma. Bacterial and physiologic etiologies were more common in juvenile animals. Degenerative and physiologic (and neoplastic in geriatric animals) etiologies predominated in adult, middle aged, and geriatric chimpanzees. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

ABSTRACT: Many primate populations are severely threatened by human activity. Illegal hunting with snares frequently causes fatal injuries and permanent mutilations in wild primates. Traumatic injuries and stressful experiences can reduce the efficacy of the immune system to fight parasitic infections. Snare-related changes in primate behavior may also influence the probability of exposure to parasites. We hypothesized that primates with permanent snare-related injuries would have a higher prevalence of intestinal parasites than control individuals. We tested the relationship between snare injuries and the prevalence of intestinal parasites in wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) of Budongo forest, Uganda. We collected 487 fecal samples from known individuals (70 control and 20 snare-injured chimpanzees) and used flotation and sedimentation to isolate helminth eggs and an immunochromatographic assay to identify protozoan cysts. We found that the prevalence of Strongylida nematodes was significantly higher in snare-injured chimpanzees than in control individuals. In contrast, we found no association between snare injuries and three other parasite taxa: Ascaris, cestode, and Cryptosporidium parvum. Our study suggests that snare-injured primates may have higher exposure and/or be more susceptible to developing infections with helminth parasites than control individuals. Future studies should investigate whether snare injuries influence parasite prevalence in other species of wild primates. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: The capacity to imagine and prepare for alternative future possibilities is central to human cognition. Recent research suggests that between age 2 and 4 children gradually begin to demonstrate a capacity to prepare for two simple, mutually exclusive alternatives of an immediate future event. When children were given the opportunity to catch a target an experimenter dropped into an inverted Y-shaped tube, 2-year olds-as well as great apes-tended to cover only one of the exits, whereas 4-year-olds spontaneously and consistently prepared for both possible outcomes. Here we gave children, age 2 to 4 years, and chimpanzees a different opportunity to demonstrate potential competence. Given that social behaviour is particularly full of uncertainty, we developed a version of the task where the outcome was still unpredictable yet obviously controlled by an experimenter. Participants could ensure they would catch the target by simply covering two tube exits. While 4-year-olds demonstrated competence, chimpanzees and the younger children instead tended to cover only one exit. These results substantiate the conclusion that the capacity for simultaneous preparation for mutually exclusive event outcomes develops relatively late in children and they are also in line with the possibility that our close animal relatives lack this capacity. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: We thank van Leeuwen et al. [1] for their response to our finding that matrilineal relationships strongly influence the style of high-arm grooming in wild chimpanzees of the Kanyawara community. We agree with them that grooming styles could be transmitted by different mechanisms in different contexts, and we appreciate their effort to assess whether the transmission of grooming styles within two captive groups in Chimfunshi accords with our result. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Recent decisions and unprecedented evaluative processes about research with chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) continue to attract widespread attention by the public, media, and scientific community. Over the past 5 years, actions by the NIH and the United States Fish and Wildlife Services, have significantly truncated valuable scientific research and jeopardized future research. From a global perspective, the decisions have broad consequences for research aimed not only at human health, but also the conservation and welfare of other species. Full consideration of the role that research plays in improving animal welfare in captivity and in the wild, and the impact of the loss of access to chimpanzees for research, remains largely unexamined. At the same time, legal initiatives aimed at protecting chimpanzees by granting them “personhood” status have increasingly raised questions about equity in standards, oversight, and transparency for chimpanzees in other captive settings. Together, the decisions, subsequent actions, and public discussion put the growing need for a more integrative and global approach to decision-making about the future of captive chimpanzees into sharp relief. In this paper, we outline an expansive framework for ethical consideration to guide dialogue and decisions about animal research, welfare, and equitable treatment of nonhuman animals across settings. Regardless of the setting in which animals live, science plays an indispensable role in informing decisions about individual, species, societal, and environmental health. Thus, the scientific community and broader public need to engage in serious and thoughtful deliberations to weigh the harms and benefits of conducting (or failing to conduct) research that transcends geographic borders and that can guide responsible and informed decisions about the future of chimpanzees. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Accurate and precise surveys of primate abundance provide the basis for understanding species ecology and essential information for conservation assessments. Owing to the elusive nature of wild apes and the vast region of dense forest they inhabit, population estimates of central chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) have largely relied on surveys of their nests. Specific information about the nesting behavior of apes permits the estimation of the number of nests built (nest creation rate). Similarly, information on nest characteristics and environmental factors can be used to estimate the time it takes nests to decay (nest decay rate). Nest creation and decay rates are then used to convert nest density estimates to absolute ape densities. Population estimates that use site-specific estimates of nest creation and decay rates are more accurate and precise. However, it is common practice to generalize these conversion factors across sites because of the additional cost of studies required to gather the information to estimate them. Over a 9-mo study period, we detected and monitored the time to decay of gorilla nests (N = 514) and chimpanzee nests (N = 521) in northern Republic of Congo. We investigated the influence of nest characteristics and environmental factors on nest survivorship and estimated the mean time to nest decay (or equivalently survival) using MARK. Key factors influencing nest decay rate included ape species, forest type, nest height, mean rainfall, nest structure, nest type, and primary aspects of nest construction. Our findings highlight the synergistic effect of behavior and environment on great ape nest degradation, as well as providing practical insights for improving measures to monitor remaining populations of these endangered species. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: Demographic data on wild chimpanzees are crucial for understanding the evolution of chimpanzee and hominin life histories, but most data come from populations affected by disease outbreaks and anthropogenic disturbance. We present survivorship data from a relatively undisturbed and exceptionally large community of eastern chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda. We monitored births, deaths, immigrations, and emigrations in the community between 1995 and 2016. Using known and estimated ages, we calculated survivorship curves for the whole community, for males and females separately, and for individuals ≤2 years old when identified. We used a novel method to address age estimation error by calculating stochastic survivorship curves. We compared Ngogo life expectancy, survivorship, and mortality rates to those from other chimpanzee communities and human hunter-gatherers. Life expectancy at birth for both sexes combined was 32.8 years, far exceeding estimates of chimpanzee life expectancy in other communities, and falling within the range of human hunter-gatherers (i.e., 27–37 years). Overall, the pattern of survivorship at Ngogo was more similar to that of human hunter-gatherers than to other chimpanzee communities. Maximum lifespan for the Ngogo chimpanzees, however, was similar to that reported at other chimpanzee research sites and was less than that of human-hunter gatherers. The absence of predation by large carnivores may contribute to some of the higher survivorship at Ngogo, but this cannot explain the much higher survivorship at Ngogo than at Kanyawara, another chimpanzee community in the same forest, which also lacks large carnivores. Higher survivorship at Ngogo appears to be an adaptive response to a food supply that is more abundant and varies less than that of Kanyawara. Future analyses of hominin life history evolution should take these results into account. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Understanding the extent to which humans perceive the emotional state of animals has both theoretical and practical implications. While recent studies indicate that natural selection has led to some convergence of emotion coding among vertebrate species (including humans), highlighting the interspecific value of emotional signals, it has also been argued that interspecific communication of emotions can fail due to species-specific signalling traits impairing information decoding and/or absence of familiarity with heterospecific communication systems. In this article, we show that human listeners pay attention to the mean pitch of vocalizations when asked to rate the distress level expressed by human baby cries, and that they use a similar pitch scale to rate the emotional level of baby non-human ape (bonobo and chimpanzee) distress calls. As a consequence, the very high-pitched bonobo infant calls were systematically rated as expressing overall high distress levels despite being recorded in contexts eliciting various stress intensity. Conversely, chimpanzee infant calls – which are characterized by a relatively lower pitch – were systematically rated as expressing relatively lower distress levels. These results indicate that, in the absence of exposure/ familiarity, our spontaneous ability to range the emotional content of vocalizations in closely related ape species remains biased by basic frequency differences, suggesting that the absolute interspecific value of emotional signals should not be overestimated. © 2016 The Linnean Society of London.

ABSTRACT: By 2.5 years of age humans are more skilful than other apes on a set of social, but not nonsocial, cognitive tasks. Individual differences in human infants, but not chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, are also explained by correlated variance in these cooperative communicative skills. Relative to nonhuman apes, domestic dogs, Canis familiaris, perform more like human infants in cooperative communicative tasks, but it is unknown whether dog and human cognition share a similar underlying structure. We tested 552 dogs in a large-scale test battery modelled after similar work with humans and nonhuman apes. Unlike chimpanzees, but similarly to humans, individual differences in dogs were explained by correlated variance in skills for solving cooperative communicative problems. Direct comparisons of data from all three species revealed similar patterns of individual differences in cooperative communication between human infants (N = 105) and domestic dogs (N = 430), which were not observed in chimpanzees (N = 106). Future research will be needed to examine whether the observed similarities are a result of similar psychological mechanisms and evolutionary processes in the dog and human lineages. © 2017

ABSTRACT: Animals communicate using a vast array of different signals in different modalities. For chimpanzees, vocalizations, gestures and facial expressions are all important forms of communication, yet these signals have rarely been studied together holistically. The current study aimed to provide the first comprehensive repertoire of flexibly combined (‘free’) multimodal (MM) signals, and assess individual and contextual factors influencing production of, and responses to, unimodal (UM) and MM signals in wild chimpanzees. In total, 48 different free MM signals were produced. MM signals were produced at a significantly lower rate than UM signals, but 22 of 26 focal animals were observed to produce free MM signals. The relative production rates of different types of UM and MM signals differed significantly between the behavioural contexts investigated, showing flexible use of signals across contexts. In contrast, individual factors such as age, sex or rank of signaller did not appear to influence the type of signal produced or the likelihood of eliciting a response. Finally, we compared recipient responses to free MM grunt-gesture signals and matched UM component signals and found that these MM signals were more likely to elicit a response than a grunt alone, but were as likely to elicit a response as the gesture alone. The overall findings point to a widespread capacity for wild chimpanzees to flexibly combine signals from different modalities and highlight the importance of adopting a multimodal approach to studying communication. © 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ABSTRACT: Cumulative culture underpins humanity's enormous success as a species. Claims that other animals are incapable of cultural ratcheting are prevalent, but are founded on just a handful of empirical studies. Whether cumulative culture is unique to humans thus remains a controversial and understudied question that has far-reaching implications for our understanding of the evolution of this phenomenon. We investigated whether one of human's two closest living primate relatives, chimpanzees, are capable of a degree of cultural ratcheting by exposing captive populations to a novel juice extraction task. We found that groups (N = 3) seeded with a model trained to perform a tool modification that built upon simpler, unmodified tool use developed the seeded tool method that allowed greater juice returns than achieved by groups not exposed to a trained model (non-seeded controls; N = 3). One non-seeded group also discovered the behavioral sequence, either by coupling asocial and social learning or by repeated invention. This behavioral sequence was found to be beyond what an additional control sample of chimpanzees (N = 1 group) could discover for themselves without a competent model and lacking experience with simpler, unmodified tool behaviors. Five chimpanzees tested individually with no social information, but with experience of simple unmodified tool use, invented part, but not all, of the behavioral sequence. Our findings indicate that (i) social learning facilitated the propagation of the model-demonstrated tool modification technique, (ii) experience with simple tool behaviors may facilitate individual discovery of more complex tool manipulations, and (iii) a subset of individuals were capable of learning relatively complex behaviors either by learning asocially and socially or by repeated invention over time. That chimpanzees learn increasingly complex behaviors through social and asocial learning suggests that humans' extraordinary ability to do so was built on such prior foundations. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The two closest living relatives of humans, bonobos (Pan paniscus) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), share many traits that are common in humans but rare in other mammals, including societies with high fission–fusion dynamics, male philopatry, female dispersal and extensive social bonding among unrelated individuals [1]. The major difference between these two species is that male aggression is more frequent and intense in male-dominated chimpanzees than in bonobos, where the highest-ranking individuals are female [1]. One potential explanation is that because periods of female sexual receptivity and attractiveness are more extended in bonobos [2], males compete less intensely for each mating opportunity. This would reduce the strength of selection for traits that lead to success in direct contest competition between males and in sexual coercion of females, thus increasing the potential for female choice [3]. Accordingly, it has been predicted that the influence of male dominance rank on reproductive success and the extent of male reproductive skew should be lower in bonobos than in chimpanzees [1]. Although relevant for understanding the evolution of the unusual levels of egalitarianism and cooperation found in human hunter-gatherers [4], comparative analyses in the genus Pan have been limited by the scanty paternity data available for wild bonobos [5]. Here, we show using the largest sample of paternity data available that, contrary to expectation, male bonobos have a higher reproductive skew and a stronger relationship between dominance rank and reproductive success than chimpanzees. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a uniquely human brain disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta protein (Aβ) into extracellular plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) made from intracellular, abnormally phosphorylated tau, and selective neuronal loss. We analyzed a large group of aged chimpanzees (n = 20, age 37–62 years) for evidence of Aβ and tau lesions in brain regions affected by AD in humans. Aβ was observed in plaques and blood vessels, and tau lesions were found in the form of pretangles, NFT, and tau-immunoreactive neuritic clusters. Aβ deposition was higher in vessels than in plaques and correlated with increases in tau lesions, suggesting that amyloid build-up in the brain's microvasculature precedes plaque formation in chimpanzees. Age was correlated to greater volumes of Aβ plaques and vessels. Tangle pathology was observed in individuals that exhibited plaques and moderate or severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy, a condition in which amyloid accumulates in the brain's vasculature. Amyloid and tau pathology in aged chimpanzees suggests these AD lesions are not specific to the human brain. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Humans can extract statistical information, such as the average size of a group of objects or the general emotion of faces in a crowd without paying attention to any individual object or face. To determine whether summary perception is unique to humans, we investigated the evolutional origins of this ability by assessing whether chimpanzees, which are closely related to humans, can also determine the average size of multiple visual objects. Five chimpanzees and 18 humans were able to choose the array in which the average size was larger, when presented with a pair of arrays, each containing 12 circles of different or the same sizes. Furthermore, both species were more accurate in judging the average size of arrays consisting of 12 circles of different or the same sizes than they were in judging the average size of arrays consisting of a single circle. Our findings could not be explained by the use of a strategy in which the chimpanzee detected the largest or smallest circle among those in the array. Our study provides the first evidence that chimpanzees can perceive the average size of multiple visual objects. This indicates that the ability to compute the statistical properties of a complex visual scene is not unique to humans, but is shared between both species. © 2017 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Sensitivity to variance, or risk, has been considered elementary to economic decision-making, featured prominently in discussions of primate species-typical behaviors and phylogeny and heralded as a challenge to deterministic foraging theory. Most risk sensitivity studies involve dichotomous choices and small spatial scales, providing only limited bases for predicting how variance information might be used across contexts. We examined foraging risk sensitivity in four chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) which were presented containers associated with particular mean food rewards/variances. Preferences were measured via indoor dichotomous choice tests. Subsequent tasks, designed to assess how well these preferences held up across situations, involved a differing food type, rank-ordering arrays of containers, and/or recovering them in a large outdoor testing area. In addition, some variations involved memory for containers previously observed being hidden. Risk preferences varied by subject, experimental context, reward type, and mean reward quantity. In rank-ordering experiments, under the reward contingencies utilized, mean food quantity was a better predictor of selection order than variance. These results bring into question arguments that species-typical primate risk traits—in the sense of enduring, generalized dispositional features of organisms—have been firmly identified and suggest that many popular experimental strategies are alone inadequate for reconstructing risk-related traits in primate/human evolution. Models from classical foraging theory, which do not address variance, have likely been successful because they include crucial variables with robust predictive value. Determining the importance of variance to naturalistic decision-making, on the other hand, will require further testing in a wide range of experimental and observational contexts. Significance statement: Studies of risk-sensitive foraging traditionally include two options (of differing variances) that involve the same food type, are close to one another, and are visible to the decision maker. We examined risk sensitivity in four chimpanzees and included experiments that involved four choice options, differing food rewards, increased distance between options, and/or choosing between items visually hidden at the time of decision-making. We found that chimpanzees exhibited sensitivity to variance and could utilize mean quantity and variance associations—even in some cases when the items were not visible. However, differences within or between individual apes in the strength or direction of risk preferences occurred when experimental context (e.g., reward type, visible/hidden) was varied. These results suggest that identifications of primate species-specific risk preferences are premature and that studies of risk should be conducted in a wider range of contexts. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Many primate populations inhabit anthropogenic landscapes. Understanding their long-term ability to persist in such environments and associated real and perceived risks for both primates and people is essential for effective conservation planning. Primates in forest–agricultural mosaics often consume cultivars to supplement their diet, leading to potentially negative encounters with farmers. When crossing roads, primates also face the risk of encounters with people and collision with vehicles. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) in Bossou, Guinea, West Africa, face such risks regularly. In this study, we aimed to examine their activity budget across habitat types and the influence of anthropogenic risks associated with cultivated fields, roads, and paths on their foraging behavior in noncultivated habitat. We conducted 6-h morning or afternoon follows daily from April 2012 to March 2013. Chimpanzees preferentially used forest habitat types for traveling and resting and highly disturbed habitat types for socializing. Wild fruit and crop availability influenced seasonal habitat use for foraging. Overall, chimpanzees preferred mature forest for all activities. They showed a significant preference for foraging at >200 m from cultivated fields compared to 0–100 m and 101–200 m, with no effect of habitat type or season, suggesting an influence of associated risk. Nevertheless, the chimpanzees did not actively avoid foraging close to roads and paths. Our study reveals chimpanzee reliance on different habitat types and the influence of human-induced pressures on their activities. Such information is critical for the establishment of effective land use management strategies in anthropogenic landscapes. © 2017, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: Although a high genetic diversity of Plasmodium spp. circulating in great apes has been revealed recently due to non-invasive methods enabling detection in faecal samples, little is known about the actual mechanisms underlying the presence of Plasmodium DNA in faeces. Great apes are commonly infected by strongylid nematodes, including hookworms, which cause intestinal bleeding. The impact of strongylid infections on the detection of Plasmodium DNA in faeces was assessed in wild, western, lowland gorillas from Dzanga Sangha Protected Areas, Central African Republic and eastern chimpanzees from Kalinzu Forest Reserve, Uganda. Methods: Fifty-one faecal samples from 22 habituated gorillas and 74 samples from 15 habituated chimpanzees were analysed using Cytochrome-b PCR assay and coprological methods. Results: Overall, 26.4% of the analysed samples were positive for both Plasmodium spp. and strongylids. However, the results showed no significant impact of intensity of infections of strongylids on detection of Plasmodium DNA in gorilla and chimpanzee faeces. Conclusion: Bleeding caused by strongylid nematode Necator spp. cannot explain the presence of Plasmodium DNA in ape faeces. © 2017 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Genetic capture-recapture (CR) estimates of population size have potential for aiding the conservation and management of rare or elusive animals. To date, few studies have explored the performance of genetic CR estimates by implementing them in a population of known size. We evaluated the accuracy and precision of genetic CR estimates by genotyping fecal samples collected opportunistically over the territory of a well-studied group of approximately 190 previously identified and genotyped eastern chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) in Kibale National Park, Uganda. We compared the performance of genetic CR estimates based on 3-month and 3-year sampling periods to explore the impact of lengthened sample periods, which are expected to increase accuracy and precision of estimates but also increase the chances of violating population closure assumptions. We compared the effects of using spatial and non-spatial models and equal or heterogeneous detection probabilities upon estimates. Over the 3-year period, we detected 54% of the group members and produced population size estimates with more accuracy and narrower confidence intervals than the 3-month sampling period. The population remained effectively closed over the 3 years and detection heterogeneity was linked to age but not sex. Non-spatial methods estimated group size more accurately than spatially explicit methods, which had a stronger tendency to underestimate population size. This study suggests that genetic CR may produce accurate and precise population size estimates if substantial effort is allocated to sample collection and genotyping. © 2016 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2016

ABSTRACT: Post-aggression consolation is assumed to occur in humans as well as in chimpanzees. While consolation following peer aggression has been observed in children, systematic evidence of consolation in human adults is rare. We used surveillance camera footage of the immediate aftermath of nonfatal robberies to observe the behaviors and characteristics of victims and bystanders. Consistent with empathy explanations, we found that consolation was linked to social closeness rather than physical closeness. While females were more likely to console than males, males and females were equally likely to be consoled. Furthermore, we show that high levels of threat during the robbery increased the likelihood of receiving consolation afterwards. These patterns resemble post-aggression consolation in chimpanzees and suggest that emotions of empathic concern are involved in consolation across humans and chimpanzees. © 2017 Lindegaard et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.

ABSTRACT: Human brains are markedly asymmetric in structure and lateralized in function, which suggests a relationship between these two properties. The brains of other closely related primates, such as chimpanzees, show similar patterns of asymmetry, but to a lesser degree, indicating an increase in anatomical and functional asymmetry during hominin evolution. We analysed the heritability of cerebral asymmetry in chimpanzees and humans using classic morphometrics, geometric morphometrics, and quantitative genetic techniques. In our analyses, we separated directional asymmetry and fluctuating asymmetry (FA), which is indicative of environmental influences during development. We show that directional patterns of asymmetry, those that are consistently present in most individuals in a population, do not have significant heritability when measured through simple linear metrics, but they have marginally significant heritability in humans when assessed through three-dimensional configurations of landmarks that reflect variation in the size, position, and orientation of different cortical regions with respect to each other. Furthermore, genetic correlations between left and right hemispheres are substantially lower in humans than in chimpanzees, which points to a relatively stronger environmental influence on leftright differences in humans. We also show that the level of FA has significant heritability in both species in some regions of the cerebral cortex. This suggests that brain responsiveness to environmental influences, which may reflect neural plasticity, has genetic bases in both species. These results have implications for the evolvability of brain asymmetry and plasticity among humans and our close relatives. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Modern human technological culture depends on social learning. A widespread assumption for chimpanzee tool-use cultures is that they, too, are dependent on social learning. However, we provide evidence to suggest that individual learning, rather than social learning, is the driver behind determining the form of these behaviours within and across individuals. Low-fidelity social learning instead merely facilitates the reinnovation of these behaviours, and thus helps homogenise the behaviour across chimpanzees, creating the population-wide patterns observed in the wild (what here we call ''socially mediated serial reinnovations''). This is the main prediction of the Zone of Latent Solutions (ZLS) hypothesis. This study directly tested the ZLS hypothesis on algae scooping, a wild chimpanzee tool-use behaviour. We provided naïve chimpanzees (n = 14, Mage = 31.33, SD = 10.09) with ecologically relevant materials of the wild behaviour but, crucially, without revealing any information on the behavioural form required to accomplish this task. This study found that naïve chimpanzees expressed the same behavioural form as their wild counterparts, suggesting that, as the ZLS theory predicts, individual learning is the driver behind the frequency of this behavioural form. As more behaviours are being found to be within chimpanzee's ZLS, this hypothesis now provides a parsimonious explanation for chimpanzee tool cultures. © 2017 Bandini and Tennie.

ABSTRACT: Surveying endangered species is necessary to evaluate conservation effectiveness. Camera trapping and biometric computer vision are recent technological advances. They have impacted on the methods applicable to field surveys and these methods have gained significant momentum over the last decade. Yet, most researchers inspect footage manually and few studies have used automated semantic processing of video trap data from the field. The particular aim of this study is to evaluate methods that incorporate automated face detection technology as an aid to estimate site use of two chimpanzee communities based on camera trapping. As a comparative baseline we employ traditional manual inspection of footage. Our analysis focuses specifically on the basic parameter of occurrence where we assess the performance and practical value of chimpanzee face detection software. We found that the semi-automated data processing required only 2–4% of the time compared to the purely manual analysis. This is a non-negligible increase in efficiency that is critical when assessing the feasibility of camera trap occupancy surveys. Our evaluations suggest that our methodology estimates the proportion of sites used relatively reliably. Chimpanzees are mostly detected when they are present and when videos are filmed in high-resolution: the highest recall rate was 77%, for a false alarm rate of 2.8% for videos containing only chimpanzee frontal face views. Certainly, our study is only a first step for transferring face detection software from the lab into field application. Our results are promising and indicate that the current limitation of detecting chimpanzees in camera trap footage due to lack of suitable face views can be easily overcome on the level of field data collection, that is, by the combined placement of multiple high-resolution cameras facing reverse directions. This will enable to routinely conduct chimpanzee occupancy surveys based on camera trapping and semi-automated processing of footage. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: Using semi-automated ape face detection technology for processing camera trap footage requires only 2–4% of the time compared to manual analysis and allows to estimate site use by chimpanzees relatively reliably. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Hunting and sharing of meat is seen across all chimpanzee sites, with variation in prey preferences, hunting techniques, frequencies, and success rates. Here, we compared hunting and meat-eating behaviour in two adjacent chimpanzee communities (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) of Budongo Forest, Uganda: the Waibira and Sonso communities. We observed consistent between-group differences in prey-species preferences and in post-hunting behaviour. Sonso chimpanzees show a strong prey preference for Guereza colobus monkeys (Colobus guereza occidentalis; 74.9% hunts), and hunt regularly (1–2 times a month) but with large year-to-year and month-to-month variation. Waibira chimpanzee prey preferences are distributed across primate and duiker species, and resemble those described in an early study of Sonso hunting. Waibira chimpanzees (which include ex-Sonso immigrants) have been observed to feed on red duiker (Cephalophus natalensis; 25%, 9/36 hunts), a species Sonso has never been recorded to feed on (18 years data, 27 years observations), despite no apparent differences in prey distribution; and show less rank-related harassment of meat possessors. We discuss the two most likely and probably interrelated explanations for the observed intergroup variation in chimpanzee hunting behaviour, that is, long-term disruption of complex group-level behaviour due to human presence and possible socially transmitted differences in prey preferences. © 2017 Hobaiter et al.

ABSTRACT: The longitudinal arch of the human foot is commonly thought to reduce midfoot joint motion to convert the foot into a rigid lever during push off in bipedal walking. In contrast, African apes have been observed to exhibit midfoot dorsiflexion following heel lift during terrestrial locomotion, presumably due to their possession of highly mobile midfoot joints. This assumed dichotomy between human and African ape midfoot mobility has recently been questioned based on indirect assessments of in vivo midfoot motion, such as plantar pressure and cadaver studies; however, direct quantitative analyses of African ape midfoot kinematics during locomotion remain scarce. Here, we used high-speed motion capture to measure three-dimensional foot kinematics in two male chimpanzees and five male humans walking bipedally at similar dimensionless speeds. We analyzed 10 steps per chimpanzee subject and five steps per human subject, and compared ranges of midfoot motion between species over stance phase, as well as within double- and single-limb support periods. Contrary to expectations, humans used a greater average range of midfoot motion than chimpanzees over the full duration of stance. This difference was driven by humans' dramatic plantarflexion and adduction of the midfoot joints during the second double-limb support period, which likely helps the foot generate power during push off. However, chimpanzees did use slightly but significantly more midfoot dorsiflexion than humans in the single limb-support period, during which heel lift begins. These results indicate that both stiffness and mobility are important to longitudinal arch function, and that the human foot evolved to utilize both during push off in bipedal walking. Thus, the presence of human-like midfoot joint morphology in fossil hominins should not be taken as indicating foot rigidity, but may signify the evolution of pedal anatomy conferring enhanced push off mechanics. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Understanding the evolution of cooperation remains a central concern in studies of animal behaviour, with fundamental issues being how individuals avoid being cheated, or ‘short-changed’, and how partners are chosen. Economic decisions made during social interactions should depend upon the availability of potential partners nearby, as these bystanders generate temptations to defect from the current partner. The influence of bystanders is highlighted in two theoretical approaches, biological markets theory and parcelling, both economic models of behaviour. Here, we tested predictions of these models using the grooming behaviour of wild male chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, living under strong structural despotism, where grooming is exchanged both for agonistic support and for itself, and so we provide the first investigation of both presence and value of bystanders on chimpanzees' grooming decisions. We found that male chimpanzees took into account the relative value (rank) of bystanders compared to that of their current partner, with this more important than bystander numbers. High-ranking bystanders appeared to generate incentives to defect from a potentially cooperative interaction and we found that grooming effort was parcelled into discrete episodes, with smaller parcels used when a bystander outranked the current partner. The number of bystanders also generated a temptation to defect, as bidirectional (reciprocated) bouts were more likely to occur with fewer bystanders. Such bouts were more likely with smaller rank distances between groomer and recipient. We found no influence of grooming relationship on initial investment: groomers did not appear to trust that they would receive grooming in return, even from those with whom they had a history of strongly reciprocal grooming. Our findings are consistent with an economic-benefits, markets-based approach, but not a relationship model paradigm. Our work highlights the importance of considering the immediate social context (number and quality of bystanders) in studies of cooperation. © 2017 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees’ refusal of less-preferred food when an experimenter has previously provided preferred food to a conspecific has been taken as evidence for a sense of fairness. Here, we present a novel hypothesis-the social disappointment hypothesis-according to which food refusals express chimpanzees’ disappointment in the human experimenter for not rewarding them as well as they could have. We tested this hypothesis using a two-bytwo design in which food was either distributed by an experimenter or a machine and with a partner present or absent. We found that chimpanzees were more likely to reject food when it was distributed by an experimenter rather than by a machine and that they were not more likely to do so when a partner was present. These results suggest that chimpanzees’ refusal of lesspreferred food stems from social disappointment in the experimenter and not from a sense of fairness. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Recently, gut-dwelling bifidobacteria from chimpanzees, which are phylogenetically close to humans and have feeding habits similar to humans, have been frequently investigated. Given this, we speculated that like humans, chimpanzees would have a unique diversity of bifidobacteria. We herein describe a taxonomically novel member of bifidobacteria isolated from fecal samples of captive chimpanzees. Bifidobacteria were detected in all fecal samples by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. A Bifidobacterium pseudolongum-like species, which could not be detected using B. pseudolongum-specific primers targeting the groEL gene sequence, was dominant in the feces of five chimpanzees. Seven bifidobacterial strains were isolated from this group of five chimpanzees, and all isolates were identified as B. pseudolongum. B. pseudolongum has previously often been isolated from non-primate animals as well as humans; however, here we demonstrate its presence in a nonhuman primate species. © 2017 BMFH Press.

ABSTRACT: Purpose The common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) is the primate that is phylogenetically most closely related to humans (Homo sapiens). In order to shed light on the anatomy and function of the temporalis muscle in the chimpanzee, we have analyzed the expression patterns of the mRNA transcripts of the myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms in different parts of the muscle. Basic procedures We dissected the superficial, deep and sphenomandibularis portions of the temporalis muscle in five adult P. troglodytes and quantified the expression of the mRNA transcripts of the MyHC isoforms in each portion using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Main findings We observed significant differences in the patterns of expression of the mRNA transcripts of the MyHC-IIM isoform between the sphenomandibularis portion and the anterior superficial temporalis (33.6% vs 47.0%; P = 0.032) and between the sphenomandibularis portion and the anterior deep temporalis (33.6% vs 43.0; P = 0.016). We also observed non-significant differences between the patterns of expression in the anterior and posterior superficial temporalis. Principal conclusions The differential expression patterns of the mRNA transcripts of the MyHC isoforms in the temporalis muscle in P. troglodytes may be related to the functional differences that have been observed in electromyographic studies in other species of primates. Our findings can be applicable to the fields of comparative anatomy, evolutionary anatomy, and anthropology. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH

ABSTRACT: Vast, pristine ecosystems and their biodiversity are vanishing globally at frightening speed, but many large tracts of wilderness have not yet been systematically inventoried and important natural populations of threatened species remain poorly characterized. The forest-savanna ecotone of the Eastern Central African Republic (CAR) is one such poorly studied area. Using camera traps, transect walks and collected fecal samples, we provide the first quantitative survey of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in this region previously classified as a highly important chimpanzee conservation unit. In contrast to species distribution models and expert predictions, we did not find any evidence of chimpanzees in the large and remote forest blocks west of the Chinko River despite considerable search effort. Our study thus highlights the limitations of relying solely on remote sensing data to predict the presence or absence of endangered species and illustrates the necessity of extensive field surveys to accurately assess occurrence and density in remote areas. However, we did discover a sizeable and reproducing population of chimpanzees east of the Chinko River. Based on a density of 0.81 chimpanzees/km2 in closed canopy forest that we inferred from nest count data, we estimate 910 weaned chimpanzees to inhabit the Chinko Nature Reserve (CNR) and further predict additional 2700 individuals in adjacent, unmanaged hunting zones and reserves. According to microsatellite data, these chimpanzees genetically cluster with P. t. schweinfurthii populations in East Africa. Conservation action and appropriate management plans are urgently needed to protect this important population and to prevent heavily-armed nomadic pastoralists from the Sahel, illegal miners, as well as elephant and meat poachers, from irretrievably destroying the natural vegetation and local biodiversity of the area. © 2017

ABSTRACT: The number of chimpanzees visiting feeding area gradually increased and by the middle of 1964 a total of forty-five individuals, comprising all age groups of both sexes, had become frequent visitors. Maternal protection extends over the whole period of infancy and, indeed, to the juvenile and on rare occasions the adolescent. M. K. Harlow suggests that contact clinging behaviour, at least in rhesus monkey infants, plays an important role in eliciting maternal behaviour. The newborn infant of a captive rhesus monkey was jerked from its mother when the placenta, which was attached, caught on a branch. Suckling continues throughout infancy. During infancy, affectionate behaviour, play and grooming are all probably helpful in establishing a strong social tie between a mother and her offspring. Grooming behaviour, as a social interaction between a mother and her offspring, appears gradually to become more important as the offspring grows older. © 1967 by Desmond Morris.

ABSTRACT: Among primates, the two recognized species of chimpanzees (common chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes; pygmy chimpanzee, Pan paniscus) are considered to be the most similar to humans. Importantly, in mammals, the food intake behaviour largely determines the tongue morphology, including the type, proportion and distribution of gustatory and non-gustatory tongue papillae. The lingual papillae form during its development and mature in post-natal life depending on the different feeding. In this study, we have used scanning electron microscopy to analyse the age-related changes in the lingual papillae of foetal, newborn and adult P. troglodytes. Four main types of lingual papillae, denominated filiform, fungiform, foliate and vallate, and one subtype of filiform papillae called conical papillae, were found. The main age-related changes observed in all kinds of papillae were a progressive keratinization and morphological complexity along the lifespan. During the foetal period, there was scarce keratinization, which progressively increases in young animals to adulthood. The number of filiform increased with ageing, and both filiform and fungiform papillae in adult tongues are divided into pseudopapillae. On the other hand, the vallate papillae vary from smooth simple surfaces in foetal tongues to irregular surfaces with grooves and pseudopapillae (microscopic papilla-shaped formations within the papilla itself) in adults. These results describe for the first time the age-related variations in the three-dimensional aspect of lingual papillae of the chimpanzee tongue and provide new data to characterize more precisely these structures in the human closest specie. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

ABSTRACT: Social learning is predicted to evolve in socially living animals provided the learning process is not random but biased by certain socio-ecological factors. One bias of particular interest for the emergence of (cumulative) culture is the tendency to forgo personal behaviour in favour of relatively better variants observed in others, also known as the “copy-if-better” strategy. We investigated whether chimpanzees employ copy-if-better in a simple token-exchange paradigm controlling for individual and random social learning. After being trained on one token-type, subjects were confronted with a conspecific demonstrator who either received the same food reward as the subject (control condition) or a higher value food reward than the subject (test condition) for exchanging another token-type. In general, the chimpanzees persisted in exchanging the token-type they were trained on individually, indicating a form of conservatism consistent with previous studies. However, the chimpanzees were more inclined to copy the demonstrator in the test compared to the control condition, indicating a tendency to employ a copy-if-better strategy. We discuss the validity of our results by considering alternative explanations and relate our findings to the emergence of cumulative culture. © 2016, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Coalitions among males during within group conflicts have a strong influence on the competitive and social environment within social groups. To evaluate possible variation in the occurrence of such coalitions in our closest relatives, chimpanzees and bonobos, we compared male aggression and coalitionary behavior in two natural communities, one of each species, with a similar size and composition. Furthermore we compared affiliative behavior that might be related to coalition formation among males. We found higher frequencies of aggression and a greater likelihood to form coalitions during within-group conflicts among wild male chimpanzees at Taï compared to wild male bonobos at LuiKotale. The species differed in the predominant sex of the male coalition partners, with male bonobos forming coalitions more often with females, while male chimpanzees formed coalitions more often with other males. Compared to male bonobos, male chimpanzees showed higher rates of grooming and tended to reconcile more conflicts with other males. Overall our results showed lower frequencies of reconciliation among bonobos than those described in captivity and at artificial feeding sites. These findings add to the evidence that male cooperation and conflict resolution are potentially very different in bonobos and chimpanzees, despite the fact that these two species are closely related, live in multi-male, multi-female communities with a high degree of fission-fusion dynamics and have female-biased migration patterns. Given the correlation between aggressive, cooperative and some affiliative patterns within the species in our study, we hypothesize that the fitness benefits of male relationships are greater in chimpanzees compared to bonobos. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: A relevant approach to address the mechanisms underlying the emergence of the right-handedness/left-hemisphere language specialization of humans is to investigate both proximal and distal causes of language lateralization through the study of non-human primates’ gestural laterality. We carried out the first systematic, quantitative comparison of within-subjects’ and between-species’ laterality by focusing on the laterality of intraspecific gestures of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) living in six different captive groups. We addressed the following two questions: (1) Do chimpanzees and gorillas exhibit stable direction of laterality when producing different types of gestures at the individual level? If yes, is it related to the strength of laterality? (2) Is there a species difference in gestural laterality at the population level? If yes, which factors could explain this difference? During 1356 observation hours, we recorded 42335 cases of dyadic gesture use in the six groups totalling 39 chimpanzees and 35 gorillas. Results showed that both species could exhibit either stability or flexibility in their direction of gestural laterality. These results suggest that both stability and flexibility may have differently modulated the strength of laterality depending on the species social structure and dynamics. Furthermore, a multifactorial analysis indicates that these particular social components may have specifically impacted gestural laterality through the influence of gesture sensory modality and the position of the recipient in the signaller's visual field during interaction. Our findings provide further support to the social theory of laterality origins proposing that social pressures may have shaped laterality through natural selection. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Background: Simian immunodeficiency virus of chimpanzees (SIVcpz), the progenitor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), is associated with increased mortality and AIDS-like immunopathology in wild-living chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Surprisingly, however, similar findings have not been reported for chimpanzees experimentally infected with SIVcpz in captivity, raising questions about the intrinsic pathogenicity of this lentivirus. Findings: Here, we report progressive immunodeficiency and clinical disease in a captive western chimpanzee (P. t. verus) infected twenty years ago by intrarectal inoculation with an SIVcpz strain (ANT) from a wild-caught eastern chimpanzee (P. t. schweinfurthii). With sustained plasma viral loads of 105 to 106 RNA copies/ml for the past 15 years, this chimpanzee developed CD4+ T cell depletion (220 cells/μl), thrombocytopenia (90,000 platelets/μl), and persistent soft tissue infections refractory to antibacterial therapy. Combination antiretroviral therapy consisting of emtricitabine (FTC), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), and dolutegravir (DTG) decreased plasma viremia to undetectable levels (<200 copies/ml), improved CD4+ T cell counts (509 cell/μl), and resulted in the rapid resolution of all soft tissue infections. However, initial lack of adherence and/or differences in pharmacokinetics led to low plasma drug concentrations, which resulted in transient rebound viremia and the emergence of FTC resistance mutations (M184V/I) identical to those observed in HIV-1 infected humans. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that SIVcpz can cause immunodeficiency and other hallmarks of AIDS in captive chimpanzees, including P. t. verus apes that are not naturally infected with this virus. Moreover, SIVcpz-associated immunodeficiency can be effectively treated with antiretroviral therapy, although sufficiently high plasma concentrations must be maintained to prevent the emergence of drug resistance. These findings extend a growing body of evidence documenting the immunopathogenicity of SIVcpz and suggest that experimentally infected chimpanzees may benefit from clinical monitoring and therapeutic intervention. © 2017 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: An important debate centres around the nature of prosociality in nonhuman primates. Chimpanzees help other individuals in some experimental settings, yet they do not readily share food. One solution to this paradox is that they are motivated to help others provided there are no competing interests. However, benefits to recipients could arise as by-products of testing. Here we report two studies that separate by-product from intended helping in chimpanzees using a GO/NO-GO paradigm. Actors in one group could help a recipient by releasing a food box, but the same action for another group prevented a recipient from being able to get food. We find no evidence for helping - chimpanzees engaged in the test regardless of the effects on their partners. Illusory prosocial behaviour could arise as a by-product of task design. © The Author(s) 2016.

ABSTRACT: Primates possess great manual dexterity, and their limbs are integral to many aspects of normal functioning (e.g., climbing, feeding). As such, the loss of a limb carries the risk of significant disability and potentially harmful impairment of species-typical functioning. Limb loss is known to occur in some wild primate populations due to entanglement in hunting snares, but can also occur in captive settings due to injury that necessitates therapeutic amputation. In this study, we conducted a detailed evaluation of the behavior, travel, and space use expressed by a female zoo-housed chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) before and following surgical amputation of her right forelimb. Overall, our results suggest that the injury did not substantively affect her daily activities. She showed no change to her vertical space use, spending equivalent proportions of her time on the ground and high in the enclosure. There was a decrease in the frequency of locomotion on the ground (P = 0.006) but also a significant increase in the overall distance travelled (P = 0.0015) following the removal of the limb. This case study provides evidence that individual chimpanzees are able to successfully adjust to significant anatomical changes when provided adequate environments in which to stay active, and highlights the importance of an effective post-surgical monitoring period—a comprehensive recovery evaluation that includes input from both veterinary and behavioral research staff is likely to provide the most holistic assessment of animal health and long-term wellbeing.

ABSTRACT: With the conversion of natural habitats to farmland, nonhuman primates (hereafter primates) are increasingly exposed to agricultural crops. Although frugivorous primates are important seed dispersers that sometimes feed on agricultural fruits, evidence for dispersal of crops by primates is lacking. Here, we examine flexible feeding on cacao (Theobroma cacao) fruit and seed dispersal patterns by chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) at Bossou in Guinea, and consequent cacao germination and survival. From direct observations, we confirm that cacao fruit is not an important food to chimpanzees, representing 0.23 % of focal animal feeding time. Chimpanzees ingest cacao pulp and either spit out the large seeds intact from unripe cacao fruit or swallow the seeds from ripe cacao fruits, which are consequently deposited in feces. From ecological surveys we show that chimpanzees distributed cacao extensively throughout their home range, at a mean distance of 407 m ± SE 0.6 (N = 90 clusters, range: 4–1130 m) from cacao plantations. As distance from the cacao plantation increased, cacao plants were more likely to survive. Other factors, including number of cacao plants in a cluster, plant height, and openness of the understory did not predict short-term cacao survival. Cacao plants within the forest did not produce fruit. By contrast, when chimpanzees deposited seeds in a plantation, cacao plants produced fruits as a result of farmers’ maintenance of the area. Our local-scale findings emphasize the complex behavioral and ecological interconnections between coexisting humans and primates in agricultural landscapes and generate interesting questions regarding primate niche construction and crop “ownership” related to who “plants” the crop. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: Species composition of Necator hookworms was surveyed in (i) Ugandan chimpanzees living around farms and villages at Bulindi, (ii) Gabonese gorillas under habituation in Moukalaba-Doudou National Park (MDNP), and (iii) Gabonese villagers living adjacent to MDNP. Internal transcribed spacers (ITS) of rDNA and partial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (Cox1) gene of mtDNA were analyzed from larvae obtained by coproculture. Three ITS types (I, II and III) and three Cox1 haplotype groups (A, B and C) were demonstrated. ITS type I and Cox1 haplotype group A, representing Necator americanus, were demonstrated in the hookworm larvae from Gabonese gorillas and humans, but not from Ugandan chimpanzees. Type II and haplotype groups B and C, presumably representing N. gorillae, were found in larvae from Ugandan chimpanzees and Gabonese gorillas and humans. These features were overall similar with those found previously in the Central African Republic. Meanwhile, type III was proven in a larva from a Gabonese gorilla as the first demonstration from a non-human primate. Cox1 haplotypes obtained from Ugandan chimpanzees formed a subgroup within group B, presumably reflecting dispersal and diversification processes of the apes. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd

ABSTRACT: Being able to recognize the faces of our friends and family members no matter where we see them represents a substantial challenge for the visual system because the retinal image of a face can be degraded by both changes in the person (age, expression, pose, hairstyle, etc.) and changes in the viewing conditions (direction and degree of illumination). Yet most of us are able to recognize familiar people effortlessly. A popular theory for how face recognition is achieved has argued that the brain stabilizes facial appearance by building average representations that enhance diagnostic features that reliably vary between people while diluting features that vary between instances of the same person. This explains why people find it easier to recognize average images of people, created by averaging multiple images of the same person together, than single instances (i.e. photographs). Although this theory is gathering momentum in the psychological and computer sciences, there is no evidence of whether this mechanism represents a unique specialization for individual recognition in humans. Here we tested two species, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta), to determine whether average images of different familiar individuals were easier to discriminate than photographs of familiar individuals. Using a two-alternative forced-choice, match-to-sample procedure, we report a behaviour response profile that suggests chimpanzees encode the faces of conspecifics differently than rhesus monkeys and in a manner similar to humans. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: The physical environments of captive and wild animals frequently differ in substrate types and compliance. As a result, there is an assumption that differences in rearing environments between captive and wild individuals produce differences in skeletal morphology. Here, this hypothesis is tested using a sample of 42 captive and wild common chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Articular surface areas of the humerus, radius, ulna, femur, and tibia were calculated from linear breadth measurements, adjusted for size differences using Mosimann shape variables, and compared across sex and environmental groups using two-way ANOVA. Results indicate that the articular surfaces of the wrist and knee differ between captive and wild chimpanzees; captive individuals have significantly larger distal ulna and tibial plateau articular surfaces. In both captive and wild chimpanzees, males have significantly larger femoral condyles and distal radius surfaces than females. Finally, there is an interaction effect between sex and rearing in the articular surfaces of the femoral condyles and distal radius in which captive males have significantly larger surface areas than all other sex-rearing groups. These data suggest that long bone articular surfaces may be sensitive to differences experienced by captive and wild individuals, such as differences in diet, body mass, positional behaviors, and presumed loading environments. Importantly, these results only find differences due to rearing environment in some long bone articular surfaces. Thus, future work on skeletal morphology could cautiously incorporate data from captive individuals, but should first investigate potential intraspecific differences between captive and wild individuals. © 2017 Lewton.

ABSTRACT: Upright bipedalism is a hallmark of hominin locomotion, however debates continue regarding the extent of arboreal locomotion and the nature of bipedalism practiced by early hominins. Pedal form and function play a prominent role in these debates, as the foot is the element that directly interacts with the locomotor substrate. Recent finds have substantially increased the availability of associated foot remains of early hominins and emphasized the enigmatic nature of the early evolution of human bipedalism. New discoveries of associated forefoot remains have afforded the opportunity to assess relative proportions across the forefoot of fossil hominins and illuminated the need for data on relative loading across the forefoot in extant hominoids. In order to provide functional data with which to examine the relationship between bony features and load distribution across the forefoot during climbing, we present the first analysis of plantar pressure distribution across the forefoot of chimpanzees climbing a vertical support. Chimpanzees load the medial metatarsals and first toe disproportionately during vertical climbing. Peak pressures on these elements occur at the end of stance phase during climbing and are higher than on any other elements of the foot. Toe pressures are considerably higher during vertical climbing than during knuckle-walking or movement on horizontal poles, supporting the notion that the plantarly-broad and dorsally-narrow metatarsal heads in chimpanzees and some early hominins are associated with close-packing of the metatarsophalangeal joint during climbing. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Objective The aim of this study is to examine the expression pattern of the different myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms in the masseter and medial pterygoid muscles by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to obtain information at molecular level which can be related to the functional characteristics of these two muscles. Design The masseter, deep and superficial portion, and medial pterygoid muscles of five adult Pan troglodytes were dissected in order to obtain samples of the anterior and posterior regions of each portion of the masseter and of the medial pterygoid. The expression of MyHC isoforms mRNA transcripts was analyzed by RT-qPCR. Results No significant differences in expression of MyHC isoforms between the masseter and the medial pterygoid were found. In contrast, when comparing the superficial and the deep portion of the masseter, we found that the MyHC-IIM isoform was expressed at a significantly higher level in the superficial portion. Conclusions The superficial portion of the masseter and the medial pterygoid muscle have the same expression pattern regarding the different MyHC isoforms. On the other hand, the deep portion of the masseter, which is activated mainly during lateral and repositioning movements of the mandible, has a lower MyHC-IIM isoform expression than the superficial portion. Our findings provide new data on functional aspects of the masseter and medial pterygoid that can complement results obtained by other techniques. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Polymorphisms of the arginine vasopressin receptor 1a (AVPR1a) gene have been linked to various measures related to human social behavior, including sibling conflict and agreeableness. In chimpanzees, AVPR1a polymorphisms have been associated with traits important for social interactions, including sociability, joint attention, dominance, conscientiousness, and hierarchical personality dimensions named low alpha/stability, disinhibition, and negative emotionality/low dominance. We examined associations between AVPR1a and six personality domains and hierarchical personality dimensions in 129 chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) living in Japan or in a sanctuary in Guinea. We fit three linear and three animal models. The first model included genotype, the second included sex and genotype, and the third included genotype, sex, and sex × genotype. All personality phenotypes were heritable. Chimpanzees possessing the long form of the allele were higher in conscientiousness, but only in models that did not include the other predictors; however, additional analyses suggested that this may have been a consequence of study design. In animal models that included sex and sex × genotype, chimpanzees homozygous for the short form of the allele were higher in extraversion. Taken with the findings of previous studies of chimpanzees and humans, the findings related to conscientiousness suggest that AVPR1a may be related to lower levels of impulsive aggression. The direction of the association between AVPR1a genotype and extraversion ran counter to what one would expect if AVPR1a was related to social behaviors. These results help us further understand the genetic basis of personality in chimpanzees. © 2016, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: We present the spontaneous causes of mortality for 137 chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) over a 35-year period. A record review of the pathology database was performed and a primary cause of mortality was determined for each chimpanzee. The most common causes of mortality were as follows: cardiomyopathy (40% of all mortalities), stillbirth/abortion, acute myocardial necrosis, chimpanzee-induced trauma, amyloidosis, and pneumonia. Five morphologic diagnoses accounted for 61% of mortalities: cardiomyopathy, hemorrhage, acute myocardial necrosis, amyloidosis, and pneumonia. The most common etiologies were degenerative, undetermined, bacterial, traumatic, and neoplastic. The cardiovascular system was most frequently involved, followed by the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and multisystemic diseases. Degenerative diseases were the primary etiological cause of mortality of the adult captive chimpanzee population. Chimpanzee-induced trauma was the major etiological cause of mortality among the perinatal and infant population. This information should be a useful resource for veterinarians and researchers working with chimpanzees. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

ABSTRACT: Understanding nest site choice by chimpanzees has implications for ecology, anthropology, and in the collection of census data, yet it remains controversial. Here we provide the first information on environmental factors affecting nest site choice in a montane population of the rare and relatively understudied Nigerian/Cameroon chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes ellioti) in Ngel Nyaki Forest Reserve, Nigeria. The forest is small, isolated, and visited by researchers, community members, and hunters. We also tested the hypothesis that people (researchers) walking along forest trails collecting data on a regular basis since 2005 will have changed nesting behaviour in the vicinity of the trails. Along the trails searched for nests, the chimpanzees used a subset of 35 (28.5%) of all available tree species. The top 5 nest tree species represented 16% of all non-nest tree species. The nest trees were on steeper than average slopes and the trees themselves were shorter and had a smaller DBH (diameter at breast height) than trees without nests. We found no evidence to suggest a change in nesting behaviour along trails compared with off trails; however, the average nest height today is considerably higher than it was in 2004, which may indicate a change in behaviour across the whole forest. © 2017 S.

ABSTRACT: Introduction In this study we evaluated the full extent of placental bed changes (centre to periphery) in a pregnant chimpanzee uterus, kept at the Museum for Central Africa in Tervuren, Belgium. According to placental size the specimen was equivalent to an 8 weeks pregnant human uterus. Methods Histological sections from central to peripheral tissue blocks of the placental bed were stained to reveal the presence of trophoblast, endothelium, vascular smooth muscle and elastic laminae. As an indicator for early arterial remodelling, we evaluated endothelial nuclear rounding and subendothelial vascular changes within the maternal vasculature in decidua and adjacent inner myometrium. Results While interstitially invading trophoblasts were present, endovascular trophoblast invasion seemed about to start into one spiral artery outlet at the centre of the placental bed, confirming our previous impression of a later onset of endovascular trophoblast invasion as compared to the human. An early sign of spiral artery remodelling was rounding of the endothelial nuclei. This phenomenon was not related to the local presence of interstitial trophoblast. Discussion Endothelial nuclear rounding turned out to be a feature of the placental bed as a whole, being significantly less prominent in the adjacent non-placental bed part of the uterus, indicating an effect of the presence of the placenta. The different time-course of early spiral artery remodelling in the chimpanzee as compared to the human may have had a significant impact upon our evolution. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Non-dietary aspects of ape scats such as scat weight and diameter are correlated with age and sex of defaecator for gorillas and orangutans. Defaecation rates of primates, including apes, illuminate their role as primary seed dispersers. We assess if non-dietary features of scats for East African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) reveal such insights for members of the Kanyawara community in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Our objective is to see if such data yield useful perspectives for future census work on unhabituated chimpanzees, that is, what can scats tell us about a wild study population, beyond diet? We followed ten adults from this community, as well as travelling parties, comparing observed vs. unobserved defaecations, and collected data on scat weight and dimensions, defaecation rate, scat encounter rate, and interval between defaecations. Few non-dietary features of chimpanzee scats significantly differentiated sex or age of the defaecator, but total scat length and height distinguished adults from juveniles/infants. Defaecation rates and distance travelled were similar for adult males and females, indicating the importance of both sexes as potential primary seed dispersers. Observed travelling parties vs. non-observed travelling parties yielded similar data, indicating the potential to assess party size from scat encounter rates over a set distance. We provide detailed measurements of scat dimensions for this ape taxon which previously have been lacking. This research builds upon prior work by recording more in-depth data for focal subjects and travelling parties on defaecation and scat encounter rates. The findings presented should assist in the interpretation of scat data when censusing unhabituated chimpanzees. © 2017, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: Objectively measuring the effects of parasitism on animal health is challenging, especially in the wild. Analyses of behavioural organization are increasingly used for this purpose, to identify animals in pathological or otherwise challenged states. Here, we investigated the possible impact of gastrointestinal helminth infection on the behaviour of wild chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, by applying fractal analysis to their feeding patterns. We predicted that higher intensity of strongylid infection should be associated with altered organizational complexity in temporal sequences of behaviour. We observed 15 habituated male chimpanzees in Kalinzu Reserve Forest, Uganda, and collected behavioural time series via focal animal sampling. We quantified the number of strongylid eggs per gram of faecal sediment using a modified simple sedimentation method to estimate the intensity of infection with strongylid nematodes. We used detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) to explore long-range dependence in binary sequences of feeding behaviour as an index of organizational complexity along a stochastic-deterministic gradient. We then built several generalized linear mixed models to examine the relationship between behavioural organization and strongylid infection. Our results indicate that chimpanzee feeding sequences are long-range dependent and antipersistent, i.e. short bouts tended to be followed by long bouts and vice versa. Furthermore, the complexity of chimpanzee feeding sequences and the intensity of infection with strongylid nematodes were positively related: individuals with more intense infections exhibited more stochastic feeding sequences. In contrast, more conventional analyses did not reveal any relationship between parasitism and chimpanzee behaviour, nor did a survival analysis find variation in the probability of switching between behaviour states across chimpanzees with varying infection phenotypes. This work suggests that strongylid nematodes do pose a challenge for wild chimpanzees, manifest as altered organizational complexity in behaviour sequences, and provides further evidence that fractal analyses can have a valuable role in animal health monitoring. © 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ABSTRACT: A detailed analysis of tool use behaviors can disclose the underlying cognitive traits of the users. We investigated the technique used by wild chimpanzees to extract the underground nests of stingless bees (Meliplebeia lendliana), which represent a hard-to-reach resource given their highly undetectable location. Using remote-sensor camera trap footage, we analyzed 151 visits to 50 different bee nests by 18 adult chimpanzees of both sexes. We quantified the degree of complexity and flexibility of this technique by looking at the behavioral repertoire and at its structural organization. We used Generalized Linear Mixed Models to test whether individuals differed in their action repertoire sizes and in their action sequencing patterns, as well as in their preferences of use of different behavioral elements (namely, actions, and grip types). We found that subjects showed non-randomly organized sequences of actions and that the occurrence of certain actions was predicted by the type of the previous action in the sequences. Subjects did not differ in their repertoire sizes, and all used extractive actions involving tools more often than manual digging. As for the type of grip employed, the grip involving the coordinated use of hands and feet together was most frequently used by all subjects when perforating, and we detected significant individual preferences in this domain. Overall, we describe a highly complex and flexible extractive technique, and propose the existence of inter-individual variation in it. We discuss our results in the light of the evolution of higher cognitive abilities in the human lineage. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Conformity to the behavioural preferences of others can have powerful effects on intragroup behavioural homogeneity in humans, but evidence in animals remains minimal. In this study, we took advantage of circumstances in which individuals or pairs of captive chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, were ‘migrated’ between groups, to investigate whether immigrants would conform to a new dietary population preference experienced in the group they entered, an effect suggested by recent fieldwork. Such ‘migratory-minority’ chimpanzees were trained to avoid one of two differently coloured foods made unpalatable, before ‘migrating’ to, and then observing, a ‘local-majority’ group consume a different food colour. Both migratory-minority and local-majority chimpanzees displayed social learning, spending significantly more time consuming the previously unpalatable, but instead now edible, food, than did control chimpanzees who did not see immigrants eat this food, nor emigrate themselves. However, following the migration of migratory-minority chimpanzees, these control individuals and the local-majority chimpanzees tended to rely primarily upon personal information, consuming first the food they had earlier learned was palatable before sampling the alternative. Thus, chimpanzees did not engage in conformity in the context we tested; instead seeing others eat a previously unpalatable food led to socially learned and adaptive re-exploration of this now-safe option in both minority and majority participants. © 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ABSTRACT: Vaccination is considered to be the most effective method of preventing infectious or other diseases. Adenovirus (Ad) is one the most promising vectors in vaccine research and development. It can induce not only potent humoral but also cellular immune responses, and has therefore been widely applied in basic and translational studies. Chimpanzee Ad is a rare serotype circulating in humans. This circumvents the problem of preexisting immunity to human Ad serotypes, enhancing Chimpanzee Ad prospects in vaccine development. Here we describe experimental procedures used to generate a new generation of rabies vaccine based on a chimpanzee Ad vector, which can be extended in the development of novel vaccines against other infectious diseases. © Springer Science+Business Media LLC 2017.

ABSTRACT: Lethal coalitionary aggression is of significant interest to primatologists and anthropologists given its pervasiveness in human, but not nonhuman, animal societies. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) provide the largest sample of recorded lethal coalitionary aggression in nonhuman primates, and most long-term chimpanzee study sites have recorded coalitionary killing of conspecifics. We report an inferred lethal attack by resident males on a former alpha male chimpanzee (P. t. verus) at Fongoli in Senegal. We describe the male’s presence in the community, his overthrow, social peripheralization for >5 yr, and his attempt to rejoin the group as well as circumstances surrounding his death. We report attacks by multiple chimpanzees on his dead body, most frequently by a young adult male and an older female. The latter also cannibalized the body. Coalitionary killing is rare among West African chimpanzees compared to the East African chimpanzee (P. t. schweinfurthii). This pattern may relate to differences in population densities, research effort, and subspecies differences in biology and behavior. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: Historical and recent behavioral, cognitive, neurological, and molecular biological studies with primates generally, and with chimpanzees specifically, have contributed and advanced scientific theory in two critical ways. First, because of their genetic and biological similarities to humans, studies with nonhuman primates, including the great apes, have been vital for testing evolutionary theories on the origins of human-specific skills and specializations. For example, comparative studies of primates, notably chimpanzees, have been vital for testing theories on the origins of language; tool use and tool making; culture; theory of mind and deception; complex emotional systems, such as empathy; and cortical organization and lateralization, to name a few (Savage-Rumbaugh and Lewin 1994; Byrne 1995; Van Schaik et al. 1999; Rumbaugh and Washburn 2003; Byrne and Corp 2004; Whiten and Mesoudi 2008; Hopkins 2013; Hopkins et al. 2014b). Second, studies in nonhuman primates have been critically important for modeling human disease and psychological problems in an effort to improve our understanding of mechanisms underlying dysfunction, and potential interventions and treatments (Phillips et al. 2014). © 2017 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

ABSTRACT: Among modern foraging societies, men hunt more than women, who mostly target relatively low-quality, reliable resources (i.e., plants). This difference has long been assumed to reflect human female reproductive constraints, particularly caring for and provisioning mates and offspring. Long-term studies of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) enable tests of hypotheses about the possible origins of human sex differences in hunting, prior to pair-bonding and regular provisioning. We studied two eastern chimpanzee communities (Kasekela, Mitumba) in Gombe, Tanzania and one (Kanyawara) in Kibale, Uganda. Relative to males, females had low hunting rates in all three communities, even where they encountered red colobus monkeys (the primary prey of chimpanzees) as often as males did. There was no evidence that clinging offspring hampered female hunting. Instead, consistent with the hypothesis that females should be more risk-averse than males, females at all three sites specialized in low-cost prey (terrestrial/sedentary prey at Gombe; black and white colobus monkeys at Kanyawara). Female dominance rank was positively correlated with red colobus hunting probability only at Kasekela, suggesting that those in good physical condition were less sensitive to the costs of possible failure. Finally, the potential for carcass appropriation by males deterred females at Kasekela (but not Kanyawara or Mitumba) from hunting in parties containing many adult males. Although chimpanzees are not direct analogs of the last common ancestor (LCA) of Pan and Homo, these results suggest that before the emergence of social obligations regarding sharing and provisioning, constraints on hunting by LCA females did not necessarily stem from maternal care. Instead, they suggest that a risk-averse foraging strategy and the potential for losing prey to males limited female predation on vertebrates. Sex differences in hunting behavior would likely have preceded the evolution of the sexual division of labor among modern humans. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: We report a case of chimpanzee trisomy 22 in a captive-born female. Because chromosome 22 in great apes is homologous to human chromosome 21, the present case is analogous to human trisomy 21, also called Down syndrome. The chimpanzee in the present case experienced retarded growth; infantile cataract and vision problems, including nystagmus, strabismus, and keratoconus; congenital atrial septal defect; and hypodontia. All of these symptoms are common in human Down syndrome. This case was the second reported case of trisomy 22 in the chimpanzee. The chimpanzee in our case became blind by 7 years old, making social life with other chimpanzees difficult, but opportunities to interact with other conspecific individuals have been offered routinely. We believe that providing her with the best care over the course of her life will be essential. © 2017, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: Dominance hierarchies are a prominent feature of the lives of many primate species. These hierarchies have important fitness consequences, as high rank is often positively correlated with reproduction. Although adult male chimpanzees strive for status to gain fitness benefits, the development of dominance relationships is not well understood. While two prior studies found that adolescent males do not display dominance relationships with peers, additional research at Ngogo in Kibale National Park, Uganda, indicates that adolescents there form a linear dominance hierarchy. These conflicting findings could reflect different patterns of rank acquisition across sites. An alternate possibility arises from a recent re-evaluation of age estimates at Ngogo and suggests that the report describing decided dominance relationships between adolescent males may have been due to the accidental inclusion of young adult males in the sample. To investigate these issues, we conducted a study of 23 adolescent male chimpanzees of known age during 12 months at Ngogo. Adolescent male chimpanzees exchanged pant grunts, a formal signal of submission, only 21 times. Recipients of pant grunts were late adolescent males, ranging between 14 and 16 years old. In contrast, younger adolescent males never received pant grunts from other males. Aggression between adolescent males was also rare. Analysis of pant grunts and aggressive interactions did not produce a linear dominance hierarchy among adolescent males. These data indicate that adolescent male chimpanzees do not form decided dominance relationships with their peers and are consistent with the hypothesis that the hierarchy described previously at Ngogo resulted from inaccurate age estimates of male chimpanzees. Because dominance relationships develop before adulthood in other primates, our finding that adolescent male chimpanzees do not do so is surprising. We offer possible explanations for why this is the case and suggest future studies that may help clarify the matter. © 2016, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: African large mammals are under extreme pressure from unsustainable hunting and habitat loss. Certain traits make large mammals particularly vulnerable. These include late age at first reproduction, long inter-birth intervals, and low population density. Great apes are a prime example of such vulnerability, exhibiting all of these traits. Here we assess the rate of population change for the western chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes verus, over a 24-year period. As a proxy for change in abundance, we used transect nest count data from 20 different sites archived in the IUCN SSC A.P.E.S. database, representing 25,000 of the estimated remaining 35,000 western chimpanzees. For each of the 20 sites, datasets for 2 different years were available. We estimated site-specific and global population change using Generalized Linear Models. At 12 of these sites, we detected a significant negative trend. The estimated change in the subspecies abundance, as approximated by nest encounter rate, yielded a 6% annual decline and a total decline of 80.2% over the study period from 1990 to 2014. This also resulted in a reduced geographic range of 20% (657,600 vs. 524,100 km2). Poverty, civil conflict, disease pandemics, agriculture, extractive industries, infrastructure development, and lack of law enforcement, are some of the many reasons for the magnitude of threat. Our status update triggered the uplisting of the western chimpanzee to “Critically Endangered” on the IUCN Red List. In 2017, IUCN will start updating the 2003 Action Plan for western chimpanzees and will provide a consensus blueprint for what is needed to save this subspecies. We make a plea for greater commitment to conservation in West Africa across sectors. Needed especially is more robust engagement by national governments, integration of conservation priorities into the private sector and development planning across the region and sustained financial support from donors. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Great apes are important seed dispersers with large bodies, able to swallow large seeds and travel long distances. Although there have been several studies investigating seed dispersal quality [sensu Schupp (Vegetatio 107/108:15–29, 1993)] by chimpanzees, there is little information on the volume of seeds they can carry in their bodies. When a relatively fresh corpse of a mature female chimpanzee was found at Mahale, Tanzania, we took advantage of the rare opportunity to investigate the total weight and cubic volume of seeds recovered from the corpse. The seeds contained in the corpse weighed 258.8 g (dry weight) and measured 489.4 cm3. The volume of seeds was 14.7 % of the previously reported capacity of the digestive tract of a chimpanzee in captivity. We also indirectly estimated the volume of seeds from the values of observed seed volume in feces, the reported number of defecations per day, and the seed passage time. The estimated volume was significantly lower than the observed seed volume, suggesting that the number of defecations per day is underestimated because it may not include nighttime defecation. © 2016, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes are critically involved in the defense against intracellular pathogens. MHC diversity comparisons among samples of closely related taxa may reveal traces of past or ongoing selective processes. The bonobo and chimpanzee are the closest living evolutionary relatives of humans and last shared a common ancestor some 1 mya. However, little is known concerning MHC class I diversity in bonobos or in central chimpanzees, the most numerous and genetically diverse chimpanzee subspecies. Here, we used a long-read sequencing technology (PacBio) to sequence the classical MHC class I genes A, B, C, and A-like in 20 and 30 wild-born bonobos and chimpanzees, respectively, with a main focus on central chimpanzees to assess and compare diversity in those two species. We describe in total 21 and 42 novel coding region sequences for the two species, respectively. In addition, we found evidence for a reduced MHC class I diversity in bonobos as compared to central chimpanzees as well as to western chimpanzees and humans. The reduced bonobo MHC class I diversity may be the result of a selective process in their evolutionary past since their split from chimpanzees. © 2017, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: We describe behaviors of unhabituated wild chimpanzees in Gabon during repeated encounters with large mirrors installed permanently in their home range. Movement in proximity to the mirrors triggered video cameras that recorded the scene. Data are presented for 51 mirror encounters spanning a 3-year period. After initial wariness, mirror-directed aggressive behaviors were common, especially in adult males, but aggression gradually diminished and eventually almost completely ceased. Focusing on the two mirrors that elicited most reactions, the percentage of chimpanzees showing tension or anxiety also decreased across encounters. These mirrors elicited a range of socio-sexual behaviors interpreted as having a reassurance function, especially when group-level tension appeared high. Chimpanzees also occasionally directed these behaviors towards their own reflection. Despite increasing habituation and positive attraction to the mirrors, none of the chimpanzees displayed signs of self-recognition. We conclude that a combination of large mirrors and video traps can provide valuable information about unhabituated, semi-terrestrial primates in their natural habitat, by inducing the primates to stay in one place for longer than they might otherwise do. © 2016, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: The ‘grooming handclasp’ is one of the most well-established cultural traditions in chimpanzees. A recent study by Wrangham et al. [1] reduced the cultural scope of grooming-handclasp behavior by showing that grooming-handclasp style convergence is “explained by matrilineal relationship rather than conformity” [1]. Given that we previously reported cultural differences in grooming-handclasp style preferences in captive chimpanzees [2], we tested the alternative view posed by Wrangham et al. [1] in the chimpanzee populations that our original results were based on. Using the same outcome variable as Wrangham et al. [1] — the proportion of high-arm grooming featuring palm-to-palm clasping — we found that matrilineal relationships explained neither within-group homogeneity nor between-group heterogeneity, thereby corroborating our original conclusion that grooming-handclasp behavior can represent a group-level cultural tradition in chimpanzees. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Stone tool transport leaves long-lasting behavioural evidence in the landscape. However, it remains unknown how large-scale patterns of stone distribution emerge through undirected, short-term transport behaviours. One of the longest studied groups of stone-tool-using primates are the chimpanzees of the Taï National Park in Ivory Coast, West Africa. Using hammerstones left behind at chimpanzee Panda nut-cracking sites, we tested for a distance-decay effect, in which the weight of material decreases with increasing distance from raw material sources. We found that this effect exists over a range of more than 2 km, despite the fact that observed, shortterm tool transport does not appear to involve deliberate movements away from raw material sources. Tools from the millennia-old Noulo site in the Taï forest fit the same pattern. The fact that chimpanzees show both complex short-term behavioural planning, and yet produce a landscape-wide pattern over the long term, raises the question of whether similar processes operate within other stone-tool-using primates, including hominins. Where hominin landscapes have discrete material sources, a distance-decay effect, and increasing use of stone materials away from sources, the Taï chimpanzees provide a relevant analogy for understanding the formation of those landscapes. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: As habitat loss and fragmentation place growing pressure on endangered nonhuman primate populations, researchers find increasing evidence for novel responses in behavior. In western Uganda between the Budongo and Bugoma Forests, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) inhabit a mosaic landscape comprising forest fragments, human settlements, and agricultural land. We recorded nests and feeding evidence of unhabituated chimpanzees in this region over a 12-mo period. We found extensive evidence of nesting in introduced tree species, including eucalyptus (Eucalyptus grandis), guava (Psidium guajava), cocoa (Theobroma cacao), and Caribbean pine (Pinus caribaea). In addition, we found instances of ground nesting, nest reuse, and composite nests constructed from branches of multiple trees. This evidence may indicate a lack of suitable nesting trees or attempts by chimpanzees to nest in areas of riparian forest that allow them to avoid human detection. We also found new evidence for eucalyptus bark feeding by chimpanzees. Such evidence suggests chimpanzees respond flexibly to mitigate anthropogenic pressures in human-dominated landscapes. The limits of such flexibility remain unknown. Further research is needed to examine systematically the factors influencing the use of such resources and to understand better the extent to which chimpanzees can persist while relying on them. © 2016, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Primate seed dispersal plays an important role in forest regeneration. It may be particularly important to anthropogenically disturbed habitats such as forest fragments. However, few studies have examined primate seed dispersal in these types of environments. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are frugivorous and large-bodied, and are therefore able to disperse both large and small seeds, making them an important seed dispersal species. We examined chimpanzee seed dispersal in Gishwati forest, a 14 km2 montane rainforest fragment in Rwanda. We systematically collected ≤24-hr-old fecal samples and counted the number of seeds of each fruit species. We also recorded observations of seeds found in wadges. We found that chimpanzees dispersed at least 18 fruit species in 14 families in their feces. Ninety-five percent of feces had seeds, the most common of which were Ficus spp., Myrianthus holstii, and Maesa lanceolata. We estimated that the Gishwati chimpanzee community with a density of 1.7 individuals per km2 dispersed an average of 592 (>2 mm) seeds km−2 day−1. We also found that chimpanzees dispersed the seeds of at least two fruit species, Ficus spp. and Chrysophyllum gorungosanum, in their wadges. In addition, 17% of the tree species recorded in our vegetation plots were chimpanzee-dispersed. This study emphasizes the importance of chimpanzees as large seed dispersers in regenerating forest fragments. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: Chimpanzees in Gishwati disperse a significant number of large seeds. Large-bodied seed dispersers, like chimpanzees, are particularly important in regenerating forest fragments. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Primate habitats are being transformed by human activities such as agriculture. Many wild primates include cultivated foods (crops) in their diets, calling for an improved understanding of the costs and benefits of crop feeding. We measured the macronutrient and antifeedant content of 44 wild and 21 crop foods eaten by chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) in a mosaic habitat at Bulindi, Uganda, to evaluate the common assertion that crops offer high nutritional returns compared to wild forage for primates. In addition, we analyzed 13 crops not eaten at Bulindi but that are consumed by chimpanzees elsewhere to assess whether nutritional aspects explain why chimpanzees in Bulindi ignored them. Our analysis of their wild plant diet (fruit, leaves, and pith) corresponds with previous chemical analyses of primate plant foods. Compared to wild food equivalents, crops eaten by the chimpanzees contained higher levels of digestible carbohydrates (mainly sugars) coupled with lower amounts of insoluble fiber and antifeedants. Cultivated fruits were relatively nutritious throughout the ripening process. Our data support the assumption that eating cultivated foods confers energetic advantages for primates, although crops in our sample were low in protein and lipids compared to some wild foods. We found little evidence that crops ignored by the chimpanzees were less nutritious than those that they did eat. Nonnutritional factors, e.g., similarity to wild foods, probably also influence crop selection. Whether cultivated habitats can support threatened but flexible primates such as chimpanzees in the long term hinges on local people’s willingness to share their landscape and resources with them. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: Elevated Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) plasma concentrations are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease in humans, largely controlled by the LPA gene encoding apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)). Lp(a) is composed of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and apo(a) and restricted to Catarrhini. A variable number of kringle IV (KIV) domains in LPA lead to a size polymorphism of apo(a) that is inversely correlated with Lp(a) concentrations. Smaller apo(a) isoforms and higher Lp(a) levels in central chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes [PTT]) compared to humans from Europe had been reported. We studied apo(a) isoforms and Lp(a) concentrations in 75 western (Pan troglodytes verus [PTV]) and 112 central chimpanzees, and 12 bonobos (Pan paniscus [PPA]), all wild born and living in sanctuaries in Sierra Leone, Republic of the Congo, and DR Congo, respectively, and 116 humans from Gabon. Lp(a) levels were severalfold higher in western than in central chimpanzees (181.0 ± 6.7 mg/dl vs. 56.5 ± 4.3 mg/dl), whereas bonobos showed intermediate levels (134.8 ± 33.4 mg/dl). Apo(a) isoform sizes differed significantly between subspecies (means 20.9 ± 2.2, 22.9 ± 4.4, and 23.8 ± 3.8 KIV repeats in PTV, PTT, and PPA, respectively). However, far higher isoform-associated Lp(a) concentrations for all isoform sizes in western chimpanzees offered the main explanation for the higher overall Lp(a) levels in this subspecies. Human Lp(a) concentrations (mean 47.9 ± 2.8 mg/dl) were similar to those in central chimpanzees despite larger isoforms (mean 27.1 ± 4.9 KIV). Lp(a) and LDL, apoB-100, and total cholesterol levels only correlated in PTV. This remarkable differentiation between chimpanzees from different African habitats and the trait's similarity in humans and chimpanzees from Central Africa poses the question of a possible impact of an environmental factor that has shaped the genetic architecture of LPA. Overall, studies on the cholesterol-containing particles of Lp(a) and LDL in chimpanzees should consider differentiation between subspecies. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Lipids are essential components of the brain. Here, we conducted a comprehensive mass spectrometry-based analysis of lipidome composition in the prefrontal cortex of 40 humans, 40 chimpanzees, and 40 rhesus monkeys over postnatal development and adulthood. Of the 11,772 quantified lipid peaks, 7,589 change significantly along the lifespan. More than 60% of these changes occur prior to adulthood, with less than a quarter associated with myelination progression. Evolutionarily, 36% of the age-dependent lipids exhibit concentration profiles distinct to one of the three species; 488 (18%) of them were unique to humans. In both humans and chimpanzees, the greatest extent of species-specific differences occurs in early development. Human-specific lipidome differences, however, persist over most of the lifespan and reach their peak from 20 to 35 years of age, when compared with chimpanzee-specific ones. © 2017 The Author 2017.

ABSTRACT: Background: Crescentic glomeruli are the hallmark finding in rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) and are characterized by disruption and proliferation of the glomerular capsule and an influx of cells into Bowman's space. Pauci-immune-type RPGN is identified by a lack of immunoglobulins and immune complexes in the glomerular basement membrane. Methods: Complete necropsy and histology were performed on the affected chimpanzee. Electron microscopy was performed on kidney sections. A search of the literature was performed to identify spontaneous RPGN in animals. Results: We report a case of crescentic glomerulonephritis of the pauci-immune-type in a hepatitis C virus-infected 28-year-old male chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) who was humanely euthanized for a cardiac-related decline in health. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first report describing pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis in a non-human primate. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) demonstrate much cultural diversity in the wild, yet a majority of novel behaviors do not become group-wide traditions. Since many such novel behaviors are introduced by low-ranking individuals, a bias toward copying dominant individuals (“rank-bias”) has been proposed as an explanation for their limited diffusion. Previous experimental work showed that chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) preferentially copy dominant over low-rank models. We investigated whether low ranking individuals may nevertheless successfully seed a beneficial behavior as a tradition if there are no “competing” models. In each of four captive groups, either a single high-rank (HR, n = 2) or a low-rank (LR, n = 2) chimpanzee model was trained on one method of opening a two-action puzzle-box, before demonstrating the trained method in a group context. This was followed by 8 hr of group-wide, open-access to the puzzle-box. Successful manipulations and observers of each manipulation were recorded. Barnard's exact tests showed that individuals in the LR groups used the seeded method as their first-choice option at significantly above chance levels, whereas those in the HR groups did not. Furthermore, individuals in the LR condition used the seeded method on their first attempt significantly more often than those in the HR condition. A network-based diffusion analysis (NBDA) revealed that the best supported statistical models were those in which social transmission occurred only in groups with subordinate models. Finally, we report an innovation by a subordinate individual that built cumulatively on existing methods of opening the puzzle-box and was subsequently copied by a dominant observer. These findings illustrate that chimpanzees are motivated to copy rewarding novel behaviors that are demonstrated by subordinate individuals and that, in some cases, social transmission may be constrained by high-rank demonstrators. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Streptococcus troglodytae TKU31 was isolated from the oral cavity of a chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and was found to be the most closely related species of the mutans group streptococci to Streptococcus mutans. The complete sequence of TKU31 genome consists of a single circular chromosome that is 2,097,874 base pairs long and has a G + C content of 37.18%. It possesses 2082 coding sequences (CDSs), 65 tRNAs and five rRNA operons (15 rRNAs). Two clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, six insertion sequences and two predicted prophage elements were identified. The genome of TKU31 harbors some putative virulence associated genes, including gtfB, gtfC and gtfD genes encoding glucosyltransferase and gbpA, gbpB, gbpC and gbpD genes encoding glucan-binding cell wall-anchored protein. The deduced amino acid identity of the rhamnose-glucose polysaccharide F gene (rgpF), which is one of the serotype determinants, is 91% identical with that of S. mutans LJ23 (serotype k) strain. However, two other virulence-associated genes cnm and cbm, which encode the collagen-binding proteins, were not found in the TKU31 genome. The complete genome sequence of S. troglodytae TKU31 has been deposited at DDBJ/European Nucleotide Archive/GenBank under the accession no.

ABSTRACT: Compared to great apes, humans maintain a relatively rapid reproductive pace despite long periods of dependency. This seemingly contradictory set of traits is made possible by weaning offspring before nutritional independence and alloparents who help provide care. In traditional societies, this help may be provided to mothers in part by their juvenile offspring who carry, supervise, or provision younger siblings. In contrast to humans, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are nutritionally independent after weaning, yet juveniles continue to travel with their mother and younger sibling for an additional 4–5 years. This continued association could be costly to the mother if she continues to invest in weaned offspring. Alternately, while juvenile chimpanzees do not typically provision younger siblings, their presence and social interaction with infants may allow mothers to focus on other tasks. In this study, we investigate the costs and benefits to mothers of continued association with juveniles in wild chimpanzees. Using 26 years of long-term behavioral data we examined how maternal activity budgets varied based on the presence of a dependent juvenile offspring. We found that continued social interaction between mothers and juveniles does not influence the mother's time allocated to interacting with the younger infant, her feeding, resting, or travel time, or time socializing with other community members. Instead, mothers may benefit from the additional social interaction and/or relationship with their older offspring. Using 45 years of demographic data we found that those offspring who had an older sibling tended to be more likely to survive each year from birth to 8 years than those without an older sibling. Additionally, interbirth intervals were more likely to end when the female had an older offspring present. A mutually beneficial mother-juvenile dynamic in great apes provides insight into continued association between mothers and offspring after nutritional independence and the emergence of juvenile helping during hominin evolution. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Abstract: We describe the individual and combined use of vocalizations and gestures in wild chimpanzees. The rate of gesturing peaked in infancy and, with the exception of the alpha male, decreased again in older age groups, while vocal signals showed the opposite pattern. Although gesture-vocal combinations were relatively rare, they were consistently found in all age groups, especially during affiliative and agonistic interactions. Within behavioural contexts rank (excluding alpha-rank) had no effect on the rate of male chimpanzees’ use of vocal or gestural signals and only a small effect on their use of combination signals. The alpha male was an outlier, however, both as a prolific user of gestures and recipient of high levels of vocal and gesture-vocal signals. Persistence in signal use varied with signal type: chimpanzees persisted in use of gestures and gesture-vocal combinations after failure, but where their vocal signals failed they tended to add gestural signals to produce gesture-vocal combinations. Overall, chimpanzees employed signals with a sensitivity to the public/private nature of information, by adjusting their use of signal types according to social context and by taking into account potential out-of-sight audiences. We discuss these findings in relation to the various socio-ecological challenges that chimpanzees are exposed to in their natural forest habitats and the current discussion of multimodal communication in great apes. Significance statement: All animal communication combines different types of signals, including vocalizations, facial expressions, and gestures. However, the study of primate communication has typically focused on the use of signal types in isolation. As a result, we know little on how primates use the full repertoire of signals available to them. Here we present a systematic study on the individual and combined use of gestures and vocalizations in wild chimpanzees. We find that gesturing peaks in infancy and decreases in older age, while vocal signals show the opposite distribution, and patterns of persistence after failure suggest that gestural and vocal signals may encode different types of information. Overall, chimpanzees employed signals with a sensitivity to the public/private nature of information, by adjusting their use of signal types according to social context and by taking into account potential out-of-sight audiences. © 2017, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Over a 6 month period during the dry season, from the end of October 2014 to the beginning of May 2015, we studied tool use behavior of previously unstudied and non-habituated savanna chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) living in the Comoé National Park, Ivory Coast (CI). We analyzed all the stick tools and leaf-sponges found that the chimpanzees used to forage for ants, termites, honey, and water. We found a particular behavior to be widespread across different chimpanzee communities in the park, namely, dipping for water from tree holes using sticks with especially long brush-tip modifications, using camera traps, we recorded adults, juveniles, and infants of three communities displaying this behavior. We compared water dipping and honey dipping tools used by Comoé chimpanzees and found significant differences in the total length, diameter, and brush length of the different types of fluid-dipping tools used. We found that water dipping tools had consistently longer and thicker brush-tips than honey dipping tools. Although this behavior was observed only during the late dry season, the chimpanzees always had alternative water sources available, like pools and rivers, in which they drank without the use of a tool. It remains unclear whether the use of a tool increases efficient access to water. This is the first time that water dipping behavior with sticks has been found as a widespread and well-established behavior across different age and sex classes and communities, suggesting the possibility of cultural transmission. It is crucial that we conserve this population of chimpanzees, not only because they may represent the second largest population in the country, but also because of their unique behavioral repertoire. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Proximate factors of primate food sharing, in contrast to its evolutionary explanations, have received little attention. Active food sharing is considered prosocial, since possessors may benefit others by spontaneously passing food or by reacting to ‘signals of need’. However, in contrast to passive sharing, active food sharing is rare in most nonhuman primates. Surprisingly, previous research showed that captive Sumatran orang-utans actively share food more frequently than chimpanzees and bonobos, and hence, appear more prosocial. Yet these comparisons with the two Pan species were relying on previously published studies, which differed with regard to methods and food types used. Here we used the identical procedure and food type to compare the food-sharing behaviour of 10 captive Sumatran orang-utans and 18 chimpanzees, in situations where individuals could monopolize a sharable food source. We focused on communicative behaviours used to initiate food transfers, and assessed whether and how much food was transferred in response to these initiation attempts. In both species, most transfers were initiated by taking the food, resulting in passive sharing, while active sharing by offering food or after requesting it occurred only rarely. However, orang-utans differed from chimpanzees in several aspects. Because the food was mostly monopolized by the adult male, orang-utans attempted to initiate food transfers more frequently, resisted more to taking attempts, and were less likely to transfer whole food items. In both species, requests were less likely to result in food transfers, indicating that in situations involving access to food, they do not necessarily respond to ‘signals of need’. We argue that in addition to instances of active sharing, other factors such as the degree of food monopolization, response rates to ‘signals of need’, and the quality and quantity of transferred food need to be considered to gain a more detailed picture of prosociality across species. © 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ABSTRACT: Cold chain-free vaccine technologies are needed to ensure effective vaccine delivery and coverage, particularly in resource-poor countries. However, the immunogenicity and thermostability of spray dried live viral vector-based vaccines such as recombinant adenoviral-vectored vaccines remain to be investigated. To address this issue, we have spray dried human adenoviral (AdHu5)- and chimpanzee adenoviral (AdCh68)-vectored tuberculosis vaccines in a mannitol and dextran matrix. Spray dried powders containing these two vaccines display the morphologic and chemical properties desired for long-term thermostability and vaccination. Upon reconstitution, they effectively transfected the cells in vitro with relatively small losses in viral infectivity related to the spray drying process. Following in vivo vaccination, AdHu5- and AdCh68-vectored vaccines were as immunogenic as the conventional fresh, cryopreserved liquid vaccine samples. Of importance, even after cold chain-free storage, at ambient temperatures and relatively low humidity for 30 and 90 days, the vaccines retained their in vivo immunogenicity, while the liquid vaccine samples stored under the same conditions lost their immune-activating capability almost entirely. Our results support further development of our spray drying technologies for generating thermally stable adenoviral-vectored and other viral-vectored vaccines. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Infrared thermal imaging has emerged as a valuable tool in veterinary medicine, in particular for evaluating reproductive processes. Here, we explored differences in skin temperature of twenty female chimpanzees in Budongo Forest, Uganda, four of which were pregnant during data collection. Based on previous literature in other mammals, we predicted increased skin temperature of maximally swollen reproductive organs of non-pregnant females when approaching peak fertility. For pregnant females, we made the same prediction because it has been argued that female chimpanzees have evolved mechanisms to conceal pregnancy, including swellings of the reproductive organs, conspicuous copulation calling, and solicitation of male mating behaviour, to decrease the infanticidal tendencies of resident males by confusing paternity. For nonpregnant females, we found slight temperature increases towards the end of the swelling cycles but no significant change between the fertile and non-fertile phases. Despite their different reproductive state, pregnant females had very similar skin temperature patterns compared to non-pregnant females, suggesting little potential for males to use skin temperature to recognise pregnancies, especially during maximal swelling, when ovulation is most likely to occur in non-pregnant females. We discuss this pattern in light of the concealment hypothesis, i.e., that female chimpanzees have evolved physiological means to conceal their reproductive state during pregnancy. © 2017 Dezecache et al.

ABSTRACT: Many primate populations occur outside protected areas in fragmented anthropogenic landscapes. Empirical data on the ecological characteristics that define an anthropogenic landscape are urgently required if conservation initiatives in such environments are to succeed. The main objective of our study was to determine the composition and availability of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) food resources across fine spatial scales in the anthropogenic landscape of Bossou, Guinea, West Africa. We examined food resources in all habitat types available in the chimpanzees’ core area. We surveyed resource composition, structure and heterogeneity (20 m × 20 m quadrats, N = 54) and assessed temporal availability of food from phenology trails (total distance 5951 m; 1073 individual trees) over 1 year (2012–2013). Over half of Bossou consists of regenerating forest and is highly diverse in terms of chimpanzee food species; large fruit bearing trees are rare and confined to primary and riverine forest. Moraceae (mulberries and figs) was the dominant family, trees of which produce drupaceous fruits favored by chimpanzees. The oil palm occurs at high densities throughout and is the only species found in all habitat types except primary forest. Our data suggest that the high densities of oil palm and fig trees, along with abundant terrestrial herbaceous vegetation and cultivars, are able to provide the chimpanzees with widely available resources, compensating for the scarcity of large fruit trees. A significant difference was found between habitat types in stem density/ha and basal area m2/ha of chimpanzee food species. Secondary, young secondary, and primary forest emerged as the most important habitat types for availability of food tree species. Our study emphasizes the importance of examining ecological characteristics of an anthropogenic landscape as each available habitat type is unlikely to be equally important in terms of spatial and temporal availability of resources.

ABSTRACT: Empirical validations of survey methods for estimating animal densities are rare, despite the fact that only an application to a population of known density can demonstrate their reliability under field conditions and constraints. Here, we present a field validation of camera trapping in combination with spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) methods for enumerating chimpanzee populations. We used 83 camera traps to sample a habituated community of western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) of known community and territory size in Taï National Park, Ivory Coast, and estimated community size and density using spatially explicit capture-recapture models. We aimed to: (1) validate camera trapping as a means to collect capture-recapture data for chimpanzees; (2) validate SECR methods to estimate chimpanzee density from camera trap data; (3) compare the efficacy of targeting locations frequently visited by chimpanzees versus deploying cameras according to a systematic design; (4) evaluate the performance of SECR estimators with reduced sampling effort; and (5) identify sources of heterogeneity in detection probabilities. Ten months of camera trapping provided abundant capture-recapture data. All weaned individuals were detected, most of them multiple times, at both an array of targeted locations, and a systematic grid of cameras positioned randomly within the study area, though detection probabilities were higher at targeted locations. SECR abundance estimates were accurate and precise, and analyses of subsets of the data indicated that the majority of individuals in a community could be detected with as few as five traps deployed within their territory. Our results highlight the potential of camera trapping for cost-effective monitoring of chimpanzee populations. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Sexual selection theory predicts that because male reproductive success in mammals is limited by access to females, males will attempt to defend access to mates and exclude rivals from mating. In mammals, dominance rank is correlated with male reproductive success; however, the highestranking (alpha) male rarely monopolizes reproduction completely. To explain why, incomplete control models propose that alpha males simply cannot control other males’ access to mates. If true, then dominance rank should be a key factor influencing subordinate (non-alpha) male mating success. Alternatively, the concession model states that alpha males can prevent other males from gaining access to mates but posits that they concede matings to subordinates in exchange for social favours. This predicts that a male’s grooming interactions with the alpha should mediate his access to females. We test these predictions using 36 years of data, encompassing the tenures of eight alpha male chimpanzees at Gombe National Park, Tanzania. Incomplete control models were most strongly supported. At a given copulation event, the probability that the alpha was the male that mated was negatively associated with the number of males and sexually receptive females in the party. Additionally, as the number of males increased, high dominance rank was associated with an increased likelihood that a particular non-alpha male mated. The concession model, however, was also supported. The amount of time a male spent grooming with the alpha was positively associated with his likelihood of mating when the alphawas present in the party. As grooming is a major affiliative component of male social relationships, our results suggest that social bonds with dominant individuals are leveraged for mating access, particularly in species in which males form coalitions. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Tactical deception has been widely reported in primates on a functional basis, but details of behavioral mechanisms are usually unspecified. We tested a pair of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in the informed forager paradigm, in which the subordinate saw the location of hidden food and the dominant did not. We employed cross-correlations to examine temporal contingencies between chimpanzees’ behavior: specifically how the direction of the subordinate's gaze and movement functioned to manipulate the dominant's searching behavior through two tactics, withholding, and misleading information. In Experiment 1, not only did the informed subordinate tend to stop walking toward a single high value food, but she also refrained from gazing toward it, thus, withholding potentially revealing cues from her searching competitor. In a second experiment, in which a moderate value food was hidden in addition to the high value food, whenever the subordinate alternated her gaze between the dominant and the moderate value food, she often paused walking for 5 s; this frequently recruited the dominant to the inferior food, functioning as a “decoy.” The subordinate flexibly concealed and revealed gaze toward a goal, which suggests that not only can chimpanzees use visual cues to make predictions about behavior, but also that chimpanzees may understand that other individuals can exploit their gaze direction. These results substantiate descriptive reports of how chimpanzees use gaze to manipulate others, and to our knowledge are the first quantitative data to identify behavioral mechanisms of tactical deception. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: Cross correlations show a subordinate chimpanzee tactically deceived a dominant by not gazing toward a valuable food (withholding), and recruiting to a “decoy” food (misleading). Chimpanzees understand that others can exploit their gaze direction. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Wild chimpanzees regularly use tools, made from sticks, leaves, or stone, to find flexible solutions to the ecological challenges of their environment. Nevertheless, some studies suggest strong limitations in the tool-using capabilities of chimpanzees. In this context, we present the discovery of a newly observed tool-use behavior in a population of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) living in the Bakoun Classified Forest, Guinea, where a temporary research site was established for 15 months. Bakoun chimpanzees of every age-sex class were observed to fish for freshwater green algae, Spirogrya sp., from rivers, streams, and ponds using long sticks and twigs, ranging from 9 cm up to 4.31 m in length. Using remote camera trap footage from 11 different algae fishing sites within an 85-km2 study area, we found that algae fishing occurred frequently during the dry season and was non-existent during the rainy season. Chimpanzees were observed algae fishing for as little as 1 min to just over an hour, with an average duration of 9.09 min. We estimate that 364 g of Spirogyra algae could be retrieved in this time, based on human trials in the field. Only one other chimpanzee population living in Bossou, Guinea, has been described to customarily scoop algae from the surface of the water using primarily herbaceous tools. Here, we describe the new behavior found at Bakoun and compare it to the algae scooping observed in Bossou chimpanzees and the occasional variant reported in Odzala, Republic of the Congo. As these algae are reported to be high in protein, carbohydrates, and minerals, we hypothesize that chimpanzees are obtaining a nutritional benefit from this seasonally available resource. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Facilities housing captive animals are full of staff who, every day, interact with the animals under their care. The expertise and familiarity of staff can be used to monitor animal welfare by means of questionnaires. It was the goal of our study to examine the association between chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) welfare, happiness, and personality. To these ends we collected two waves of welfare and subjective well-being ratings of 18 chimpanzees housed at the Edinburgh Zoo and one set of ratings of 13 chimpanzees housed at Fundació Mona. Ratings were made on a welfare questionnaire that included 12 items related to stress, psychological stimulation, and behavioural indicators of negative and positive welfare states, and a 4-item subjective well-being questionnaire. In addition, ratings were made on the 54-item Hominoid Personality Questionnaire and an abbreviated version of this scale consisting of 37 antonym pairs. We used generalizability theory to test whether welfare ratings generalized across items, raters, chimpanzees, and time. We then assessed the validity of the welfare and subjective well-being questionnaires by examining their associations with behaviour. Finally, we tested whether the welfare and subjective well-being ratings were associated with personality. Welfare ratings generalized across items, raters, chimpanzees, and time. Principal components analysis and regularized exploratory factor analysis indicated that ten welfare items and all four subjective well-being items formed a single dimension (welfareSWB). LASSO regression found that lower welfareSWB was associated with regurgitation, coprophagy, urophagy, and decreased proximity to nearest neighbour. A linear model that adjusted for age, sex, and facility, indicated that higher Extraversion and lower Neuroticism were related to higher welfareSWB. Welfare ratings were reliable and associated with subjective well-being and personality, demonstrating that staff ratings are a valid and potentially valuable tool for chimpanzee welfare assessment. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The ancestral progenitor of common chimpanzees and bonobos experienced a selective sweep that ravaged its major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I repertoire. The causative agent was probably an ancestral retrovirus, highly related to the contemporary HIV-1 strain, which initiated the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome pandemic in the human population. As a direct result, MHC class I allotypes with the capability of targeting conserved retroviral elements were enriched in the ancestral progenitor. Even today, the impact can be traced back by studying the functional capacities of the contemporary MHC class I allotypes of common chimpanzees. Viruses, however, have developed several strategies to manipulate the cell-surface expression of MHC class I genes. Monitoring the presence and absence of the MHC class I allotypes on the cell surface is conducted, for instance, by the hosts’ gene products of the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) complex. Hence, one may wonder whether—in the future—any clues with regard to the signature of the MHC class I selective sweep might be unearthed for the KIR genes as well. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Non-human primates face major environmental changes due to increased human impacts all over the world. Although some species are able to survive in certain landscapes with anthropogenic impact, their long-term viability and fitness may be decreased due to chronic stress. Here we assessed long-term stress levels through cortisol analysis in chimpanzee hair obtained from sleeping nests in northwestern Uganda, in order to estimate welfare in the context of ecotourism, forest fragmentation with human-wildlife conflicts, and illegal logging with hunting activity (albeit not of primates), compared with a control without human contact or conflict. Concerning methodological issues, season [F(2,129) = 37.4, p < 0.0001, r2= 0.18] and the age of nests [F(2,178) = 20.3, p < 0.0001, r2= 0.11] significantly predicted hair cortisol concentrations (HCC). With regard to effects of anthropogenic impacts, our results neither showed elevation of HCC due to ecotourism, nor due to illegal logging compared to their control groups.We did, however, find significantly increased HCC in the fragment group compared to chimpanzees living in a nearby intact forest [F(1,88) = 5.0, p = 0.03, r2= 0.20]. In conclusion, our results suggest that hair cortisol analysis is a powerful tool that can help understanding the impact of anthropogenic disturbances on chimpanzee well-being and could be applied to other great ape species. © 2016 Carlitz et al.

ABSTRACT: Mycoplasma genitalium, a human pathogen associated with sexually transmitted diseases, is capable of causing chronic infections, though mechanisms for persistence remain unclear. Previous studies have found that variation of the MgPa operon occurs by recombination of repetitive chromosomal sequences (known as MgPars) into the MG191 and MG192 genes carried on this operon, which may lead to antigenic variation and immune evasion. In this study, we determined the kinetics of MG192 sequence variation during the course of experimental infection using archived specimens from two chimpanzees infected with M. genitalium strain G37. The highly variable region of MG192 was amplified by PCR from M. genitalium isolates obtained at various time points postinfection (p.i.). Sequence analysis revealed that MG192 sequence variation began at 5 weeks p.i. With the progression of infection, sequence changes accumulated throughout the MG192 variable region. The presence of MG192 variants at specific time points was confirmed by variant-specific PCR assays and sequence analysis of single-colony cloned M. genitalium organisms. MG192 nucleotide sequence variation correlated with estimated recombination events, predicted amino acid changes, and time of seroconversion, a finding consistent with immune selection of MG192 variants. In addition, we provided evidence that MG192 sequence variation occurred during the process of M. genitalium single-colony cloning. Such spontaneous variation suggests that some MG192 variation is independent of immune selection but may form the basis for subsequent immune selection. © 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

ABSTRACT: The Japanese approach to science has permitted theoretical leaps in our understanding of culture in non-human animals and challenged human uniqueness, as it is not embedded in the Western traditional dualisms of human/animal and nature/culture. This paper highlights the value of an interdisciplinary approach and combining methodological approaches in exploring putative cultural variation among chimpanzees. I focus particularly on driver ants (Dorylus sp.) and oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) consumption among the Bossou and Nimba chimpanzees, in south-eastern Guinea at the border with Côte d’Ivoire and Liberia, and hand use across different tool use tasks commonly witnessed at Bossou, i.e. ant-dipping, nut-cracking, pestle-pounding, and algae-scooping. Observed variation in resource use was addressed across differing scales exploring both within- and between-community differences. Our findings have highlighted a tight interplay between ecology, social dynamics and culture, and between social and individual learning and maternal contribution to tool-use acquisition. Exploration of hand use by chimpanzees revealed no evidence for individual-level hand or community-level task specialisation. However, more complex types of tool use such as nut-cracking showed distinct lateralization, while the equivalent of a haptic manual action revealed a strong right hand bias. The data also suggest an overall population tendency for a right hand preference. As well as describing these sites’ key contributions to our understanding of chimpanzees and to challenging our perceptions of human uniqueness, this paper also highlights the critical condition and high levels of threats facing this emblematic chimpanzee population, and several questions that remain to be addressed. In the spirit of the Japanese approach to science, I recommend that an interdisciplinary and collaborative research approach can best help us to challenge perceptions of human uniqueness and to further our understanding of chimpanzee behavioural and social flexibility in the face of local social, ecological and anthropogenic changes and threats to their survival. © 2016, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: Social laterality is the core of two major theories: one concerns the evolution of laterality at the population level and the other the evolution of human language. However, few studies have investigated gestural laterality in communication between conspecifics. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to investigate the production of intraspecific gestures taking into account the influence of multiple factors on gestural laterality: first, gestural characteristics (sensory modality, use of a communication tool, sharing degree in the population and duration); second, the interactional context (visual field and body sides of signaller and recipient, and emotional context); and third, individual sociodemographic characteristics of signaller and recipient (age, sex, group, hierarchy, affiliation and kinship). We questioned, first, whether gestural laterality differed with gesture at the population level and second, whether some factors influenced gestural laterality. To do so, we evaluated social laterality in dyadic interactions in 39 chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, living in three groups in captivity. We found that, at the population level, 13 of the 21 gestures we observed were performed predominantly with the right hand. Gestural laterality of signallers was influenced mainly by interactional context, gesture characteristics (except gesture duration) and signallers' hierarchical rank and age. Signallers used their hand ipsilateral to recipients for tactile and visual gestures and their contralateral hand for gestures involving auditory communication and a communication tool. Moreover, signallers' use of their right hand was more important for subordinates. This was also true in negative contexts for gestures common to most of the subjects. Our results further support the hypothesis that laterality in gestural communication might represent a precursor of the left-hemispheric lateralization of language. We discuss our results in relation to theories concerning the origins of cerebral hemispheric lateralization and their consistency with previous studies. © 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: We report the physical and behavioral development of one severely disabled female infant chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) of the well-habituated M group in the Mahale Mountains National Park. We documented interactions between the infant and its mother and with other group members. Congenital disabilities occur in many primate species, including chimpanzees. However, there have been only a few case studies of congenitally disabled chimpanzee infants and no reports examining how a chimpanzee mother copes with such a disabled infant in the wild. The observed infant exhibited symptoms resembling Down syndrome, similar to those reported previously for a captive chimpanzee. The mother did not allow nonrelatives to take care of the infant even though she had been previously relatively tolerant of allomothering by nonrelatives. The mother’s compensatory care for her infant’s disabilities and allomothering of the infant by its sister might have helped it to survive for 23 months in the wild. Other group members did not show any aversive or fearful reactions to the disabled infant. © 2015, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) naturally infects two subspecies of chimpanzee: Pan troglodytes troglodytes from Central Africa (SIVcpzPtt) and P. t. schweinfurtii from East Africa (SIVcpzPts), but is absent in P. t. verus from West Africa and appears to be absent in P. t. ellioti inhabiting Nigeria and western Cameroon. One explanation for this pattern is that P. t. troglodytes and P. t schweinfurthii may have acquired SIVcpz after their divergence from P. t. verus and P. t. ellioti. However, all of the subspecies, except P. t. verus, still occasionally exchange migrants making the absence of SIVcpz in P. t. ellioti puzzling. Sampling of P. t. ellioti has been minimal to date, particularly along the banks of the Sanaga River, where its range abuts that of P. t. troglodytes. This study had three objectives. First, we extended the sampling of SIVcpz across the range of chimpanzees north of the Sanaga River to address whether under-sampling might account for the absence of evidence for SIVcpz infection in P. t. ellioti. Second, we investigated how environmental variation is associated with the spread and prevalence of SIVcpz in the two chimpanzee subspecies inhabiting Cameroon since environmental variation has been shown to contribute to their divergence from one another. Finally, we compared the prevalence and distribution of SIVcpz with that of Simian Foamy Virus (SFV) to examine the role of ecology and behavior in shaping the distribution of diseases in wild host populations. The dataset includes previously published results on SIVcpz infection and SFVcpz as well as newly collected data, and represents over 1000 chimpanzee fecal samples from 41 locations across Cameroon. Results revealed that none of the 181 P. t. ellioti fecal samples collected across the range of P. t. ellioti tested positive for SIVcpz. In addition, species distribution models suggest that environmental variation contributes to differences in the distribution and prevalence of SIVcpz and SFVcpz. The ecological niches of these two viruses are largely non-overlapping, although stronger statistical support for this conclusion will require more sampling. Overall this study demonstrates that SIVcpz infection is absent or very rare in P. t. ellioti, despite multiple opportunities for transmission. The reasons for its absence remain unclear, but might be explained by one or more factors, including environmental variation, viral competition, and/or local adaptation - all of which should be explored in greater detail through continued surveillance of this region. © 2016 Locatelli et al.

ABSTRACT: Objectives: Over 2 million individuals are infected with HIV type 1 (HIV-1) each year, yet an effective vaccine remains elusive. The most successful HIV-1 vaccine to date demonstrated 31% efficacy. Immune correlate analyses associated HIV-1 envelope (Env)-specific antibodies with protection, thus providing a path toward a more effective vaccine. We sought to test the antibody response from novel prime-boost vaccination with a chimpanzee-derived adenovirus (AdC) vector expressing a subtype C Env glycoprotein (gp)140 combined with either a serologically distinct AdC vector expressing gp140 of a different subtype C isolate or an alum-adjuvanted, partially trimeric gp145 from yet another subtype C isolate. Design: Three different prime-boost regimens were tested in mice: AdC prime-protein boost, protein prime-AdC boost, and AdC prime-AdC boost. Each regimen was tested at two different doses of AdC vector in a total of six experimental groups. Methods: Sera were collected at various time points and evaluated by ELISA for Envspecific antibody binding, isotype, and avidity. Antibody functionality was assessed by pseudovirus neutralization assay. Results: Priming with AdC followed by a protein boost or sequential immunizations with two AdC vectors induced HIV-1 Env-specific binding antibodies, including those to the variable region 2, whereas priming with protein followed by an AdC boost was relatively ineffective. Antibodies that cross-neutralized tier 1 HIV-1 from different subtypes were elicited with vaccine regimens that included immunizations with protein. Conclusion: Our study warrants further investigation of AdC vector and gp145 protein prime-boost vaccines and their ability to protect against acquisition in animal challenge studies. © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Long-distance calling is a common behaviour in animals, which has various important social functions. At a physiological level, calling is often mediated by gonadal hormones such as testosterone (T), particularly when its function is linked to intra-sexual competition for mates or territory. T also plays an important role in the development of vocal characteristics associated with dominance in humans. However, the few available studies of T and vocal behaviour in non-human primates suggest that in primates, T has less influence on call production than in other animals. We tested this hypothesis by studying the relationship between T concentrations and pant-hooting in wild male chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) of the Kanyawara community in the Kibale National Park, Uganda. We found three kinds of correlation. Hourly T averages were positively associated with hourly rates of pant-hooting. Monthly T levels were likewise correlated with monthly rates of pant-hooting after controlling for other influences such as fission-fusion rates. Finally, males with high T levels had higher peak frequency at the start of the call climax. These results suggest that T affects the production of pant-hoots in chimpanzees. This implies that the pant-hoot call plays a role in male-male competition. We propose that even in cognitively sophisticated species, endocrine mechanisms can contribute to regulating vocal production. Significance statement: Many animals produce long-distance calls. The production of these calls is often modulated by gonadal hormones such as testosterone, especially if the calls are involved in competition between males for mates or territory. However, comparatively little is known about the influence of testosterone over the vocal behaviour of non-human primates, especially among great apes. In this study, we examined the relationship between testosterone and pant-hooting in wild male chimpanzees. We found that testosterone levels were associated with pant-hoot rates and one acoustic feature of the call. More specifically, males pant-hooted more often and produced pant-hoots with higher peak frequencies during periods of elevated testosterone levels. These results imply that gonadal hormones are involved in regulating vocal behaviour in chimpanzees and support the view that pant-hoots play a role in male-male competition. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Handheld, point-of-care glucometers are commonly used in NHP for clinical and research purposes, but whether these devices are appropriate for use in NHP is unknown. Other animal studies indicate that glucometers should be species-specific, given differences in glucose distribution between RBC and plasma; in addition, Hct and sampling site (venous compared with capillary) influence glucometer readings. Therefore, we compared the accuracy of 2 human and 2 veterinary glucometers at various Hct ranges in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys), and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) with that of standard laboratory glucose analysis. Subsequent analyses assessed the effect of hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, and sampling site on glucometer accuracy. The veterinary glucometers overestimated blood glucose (BG) values in all species by 26 to 75 mg/dL. The mean difference between the human glucometers and the laboratory analyzer was 7 mg/dL or less in all species. The human glucometers overestimated BG in hypoglycemic mangabeys by 4 mg/dL and underestimated BG in hyperglycemic mangabeys by 11 mg/dL; similar patterns occurred in rhesus macaques. Hct did not affect glucometer accuracy, but all samples were within the range at which glucometers generally are accurate in humans. BG values were significantly lower in venous than capillary samples. The current findings show that veterinary glucometers intended for companion-animal species are inappropriate for use in the studied NHP species, whereas the human glucometers showed clinically acceptable accuracy in all 3 species. Finally, potential differences between venous and capillary BG values should be considered when comparing and evaluating results. © Copyright 2016 by the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees are especially suited to teach us about ourselves, both in terms of their similarities and differences with human, and such important similarities and differences have also been noted for the incidence and severity of several major human diseases. In the present work, we report the entire mitochondrial genome of the Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes ellioti) for the first time. Results shows that this mitogenome is 16,559 bp long and consists of 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes, and 1 putative non-coding region (D-loop region). The genomic organization and gene order are the same as other Chimpanzees. The whole nucleotide base composition is 31.1% of A, 30.7% of C, 12.9% G, and 25.3% T, with a slight A+T bias of 56.4%. Most of the genes are encoded on H-strand, except for the ND6 subunit gene and 8 tRNA genes.

ABSTRACT: Background: The rise of the primate lineage is accompanied by an outstanding emergence of microRNAs, small non-coding RNAs with a prominent role in gene regulation. In spite of their biological importance little is known about the way in which natural selection has influenced microRNAs in the human lineage. To study the recent evolutionary history of human microRNAs and to analyze the signatures of natural selection in genomic regions harbouring microRNAs we have investigated the nucleotide substitution rates of 1,872 human microRNAs in the human and chimpanzee lineages. Results: We produced a depurated set of microRNA alignments of human, chimpanzee and orang-utan orthologs combining BLAT and liftOver and selected 1,214 microRNA precursors presenting optimal secondary structures. We classified microRNAs in categories depending on their genomic organization, duplication status and conservation along evolution. We compared substitution rates of the aligned microRNAs between human and chimpanzee using Tajima's Relative Rate Test taking orang-utan as out-group and found several microRNAs with particularly high substitution rates in either the human or chimpanzee branches. We fitted different models of natural selection on these orthologous microRNA alignments and compared them using a likelihood ratio test that uses ancestral repeats and microRNA flanking regions as neutral sequences. We found that although a large fraction of human microRNAs is highly conserved among the three species studied, significant differences in rates of molecular evolution exist among microRNA categories. Particularly, primate-specific microRNAs, which are enriched in isolated and single copy microRNAs, more than doubled substitution rates of those belonging to older, non primate-specific microRNA families. Conclusions: Our results corroborate the remarkable conservation of microRNAs, a proxy of their functional relevance, and indicate that a subset of human microRNAs undergo nucleotide substitutions at higher rates, which may be suggestive of the action of positive selection. © 2016 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Self-control is defined as the ability or capacity to obtain an objectively more valuable outcome rather than an objectively less valuable outcome though tolerating a longer delay or a greater effort requirement (or both) in obtaining that more valuable outcome. A number of tests have been devised to assess self-control in non-human animals, including exchange tasks. In this study, three chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) participated in a delay of gratification task that required food exchange as the behavioral response that reflected self-control. The chimpanzees were offered opportunities to inhibit eating and instead exchange a currently possessed food item for a different (and sometimes better) item, often needing to exchange several food items before obtaining the highest valued reward. We manipulated reward type, reward size, reward visibility, delay to exchange, and location of the highest valued reward in the sequence of exchange events to compare performance within the same individuals. The chimpanzees successfully traded until obtaining the best item in most cases, although there were individual differences among participants in some variations of the test. These results support the idea that self-control is robust in chimpanzees even in contexts in which they perhaps anticipate future rewards and sustain delay of gratification until they can obtain the ultimately most valuable item. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: The distribution and abundance of food resources are among the most important factors that influence animal behavioral strategies. Yet, spatial variation in feeding habitat quality is often difficult to assess with traditional methods that rely on extrapolation from plot survey data or remote sensing. Here, we show that maximum entropy species distribution modeling can be used to successfully predict small-scale variation in the distribution of 24 important plant food species for chimpanzees at Gombe National Park, Tanzania. We combined model predictions with behavioral observations to quantify feeding habitat quality as the cumulative dietary proportion of the species predicted to occur in a given location. This measure exhibited considerable spatial heterogeneity with elevation and latitude, both within and across main habitat types. We used model results to assess individual variation in habitat selection among adult chimpanzees during a 10-year period, testing predictions about trade-offs between foraging and reproductive effort. We found that nonswollen females selected the highest-quality habitats compared with swollen females or males, in line with predictions based on their energetic needs. Swollen females appeared to compromise feeding in favor of mating opportunities, suggesting that females rather than males change their ranging patterns in search of mates. Males generally occupied feeding habitats of lower quality, which may exacerbate energetic challenges of aggression and territory defense. Finally, we documented an increase in feeding habitat quality with community residence time in both sexes during the dry season, suggesting an influence of familiarity on foraging decisions in a highly heterogeneous landscape. © 2016 The Author.

ABSTRACT: There is a growing interest in the study of personality in chimpanzees with repeated findings of a similar structure of personality in apes to that found in humans. To date, however, the direct translational value of instruments used to assess chimpanzee personality to humans has yet to be explicitly tested. As such, in the current study we sought to determine the transportability of factor analytically-derived chimpanzee personality scales to humans in a large human sample (N=301). Human informants reporting on target individuals they knew well completed chimpanzee-derived and human-derived measures of personality from the two most widely studied models of human personality: Big Five and Big Three. The correspondence between informant-reported chimpanzee- and human-derived personality scales was then investigated. Results indicated high convergence for corresponding scales across most chimpanzee- and human-derived personality scales. Findings from the current study provide evidence that chimpanzee-derived scales translate well to humans and operate quite similarly to the established human-derived personality scales in a human sample. This evidence of transportability lends support to the translational nature of chimpanzee personality research suggesting clear relevance of this growing literature to humans. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: In this study, we evaluated the potential for a behavioral research study, designed to evaluate chimpanzee decision-making behavior, to also encourage increased activity in a group of zoo-housed chimpanzees. For the behavioral study, the chimpanzees had to carry tokens to different locations such that they always had to travel farther to obtain a more-preferred reward. We recorded the distance travelled by each subject in each of the three phases of the 15-month study. By the final phase, the chimpanzees' rate of travel during test sessions was significantly higher compared to their baseline activity. Importantly, the chimpanzees' increase in locomotion was not dependent on their participation in the study; rate of travel was not correlated with number of tokens exchanged. However, the chimpanzees' activity returned to baseline within 2 hr of the 30-min test sessions. This study emphasizes the role that research can have in providing enrichment, the importance for long-term enrichment plans, and the essential need to evaluate the impact of research on animal participants, just as we evaluate the efficacy of enrichment strategies.

ABSTRACT: Ecological variation influences the appearance and maintenance of tool use in animals, either due to necessity or opportunity, but little is known about the relative importance of these two factors. Here, we combined long-term behavioural data on feeding and travelling with six years of field experiments in a wild chimpanzee community. In the experiments, subjects engaged with natural logs, which contained energetically valuable honey that was only accessible through tool use. Engagement with the experiment was highest after periods of low fruit availability involving more travel between food patches, while instances of actual tool-using were significantly influenced by prior travel effort only. Additionally, combining data from the main chimpanzee study communities across Africa supported this result, insofar as groups with larger travel efforts had larger tool repertoires. Travel thus appears to foster tool use in wild chimpanzees and may also have been a driving force in early hominin technological evolution. © Gruber et al.

ABSTRACT: Taraba State, Nigeria, is an important conservation site for the Endangered Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee Pan troglodytes ellioti. Gashaka Gumti National Park, Nigeria's largest national park and home to potentially the largest contiguous population of the Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee, spans a significant portion of the eastern sector of Taraba and the adjoining Adamawa State. South of the Park, Ngel Nyaki Forest Reserve comprises two forest fragments and holds a small population of chimpanzees. We investigated the existence of patterns in population structure and dispersal within this region, using microsatellite loci extracted from non-invasive sources of DNA. Our results indicate that dispersal and thus gene flow between the groups of chimpanzees at the Park and Reserve is limited, at least more so than it is within the Park, and we identified a biased sex ratio at the Reserve, forewarning of potential conservation concerns in relation to demographic and genetic stochasticity. We discuss conservation actions that may be applicable to sustaining the population within Ngel Nyaki Forest Reserve. Copyright © Fauna & Flora International 2015.

ABSTRACT: The reverse-reward contingency task presents 2 food sets to an animal, and they are required to choose the smaller of the 2 sets in order to receive the larger food set. Intriguingly, the majority of species tested on the reverse-reward task fail to learn this contingency in the absence of large trial counts, correction trials, and punishment techniques. The unique difficulty of this seemingly simple task likely reflects a failure of inhibitory control which is required to point toward a smaller and less desirable reward rather than a larger and more desirable reward. This failure by chimpanzees and other primates to pass the reverse-reward task is striking given the self-control they exhibit in a variety of other paradigms. For example, chimpanzees have consistently demonstrated a high capacity for delay of gratification in order to maximize accumulating food rewards in which foods are added item-by-item to a growing set until the subject consumes the rewards. To study the mechanisms underlying success in the accumulation task and failure in the reverse-reward task, we presented chimpanzees with several combinations of these 2 tasks to determine when chimpanzees might succeed in pointing to smaller food sets over larger food sets and how the nature of the task might determine the animals' success or failure. Across experiments, 3 chimpanzees repeatedly failed to solve the reverse-reward task, whereas they accumulated nearly all food items across all instances of the accumulation self-control task, even when they had to point to small amounts of food to accumulate larger amounts. These data indicate that constraints of these 2 related but still different tasks of behavioral inhibition are dependent upon the animals' perceptions of the choice set, their sense of control over the contents of choice sets, and the nature of the task constraints. © 2016 American Psychological Association.

ABSTRACT: This report describes 2 cases of spontaneous malignant neoplasia within the sex skin of aged female chimpanzees. In both cases, the initial presentation resembled nonhealing traumatic wounds to the sex skin, with different degrees of infection, ulceration, and tissue necrosis. Histopathology of the lesions confirmed the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma in one case and of adenocarcinoma with metastasis in the other. Advanced age and previous trauma likely contributed to the development of the neoplasias in both cases; long-term sun exposure may also have contributed to the development of the squamous cell carcinoma. To our knowledge, these 2 cases represent the first reports of sex skin neoplasia in chimpanzees. Copyright 2016 by the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science.

ABSTRACT: As our closest living relatives, comparisons of the social lives and behavioural ecologies of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (Pan paniscus) provide relevant insights into the evolutionary constraints of peaceful coexistence in Hominid societies. In this review, we compare and contrast findings from the two Pan species in order to examine some of the obstacles and catalysts for peaceful behaviour in our ape relatives. Through comparing the social structures, behavioural mechanisms and ecological drivers for peaceful behaviours in Pan, we develop hypotheses regarding the evolutionary constraints of peaceful co-existence in hominid societies. © 2016 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.

ABSTRACT: Whether the opportunity to breed and rear young improves the welfare of captive animals is currently debated. However, there is very little empirical data available to evaluate this relationship and this study is a first attempt to contribute objective data to this debate. We utilized the existing variation in the reproductive experiences of sanctuary chimpanzees at Chimfunshi Wildlife Orphanage Trust in Zambia to investigate whether breeding and rearing young was associated with improved welfare for adult females (N = 43). We considered several behavioural welfare indicators, including rates of luxury behaviours and abnormal or stress-related behaviours under normal conditions and conditions inducing social stress. Furthermore, we investigated whether spending time with young was associated with good or poor welfare for adult females, regardless of their kin relationship. We used generalized linear mixed models and found no difference between adult females with and without dependent young on any welfare indices, nor did we find that time spent in proximity to unrelated young predicted welfare (all full-null model comparisons likelihood ratio tests P > 0.05). However, we did find that coprophagy was more prevalent among mother-reared than non-mother-reared individuals, in line with recent work suggesting this behaviour may have a different etiology than other behaviours often considered to be abnormal. In sum, the findings from this initial study lend support to the hypothesis that the opportunity to breed and rear young does not provide a welfare benefit for chimpanzees in captivity. We hope this investigation provides a valuable starting point for empirical study into the welfare implications of managed breeding. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Despite intensive observation of nonhuman great apes during long-term field studies, observations of great ape births in the wild are rare. Research on wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) at Bossou in the Republic of Guinea has been ongoing for 35 years, yet chimpanzee parturitions have been observed on only two occasions. Here we provide information regarding both chimpanzee births, with detailed information from the close observation of one. During this birth, the mother built a day nest in a tree before parturition. After giving birth, the mother consumed the placenta, and the other chimpanzees in her party gathered near her and her neonate. However, she did not share the placenta, and consumed it all herself. In the second observation, the mother also built a nest in a tree and subsequently gave birth. Thereafter, she shared the placenta with some individuals and consumed part of the placenta herself. Although maternal placentophagy is a ubiquitous behavior among the majority of non-human primates, observations of placenta sharing by wild primates are infrequent, and the proximate and ultimate explanations for the behavior remain unclear. © Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan 2016

ABSTRACT: Figs are keystone resources that sustain chimpanzees when preferred fruits are scarce. Many figs retain a green(ish) colour throughout development, a pattern that causes chimpanzees to evaluate edibility on the basis of achromatic accessory cues. Such behaviour is conspicuous because it entails a succession of discrete sensory assessments, including the deliberate palpation of individual figs, a task that requires advanced visuomotor control. These actions are strongly suggestive of domain-specific information processing and decisionmaking, and they call attention to a potential selective force on the origin of advanced manual prehension and digital dexterity during primate evolution. To explore this concept, we report on the foraging behaviours of chimpanzees and the spectral, chemical and mechanical properties of figs, with cutting tests revealing ease of fracture in the mouth. By integrating the ability of different sensory cues to predict fructose content in a Bayesian updating framework, we quantified the amount of information gained when a chimpanzee successively observes, palpates and bites the green figs of Ficus sansibarica.We found that the cue eliciting ingestion was not colour or size, but fig mechanics (including toughness estimates fromwedge tests), which relays higher-quality information on fructose concentrations than colour vision. This result explains why chimpanzees evaluate green figs by palpation and dental incision, actions that could explain the adaptive origins of advanced manual prehension. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees, bonobos, and human foragers share a fission-fusion social system and a mating system of joint male resource defense polygyny. Within-community skew in male strength varies among and within species. In this study, we extend a mathematical model of within-group male coalition formation among primates to derive the conditions for between-community conflicts in the form of raids. We show that the main factor affecting the presence of successful raiding is the likelihood of major discrepancies in party strength, which are set by party size distributions (and thus community size) and the skew in strength. This study confirms the functional similarities between the raiding of chimpanzees and human foragers, and it supports the “imbalance of power” hypothesis for raiding. However, it also proposes two amendments to this model. First, the absence of raiding in bonobos may be attributable more to potential female involvement in defense against raids, which increases the size of defensive coalitions. Second, the model attributes some of the raiding in humans to major contrasts in instantaneous fighting ability created by surprise raids on unarmed victims; it also draws attention to the distinction between minor raids and major raids that involve multiple bands of the same community. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: Female chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, are usually depicted as sexually submissive and bound by male coercion, because males are able to monopolize oestrous females, limiting a female's options for mate choice. We present behavioural data from a group of wild chimpanzees during a rare period in which up to 10 females cycled simultaneously, which prevented males from monopolizing oestrous females, thus changing the dynamic of male-female sexual interactions. Overall, we found that nulliparous and parous females employed different copulation calling strategies, reflecting their relative reproductive attractiveness and social standing within the community. Male partner rank, copulation duration and dominant male audience further influenced calling behaviour, and there was a nonsignificant trend for females to increase calling as the number of cycling females increased. We conclude that female chimpanzees are capable of adjusting their copulation calling flexibly, by taking into account their own sexual attractiveness, to incite male competition. © 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: The majority of currently identified simian foamy virus (SFV)-infected Cameroonian and Gabonese individuals harbor SFV from the gorilla lineage. We constructed an indicator cell line for the quantification of gorilla SFVs, in which the U3 sequence of a gorilla SFV directs the expression of the β-galactosidase protein. The gorilla foamy virus activated β-galactosidase (GFAB) cells efficiently quantified two zoonotic primary gorilla isolates and SFVs from three chimpanzee subspecies. Primary gorilla SFVs replicated more slowly and at lower levels than primary chimpanzee SFVs. Analysis of previously described motifs of Tas proteins and U3 LTRs involved in viral gene synthesis revealed conservation of such motifs in Tas proteins from gorilla and chimpanzee SFVs, but little sequence homology in the LTR regions previously shown to interact with viral and cellular factors. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Recent research shows that a large number of behavioural elements in chimpanzees are specific to each community. These are passed on through social learning and can thus be described as cultural. As both chimpanzee and bonobo are endangered in the wild, the opportunity to study such cultures in our nearest relatives in their natural habitat is also under threat. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) have served as an important model for studies of reproductive diseases and aging-related disorders in humans. However, limited information is available about spontaneously occurring reproductive tract lesions in aging chimpanzees. In this article, the authors present histopathologic descriptions of lesions identified in the reproductive tract, including the mammary gland, of 33 female and 34 male aged chimpanzees from 3 captive populations. The most common findings in female chimpanzees were ovarian atrophy, uterine leiomyoma, adenomyosis, and endometrial atrophy. The most common findings in male chimpanzees were seminiferous tubule degeneration and lymphocytic infiltrates in the prostate gland. Other less common lesions included an ovarian granulosa cell tumor, cystic endometrial hyperplasia, an endometrial polyp, uterine artery hypertrophy and mineralization, atrophic vaginitis, mammary gland inflammation, prostatic epithelial hyperplasia, dilated seminal vesicles, a sperm granuloma, and lymphocytic infiltrates in the epididymis. The findings in this study closely mimic changes described in the reproductive tract of aged humans, with the exception of a lack of malignant changes observed in the mammary gland and prostate gland. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.

ABSTRACT: This study first report the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of the central chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes troglodytes. The genome was a total of 16 556 bp in length and had a base composition of A (31.05%), G (12.95%), C (30.84%), and T (25.16%), indicating that the percentage of A + T (56.21%) is higher than G + C (43.79%). Similar to other primates, it possessed a typically conserved structure, including 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes and 1 control region (D-loop). Most of these genes were found to locate on the H-strand except for the ND6 gene and 8 tRNA genes. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the P. t. troglodytes mitochondrial genome formed a cluster with the other three Pan troglodytes genomes and that the genus Pan is closely related to the genus Homo. This mitochondrial genome sequence would supply useful genetic resources to help the conservation management of primate germplasm and uncover hominoid evolution. © 2015 Informa UK Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The great apes (chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans) are our closest relatives. Despite the many similarities, there are significant differences in aging among apes, including the human ape. Common to all are dental attrition, periodontitis, tooth loss, osteopenia, and arthritis, although gout is uniquely human and spondyloarthropathy is more prevalent in apes than humans. Humans are more prone to frailty, sarcopenia, osteoporosis, longevity past reproductive senescence, loss of brain volume, and Alzheimer dementia. Cerebral vascular disease occurs in both humans and apes. Cardiovascular disease mortality increases in aging humans and apes, but coronary atherosclerosis is the most significant type in humans. In captive apes, idiopathic myocardial fibrosis and cardiomyopathy predominate, with arteriosclerosis of intramural coronary arteries. Similar cardiac lesions are occasionally seen in wild apes. Vascular changes in heart and kidneys and aortic dissections in gorillas and bonobos suggest that hypertension may be involved in pathogenesis. Chronic kidney disease is common in elderly humans and some aging apes and is linked with cardiovascular disease in orangutans. Neoplasms common to aging humans and apes include uterine leiomyomas in chimpanzees, but other tumors of elderly humans, such as breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers, are uncommon in apes. Among the apes, chimpanzees have been best studied in laboratory settings, and more comparative research is needed into the pathology of geriatric zoo-housed and wild apes. Increasing longevity of humans and apes makes understanding aging processes and diseases imperative for optimizing quality of life in all the ape species. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.

ABSTRACT: Diet influences the stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen (δ(13) C and δ(15) N values) in animal tissue; but here we explore the influences of particular aspects of the local environment on those values in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). In this article we present new δ(13) C and δ(15) N values in Gombe chimpanzees using hairs collected from night nests in 1989. Then, we explore the influence of environmental factors by comparing our Gombe data to those from eight additional Pan study sites with previously published stable isotope data. We compare chimpanzee δ(13) Chair and δ(15) Nhar values to specific characteristics of local site ecology (biome and ecoregion) and to local Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP) to test hypotheses based on known effects of these variables on the δ(13) C and δ(15) N values in plant tissues. The comparison shows that hair from chimpanzees living in savanna sites with lower MAP have higher δ(13) Chair values than do chimpanzees living in woodland and forested sites with higher MAP. These results demonstrate the potential of using δ(13) C values in primate tissue to indicate aspects of their local ecology in cases where the ecology is uncertain, such as samples collected early in the last century and in fossil hominins. In contrast to expectations, however, chimpanzee δ(15) Nhair values from some savanna sites with lower MAP are lower, not higher, than those living in more forested areas with higher MAP. It is likely that diet selectivity by chimpanzees affects δ(15) Nhair values to a greater extent than does the influence of precipitation on plants. Am. J.

ABSTRACT: Highly pathogenic avian H5N1 viruses may give rise to the next influenza pandemic due to their reassortment and mutation of the genome. Vaccine against this virus is important for coping with its potential threat. Chimpanzee adenovirus (Ad) vectors are a novel type of vaccine vectors that share the advantages of human serotype Ad vectors but without being affected by pre-existing human neutralizing antibody to the vaccine vector. Based on a replication-deficient chimpanzee Ad vector, AdC7, we generated a novel H5N1 vaccine candidate AdC7-H5HA that expresses H5N1 Hemagglutinin (HA). When tested in mice, the vaccine significantly reduced the virus load and pathological lesions in the lung tissues, and conferred complete protection against lethal challenge by a homologous virus. Mechanistically, the AdC7-H5HA vaccine can induce both HA-specific humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in mice. Also, sera transfer experiments demonstrated that neutralizing antibodies alone could provide protection. In conclusion, our results show that chimpanzee Ad vector expressing influenza virus HA may represent a promising vaccine candidate for H5N1 viruses and other influenza virus subtypes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: KSD-VP-1/1 is a 3.6 million years old (Ma) partial skeleton of Australopithecus afarensis recently discovered from the Woranso-Mille study area in the Afar region of Ethiopia. The recovered elements of this specimen, which include cervical vertebrae, a complete scapula, clavicle, numerous ribs, pelvis, and elements of the fore- and hindlimbs, greatly enhance our understanding of the paleobiology of early Australopithecus afarensis. Detailed analyses of the cervical vertebrae indicate that Australopithecus afarensis had a highly mobile neck, signaling human-like kinematics consistent with habitual upright posture and bipedalism. Elements of the shoulder girdle exhibit some primitive morphology but are overall more similar to humans than has been previously understood. This similarity is inconsistent with the notion that the Australopithecus afarensis shoulder retained primitive morphology from an African ape-like chimpanzee/human last common ancestor. Morphology of the thorax also indicates that while some individual traits may appear to superficially suggest arboreality, Australopithecus afarensis did not have an abundance of functionally significant morphological traits that would suggest high canopy arboreality as found today in large-bodied apes. Most of the inconsistencies in interpretations of early hominin paleobiology appear to stem from methodological differences, incorrect a priori assumptions, or incomplete information derived from fragmentary specimens. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

ABSTRACT: All four chimpanzee sub-species populations are declining due to multiple factors including human-caused habitat loss. Effective conservation efforts are therefore needed to ensure their long-term survival. Habitat suitability models serve as useful tools for conservation planning by depicting relative environmental suitability in geographic space over time. Previous studies mapping chimpanzee habitat suitability have been limited to small regions or coarse spatial and temporal resolutions. Here, we used Random Forests regression to downscale a coarse resolution habitat suitability calibration dataset to estimate habitat suitability over the entire chimpanzee range at 30-m resolution. Our model predicted habitat suitability well with an r2 of 0.82 (±0.002) based on 50-fold cross validation where 75% of the data was used for model calibration and 25% for model testing; however, there was considerable variation in the predictive capability among the four sub-species modeled individually. We tested the influence of several variables derived from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) that included metrics of forest canopy and structure for four three-year time periods between 2000 and 2012. Elevation, Landsat ETM+ band 5 and Landsat derived canopy cover were the strongest predictors; highly suitable areas were associated with dense tree canopy cover for all but the Nigeria-Cameroon and Central Chimpanzee sub-species. Because the models were sensitive to such temporally based predictors, our results are the first to highlight the value of integrating continuously updated variables derived from satellite remote sensing into temporally dynamic habitat suitability models to support near real-time monitoring of habitat status and decision support systems. © 2016 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Hepatitis B virus causes horizontally transmitted infectious hepatopathy of primates and may progress to hepatocellular carcinoma. Historically, a small number of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) living in accredited North American zoos have been confirmed with positive hepatitis B serology consistent with exposure. However, the overall status for this population and the interpretation of these individual test results have not been established previously. The current U.S. zoo-housed population (n = 259) was assessed serologically for hepatitis B by surface protein antigen (HbsAg) and surface antibodies (anti-Hbs). Signalment, origin, current health status, history of liver disease, and hepatitis B vaccination history were obtained for each animal. Serologic status was measured directly in 86.5% (n = 224) of these individuals, with 2.2% (n = 5) of the study population determined to be chronically infected by positive HbsAg and negative anti-Hbs status. Additionally, 11.6% (n = 26) of the directly measured population tested were HbsAg negative and anti-Hbs positive, which was indicative of viral exposure. No animals were determined to be acutely infected as HbsAg and anti-Hbs positive. Although these results demonstrated a relatively low prevalence of hepatitis B infection among these chimpanzees, the varied serologic results between institutions underscored the importance of routine serologic testing, especially at times of proposed transfers, and consideration of species vaccination protocols. © 2016 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: The envelope-associated glycoprotein B (gB) is highly conserved within the Herpesviridae and plays a critical role in viral entry. We analyzed the evolutionary conservation of sequence and structural motifs within the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) gB and homologs of Old World primate rhadinoviruses belonging to the distinct RV1 and RV2 rhadinovirus lineages. In addition to gB homologs of rhadinoviruses infecting the pig-tailed and rhesus macaques, we cloned and sequenced gB homologs of RV1 and RV2 rhadinoviruses infecting chimpanzees. A structural model of the KSHV gB was determined, and functional motifs and sequence variants were mapped to the model structure. Conserved domains and motifs were identified, including an "RGD" motif that plays a critical role in KSHV binding and entry through the cellular integrin αVβ3. The RGD motif was only detected in RV1 rhadinoviruses suggesting an important difference in cell tropism between the two rhadinovirus lineages. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Bipedalism is a key adaptation that shaped human evolution, yet the timing and nature of its evolution remain unclear. Here we use new experimentally based approaches to investigate the locomotor mechanics preserved by the famous Pliocene hominin footprints from Laetoli, Tanzania. We conducted footprint formation experiments with habitually barefoot humans and with chimpanzees to quantitatively compare their footprints to those preserved at Laetoli. Our results show that the Laetoli footprints are morphologically distinct from those of both chimpanzees and habitually barefoot modern humans. By analysing biomechanical data that were collected during the human experiments we, for the first time, directly link differences between the Laetoli and modern human footprints to specific biomechanical variables. We find that the Laetoli hominin probably used a more flexed limb posture at foot strike than modern humans when walking bipedally. The Laetoli footprints provide a clear snapshot of an early hominin bipedal gait that probably involved a limb posture that was slightly but significantly different from our own, and these data support the hypothesis that important evolutionary changes to hominin bipedalism occurred within the past 3.66 Myr. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: African apes harbour at least six Plasmodium species of the subgenus Laverania, one of which gave rise to human Plasmodium falciparum. Here we use a selective amplification strategy to sequence the genome of chimpanzee parasites classified as Plasmodium reichenowi and Plasmodium gaboni based on the subgenomic fragments. Genome-wide analyses show that these parasites indeed represent distinct species, with no evidence of cross-species mating. Both P. reichenowi and P. gaboni are 10-fold more diverse than P. falciparum, indicating a very recent origin of the human parasite. We also find a remarkable Laverania-specific expansion of a multigene family involved in erythrocyte remodelling, and show that a short region on chromosome 4, which encodes two essential invasion genes, was horizontally transferred into a recent P. falciparum ancestor. Our results validate the selective amplification strategy for characterizing cryptic pathogen species, and reveal evolutionary events that likely predisposed the precursor of P. falciparum to colonize humans.

ABSTRACT: The social behavior of chimpanzees has been extensively studied, yet not much is known about how they behave in response to the death of a group member. Here, we provide a detailed report of the reactions of a group of chimpanzees to finding the dead body of a 9-year-old male group member. The behavior of the group was characterized by quiet attendance and close inspections punctuated by rare displays. Moreover, the body was continuously attended and closely inspected by several adults and juveniles, including an adult male who formed a close social bond with the deceased individual after the deceased individual's mother died 4 years earlier. When considered with observations of how chimpanzees respond to dead infants and adults in this group and in others, these observations suggest that chimpanzees' responses to death may be mediated by social bonds with the deceased individual. The results are discussed in light of recent reports on chimpanzees' reactions to dead community members and more general primate thanatology. Am. J.

ABSTRACT: There are a number of documented differences between humans and our closest relatives in responses to wound healing and in disease susceptibilities, suggesting a differential cellular response to certain environmental factors. In this study, we sought to look at a specific cell type, fibroblasts, to examine differences in cellular adhesion between humans and chimpanzees in visualized cells and in gene expression. We have found significant differences in the number of focal adhesions between primary human and chimpanzee fibroblasts. Additionally, we see that adhesion related gene ontology categories are some of the most differentially expressed between human and chimpanzee in normal fibroblast cells. These results suggest that human and chimpanzee fibroblasts may have somewhat different adhesive properties, which could play a role in differential disease phenotypes and responses to external factors. � The Author(s) 2016.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees in laboratory colonies experience more wounds on weekdays than on weekends, which has been attributed to the increased number of people present during the week; thus, the presence of more people was interpreted as stressful. If this were also true for primates in zoos, where high human presence is a regular feature, this would clearly be of concern. Here we examine wounding rates in two primate species (chimpanzees Pan troglodytes and ring-tailed lemurs Lemur catta) at three different zoos, to determine whether they correlate with mean number of visitors to the zoo. Wounding data were obtained from a zoo electronic record keeping system (ZIMS™). The pattern of wounds did not correlate with mean gate numbers for those days for either species in any group. We conclude that there is no evidence that high visitor numbers result in increased woundings in these two species when housed in zoos.

ABSTRACT: The degree to which the relatively smaller area of artificial environments (compared with natural habitats) has measureable effects on the behavior and welfare of captive animals has been debated for many years. While there is little question that these spaces provide far less opportunity for natural ranging behavior and travel, less is known about the degree to which captive animals travel within their environments and what factors influence these travel patterns. We intensively studied the movement of zoo-housed chimpanzees and gorillas using a computer map interface and determined their mean daily travel and found they travelled similar distances each day when restricted to their indoor areas, but when provided additional outdoor space, chimpanzees tended to increase their travel to a greater extent than did gorillas. Both species travelled shorter distances than has been recorded for their wild counterparts, however, when given access to their full indoor–outdoor exhibit; those differences were not as substantive. These findings suggest that while large, complex naturalistic environments might not stimulate comparable species-typical travel patterns in captive apes, larger spaces that include outdoor areas may be better at replicating this behavioral pattern than smaller, indoor areas. © 2016, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: To address the molecular diversity and occurrence of pathogenic species of the genus Entamoeba spp. in wild non-human primates (NHP) we conducted molecular-phylogenetic analyses on Entamoeba from wild chimpanzees living in the Issa Valley, Tanzania. We compared the sensitivity of molecular [using a genus-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR)] and coproscopic detection (merthiolate-iodine-formaldehyde concentration) of Entamoeba spp. We identified Entamoeba spp. in 72 chimpanzee fecal samples (79%) subjected to species-specific PCRs for six Entamoeba species/groups (Entamoeba histolytica, Entamoeba nuttalli, Entamoeba dispar, Entamoeba moshkovskii, Entamoeba coli and Entamoeba polecki ST2). We recorded three Entamoeba species: E. coli (47%), E. dispar (16%), Entamoeba hartmanni (51%). Coproscopically, we could only distinguish the cysts of complex E. histolytica/dispar/moshkovskii/nuttalli and E. coli. Molecular prevalence of entamoebas was higher than the prevalence based on the coproscopic examination. Our molecular phylogenies showed that sequences of E. dispar and E. coli from Issa chimpanzees are closely related to sequences from humans and other NHP from GenBank. The results showed that wild chimpanzees harbour Entamoeba species similar to those occurring in humans; however, no pathogenic species were detected. Molecular-phylogenetic methods are critical to improve diagnostics of entamoebas in wild NHP and for determining an accurate prevalence of Entamoeba species. © Cambridge University Press 2016.

ABSTRACT: Conflict management strategies can reduce costs of aggressive competition in group-living animals. Postconflict behaviors such as reconciliation and third-party postconflict affiliation are widely accepted as social skills in primates and have been demonstrated in many species. Although immature primates possess a repertoire of species-specific behaviors, it is thought that they gradually develop appropriate social skills throughout prolonged juvenility to establish and maintain complex social relationships within their group. We examined the occurrence of postconflict skills in five immature chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) over 15 mo, focusing on interactions that were not with the subject’s mother. We observed reconciliation, with conciliatory tendencies comparable to adults, and provide the first evidence that captive immature chimpanzees commonly reconciled using social play. However, immatures were not more likely to reconcile valuable than nonvaluable relationships. We also observed third party postconflict affiliation although at a lower level than reported for adults. Our results provide evidence for postconflict skills in immature chimpanzees but the lack of higher conciliatory tendency with valuable partners and low occurrence of third-party affiliation indicates extended juvenility may be required refine these skills. Further work is needed to investigate whether these behaviors have the same function and effectiveness as those found in adults. © 2016, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Human neocortex expansion likely contributed to the remarkable cognitive abilities of humans. This expansion is thought to primarily reflect differences in proliferation versus differentiation of neural progenitors during cortical development. Here, we have searched for such differences by analysing cerebral organoids from human and chimpanzees using immunohistofluorescence, live imaging, and single-cell transcriptomics. We find that the cytoarchitecture, cell type composition, and neurogenic gene expression programs of humans and chimpanzees are remarkably similar. Notably, however, live imaging of apical progenitor mitosis uncovered a lengthening of prometaphase-metaphase in humans compared to chimpanzees that is specific to proliferating progenitors and not observed in non-neural cells. Consistent with this, the small set of genes more highly expressed in human apical progenitors points to increased proliferative capacity, and the proportion of neurogenic basal progenitors is lower in humans. These subtle differences in cortical progenitors between humans and chimpanzees may have consequences for human neocortex evolution. © Mora-Bermúdez et al.

ABSTRACT: Cardiorenal syndrome involves disease and dysfunction of the heart that leads to progressive renal dysfunction. This study investigated the relationship between cardiac and renal disease in 91 aged chimpanzees at the Alamogordo Primate Facility by evaluation of the medical histories, metabolic parameters, functional measurements of the cardiovascular system, clinical pathology, and histopathology focused on the heart and kidney. Cardiac fibrosis was the most frequent microscopic finding in 82 of 91 animals (90%), followed by glomerulosclerosis with tubulointerstitial fibrosis in 63 of 91 (69%). Cardiac fibrosis with attendant glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis was observed in 58 of 91 animals (63%); there was a statistically significant association between the 2 conditions. As the severity of cardiac fibrosis increased, there was corresponding increase in severity of glomerulosclerosis with tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Altered metabolic, cardiovascular, and clinical pathology parameters indicative of heart and kidney failure were commonly associated with the moderate to severe microscopic changes, and concurrent heart and kidney failure were considered the cause of death. The constellation of findings in the chimpanzees were similar to cardiorenal syndrome in humans. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.

ABSTRACT: Self-directed behaviors (SDBs) are a commonly used behavioral indicator of arousal in nonhuman primates. Experimental manipulations, designed to increase arousal and uncertainty, have been used to elicit SDB production in primates. Beyond measuring rates of SDB production, researchers have also recorded their lateralized production by primates, thought to reflect laterality of hemispheric brain control and response to emotion. Although a handful of such studies exist, all have been conducted with chimpanzees. Expanding on this line of inquiry, we tested both chimpanzees (N = 3) and gorillas (N = 3) in a serial learning task presented on a touchscreen interface that incorporated both EASY (two-item list) and HARD (four-item list) versions of the task. Although SDB production by the apes did not differ across the two levels of task complexity, both species produced higher rates of SDB when they made an error, regardless of task difficulty. Furthermore, the apes made more SDB with the left hand—directed to the right side of their body (contralateral SDB) and left side of their body (ipsilateral SDB)—when they made an incorrect response. There was no difference in the rate of SDB produced with the right hand across correct compared to incorrect trials. The apes’ responses reflect previous reports that show humans are quicker at selecting negative emotional stimuli when using their left, compared to their right, hand (the reverse is true for positive stimuli). However, previous work has shown that chimpanzees are more likely to produce (contralateral) SDB with their right hand when aroused and so we discuss our results in relation to these findings and consider how they relate to the ‘right hemisphere’ and ‘valence’ models of emotional processing in apes. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Animals react in many different ways to being watched by others. In the context of cooperation, many theories emphasize reputational effects: Individuals should cooperate more if other potential cooperators are watching. In the context of competition, individuals might want to show off their strength and prowess if other potential competitors are watching. In the current study, we observed chimpanzees and human children in three experimental conditions involving resource acquisition: Participants were either in the presence of a passive observer (observed condition), an active observer who engaged in the same task as the participant (competition condition), or in the presence of but not directly observed by a conspecific (mere presence condition). While both species worked to acquire more resources in the competition condition, children but not chimpanzees also worked to acquire more resources in the observer condition (compared to the mere presence condition). These results suggest evolutionary continuity with regard to competition-based observer effects, but an additional observer effect in young children, potentially arising from an evolutionary-based concern for cooperative reputation. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Many chimpanzees throughout the world are housed in captivity, and there is an increasing effort to recreate social groups by mixing individuals with captive origins with those with wild origins. Captive origins may entail restricted rearing conditions during early infant life, including, for example, no maternal rearing and a limited social life. Early rearing conditions have been linked with differences in tool-use behavior between captive- and wild-born chimpanzees. If physical cognition can be impaired by non-natural rearing, what might be the consequences for social capacities? This study describes the results of network analysis based on grooming interactions in chimpanzees with wild and captive origins living in the Kumamoto Sanctuary in Kumamoto, Japan. Grooming is a complex social activity occupying up to 25 % of chimpanzees’ waking hours and plays a role in the emergence and maintenance of social relationships. We assessed whether the social centralities and roles of chimpanzees might be affected by their origin (captive vs wild). We found that captive- and wild-origin chimpanzees did not differ in their grooming behavior, but that theoretical removal of individuals from the network had differing impacts depending on the origin of the individual. Contrary to findings that non-natural early rearing has long-term effects on physical cognition, living in social groups seems to compensate for the negative effects of non-natural early rearing. Social network analysis (SNA) and, in particular, theoretical removal analysis, were able to highlight differences between individuals that would have been impossible to show using classical methods. The social environment of captive animals is important to their well-being, and we are only beginning to understand how SNA might help to enhance animal welfare. © 2015, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: Many studies have reported a spontaneous nature to synchronized movement in humans and in nonhuman primates. However, it is not yet clear whether individuals mutually adapt their movement to each other or whether one individual significantly changes to synchronize with the other. In the current study, we examined a directionality of the tempo adaptation to understand an introductive process of interactional synchrony in pairs of chimpanzees. Four pairs, consisting of five female chimpanzees, produced a finger-tapping movement under a face-to-face experimental setup where both auditory and visual cues of the partner’s movement were available. Two test conditions were prepared: alone and paired. An analysis of the tapping tempo depending on condition showed that only one chimpanzee in each pair significantly changed their tapping tempo in the direction of the partner’s tapping tempo in the paired condition compared with the alone condition. The current study demonstrated that unidirectional adaptation in tempo occurs in pairs of chimpanzees when they simultaneously produce the tapping movement under auditory and visual interaction. ©Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan 2016.

ABSTRACT: Background: Human astroviruses (HAstVs) are commonly identified worldwide as important aetiological agents of acute gastroenteritis in all age groups. More and more evidences challenged the paradigm that AstV infections are species-specific. Yet to date, AstVs associated with human infections have not been detected in any animal hosts. Results: Viral metagenomics methods were used to detect viral nucleic acids in fecal samples from 69 captive non-human primates (NHPs) from three zoos in China. Sequence reads showing high similarity to astrovirus MLB2 were found in feces from a chimpanzee with diarrhea. The complete genome of this astrovirus was determined and deposited in the GenBank under accession number KX273058 (named SAstV-nj). Phylogenetic analysis based on complete genomes revealed that SAstV-nj was closely related to and shared >98% nucleotide sequence identity with the previous human astrovirus MLB2 strains. Conclusions: This study suggested that MLB2-related astroviruses might have the potential of cross-species transmission between human and NHP. © 2016 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The male-specific regions of primate Y-chromosomes (MSY) are enriched for multi-copy genes highly expressed in the testis. These genes are located in large repetitive sequences arranged as palindromes, inverted-, and tandem repeats termed amplicons. In humans, these genes have critical roles in male fertility and are essential for the production of sperm. The structure of human and chimpanzee amplicon sequences show remarkable difference relative to the remainder of the genome, a difference thatmay be the result of intense selective pressure on male fertility.

However, little is understood about Y-chromosome amplicon diversity within and across chimpanzee populations. Here, we analyze nine common chimpanzee (representing three subspecies: Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, Pan troglodytes ellioti, and Pan troglodytes verus) and two bonobo (Pan paniscus) male whole-genome sequences to assess Y ampliconic copynumber diversity across the Pan genus. We observe that the copy number of Y chromosome amplicons is variable among chimpanzees and bonobos, and identify several lineage-specific patterns, including variable copy number of azoospermia candidates RBMY and DAZ. We detect recurrent switchpoints of copy-number change along the ampliconic tracts across chimpanzee populations, which may be the result of localized genome instability or selective forces. © The Author 2016.

ABSTRACT: The Nimba Mountains are a West African Natural World Heritage site located in the range of the Guineo–equatorial evergreen rainforest, renowned for its rich biodiversity with a high level of endemism. In 1976, Yukimaru Sugiyama from Kyoto University initiated the long-term study of chimpanzees at Bossou, a Guinean village situated 5 km from the northern foothills of Nimba. This Japanese initiative has provided key discoveries and insights on our closest living evolutionary relatives over the 40 past years, and has grown to become an international collaboration with a research focus extended to adjacent chimpanzee communities. The present paper describes a mid-term behavioral and ecological study on wild chimpanzees populating the southern slope of the Nimba Mountains, conducted in the framework of this collaborative project. It aimed to assess the status and ecological requirements of chimpanzees in order to formulate purpose-built actions for their conservation. We estimated a density of 0.46 chimpanzee per km2 using nest count methods from line transects. We used logistic and Poisson regressions to investigate basic ecological characteristics of chimpanzees in relation to habitat composition and structure, topography and seasonality. We performed an in-depth analysis of their nesting and feeding behaviors, and identified important components of their diet; we also recorded their year-round ranging patterns. Our findings highlight the importance of old secondary forest and high-altitude habitats for these chimpanzees. We discuss the results in the light of other studies from the perspective of the conservation of the species and its natural habitat. © 2016, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: It is well established that great apes communicate via intentionally produced, elaborate and flexible gestural means. Yet relatively little is known about the most fundamental steps into this communicative endeavour—communicative exchanges of mother–infant dyads and gestural acquisition; perhaps because the majority of studies concerned captive groups and single communities in the wild only. Here, we report the first systematic, quantitative comparison of communicative interactions of mother–infant dyads in two communities of wild chimpanzees by focusing on a single communicative function: initiation of carries for joint travel. Over 156 days of observation, we recorded 442 actions, 599 cases of intentional gesture production, 51 multi-modal combinations and 80 vocalisations in the Kanyawara community, Kibale National Park, Uganda, and the Taï South community, Taï National Park, Côte d’Ivoire. Our results showed that (1) mothers and infants differed concerning the signal frequency and modality employed to initiate joint travel, (2) concordance rates of mothers’ gestural production were relatively low within but also between communities, (3) infant communicative development is characterised by a shift from mainly vocal to gestural means, and (4) chimpanzee mothers adjusted their signals to the communicative level of their infants. Since neither genetic channelling nor ontogenetic ritualization explains our results satisfactorily, we propose a revised theory of gestural acquisition, social negotiation, in which gestures are the output of social shaping, shared understanding and mutual construction in real time by both interactants. © 2016, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Although numerous ecological and social factors influence range use in vertebrates, the general assumption is that ranging patterns typically accord with principles of optimal foraging theory. However, given temporal variability in resource abundance, animals can more easily meet nutritional needs at some times than at others. For species in which sociality is particularly important for fitness, such as chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and other group-living primates, the influences of social factors can be particularly strong, and likely interact closely with ecological factors. We investigated home range use by a community of chimpanzees at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda, to determine whether range use corresponded to energy-based optimality principles. Chimpanzees were particularly attracted to areas of the home range where individuals of Ficus mucuso (a large but low-density resource) were found, but only if those areas also offered other preferred or important resource classes. The aggregation of large foraging parties at F. mucuso crowns (frequently seen year-round) facilitates a number of socially beneficial activities for both males and females. Because chimpanzees apparently seek out F. mucuso in areas where other high-quality feeding opportunities exist, these social benefits likely do not come at the expense of fitness benefits accrued from feeding on high-quality resources. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Levels of nucleotide diversity vary greatly across the genomes ofmost species owing tomultiple factors. These include variation in the underlying mutation rates, as well as the effects of both direct and linked selection. Fundamental to interpreting the relative importanceof these forces is the commonobservationof a strong positive correlation between nucleotide diversity andrecombination rate. While indeed observed in humans, the interpretation of this pattern has been difficult in the absence of high-quality polymorphism data and recombination maps in closely related species. Here,we characterize genetic features driving nucleotide diversity in Western chimpanzees using a recently generated whole genome polymorphism data set. Our results suggest that recombination rate is the primary predictor ofnucleotide variation with a strongly positive correlation. Inaddition, telomeric distance, regionalGC-content,and regional CpG-island content are strongly negatively correlated with variation. These results are compared with humans, with both similarities anddifferences interpreted inthe light of the estimated effectivepopulation sizes of the twospecies aswell as their strongly differing recent demographic histories. © The Author 2016.

ABSTRACT: Primate bocaparvoviruses were first described in 2005, since then further human and gorilla bocaparvoviruses have been identified. To uncover diversity of non-human primates' bocaparvoviruses, their phylogenetic relationship and potential to cross the host species barrier, we tested 153 fecal samples from 17 captive primate species. The only one captive female of central chimpanzee (coded CPZh2) has been identified as bocaparvovirus positive. Based on the full genome phylogenetic analyses, CPZh2 strain shows close relationship to HBoV3 and GBoV. Further recombination analysis confirmed expected mosaic origin of CPZh2 strain. According the phylogenetic position, following the ICTV recommendations, we propose a novel genotype within the Primate bocaparvovirus 1 species infecting chimpanzee. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Although chimpanzees understand what others may see, it is unclear whether they understand how others see things (Level 2 perspective-taking). We investigated whether chimpanzees can predict the behavior of a conspecific which is holding a mistaken perspective that differs from their own. The subject competed with a conspecific over two food sticks. While the subject could see that both were the same size, to the competitor one appeared bigger than the other. In a previously established game, the competitor chose one stick in private first and the subject chose thereafter, without knowing which of the sticks was gone. Chimpanzees and 6-year-old children chose the ‘riskier’ stick (that looked bigger to the competitor) significantly less in the game than in a nonsocial control. Children chose randomly in the control, thus showing Level 2 perspective-taking skills; in contrast, chimpanzees had a preference for the ‘riskier’ stick here, rendering it possible that they attributed their own preference to the competitor to predict her choice. We thus run a follow-up in which chimpanzees did not have a preference in the control. Now, they also chose randomly in the game. We conclude that chimpanzees solved the task by attributing their own preference to the other, while children truly understood the other’s mistaken perspective. © 2016, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: Habitat types can affect vector and pathogen distribution and transmission dynamics. The prevalence and genetic diversity of Plasmodium spp. in two eastern chimpanzee populations - Kalinzu Forest Reserve, Uganda and Issa Valley, Tanzania - inhabiting different habitat types was investigated. As a follow up study the effect of host sex and age on infections patterns in Kalinzu Forest Reserve chimpanzees was determined. Methods: Molecular methods were employed to detect Plasmodium DNA from faecal samples collected from savanna-woodland (Issa Valley) and forest (Kalinzu Forest Reserve) chimpanzee populations. Results: Based on a Cytochrome-b PCR assay, 32 out of 160 Kalinzu chimpanzee faecal samples were positive for Plasmodium DNA, whilst no positive sample was detected in 171 Issa Valley chimpanzee faecal samples. Sequence analysis revealed that previously known Laverania species (Plasmodium reichenowi, Plasmodium billbrayi and Plasmodium billcollinsi) are circulating in the Kalinzu chimpanzees. A significantly higher proportion of young individuals were tested positive for infections, and switching of Plasmodium spp. was reported in one individual. Amongst the positive individuals sampled more than once, the success of amplification of Plasmodium DNA from faeces varied over sampling time. Conclusion: The study showed marked differences in the prevalence of malaria parasites among free ranging chimpanzee populations living in different habitats. In addition, a clear pattern of Plasmodium infections with respect to host age was found. The results presented in this study contribute to understanding the ecological aspects underlying the malaria infections in the wild. Nevertheless, integrative long-term studies on vector abundance, Plasmodium diversity during different seasons between sites would provide more insight on the occurrence, distribution and ecology of these pathogens. © 2016 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Stable isotope values in primate tissues can be used to reconstruct diet in the absence of direct observation. However, in order to make dietary inferences, one must first establish isotopic variability for potential food sources. In this study we examine stable carbon isotope (δ(13) C) values for chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) food resources from two Ugandan forests: Ngogo (Kibale National Park), and Bwindi Impenetrable National Park. Mean δ(13) C values for plant samples are equivalent at both sites. Plant δ(13) C values are best explained by a multivariate linear model including plant part (leaves, pith, flowers, and fruit), vertical position within the canopy (canopy vs. ground), and taxon (R(2)  = 0.6992). At both sites, leaves had the lowest δ(13) C values followed by pith and fruit. Canopy resources have comparable δ(13) C values at the two sites but ground resources have lower δ(13) C values at Ngogo than Bwindi (-30.7 vs. -28.6‰). Consequently, isotopic differences between ground and canopy resources (4.2 vs. 2.2‰), and among plant parts are more pronounced at Ngogo. These results demonstrate that underlying environmental differences between sites can produce variable δ(13) C signatures among primate food resources. In the absence of observation data or isotope values for local vegetation, caution must be taken when interpreting isotopic differences among geographically or temporally separated populations or species.

ABSTRACT: A species, especially when it is endangered and surrounded by anthropogenic elements, can be threatened by habitat fragmentation. Food resource availability in the species’ usual or surrogate habitats may reinforce or decrease its use of certain areas. Our objective was to to determine the influence of natural and anthropogenic variables on spatial distribution of eastern chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii). We first determined the home range of a wild chimpanzee community (hereafter Sebitoli Chimpanzee Community [SCC]) based on global positioning system (GPS) point locations (n = 2,586 direct observations and feces locations) collected between 2009 and 2013 in Sebitoli, Kibale National Park, Uganda. We described SCC home range using grid cells (2,959 cells of 100 m × 100 m) referencing environmental, spatial, and topographical variables (n = 15). We then determined diet and food species abundance within their territory (n = 63 vegetation plots and 18 months phenological survey) and predicted distribution of the 10 most foraged fruit species within SCC home range, using environmental, spatial, and topographical variables (n = 10) by applying a maximum entropy model (maxent). We then predicted chimpanzee presence as a function of environmental, spatial, and topographical variables (n = 15) using the maxent model and assessed its truthfulness with the kernel model, based only on GPS point locations. Chimpanzees in Sebitoli were mostly observed in a core area of 5.42 km2 within the 25-km2 home range. They did not avoid forest edges in contact with human populations, especially males who used larger core areas than females. Factors with the greatest positive impact on the chimpanzee distribution model (maxent area under the curve [AUC] = 0.907) were related to 3 different food resources: 1) proximity to forest edges considered as attractive because of presence of crops cultivated by local farmers; 2) proximity to a tarmac road that crosses the SCC home range with shoulders covered by attractive terrestrial herbaceous vegetation; and 3) presence of wild forest fruiting resources. The results obtained with the maxent predictive model, applied on a fine scale, were consistent with the kernel model, based on real observations. Therefore, such an approach may be recommended for surveys or action plans interested in sustainable management of wildlife in an anthropogenic environment and may be a useful tool to better understand parameters of a prefered zone for an endangered species. © 2016 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2016

ABSTRACT: The production of edible rainforest fruits is characterized by fluctuating and seasonal patterns that require frugivores to flexibly adjust their ranging behaviour. We investigated whether significant changes in a forager's travel direction can inform us about the importance of the nutritional and energetic aspects of different food sources for a wild animal's diet. We recorded the ranging patterns of five adult female chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes verus, for a total of 275 full days in the Taï National Park in Côte d'Ivoire and designed two models that predicted their directional changes at, and on the way to, fruit-bearing feeding trees. In both models, directional change was significantly influenced by the density of the feeding tree species and the crude fat content of that species' fruit. Female chimpanzees were more likely to change their travel direction for rarer trees, at which they fed on fruits that contained higher amounts of fat. In addition, directional changes tended to be positively influenced by the content of nonstructural (‘easy energy’) and structural carbohydrates (NDF) in that species' fruit. We did not detect any effect of sensory cues or social factors on the directional changes, in either model. The amount of fruit available and the time since the start of the fruiting season positively influenced directional change in the second model, which suggests that chimpanzees were updating their knowledge of the fruit availability in individual trees over time. Our results indicate that the nutrient content of fruit and its abundance exerted a significant impact on the shape of chimpanzee female travel paths, which opens up a new avenue for investigation of food preferences in wild animals through analyses of their ranging patterns. © 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ABSTRACT: The nearly universal right hand preference manifested by human populations is one of the most pronounced manifestations of population-level lateralization. Morphological and archeological evidence indicate that this behavioral specialization may have emerged among our hominin ancestors. Whether population-level behavioral asymmetries are evident in non-human animals remains a topic of considerable scientific debate, with the most consistent evidence of population-level trends emerging from studies of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). However, previous studies of population-level lateralization in wild apes have relied upon data sets pooled across populations to reach adequate sample sizes. Our aim was to test for population-level handedness within a single wild chimpanzee population, and also to determine if performance asymmetries were associated with handedness. To address these questions, we coded handedness and duration of fishing probe insertions from remote video footage of chimpanzee visitation to termite nests (totaling 119 hr) in the Goualougo Triangle, Republic of Congo. Similar to reports from other populations, chimpanzees in the Goualougo Triangle showed robust individual hand preferences for termite fishing. There were 46 right-handed, 39 left-handed, and 4 ambiguously-handed individuals. Though we did not detect an overall significant population-level handedness (t(88) = 0.83, n.s.) in this study, males showed a greater right hand preference than females. Further, we found that average dipping latencies were significantly faster for right- compared to left-handed chimpanzees. Possible explanations and evolutionary implications of taxa- and task-specific patterns of population-level laterality are discussed. Am. J.

ABSTRACT: Data on the contributions of indigenous knowledge of gorilla (Gorilla gorilla diehli), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes ellioti) and buffalo (Syncerus caffer) to conservation, in the Black Bush Area of Waindow (BBAW): Menchum south, North West Region of Cameroon, was collected from August to October 2013. The general objective of the research was to establish elicit information on the indigenous knowledge of gorilla, chimpanzee and buffalo which can contribute to their conservation in the study site. Research data were obtained through an interviewer-administered questionnaire survey in five (5) hills of the study site (Attue, Itiaku, Akalieu, Njouhchou and Toukechiachia), purposively selected based on the presence of hunting camps within the hills. Indigenous knowledge systems, such as, cultural laws and regulations, gender in hunting wildlife and traditional beliefs/taboos, greatly influences the conservation of these species in the study area. Gorilla, chimpanzee and buffalo meat or body parts were in high demanded for food, medicinal and ritualistic purposes resulting to excessive poaching. Therefore, it is necessary to encourage active community participation, since some of the indigenous knowledge practices placed the remaining species of gorilla, chimpanzee and buffalo under intense threat of disappearing. © 2016 Angwafo and Chuo.

ABSTRACT: The mark/rouge test has been used to assess mirror self-recognition (MSR) in many species. Despite consistent evidence of MSR in great apes, genetic or non-genetic factors may account for the individual differences in behavioral responses that have been reported. We examined whether vasopressin receptor gene (AVPR1A) polymorphisms are associated with MSR-related behaviors in chimpanzees since vasopressin has been implicated in the development and evolution of complex social relations and cognition and chimpanzees are polymorphic for the presence of the RS3-containing DupB region. We compared a sample of DupB+/- and DupB-/- chimpanzees on a mark test to assess its role on social behavior toward a mirror. Chimpanzees were administered two, 10-min sessions where frequencies of mirror-guided self-directed behaviors, contingent actions and other social behaviors were recorded. Approximately one-third showed evidence of MSR and these individuals exhibited more mirror-guided self-exploratory behaviors and mouth contingent actions than chimpanzees not classified as passers. Moreover, DupB+/- males exhibited more scratching and agonistic behaviors than other male and female cohorts. Our findings support previous studies demonstrating individual differences in MSR abilities in chimpanzees and suggest that AVPR1A partly explains individual differences in MSR by influencing the behavioral reactions of chimpanzees in front of a mirror. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and International Behavioural and Neural Genetics Society.

ABSTRACT: In humans, CD16 and CD56 are used to identify functionally distinct natural killer (NK) subsets. Due to ubiquitous CD56 expression, this marker cannot be used to distinguish between NK cell subsets in chimpanzees. Therefore, functional analysis of distinct NK subsets during hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has never been performed in these animals. In the present study an alternative strategy was used to identify four distinct NK subsets on the basis of the expression of CD16 and CD94. The expression of activating and inhibiting surface receptors showed that these subsets resemble human NK subsets. CD107 expression was used to determine degranulation of the different subsets in naive and HCV-infected chimpanzees. In HCV-infected chimpanzees increased spontaneous cytotoxicity was observed in CD94high/dimCD16pos and CD94lowCD16pos subsets. By contrast, increased natural cytotoxicity receptor (NCR)- mediated degranulation after NKp30 and NKp44 triggering was demonstrated in the CD94dimCD16neg subset. Our findings suggest that spontaneous and NCR-mediated cytotoxicity are effector functions of distinct NK subsets in HCV-infected chimpanzees. © 2016 British Society for Immunology.

ABSTRACT: Stress is a major cause of poor health and mortality in humans and other social mammals. Close social bonds buffer stress, however much of the underlying physiological mechanism remains unknown. Here, we test two key hypotheses: bond partner effects occur only during stress (social buffering) or generally throughout daily life (main effects). We assess urinary glucocorticoids (uGC) in wild chimpanzees, with or without their bond partners, after a natural stressor, resting or everyday affiliation. Chimpanzees in the presence of, or interacting with, bond partners rather than others have lowered uGC levels across all three contexts. These results support the main effects hypothesis and indicate that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis regulation is mediated by daily engagement with bond partners both within and out of stressful contexts. Regular social support with bond partners could lead to better health through daily 'micro-management' of the HPA axis, a finding with potential medical implications for humans.

ABSTRACT: The first part of this article compares the distribution of chimpanzee and elephant populations in reaction to human territorial dynamics of West African trade in parts of nineteenth century Guinea, Guinea-Bissau and Senegal. It answers for this specific region the question of whether present-day situations of close chimpanzee-human spatial proximity are stable or only temporary phenomena in long-term processes of environmental change, and shows that conservation policies centred on either of these two “flagship” species carry radically different ecological, political and territorial implications. The second part shifts to local-level perspectives on human-chimpanzee relationships, emphasizing the land rights contentions and misunderstandings created by the implementation of protected areas at Bossou and in the Boké region of Guinea. These case studies help to look at acts of resistance and local interpretations of primate conservation policies as opportunities to reconsider what is being protected, for what purpose, as whose heritage, and to move towards new and more legitimate opportunities for the implementation of conservation policies. © 2016, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: Roads have broadly adverse impacts on wildlife, including nonhuman primates. One direct effect is mortality from collisions with vehicles. While highly undesirable, roadkills provide valuable information on the health and condition of endangered species. We present a case report of a wild chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) killed crossing a road in Bulindi, Uganda, where chimpanzees inhabit forest fragments amid farmland. Details of the collision are constructed from eyewitness accounts of pedestrians. Physical examination of the cadaver indicated good overall body condition; at 40 kg, the deceased female was heavier than usual for an adult female East African chimpanzee. No external wounds or fractures were noted. Coprological assessment demonstrated infection by several gastrointestinal parasites commonly reported in living wild chimpanzees. Histopathology revealed eosinophilic enteritis and biliary hyperplasia potentially caused by parasite infection. However, eosinophilia was not widely spread into the submucosa, while egg/cyst counts suggested low-intensity parasite infections compared to healthy female chimpanzees of similar age in nearby Budongo Forest. No behavioral indicators of ill health were noted in the deceased female in the month prior to the accident. We conclude that cause of death was acute, i.e., shock from the collision, and was probably unrelated to parasite infection or any other underlying health condition. Notably, this female had asymmetrical polythelia, and, while nursing at the time of her death, had one functioning mammary gland only. In Uganda, where primates often inhabit human-dominated landscapes, human population growth and economic development has given rise to increasing motor traffic, while road development is enabling motorists to travel at greater speeds. Thus, the danger of roads to apes and other wildlife is rising, necessitating urgent strategies to reduce risks. Installation of simple speed-bumps—common on Ugandan roads—would be effective in reducing risks to wildlife, and would also make roads safer for human pedestrians. © 2016, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: For captive chimpanzees, 'abnormal' behaviours include behaviours observed only in captivity (i.e. species-atypical behaviours) and those that are performed at higher rates in captivity compared to in the wild. Both types are used as metrics for evaluating captive primates' welfare. However, categorizing all abnormal behaviours together ignores variation in their etiologies, which limits our ability to understand them and provide useful interventions. Coprophagy (deliberately eating faeces) is an intriguing abnormal behaviour because, unlike many abnormal behaviours, it is performed at higher rates among captive chimpanzees that were mother reared, compared to those that were human reared, and it has been proposed that it represents a socially learnt 'cultural' behaviour. Furthermore, coprophagy is observed among both wild and captive animals, although at higher rates in captivity. Typically, coprophagy is classed with other abnormal behaviours by those evaluating captive chimpanzee welfare, but such categorization has arisen from a top-down approach based on a priori assumptions. To apply a bottom-up approach, which would allow us to identify relations between behaviours in chimpanzees' repertoire, in this study we ran a principal components analysis on the behaviours performed by 60 captive chimpanzees, to determine whether coprophagy should be classified with other abnormal behaviours. The principal components analysis revealed seven factors that we termed social, aggressive, playful, active, feed, abnormal and self-directed. Furthermore, the analysis revealed that coprophagy loaded onto the 'social' factor, which included positive social behaviours, and not onto the 'abnormal' factor, which included other abnormal behaviours. Supporting previous research, we also found that those chimpanzees that were mother-reared showed higher rates of coprophagy than those that were human reared; there was a significant positive correlation between time spent with conspecifics during the first four years of life and the rate of coprophagy performed by the subjects as adults (r = 0.575, N = 60, P < 0.001). We discuss these results giving consideration to the practical applications for monitoring and evaluating captive chimpanzee welfare and also from a theoretical perspective about the social learning mechanisms that may underpin the transmission of coprophagy among captive chimpanzees. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: During human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, soluble CD14 (sCD14) is up-regulated as a consequence of pathological disruption of the gut epithelial barrier, and subsequent increased microbial translocation. Also in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients with advanced liver fibrosis, increased levels of sCD14 have been reported. Since the liver plays an important role in clearance of translocated bacterial products, hepatic fibrosis may negatively affect clearance and thus contribute to higher sCD14 levels. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) infected with HCV typically show no signs of liver fibrosis. Here, we have tested the hypothesis that increased levels of sCD14 occur in the absence of hepatic fibrosis or microbial translocation in chimpanzees chronically infected with HCV. sCD14 was up-regulated in both HIV/simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-and HCV-infected chimpanzees. In HIV/SIV-infected chimpanzees, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein, a marker for gut perturbation, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding-protein and LPS core antibodies, confirm that sCD14 up-regulation was caused by increased microbial translocation. In HCV-infected chimpanzees, no evidence was found for increased microbial translocation despite up-regulation of sCD14. Additionally, the impact of liver fibrosis on microbial translocation was addressed by direct comparison of chimpanzees with a high HCV load and human patients with advanced fibrosis. These data suggest that only in a small minority of HCV patients, hepatic fibrosis corroborates microbial translocation. © 2016 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Several factors are known to affect the overall well-being of captive apes, including facility design and the presence of and interaction with both familiar and unfamiliar humans. Several studies have examined the effects crowds of varying sizes have on the behavior of a wide taxonomic range of zoo-housed animals, including apes. However, previous investigations of visitor effects on ape behavior vary in scope and methodology, leading to inconsistent results across groups and institutions. Using data gathered through two long-term observation protocols, we aimed to determine how 6 chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and 5 Western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) housed at Lincoln Park Zoo responded to visitor crowds of various sizes. The dataset, gathered over 12 consecutive months, included both behavioral data collected via focal animal follows, and exhibit use data collected via whole group scans. As with previous studies, we investigated if and how the behavior of the apes varied as the number of visitors near their exhibits increased across several levels of visitor density. In addition, we looked at whether the apes in this study use the indoor areas of their exhibits that are nearest the public (within one meter) at a rate proportional to the size of that area, and whether their use of this space changed as crowd size varied. As crowd size increased, neither chimpanzees (P = 0.97) nor gorillas (P = 0.18) were observed to alter their use of the areas of their exhibit closest to zoo visitors. In addition, both chimpanzees and gorillas were observed in this area at a rate equal to or greater than expected by random movements at all three levels of crowd size analyzed. Crowd size had no effect on the frequency of most behaviors analyzed including abnormal, agonism, and grooming (P > 0.05). We observed a slight effect of crowd size on self-directed behaviors in both species though it was not the case that the largest crowds caused the highest rates of self-directed behavior. Although these data were collected at a single institution, our findings support the argument that well-designed zoo exhibits can be effective in removing the potentially negative effects of large crowds. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: When confronted with novel foods, chimpanzees' responses combine a mixture of curiosity and cautiousness. Once the item is in the mouth, the initial cautiousness is followed by an aversion to bitter taste that is mediated mainly by the TAS2R gene family. For instance, variations on the TAS2R38 locus which has been studied extensively in humans have been associated with different acceptance of bitter substances. Surprisingly, while cautiousness and bitter taste aversion were selected to prevent any risk of poisoning, very few studies on novel food acceptance have included the vegetative parts of plants. Moreover, the studies were usually carried out with captive apes faced to a very restricted variety of non-toxic plants, hardly making the results representative. This study aims to replicate previous findings obtained in zoos while controlling for these limitations. We provided nine subgroups of eastern chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) living in the Ugandan sanctuary of Ngamba Island with novel plants known to be consumed by wild chimpanzees of the same subspecies, as well as domestic plants, wild sapota fruit and grey clay used by human local communities. We also genotyped their TAS2R38 gene. Our results confirm the very low genetic heterogeneity for TAS2R38 in this chimpanzee subspecies. Chimpanzees were particularly cautious towards the vegetative parts of novel plants, likely reflecting their behavioural strategy for avoiding toxic compounds. We also confirmed their higher propensity towards testing sapota and clay, reflecting their ability to expand their diet. In contrast with the results found in zoos, familiar and novel less-palatable vegetative parts of plants did not elicit many interindividual observations. This may be explained by the items presented, which could have been so novel to be considered as enrichment in captive conditions, where the apes are rarely exposed to plants. © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

ABSTRACT: The identification and recruitment of trustworthy partners represents an important adaptive challenge for any species that relies heavily on cooperation [1, 2]. From an evolutionary perspective, trust is difficult to account for as it involves, by definition, a risk of non-reciprocation and defection by cheaters [3, 4]. One solution for this problem is to form close emotional bonds, i.e., friendships, which enable trust even in contexts where cheating would be profitable [5]. Little is known about the evolutionary origins of the human tendency to form close social bonds to overcome the trust problem. Studying chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), one of our closest living relatives, is one way of identifying these origins. While a growing body of research indicates that at least some of the properties of close human relationships find parallels in the social bonds of chimpanzees [6-10] and that chimpanzees extend favors preferentially toward selected individuals [11-14], it is unclear whether such interactions are based on trust. To fill this gap in knowledge, we observed the social interactions of a group of chimpanzees and established dyadic friendship relations. We then presented chimpanzees with a modified, non-verbal version of the human trust game and found that chimpanzees trust their friends significantly more frequently than their non-friends. These results suggest that trust within closely bonded dyads is not unique to humans but rather has its evolutionary roots in the social relationships of our closest primate relatives. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Highly social animals possess a well-developed ability to distinguish the faces of familiar from novel conspecifics to induce distinct behaviors for maintaining society. However, the behaviors of animals when they encounter ambiguous faces of familiar yet novel conspecifics, e.g., strangers with faces resembling known individuals, have not been well characterised. Using a morphing technique and preferential-looking paradigm, we address this question via the chimpanzee's facial-recognition abilities. We presented eight subjects with three types of stimuli: (1) familiar faces, (2) novel faces and (3) intermediate morphed faces that were 50% familiar and 50% novel faces of conspecifics. We found that chimpanzees spent more time looking at novel faces and scanned novel faces more extensively than familiar or intermediate faces. Interestingly, chimpanzees looked at intermediate faces in a manner similar to familiar faces with regards to the fixation duration, fixation count, and saccade length for facial scanning, even though the participant was encountering the intermediate faces for the first time. We excluded the possibility that subjects merely detected and avoided traces of morphing in the intermediate faces. These findings suggest a bias for a feeling-of-familiarity that chimpanzees perceive familiarity with an intermediate face by detecting traces of a known individual, as 50% alternation is sufficient to perceive familiarity. ï¿½ 2016 Matsuda et al.

ABSTRACT: The emotional Stroop task is an experimental paradigm developed to study the relationship between emotion and cognition. Human participants required to identify the color of words typically respond more slowly to negative than to neutral words (emotional Stroop effect). Here we investigated whether chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) would show a comparable effect. Using a touch screen, eight chimpanzees were trained to choose between two simultaneously presented stimuli based on color (two identical images with differently colored frames). In Experiment 1, the images within the color frames were shapes that were either of the same color as the surrounding frame or of the alternative color. Subjects made fewer errors and responded faster when shapes were of the same color as the frame surrounding them than when they were not, evidencing that embedded images affected target selection. Experiment 2, a modified version of the emotional Stroop task, presented subjects with four different categories of novel images: three categories of pictures of humans (veterinarian, caretaker, and stranger), and control stimuli showing a white square. Because visits by the veterinarian that include anaesthetization can be stressful for subjects, we expected impaired performance in trials presenting images of the veterinarian. For the first session, we found correct responses to be indeed slower in trials of this category. This effect was more pronounced for subjects whose last anaesthetization experience was more recent, indicating that emotional valence caused the slowdown. We propose our modified emotional Stroop task as a simple method to explore which emotional stimuli affect cognitive performance in nonhuman primates. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: The use of stick- or probe-tools is a chimpanzee universal, recorded in all long-term study populations across Africa, except one: Budongo, Uganda. Here, after 25 years of observation, stick-tool use remains absent under both natural circumstances and strong experimental scaffolding. Instead, the chimpanzees employ a rich repertoire of leaf-tools for a variety of dietary and hygiene tasks. One use of stick-tools in other communities is in feeding on the aggressive Dorylus ‘army ant’ species, consumed by chimpanzees at all long-term study sites outside of mid-Western Uganda. Here we report the first observation of army-ant feeding in Budongo, in which individuals from the Waibira chimpanzee community employed detached leaves to feed on a ground swarm. We describe the behaviour and discuss whether or not it can be considered tool use, together with its implication for the absence of stick-tool ‘culture’ in Budongo chimpanzees. © 2016, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) use some communicative signals flexibly and voluntarily, with use influenced by learning. These signals include some vocalizations and also sounds made using the lips, oral cavity, and/or teeth, but not the vocal tract, such as “attention-getting” sounds directed at humans by captive chimpanzees and lip smacking during social grooming. Chimpanzees at Ngogo, in Kibale National Park, Uganda, make four distinct sounds while grooming others. Here, I present data on two of these (“splutters” and “teeth chomps”) and consider whether social learning contributes to variation in their production and whether they serve social functions. Higher congruence in the use of these two sounds between dyads of maternal relatives than dyads of non-relatives implies that social learning occurs and mostly involves vertical transmission, but the results are not conclusive and it is unclear which learning mechanisms may be involved. In grooming between adult males, tooth chomps and splutters were more likely in long than in short bouts; in bouts that were bidirectional rather than unidirectional; in grooming directed toward high-ranking males than toward low-ranking males; and in bouts between allies than in those between non-allies. Males were also more likely to make these sounds while they were grooming other males than while they were grooming females. These results are expected if the sounds promote social bonds and induce tolerance of proximity and of grooming by high-ranking males. However, the alternative hypothesis that the sounds are merely associated with motivation to groom, with no additional social function, cannot be ruled out. Limited data showing that bouts accompanied by teeth chomping or spluttering at their initiation were longer than bouts for which this was not the case point toward a social function, but more data are needed for a definitive test. Comparison to other research sites shows that the possible existence of grooming-specific sound dialects in chimpanzees deserves further investigation. © 2015, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: The snowdrift game is a model for studying social coordination in the context of competing interests. We presented pairs of chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, with a situation in which they could either pull a weighted tray together or pull alone to obtain food. Ultimately chimpanzees should coordinate their actions because if no one pulled, they would both lose the reward. There were two experimental manipulations: the tray's weight (low or high weight condition) and the time to solve the dilemma before the rewards became inaccessible (40 s or 10 s). When the costs were high (i.e. high weight condition), chimpanzees waited longer to act. Cooperation tended to increase in frequency across sessions. The pulling effort invested in the task also became more skewed between subjects. The subjects also adjusted their behaviour by changing their pulling effort for different partners. These results demonstrate that chimpanzees can coordinate their actions in situations where there is a conflict of interest. © 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: Development of safe and efficacious vaccines whose potency is unaffected by long-term storage at ambient temperature would obviate major vaccine deployment hurdles and limit wastage associated with breaks in the vaccine cold chain. Here, we evaluated the immunogenicity of a novel chimpanzee adenovirus vectored Rift Valley Fever vaccine (ChAdOx1-GnGc) in cattle, following its thermostabilisation by slow desiccation on glass fiber membranes in the non-reducing sugars trehalose and sucrose. Thermostabilised ChAdOx1-GnGc vaccine stored for 6 months at 25, 37 or 45 °C elicited comparable Rift Valley Fever virus neutralising antibody titres to those elicited by the 'cold chain' vaccine (stored at -80 °C throughout) at the same dose, and these were within the range associated with protection against Rift Valley Fever in cattle. The results support the use of sugar-membrane thermostabilised vaccines in target livestock species. © 2016 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Our closest living relatives, bonobos and chimpanzees, along with small-scale human societies figure prominently in debates about human nature. Here we emphasize and explain behavioural variation within and among these three species. In the logic of behavioural ecology, individuals have been selected to adjust their behaviour along evolved reaction norms that maximize fitness given current socio-ecological conditions. We discuss variation in three behavioural contexts: relationships between the sexes, hierarchy and inequality, and intergroup interactions. In each context, behavioural variation can be related to two broad socio-ecological conditions: (i) the defensibility of contested resources, and (ii) differences in bargaining power. When defensibility of resources and differences in bargaining power are great, interactions are rife with conflict; when they are minimal, interactions are more harmonious. These socio-ecological conditions therefore constitute key catalysts and obstacles of cooperation. We conclude that human nature should be seen as consisting of evolved reaction norms. © 2016 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.

ABSTRACT: Understanding the factors associated with the long-term stress levels of captive animals is important from the view of animal welfare. In this study, we investigated the effects of relocation in addition to individual and environmental factors related to social management on long-term stress level in group-living captive chimpanzees by examining behaviors and hair cortisol (HC). Specifically, we conducted two studies. The first compared changes in HC levels before and after the relocation of 8 chimpanzees (Study 1) and the second examined the relationship between individual and environmental factors and individual HC levels in 58 chimpanzees living in Kumamoto Sanctuary (KS), Kyoto University (Study 2). We hypothesized that relocation, social situation, sex, and early rearing conditions, would affect the HC levels of captive chimpanzees. We cut arm hair from chimpanzees and extracted and assayed cortisol with an enzyme immunoassay. Aggressive behaviors were recorded ad libitum by keepers using a daily behavior monitoring sheet developed for this study. The results of Study 1 indicate that HC levels increased during the first year after relocation to the new environment and then decreased during the second year. We observed individual differences in reactions to relocation and hypothesized that social factors may mediate these changes. In Study 2, we found that the standardized rate of receiving aggression, rearing history, sex, and group formation had a significant influence on mean HC levels. Relocation status was not a significant factor, but mean HC level was positively correlated with the rate of receiving aggression. Mean HC levels were higher in males than in females, and the association between aggressive interactions and HC levels differed by sex. These results suggest that, although relocation can affect long-term stress level, individuals’ experiences of aggression and sex may be more important contributors to long-term stress than relocation alone. © 2016 Yamanashi et al.

ABSTRACT: There are few studies of long-term care and rehabilitation of animals which acquired physical disabilities in captivity, despite their importance for welfare. An adult male chimpanzee named Reo at the Primate Research Institute of Kyoto University, developed acute myelitis, inflammation of the spinal cord, which resulted in impaired leg function. This report describes a walking rehabilitation system set up in a rehabilitation room where he lives. The rehabilitation apparatus consisted of a touch monitor presenting cognitive tasks and a feeder presenting food rewards at a distance of two meters from the monitor, to encourage him to walk between the monitor and the feeder repeatedly. Initially, Reo did not touch the monitor, therefore we needed adjustment of the apparatus and procedure. After the habituation to the monitor and cognitive tasks, he started to show behaviors of saving food rewards without walking, or stopping participation to the rehabilitation. Finally it took seven phases of the adjustment to determine the final setting; when the monitor automatically displayed trials in 4-h, AM (1000–1200 hours) and PM (1400–1600 hours) sessions through a day, Reo spontaneously walked from the monitor to the feeder to receive rewards, and returned to the monitor to perform the next trial. Comparison of Reo’s locomotion in a no-task period and under the final setting revealed that the total travel distance increased from 136.7 to 506.3 m, movement patterns became multiple, and the percentage of walking increased from 1.2 to 27.2 % in PM session. The findings of this case study suggest that cognitive tasks may be a useful way to rehabilitate physically disabled chimpanzees, and thus improve their welfare in captivity. © 2016, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: Ecological complexity has been proposed to play a crucial role in primate brain-size evolution. However, detailed quantification of ecological complexity is still limited. Here we assess the spatio-temporal distribution of tropical fruits and young leaves, two primary chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) foods, focusing on the predictability of their availability in individual trees. Using up to 20 years of information on monthly availability of young leaf, unripe and ripe fruit in plant species consumed by chimpanzees from tropical forests in East, Central, and West Africa, we estimated: (1) the forest-wide frequency of occurrence of each food type and (2) the predictability of finding ripe fruit-bearing trees, focusing on the timing, frequency, and amount of ripe fruit present. In all three forests, at least half of all encountered trees belonged to species that chimpanzees were known to feed on. However, the proportion of these trees bearing young leaves and fruit fluctuated widely between months. Ripe fruit was the most ephemeral food source, and trees that had more than half of their crown filled were at least nine times scarcer than other trees. In old growth forests only one large ripe fruit crop was on average encountered per 10km. High levels of inter-individual variation in the number of months that fruit was present existed, and in some extreme cases individuals bore ripe fruit more than seven times as often as conspecifics. Some species showed substantially less variation in such ripe fruit production frequencies and fruit quantity than others. We hypothesize that chimpanzees employ a suite of cognitive mechanisms, including abilities to: (1) generalize or classify food trees; (2) remember the relative metrics of quantity and frequency of fruit production across years; and (3) flexibly plan return times to feeding trees to optimize high-energy food consumption in individual trees, and efficient travel between them. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Many wild primates experience long-term limb disability, and their ability to cope with disability has implications for survival and fitness. We quantified the arboreal feeding and postural behaviors of adult chimpanzees to study the consequences of physical limb disabilities. We collected behavioral data for a total of 8 mo on chimpanzees at Sebitoli, Kibale National Park, Uganda, focusing on the time spent feeding, common feeding tree species, body postures, and substrate use. Of the 51 chimpanzees we observed, 16 (31%) exhibited limb anomalies, which varied in form and severity. Disabled chimpanzees climbed as high as chimpanzees without disabilities and did not differ from nondisabled chimpanzees in the amount they used feeding tree species. Adult chimpanzees with severe hand disability spent significantly more time feeding than nondisabled individuals. In addition, manually disabled adults did not suspend themselves from branches during feeding as frequently as nondisabled adults and used larger substrates for gripping and sitting than nondisabled adults. These results indicate that disabled individuals compensate to carry out feeding activities in trees. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: Hair cortisol has been reported to be a useful measure of long-term hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation in several species. It serves as a practical tool for long-term stress assessment, but it is important to understand the methodological factors that can affects hair cortisol assays to avoid methodological artifacts. To that end, we tested several procedures for measuring cortisol levels in hair collected from captive chimpanzees. The results showed that reproducibility was high, and we found no differences in cortisol levels among the various storage, drying, and sampling methods. However, the fineness of homogenized hair, sample weight, and extraction time affected absolute hair cortisol concentration. Although hair cortisol levels were stable over time, factors that may influence measurement results should be kept constant throughout a study.We modified and validated a methodology involving enzyme immunoassays to reliably measure the hair cortisol levels of captive chimpanzees.The results revealed that the fineness of homogenized hair, sample weight, and extraction time caused variations in absolute hair cortisol concentrations in chimpanzees. In contrast, storage, drying, and sampling from similar body parts did not affect the results. © 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Although much research has been conducted to understand personality development in humans, there remain substantial gaps in our understanding of these processes, particularly in relation to social influences. As such, investigations into personality development in our closest living relative, the chimpanzee, may provide useful insight. We evaluated the impact of early social exposure (to both humans and conspecifics) on personality development by studying 88 chimpanzees, including former pets and entertainers, living in accredited zoos and sanctuaries. During infancy, subjects varied in the amount of time spent with conspecifics compared with humans. Caregivers familiar with the chimpanzees rated them using a modified version of the Hominoid Personality Questionnaire (HPQ) and the ratings were found to have strong inter-rater reliability. We used the published structure of the HPQ to evaluate our results in relation to differences in early life experience. Chimpanzees who as infants spent less time with conspecifics were rated as lower in Extraversion later in life in comparison with chimpanzees who as infants spent more time with conspecifics. These results suggest that a broad range of social influences should be considered when evaluating the impact of early social environment on later personality expression. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death in captive chimpanzees and is often associated with myocardial fibrosis, which increases the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. In this case report, we present a 36-y-old male chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) diagnosed with frequent ventricular premature complexes (VPC). We placed a subcutaneous implantable loop recorder for continual ECG monitoring to assess his arrhythmias without the confounding effects of anesthetics. During his initial treatment with the antiarrhythmia medication amiodarone, he developed thrombocytopenia, and the drug was discontinued. After reviewing other potential therapies for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, we elected to try acupuncture and laser therapy in view of the positive results and the lack of adverse side effects reported in humans. We used 2 well-known cardiac acupuncture sites on the wrist, PC6 (pericardium 6) and HT7 (heart 7), and evaluated the results of the therapy by using the ECG recordings from the implantable loop recorder. Although periodic increases in the animal's excitement level introduced confounding variables that caused some variation in the data, acupuncture and laser therapy appeared to decrease the mean number of VPC/min in this chimpanzee.

ABSTRACT: Background: Assessing the range and territories of wild mammals traditionally requires years of data collection and often involves directly following individuals or using tracking devices. Indirect and non-invasive methods of monitoring wildlife have therefore emerged as attractive alternatives due to their ability to collect data at large spatiotemporal scales using standardized remote sensing technologies. Here, we investigate the use of two novel passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) systems used to capture long-distance sounds produced by the same species, wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), living in two different habitats: forest (Taï, Côte d'Ivoire) and savanna-woodland (Issa valley, Tanzania). Results: Using data collected independently at two field sites, we show that detections of chimpanzee sounds on autonomous recording devices were predicted by direct and indirect indices of chimpanzee presence. At Taï, the number of chimpanzee buttress drums detected on recording devices was positively influenced by the number of hours chimpanzees were seen ranging within a 1 km radius of a device. We observed a similar but weaker relationship within a 500 m radius. At Issa, the number of indirect chimpanzee observations positively predicted detections of chimpanzee loud calls on a recording device within a 500 m but not a 1 km radius. Moreover, using just seven months of PAM data, we could locate two known chimpanzee communities in Taï and observed monthly spatial variation in the center of activity for each group. Conclusions: Our work shows PAM is a promising new tool for gathering information about the ranging behavior and habitat use of chimpanzees and can be easily adopted for other large territorial mammals, provided they produce long-distance acoustic signals that can be captured by autonomous recording devices (e.g., lions and wolves). With this study we hope to promote more interdisciplinary research in PAM to help overcome its challenges, particularly in data processing, to improve its wider application. © 2016 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: In vivo vaccination studies are conventionally conducted in a single mouse strain with results, only reflecting responses to a single immunogenetic background. We decided to examine the immune response to an HIV transgene (gag, pol and nef fusion protein) in 3 strains of mice (CBA, C57BL/6 and BALB/c) to determine the spectrum of responses and in addition to determine whether the serotype of the adenoviral vector used (ChAd3 and ChAd63) impacted the outcome of response. Our results demonstrated that all three strains of mice responded to the transgene and that the magnitude of responses were different between the strains. The C57BL/6 strain showed the lowest range of responses compared to the other strains and, very few responses were seen to the same peptide pool in all three strains of mice. In CBA and BALB/c mice there were significant differences in IFNγ production dependent on the adenoviral vector used. Our results suggest that employing a single strain of mouse may underestimate the efficacy and efficiency of vaccine products. © 2016

ABSTRACT: An increase in faunivory is a consistent component of human evolutionary models. Animal matter is energy- and nutrient-dense and can provide macronutrients, minerals, and vitamins that are limited or absent in plant foods. For female humans and other omnivorous primates, faunivory may be of particular importance during the costly periods of pregnancy and early lactation. Yet, because animal prey is often monopolizable, access to fauna among group-living primates may be mediated by social factors such as rank. Wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) across Africa habitually consume insects and/or vertebrates. However, no published studies have examined patterns of female chimpanzee faunivory during pregnancy and early lactation relative to non-reproductive periods, or by females of different rank. In this study, we assessed the influence of reproductive state and dominance rank on the consumption of fauna (meat and insects) by female chimpanzees of Gombe National Park, Tanzania. Using observational data collected over 38 years, we tested (a) whether faunivory varied by reproductive state, and (b) if high-ranking females spent more time consuming fauna than lower-ranking females. In single-factor models, pregnant females consumed more meat than lactating and baseline (meaning not pregnant and not in early lactation) females, and high-ranking females consumed more meat than lower-ranking females. A two-factor analysis of a subset of well-sampled females identified an interaction between rank and reproductive state: lower-ranking females consumed more meat during pregnancy than lower-ranking lactating and baseline females did. High-ranking females did not significantly differ in meat consumption between reproductive states. We found no relationships between rank or reproductive state with insectivory. We conclude that, unlike insectivory, meat consumption by female chimpanzees is mediated by both reproductive state and social rank. We outline possible mechanisms for these patterns, relate our findings to meat-eating patterns in women from well-studied hunter-gatherer societies, and discuss potential avenues for future research. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Abnormal behaviors in captive animals are generally defined as behaviors that are atypical for the species and are often considered to be indicators of poor welfare. Although some abnormal behaviors have been empirically linked to conditions related to elevated stress and compromised welfare in primates, others have little or no evidence on which to base such a relationship. The objective of this study was to investigate a recent claim that abnormal behavior is endemic in the captive population by surveying a broad sample of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), while also considering factors associated with the origins of these behaviors. We surveyed animal care staff from 26 accredited zoos to assess the prevalence of abnormal behavior in a large sample of chimpanzees in the United States for which we had information on origin and rearing history. Our results demonstrated that 64% of this sample was reported to engage in some form of abnormal behavior in the past two years and 48% of chimpanzees engaged in abnormal behavior other than coprophagy. Logistic regression models were used to analyze the historical variables that best predicted the occurrence of all abnormal behavior, any abnormal behavior that was not coprophagy, and coprophagy. Rearing had opposing effects on the occurrence of coprophagy and the other abnormal behaviors such that motherreared individuals were more likely to perform coprophagy, whereas non-motherreared individuals were more likely to perform other abnormal behaviors. These results support the assertion that coprophagy may be classified separately when assessing abnormal behavior and the welfare of captive chimpanzees. This robust evaluation of the prevalence of abnormal behavior in our sample from the U.S. zoo population also demonstrates the importance of considering the contribution of historical variables to present behavior, in order to better understand the causes of these behaviors and any potential relationship to psychological wellbeing. © 2016 Jacobson et al.

ABSTRACT: The human neocortex differs from that of other great apes in several notable regards, including altered cell cycle, prolonged corticogenesis, and increased size [1-5]. Although these evolutionary changes most likely contributed to the origin of distinctively human cognitive faculties, their genetic basis remains almost entirely unknown. Highly conserved non-coding regions showing rapid sequence changes along the human lineage are candidate loci for the development and evolution of uniquely human traits. Several studies have identified human-accelerated enhancers [6-14], but none have linked an expression difference to a specific organismal trait. Here we report the discovery of a human-accelerated regulatory enhancer (HARE5) of FZD8, a receptor of the Wnt pathway implicated in brain development and size [15, 16]. Using transgenic mice, we demonstrate dramatic differences in human and chimpanzee HARE5 activity, with human HARE5 driving early and robust expression at the onset of corticogenesis. Similar to HARE5 activity, FZD8 is expressed in neural progenitors of the developing neocortex [17-19]. Chromosome conformation capture assays reveal that HARE5 physically and specifically contacts the core Fzd8 promoter in the mouse embryonic neocortex. To assess the phenotypic consequences of HARE5 activity, we generated transgenic mice in which Fzd8 expression is under control of orthologous enhancers (Pt-HARE5::Fzd8 and Hs-HARE5::Fzd8). In comparison to Pt-HARE5::Fzd8, Hs-HARE5::Fzd8 mice showed marked acceleration of neural progenitor cell cycle and increased brain size. Changes in HARE5 function unique to humans thus alter the cell-cycle dynamics of a critical population of stem cells during corticogenesis and may underlie some distinctive anatomical features of the human brain. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: A number of studies from the 1960s to 1990s assessed the symbolic competence of great apes and other animals. These studies provided varying forms of evidence that some species were capable of symbolically representing their worlds, both through productive symbol use and comprehension of symbolic stimuli. One such project at the Language Research Center involved training chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) to use lexigram symbols (geometric visual stimuli that represented objects, actions, locations, and individuals). Those studies now are more than 40 years old, and only a few of the apes involved in those studies are still alive. Three of these chimpanzees (and a fourth, control chimpanzee) were assessed across a 10-year period from 1999 to 2008 for their continued knowledge of lexigram symbols and, in the case of one chimpanzee, the continued ability to comprehend human speech. This article describes that longitudinal assessment and outlines the degree to which symbol competence was retained by these chimpanzees across that decade-long period. All chimpanzees showed retention of lexigram vocabularies, although there were differences in the number of words that were retained across the individuals. One chimpanzee also showed continual retention of human speech perception. These retained vocabularies largely consisted of food item names, but also names of inedible objects, locations, individuals, and some actions. Many of these retained words were for things that are not common in the daily lives of the chimpanzees and for things that are rarely requested by the chimpanzees. Thus, the early experiences of these chimpanzees in symbol-rich environments have produced long-lasting memories for symbol meaning, and those competencies have benefited research in a variety of topics in comparative cognition. © 2015 Beran, Heimbauer.

ABSTRACT: Background: To date, the human population census of proviruses of the Betaretrovirus-like human endogenous retroviral (HERV-K) (HML-2) family has been compiled from a limited number of complete genomes, making it certain that rare polymorphic loci are under-represented and are yet to be described. Results: Here we describe a suppression PCR-based method called genome-wide amplification of proviral sequences (GAPS) that selectively amplifies DNA fragments containing the termini of HERV-K(HML-2) proviral sequences and their flanking genomic sequences. We analysed the HERV-K(HML-2) proviral content of 101 unrelated humans, 4 common chimpanzees and three centre d'etude du polymorphisme humain (CEPH) pedigrees (44 individuals). The technique isolated HERV-K(HML-2) proviruses that had integrated in the genomes of the great apes throughout their divergence and included evolutionarily young elements still unfixed for presence/absence. Conclusions: By examining the HERV-K(HML-2) proviral content of 145 humans we detected a new insertionally polymorphic Type I HERV-K(HML-2) provirus. We also observed provirus versus solo long terminal repeat (LTR) polymorphism within humans at a previously unreported, but ancient, locus. Finally, we report two novel chimpanzee specific proviruses, one of which is dimorphic for a provirus versus solo LTR. Thus GAPS enables the isolation of uncharacterised HERV-K(HML-2) proviral sequences and provides a direct means to assess inter-individual genetic variation associated with HERV-K(HML-2) proviruses. © Macfarlane and Badge licensee BioMed Central.

ABSTRACT: Over two experiments, we investigated the ability of two adolescent and two adult chimpanzees to generalise a learnt, pictorial categorisation to increasingly degraded and abstract stimuli. In Experiment 2, we further assessed the ability of the adolescent chimpanzees to engage in open-ended categorisation of black-and-white line drawings. The current results confirmed and extended previous findings, showing that sub-adult chimpanzees outperform adult chimpanzees in the categorisation of pictorial stimuli, particularly when the stimuli are more degraded and abstract in nature. However, none of the four chimpanzees showed positive transfer of their category learning to a set of black-and-white line drawings, and neither of the adolescent chimpanzees evidenced reliable open-ended categorisation of the black-and-white line drawings. The latter findings suggest that both sub-adult and adult chimpanzees find it difficult to recognise black-and-white line drawings, and that open-ended categorisation of black-and-white line drawings is challenging for chimpanzees. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Even when hunting in groups is mutually beneficial, it is unclear howcommunal hunts are initiated. If it is costly to be the only hunter, individuals should be reluctant to hunt unless others already are. We used 70 years of data from three communities to examine how male chimpanzees ‘solve’ this apparent collective action problem. The ‘impact hunter’ hypothesis proposes that group hunts are sometimes catalysed by certain individuals that hunt more readily than others. In two communities (Kasekela and Kanyawara), we identified a total of five males that exhibited high hunt participation rates for their age, and whose presence at an encounter with red colobus monkeys increased group hunting probability. Critically, these impact hunters were observed to hunt first more often than expected by chance. We argue that by hunting first, these males dilute prey defences and create opportunities for previously reluctant participants. This by-product mutualism can explain variation in group hunting rates within and between social groups. Hunting rates declined after the death of impact hunter FG in Kasekela and after impact hunter MS stopped hunting frequently in Kanyawara. There were no impact hunters in the third, smaller community (Mitumba), where, unlike the others, hunting probability increased with the number of females present at an encounter with prey. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: With rising conversion of "natural" habitat to other land use such as agriculture, nonhuman primates are increasingly exploiting areas influenced by people and their activities. Despite the conservation importance of understanding the ways in which primates modify their behavior to human pressures, data are lacking, even for well-studied species. Using systematically collected data (fecal samples, feeding traces, and direct observations), we examined the diet and feeding strategies of an unhabituated chimpanzee community (Pan troglodytes verus) at Caiquene-Cadique in Guinea-Bissau that inhabit a forest-savanna-mangrove-agricultural mosaic. The chimpanzees experienced marked seasonal variations in the availability of plant foods, but maintained a high proportion of ripe fruit in the diet across months. Certain wild species were identified as important to this community including oil-palm (Elaeis guineensis) fruit and flower. Honey was frequently consumed but no other insects or vertebrates were confirmed to be eaten by this community. However, we provide indirect evidence of possible smashing and consumption of giant African snails (Achatina sp.) by chimpanzees at this site. Caiquene-Cadique chimpanzees were confirmed to feed on nine different agricultural crops, which represented 13.6% of all plant species consumed. Consumption of fruit and nonfruit crops was regular, but did not increase during periods of wild fruit scarcity. Crop consumption is an increasing and potentially problematic behavior, which can impact local people's tolerance toward wildlife. To maximize the potential success of any human-wildlife coexistence strategy (e.g., to reduce primate crop feeding), knowledge of primate behavior, as well as multifaceted social dimensions of interactions, is critical. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The importance of genes in regulating phenotypic variation of personality traits in humans and animals is becoming increasingly apparent in recent studies. Here we focus on variation in the vasopressin receptor gene 1a (Avpr1a) and oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) and their effects on social personality traits in chimpanzees. We combine newly available genetic data on Avpr1a and OXTR allelic variation of 62 captive chimpanzees with individual variation in personality, based on behavioral assessments. Our study provides support for the positive association of the Avpr1a promoter region, in particular the presence of DupB, and sociability in chimpanzees. This complements findings of previous studies on adolescent chimpanzees and studies that assessed personality using questionnaire data. In contrast, no significant associations were found for the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) ss1388116472 of the OXTR and any of the personality components. Most importantly, our study provides additional evidence for the regulatory function of the 5' promoter region of Avpr1a on social behavior and its evolutionary stable effect across species, including rodents, chimpanzees and humans. Although it is generally accepted that complex social behavior is regulated by a combination of genes, the environment and their interaction, our findings highlight the importance of candidate genes with large effects on behavioral variation. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: More than 75 percent of Tanzania's chimpanzees live at low densities on land outside national parks. Chimpanzees are one of the key conservation targets in the region and long-term monitoring of these populations is essential for assessing the overall status of ecosystem health and the success of implemented conservation strategies. We aimed to assess change in chimpanzee density within the Masito-Ugalla Ecosystem (MUE) by comparing results of re-walking the same line transects in 2007 and 2014. We further used published remote sensing data derived from Landsat satellites to assess forest cover change within a 5km buffer of these transects over that same period. We detected no statistically significant decline in chimpanzee density across the surveyed areas of MUE between 2007 and 2014, although the overall mean density of chimpanzees declined from 0.09individuals/km2 in 2007 to 0.05individuals/km2 in 2014. Whether this change is biologically meaningful cannot be determined due to small sample sizes and large, entirely overlapping error margins. It is therefore possible that the MUE chimpanzee population has been stable over this period and indeed in some areas (Issa Valley, Mkanga, Kamkulu) even showed an increase in chimpanzee density. Variation in chimpanzee habitat preference for ranging or nesting could explain variation in density at some of the survey sites between 2007 and 2014. We also found a relationship between increasing habitat loss and lower mean chimpanzee density. Future surveys will need to ensure a larger sample size, broader geographic effort, and random survey design, to more precisely determine trends in MUE chimpanzee density and population size over time.

ABSTRACT: Even before the discovery of hepatitis B virus (HBV), it was known that chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are susceptible to human hepatitis viruses. The chimpanzee is the only primate animal model for HBV infections. Much like HBV-infected human patients, chimpanzees can develop acute and chronic HBV infections and consequent hepatitis. Chimpanzees also develop a cellular immune response similar to that observed in humans. For these reasons, the chimpanzee has proven to be an invaluable model for investigations on HBV-driven disease pathogenesis and also the testing of novel antiviral therapies and prophylactic approaches. © 2015 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; all rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Anelloviridae family is comprised of small, non-enveloped viruses of various genome lengths, high sequence diversity, sharing the same genome organization. Infections and co-infections by different genotypes in humans are ubiquitous. Related viruses were described in number of mammalian hosts, but very limited data are available from the closest human relatives - great apes and non-human primates.Here we report the 100% prevalence determined by semi-nested PCR from fecal samples of 16 captive primate species. Only the Mandrillus sphinx, showed the prevalence only 8%. We describe three new species of gorillas[U+05F3] and four new species of chimpanzees[U+05F3] Betatorqueviruses and their co-infections in one individual. This study is also first report and analysis of nearly full length TTMV genomes infecting gorillas. Our attempts to sequence the complete genomes of anelloviruses from host feces invariably failed. Broader usage of blood /tissue material is necessary to understand the diversity and interspecies transmission of anelloviruses. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Humans often must coordinate co-occurring activities, and their flexible skills for doing so would seem to be uniquely powerful. In 2 studies, we compared 4-and 5-year-old children and one of humans' nearest relatives, chimpanzees, in their ability to focus and shift their attention when necessary. The results of Study 1 showed that 4-year-old children and chimpanzees were very similar in their ability to monitor two identical devices and to sequentially switch between the two to collect a reward, and that they were less successful at doing so than 5-year-old children. In Study 2, which required subjects to alternate between two different tasks, one of which had rewards continuously available whereas the other one only occasionally released rewards, no species differences were found. These results suggest that chimpanzees and human children share some fundamental attentional control skills, but that such abilities continue to develop during human ontogeny, resulting in the uniquely human capacity to succeed at complex multitasking. © 2015 American Psychological Association.

ABSTRACT: Background: Development of anti-poliovirus therapies to complement vaccination is an urgent priority. A number of antiviral drugs are in development. Recently we have developed human monoclonal antibodies that could be used for treatment of chronically infected individuals and emergency response to potential reappearance of polioviruses after eradication. Objective: The aim of this study was to characterize neutralizing activity of anti-poliovirus monoclonal antibody A12 against wild type, vaccine-derived, and drug-resistant poliovirus strains, evaluate in vivo pre- and post-exposure protective properties of the antibody against polioviruses of serotypes 1 and 2, and to determine whether it interferes with response to immunization with poliovirus vaccine. Study design: Immunogenicity studies were performed in CD1 mice. Poliovirus neutralizing titers were determined in poliovirus microneutralization assay. Poliovirus immunization-challenge experiments were performed in poliovirus-susceptible TgPVR21 mice. Results: We show that monoclonal antibody A12 effectively neutralizes in vitro a broad range of type 1 and type 2 wild and vaccine-derived polioviruses, provides effective pre- and post-exposure protection of TgPVR21 mice from challenge with a lethal dose of poliovirus. Treatment of animals with the antibody concurrent with IPV immunization does not prevent immune response to the vaccine. Conclusions: Anti-poliovirus antibody A12 effectively neutralizes a range of wild and VDPV strains and protectstransgenic mice susceptible to poliovirus against lethal challenge upon pre- and post-exposure administration. This suggests that the antibodies could be used in combination with drugs and/or vaccine to improve their efficacy and prevent emergence of resistant variants, and provides a justification for initiating their clinical evaluation. © 2015.

ABSTRACT: Pretend play is well studied in human children and is thought to be associated with symbolic thought and theory of mind. There are many descriptions of pretend play in chimpanzees and other apes but few systematic studies. This study was a systematic sampling of videotapes for instances of pretend play in chimpanzees who have acquired American Sign Language. There were two sampling methods. The first sample of 17 hours 36 minutes and 26 seconds of videotape contained five instances of pretend play. The second sample of 50 hours 16 minutes and 41 seconds contained 16 instances. The instances fell into four different categories; substitution, attribution of function, animation, and insubstantial situation attribution. © 2015 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Primates are at times used as performers in circuses, advertisements, films, and as pets. Most of these animals are socially isolated from their peers. They exhibit behavioral problems and lack important skills for living in a group environment. One of the main challenges primate rescue centers face is creating groups to socialize rescued individuals and promote the development of species-typical behaviors. We monitored a group of 15 chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) housed at Fundació Mona, a primate rescue and rehabilitation centre, for 8 yr. The aim of the study was to study the rehabilitation process and to establish variables that may influence the behavioral recovery of the chimpanzees. We used scan sampling to assess behavior and two welfare indices over the study period. Our results show that both desirable behaviors and welfare indices increased over time, while nondesirable behaviors decreased. We found no differences between pet and performer chimpanzees, but captive-born subjects recovered better than wild-born. We also established that chimpanzees that were younger at the onset of rehabilitation reached higher levels of social and behavioral competence than those that were older. We conclude that both social group housing and opportunities for the development of species-typical behaviors have a positive effect on the welfare and rehabilitation of performer and pet chimpanzees, but that their previous history influences rehabilitation. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: The human and chimpanzee X chromosomes are less divergent than expected based on autosomal divergence. We study incomplete lineage sorting patterns between humans, chimpanzees and gorillas to show that this low divergence can be entirely explained by megabase-sized regions comprising one-third of the X chromosome, where polymorphism in the human-chimpanzee ancestral species was severely reduced. We show that background selection can explain at most 10% of this reduction of diversity in the ancestor. Instead, we show that several strong selective sweeps in the ancestral species can explain it. We also report evidence of population specific sweeps in extant humans that overlap the regions of low diversity in the ancestral species. These regions further correspond to chromosomal sections shown to be devoid of Neanderthal introgression into modern humans. This suggests that the same X-linked regions that undergo selective sweeps are among the first to form reproductive barriers between diverging species. We hypothesize that meiotic drive is the underlying mechanism causing these two observations. © 2015 Dutheil et al.

ABSTRACT: Across taxa, males employ a variety of mating strategies, including sexual coercion and the provision, or trading, of resources. Biological market theory (BMT) predicts that trading of commodities for mating opportunities should exist only when males cannot monopolize access to females and/or obtain mating by force, in situations where power differentials between males are low; both coercion and trading have been reported for chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Here, we investigate whether the choice of strategy depends on the variation in male power differentials, using data from two wild communities of East African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii): the structurally despotic Sonso community (Budongo, Uganda) and the structurally egalitarian M-group (Mahale, Tanzania). We found evidence of sexual coercion by male Sonso chimpanzees, and of trading—of grooming for mating—by M-group males; females traded sex for neither meat nor protection from male aggression. Our results suggest that the despotism–egalitarian axis influences strategy choice: male chimpanzees appear to pursue sexual coercion when power differentials are large and trading when power differentials are small and coercion consequently ineffective. Our findings demonstrate that trading and coercive strategies are not restricted to particular chimpanzee subspecies; instead, their occurrence is consistent with BMT predictions. Our study raises interesting, and as yet unanswered, questions regarding female chimpanzees’ willingness to trade sex for grooming, if doing so represents a compromise to their fundamentally promiscuous mating strategy. It highlights the importance of within-species cross-group comparisons and the need for further study of the relationship between mating strategy and dominance steepness. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Background: Cyclospora is a protistan parasite that causes enteritis in several species of animals including humans. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of Cyclospora in captive non-human primates. Methods: A total of 119 faecal samples from Pan troglodytes, Macaca sylvanus, Cercopithecus cephus, Erythrocebus patas, Chlorocebus aethiops and Macaca fascicularis from a wildlife animal rescue center as well as from Macaca fascicularis from an experimental primate research center were tested for the presence of Cyclospora by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Results: Cyclospora was detected in three Pan troglodytes (13.6%) and nine (9.3%) Macaca fascicularis. Conclusions: The present study represents the first record of Cyclospora in captive primates in Europe, suggesting the presence of Cyclospora cayetanensis, which is transmissible to humans. © 2015 Marangi et al.

ABSTRACT: Many of humans’ most important social interactions rely on trust, including most notably among strangers. But little is known about the evolutionary roots of human trust. We presented chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) with a modified version of the human trust game—trust in reciprocity—in which subjects could opt either to obtain a small but safe reward on their own or else to send a larger reward to a partner and trust her to reciprocate a part of the reward that she could not access herself. In a series of three studies, we found strong evidence that in interacting with a conspecific, chimpanzees show spontaneous trust in a novel context; flexibly adjust their level of trust to the trustworthiness of their partner and develop patterns of trusting reciprocity over time. At least in some contexts then, trust in reciprocity is not unique to humans, but rather has its evolutionary roots in the social interactions of humans’ closest primate relatives. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: HIV-1-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes are important for HIV-1 replication control. F4/AS01 consists of F4 recombinant fusion protein (containing clade B Gag/p24, Pol/RT, Nef and Gag/p17) formulated in AS01 Adjuvant System, and was shown to induce F4-specific polyfunctional CD4+ T-cell responses in humans. While replication-incompetent recombinant HIV-1/SIV antigen-expressing human adenoviral vectors can elicit high-frequency antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell responses, their use is hampered by widespread pre-existing immunity to human serotypes. Non-human adenovirus serotypes associated with lower prevalence may offer an alternative strategy.We evaluated the immunogenicity of AdC7-GRN ('A'), a recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus type 7 vector expressing clade B Gag, RT and Nef, and F4/AS01 ('P'), when delivered intramuscularly in homologous (PP or AA) and heterologous (AAPP or PPAA) prime-boost regimens, in macaques and mice. Vaccine-induced HIV-1-antigen-specific T cells in peripheral blood (macaques), liver, spleen, and intestinal and genital mucosa (mice) were characterized by intracellular cytokine staining. Vaccine-specific IgG antibodies (macaques) were detected using ELISA. In macaques, only the heterologous prime-boost regimens induced polyfunctional, persistent and balanced CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses specific to each HIV-1 vaccine antigen. AdC7-GRN priming increased the polyfunctionality of F4/AS01-induced CD4+ T cells. Approximately 50% of AdC7-GRN-induced memory CD8+ T cells exhibited an effector-memory phenotype. HIV-1-specific antibodies were detected with each regimen. In mice, antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses were detected in the mucosal and systemic anatomical compartments assessed. When administered in heterologous prime-boost regimens, AdC7-GRN and F4/AS01 candidate vaccines acted complementarily in inducing potent and persistent peripheral blood HIV-1-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses and antibodies in macaques. Besides, adenoviral vector priming modulated the cytokine-expression profile of the protein-induced CD4+ T cells. Each regimen induced HIV-1-specific T-cell responses in systemic/local tissues in mice. This suggests that prime-boost regimens combining adjuvanted protein and low-seroprevalent chimpanzee adenoviral vectors represent an attractive vaccination strategy for clinical evaluation. © 2015 Lorin et al.

ABSTRACT: Monitoring of animal populations is essential for conservation management. Various techniques are available to assess spatiotemporal patterns of species distribution and abundance. Nest surveys are often used for monitoring great apes. Quickly developing technologies, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be used to complement these ground-based surveys, especially for covering large areas rapidly. Aerial surveys have been used successfully to detect the nests of orang-utans. It is unknown if such an approach is practical for African apes, which usually build their nests at lower heights, where they might be obscured by forest canopy. In this 2-month study, UAV-derived aerial imagery was used for two distinct purposes: testing the detectability of chimpanzee nests and identifying fruiting trees used by chimpanzees in Loango National Park (Gabon). Chimpanzee nest data were collected through two approaches: we located nests on the ground and then tried to detect them in UAV photos and vice versa. Ground surveys were conducted using line transects, reconnaissance trails, and opportunistic sampling during which we detected 116 individual nests in 28 nest groups. In complementary UAV images we detected 48% of the individual nests (68% of nest groups) in open coastal forests and 8% of individual nests (33% of nest groups) in closed canopy inland forests. The key factor for nest detectability in UAV imagery was canopy openness. Data on fruiting trees were collected from five line transects. In 122 UAV images 14 species of trees (N=433) were identified, alongside 37 tree species (N=205) in complementary ground surveys. Relative abundance of common tree species correlated between ground and UAV surveys. We conclude that UAVs have great potential as a rapid assessment tool for detecting chimpanzee presence in forest with open canopy and assessing fruit tree availability. UAVs may have limited applicability for nest detection in closed canopy forest. Am. J. Primatol. 77:1122-1134, 2015. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: One proposed benefit for the seemingly costly behaviour of food calling is the recruitment of social allies and mates by the signaller. In chimpanzees, food calls are only produced for approximately half of all feeding events. Therefore, we investigated the influence of social and ecological context on the probability of making a food call upon arriving to a food patch in a group of wild chimpanzees. First, we tested whether feeding events where food calls had been uttered did in fact attract more individuals to join the caller. Secondly, we examined the influence of two sources of audience effects: those who were physically present with the caller and those who were presumed nearby but out of sight, and thirdly the effect of various ecological factors. We found that when feeding on fruit species, events where food calls had been produced had a higher probability of group mates arriving, even whilst controlling for the effect of pant hoots. Furthermore, the probability of uttering a food call was motivated by social more than ecological context. Specifically, high-ranking males were more likely to make food calls when estrous females were nearby, while low-ranking males and females generally called more when more females were nearby, irrespective of their reproductive state. These effects were independent of the increase in food call probability when male callers were accompanied by more males. Our findings support the recruitment function of food calls and suggest that high-ranking males call to attract estrous females to food patches to obtain mating opportunities. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Male mating tactics vary extensively in many primates. Some variation occurs because adolescent males often are sexually active but cannot invest heavily in mating effort because of their limited ability to compete directly with adults and because they are still investing in growth; consequently, most of their mating attempts may be surreptitious and/or with females whose fecundity is low. Chimpanzees (Pan trogolodytes) have a complex mating system: most copulations occur between estrous females with full sexual swelling and multiple males in group settings where the potential for sperm competition is high, but males sometimes mate-guard females, and sometimes male–female pairs mate exclusively with each other while avoiding other males during “consortships.” Among other factors, dominance ranks, coalition formation, and variation in male–female association influence male mating and reproductive success. Mating effort increases from adolescence into prime adulthood. At Gombe and Mahale, adolescent males copulated more with nulliparous than with parous females, and mostly when females were unlikely to be ovulating, partly because of low adult male interest in nulliparous females and partly because of aggression from or avoidance of adult males. Adolescents thus had low probabilities of siring infants. However, adolescents are known to have gained some paternity at Gombe and in other populations, and their mating behavior deserves more study. I present data on mating by adolescent males in an unusually large chimpanzee community at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda. Adolescents at Ngogo also copulated more with nulliparous than parous females and mostly copulated outside of periovulatory periods. Also, they directed less aggression at estrous females than did adult males. However, they gained lower shares of copulations than reported for Gombe and Mahale, regardless of female parity, and received more aggression from adult males. These differences might partly reflect the influence of variation in the number of males per community on male mating tactics. © 2014, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: Restricting animals to different areas of their enclosure, for both brief and extended durations, is a key element of animal management practices. With such restrictions, available space decreases and the choices the animals can make are more limited, particularly in relation to social dynamics. When unfamiliar individuals are introduced to each other, group dynamics can be unpredictable and understanding space usage is important to facilitate successful introductions. We studied the behavioral, welfare-related responses of two groups of zoo-housed chimpanzees (n=22) as they were introduced to each other and experienced a variety of enclosure restrictions and group composition changes. Our analysis of available space while controlling for chimpanzee density, found that arousal-related scratching and yawning decreased as the number of enclosure areas (separate rooms) available increased, whereas only yawning decreased as the amount of available space (m2) increased. Allogrooming, rubbing, and regurgitation/reingestion rates remained constant as both the number of enclosure areas and amount of space changed. Enclosure space is important to zoo-housed chimpanzees, but during introductions, a decrease in arousal-related scratching indicates that the number of accessible areas is more important than the total amount of space available, suggesting that it is important to provide modular enclosures that provide choice and flexible usage, to minimize the welfare impact of short- and long-term husbandry needs. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Individual variability in delay of gratification (DG) is associated with a number of important outcomes in both non-human and human primates. Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), this study describes the relationship between probabilistic estimates of white matter tracts projecting from the caudate to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and DG abilities in a sample of 49 captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). After accounting for time between collection of DTI scans and DG measurement, age and sex, higher white matter connectivity between the caudate and right dorsal PFCwas found to be significantly associated with the acquisition (i.e. training phase) but not the maintenance of DG abilities. No other associations were found to be significant. The integrity of white matter connectivity between regions of the striatum and the PFC appear to be associated with inhibitory control in chimpanzees, with perturbations on this circuit potentially leading to a variety of maladaptive outcomes. Additionally, results have potential translational implications for understanding the pathophysiology of a number of psychiatric and clinical outcomes in humans. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Social tolerance is a core aspect of primate social relationships with implications for the evolution of cooperation, prosociality and social learning. We measured the social tolerance of bonobos in an experiment recently validated with chimpanzees to allow for a comparative assessment of group-level tolerance, and found that the bonobo group studied here exhibited lower social tolerance on average than chimpanzees in this paradigm. Furthermore, following the Relational Model of de Waal, we investigated whether bonobos responded to an increased potential for social conflict with tolerance, conflict avoidance or conflict escalation, and found that only behaviours indicative of conflict escalation differed across conditions. Taken together, these findings contribute to the current debate over the level of social tolerance of bonobos and lend support to the position that the social tolerance of bonobos may not be notably high compared with other primates. © 2015 S.

ABSTRACT: Malignant neoplasms arising from epithelial cells are called carcinomas. Such cancers are diagnosed in about one in three humans in ‘developed’ countries, with the most common sites affected being lung, breast, prostate, colon, ovary and pancreas. By contrast, carcinomas are said to be rare in captive chimpanzees, which share more than 99% protein sequence homology with humans (and possibly in other related ‘great apes’—bonobos, gorillas and orangutans). Simple ascertainment bias is an unlikely explanation, as these nonhuman hominids are recipients of excellent veterinary care in research facilities and zoos, and are typically subjected to necropsies when they die. In keeping with this notion, benign tumours and cancers that are less common in humans are well documented in this population. In this brief overview, we discuss other possible explanations for the reported rarity of carcinomas in our closest evolutionary cousins, including inadequacy of numbers surveyed, differences in life expectancy, diet, genetic susceptibility, immune responses or their microbiomes, and other potential environmental factors. We conclude that while relative carcinoma risk is a likely difference between humans and chimpanzees (and possibly other ‘great apes’), a more systematic survey of available data is required for validation of this claim. 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: On 10 April 2015, a Dutch TV crew was filming at the Royal Burgers Zoo in Arnhem, The Netherlands. It was the intention to film the chimpanzees in the enclosure from close-by and from above with the means of a drone. When the drone came a bit closer to the chimpanzees, a female individual made two sweeps with a branch that she held in one hand. The second one was successful and downed the drone. The use of the stick in this context was a unique action. It seemed deliberate given the decision to collect it and carry it to a place where the drone might be attacked. This episode adds to the indications that chimpanzees engage in forward planning of tool-use acts. © 2015, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Over the last decade, the metacognitive abilities of nonhuman primates and the developmental emergence of metacognition in children have become topics of increasing research interest. In the current study, the performance of three adult chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes; Experiment 1) and forty-four 3.5- and 5.5-year-old human children (Experiment 2) was assessed on a behavioral search paradigm designed to assess metacognition. Subjects either directly observed the baiting of a large reward into one cup among an array of four, or had the baiting occluded from their view. In half of the trials, subjects were also presented with an additional distinctive cup that was always visibly baited with a small reward. This cup allowed subjects the opportunity to escape from making a guess about the location of the bigger reward. All three chimpanzees and both age groups of children selected the escape cup more often when the baiting of the large reward was concealed, compared to when it was visible. This demonstrates that both species can selectively choose a guaranteed smaller reward when they do not know the location of a larger reward and provides insight into the development of metacognition. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees are susceptible to experimental infection by human deficiency virus (HIV)-1, but unlike humans, they exceptionally develop an immunodeficiency syndrome after HIV-1 inoculation. To explore the difference between human and chimpanzee, we analyzed the expression of 1547 genes of various functions in human or chimpanzee CD4+ lymphoblasts inoculated in vitro with HIV-1. We observed that, 1 day after HIV inoculation, fifty-eight genes were up-regulated in lymphoblasts of the three humans while their expression remained unchanged in lymphoblasts of the three chimpanzees. One gene is involved in adhesion of HIV (catenin-alpha), three in the immune response (semaphorin 4D, placental growth factor, IL-6), three in apoptosis (deleted in colorectal carcinoma, caspase 9 and FOXO1A). No difference between species was revealed for the expression of 373 genes related to glycosylation pathways. The in vitro human/chimpanzee comparison reveals new candidate genes up-regulated after inoculation with HIV-1 only in human lymphoblasts and which could be related to the higher sensitivity of human to HIV-induced AIDS. © 2015, Indian Virological Society.

ABSTRACT: Percussion makes a vital link between the activities of early human ancestors and other animals in tool-use and tool-making. Far more of the early human actions are preserved as archaeology, since the percussion was largely used for making hard tools of stone, rather than for direct access to food. Both primate tools and early hominin tools, however, offer a means to exploring variability in material culture, a strong focus of interest in recent primate studies. This paper charts such variability in the Acheulean, the longestlasting tool tradition, extant form about 1.7 to about 0.1 Ma, and well known for its characteristic handaxes. The paper concentrates on the African record, although the Acheulean was also known in Europe and Asia. It uses principal components and discriminant analysis to examine the measurements from 66 assemblages (whole toolkits), and from 18 sets of handaxes. Its review of evidence confirms that there is deep-seated pattern in the variation, with variability within a site complex often matching or exceeding that between sites far distant in space and time. Current techniques of study allow comparisons of handaxes far more easily than for other components, stressing a need to develop common practice in measurement and analysis. The data suggest, however, that a higher proportion of traits recurs widely in Acheulean toolkits than in the chimpanzee record. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: The ability to flexibly produce facial expressions and vocalizations has a strong impact on the way humans communicate, as it promotes more explicit and versatile forms of communication. Whereas facial expressions and vocalizations are unarguably closely linked in primates, the extent to which these expressions can be produced independently in nonhuman primates is unknown. The present work, thus, examined if chimpanzees produce the same types of facial expressions with and without accompanying vocalizations, as do humans. Forty-six chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) were video-recorded during spontaneous play with conspecifics at the Chimfunshi Wildlife Orphanage. ChimpFACS was applied, a standardized coding system to measure chimpanzee facial movements, based on FACS developed for humans. Data showed that the chimpanzees produced the same 14 configurations of open-mouth faces when laugh sounds were present and when they were absent. Chimpanzees, thus, produce these facial expressions flexibly without being morphologically constrained by the accompanying vocalizations. Furthermore, the data indicated that the facial expression plus vocalization and the facial expression alone were used differently in social play, i.e., when in physical contact with the playmates and when matching the playmates' open-mouth faces. These findings provide empirical evidence that chimpanzees produce distinctive facial expressions independently from a vocalization, and that their multimodal use affects communicative meaning, important traits for a more explicit and versatile way of communication. As it is still uncertain how human laugh faces evolved, the ChimpFACS data were also used to empirically examine the evolutionary relation between open-mouth faces with laugh sounds of chimpanzees and laugh faces of humans. The ChimpFACS results revealed that laugh faces of humans must have gradually emerged from laughing open-mouth faces of ancestral apes. This work examines the main evolutionary changes of laugh faces since the last common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans. © 2015 Davila-Ross et al.

ABSTRACT: Adenovirus vaccine vectors generated from new viral serotypes are routinely screened in pre-clinical laboratory animal models to identify the most immunogenic and efficacious candidates for further evaluation in clinical human and veterinary settings. Here, we show that studies in a laboratory species do not necessarily predict the hierarchy of vector performance in other mammals. In mice, after intramuscular immunization, HAdV-5 (Human adenovirus C) based vectors elicited cellular and humoral adaptive responses of higher magnitudes compared to the chimpanzee adenovirus vectors ChAdOx1 and AdC68 from species Human adenovirus E. After HAdV-5 vaccination, transgene specific IFN-γ+ CD8+ T cell responses reached peak magnitude later than after ChAdOx1 and AdC68 vaccination, and exhibited a slower contraction to a memory phenotype. In cattle, cellular and humoral immune responses were at least equivalent, if not higher, in magnitude after ChAdOx1 vaccination compared to HAdV-5. Though we have not tested protective efficacy in a disease model, these findings have important implications for the selection of candidate vectors for further evaluation. We propose that vaccines based on ChAdOx1 or other Human adenovirus E serotypes could be at least as immunogenic as current licensed bovine vaccines based on HAdV-5. © 2015 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: We are in the midst of an unprecedented environmental crisis. Landscapes have become complex social-ecological systems in which anthropogenic activities and biophysical factors interact across multiple scales. The integration of socio-economic development processes into conservation strategies as a means of sustainable resource management requires a deep understanding of the interactions between human activities and natural processes. Attempts to combine socio-economic and biological datasets for analyses, however, have frequently been hampered by spatial, temporal and methodological incompatibilities. In this study, we investigate the effects of human well-being on their environment in Liberia, West Africa. More specifically, we tested whether regions with improved community and household wealth, better education and access to market towns and fish protein, had higher levels of large mammal species richness and densities of the flagship species of West African forests, the chimpanzee (. Pan troglodytes verus). Controlling for human pressure, forest cover and cultural diversity, we found that high literacy rates and affordable fish protein correlated with high chimpanzee density. On the other hand, areas with better economic and infrastructure development coincided with reduced large mammal species richness compared to less developed areas. This indicates that wildlife depletion rates can only be understood by including economic and social constraints. These results are important for informing effective future conservation management strategies in Liberia and elsewhere in tropical Africa. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Predation can have major effects on vertebrate population dynamics, including predator–prey cycles that occur on multiple time scales when predators switch between preferred and alternative prey and changes in the abundance of preferred prey when the availability of alternative prey changes. Predation has been an important selective force in primate social evolution and may regulate some primate populations, but assessing its impact is often difficult. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) provide opportunities for direct collection of data on predation intensity by following habituated predators because they regularly prey on a variety of vertebrates, including other primates. Chimpanzees mostly hunt red colobus monkeys (Procolobus spp.) wherever they live in sympatry. Previous reports have documented heavy predation on red colobus by chimpanzees in the unusually large Ngogo community, in Kibale National Park, Uganda, and have shown an apparent decline in the local red colobus population. Here, we update information on predation at Ngogo, give further evidence of a red colobus population decline, and ask whether the chimpanzees have made more effort to hunt alternative prey in response. Data collected between 1995 and 2014 show that the rate of alternative prey hunts has increased significantly, while the rate of red colobus hunts has declined. Predation on red colobus peaked in 2002; other prey have since accounted for significantly higher proportions of hunts and prey captures. The overall hunting rate has not changed significantly, but per capita meat availability has decreased because hunts of alternative prey lead to fewer captures than hunts of red colobus. The likelihood that the chimpanzees hunt red colobus on encounter has not changed significantly. In contrast, the likelihood of hunting on encounter has increased (redtail monkeys, Cercopithecus ascanius; gray-cheeked mangabeys, Lophocebus albigena) or remained stable (guerezas, Colobus guereza) for other primates that are major alternative prey species. Encounter rates have not changed for redtails and mangabeys, but the guereza encounter rate has decreased. These results imply that the red colobus population is not recovering and raise the possibility that the chimpanzees are having a negative impact on the guereza population. Chimpanzees are not obligate carnivores, but this may make them prone to cause such impacts because their own populations are probably not limited by those of their prey. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: Humans exhibit framing effects when making choices, appraising decisions involving losses differently from those involving gains. To directly test for the evolutionary origin of this bias, we examined decision-making in humans' closest living relatives: bonobos (Pan paniscus) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). We presented the largest sample of non-humans to date (n = 40) with a simple task requiring minimal experience. Apes made choices between a 'framed' option that provided preferred food, and an alternative option that provided a constant amount of intermediately preferred food. In the gain condition, apes experienced a positive 'gain' event in which the framed option was initially presented as one piece of food but sometimes was augmented to two. In the loss condition, apes experienced a negative 'loss' event in which they initially saw two pieces but sometimes received only one. Both conditions provided equal pay-offs, but apes chose the framed option more often in the positive 'gain' frame. Moreover, male apes were more susceptible to framing than were females. These results suggest that some human economic biases are shared through common descent with other apes and highlight the importance of comparative work in understanding the origins of individual differences in human choice. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Infection of humans and chimpanzees with Hepatitis C virus (HCV) results in either the resolution of the acute infection or its progression to a persistent infection associated with chronic liver disease. In cohorts of human patients, resolution of HCV infection has been associated with homozygosity for both C1+HLA-C and its cognate inhibitory receptor, KIR2DL3. Compared here are the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I factors of chimpanzees who resolve, or resist, HCV infection with those chimpanzees who progress to chronic infection. Analysis of Pt-KIR gene content diversity associated two of the 12 Pt-KIR with clinical outcome. Activating Pt-KIR3DS2 and inhibitory Pt-KIR2DL9 are strong receptors specific for the C2 epitope. They are encoded by neighboring genes within the Pt-KIR locus that are in strong linkage disequilibrium. HCV-infected chimpanzees with KIR genotypes containing Pt-KIR3DS2 and KIR2DL9 are significantly more likely to progress to chronic infection than infected chimpanzees lacking the genes (p = 0.0123 and p = 0.0045, respectively), whereas human HLA-B allotypes having the C1 epitope are unusual, such allotypes comprise about one quarter of the chimpanzee Patr-B allotypes. Homozygous C1+Patr-B are enriched in chimpanzees with chronic HCV infection, and the compound genotype of homozygous C1+Patr-B combined with either Pt-KIR3DS2 or Pt-KIR2DL9 is more strongly associated with disease progression than either factor alone (p = 0.0031 and p = 0.0013, respectively). Thus, despite similarities suggesting a common basis in disease resistance, there are substantial differences in the KIR and MHC class I correlations observed for HCV-infected humans and chimpanzees, consistent with the divergence of their KIR and MHC class I systems. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) remains to be a major global health problem despite many decades of parenteral use of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine. Developing safe and effective respiratory mucosal TB vaccines represents a unique challenge. Over the past decade or so, the human serotype 5 adenovirus (AdHu5)-based TB vaccine has emerged as one of the most promising candidates based on a plethora of preclinical and early clinical studies. However, anti-AdHu5 immunity widely present in the lung of humans poses a serious gap and limitation to its real-world applications. In this study we have developed a novel chimpanzee adenovirus 68 (AdCh68)-vectored TB vaccine amenable to the respiratory route of vaccination. We have evaluated AdCh68-based TB vaccine for its safety, T-cell immunogenicity, and protective efficacy in relevant animal models of human pulmonary TB with or without parenteral BCG priming. We have also compared AdCh68-based TB vaccine with its AdHu5 counterpart in both naive animals and those with preexisting anti-AdHu5 immunity in the lung. We provide compelling evidence that AdCh68-based TB vaccine is not only safe when delivered to the respiratory tract but, importantly, is also superior to its AdHu5 counterpart in induction of T-cell responses and immune protection, and limiting lung immunopathology in the presence of preexisting anti-AdHu5 immunity in the lung. Our findings thus suggest AdCh68-based TB vaccine to be an ideal candidate for respiratory mucosal immunization, endorsing its further clinical development in humans.

ABSTRACT: The extent to which primates can flexibly adjust the production of gestural communication according to the presence and visual attention of the audience provides key insights into the social cognition underpinning gestural communication, such as an understanding of third party relationships. Gestures given in a mating context provide an ideal area for examining this flexibility, as frequently the interests of a male signaller, a female recipient and a rival male bystander conflict. Dominant chimpanzee males seek to monopolize matings, but subordinate males may use gestural communication flexibly to achieve matings despite their low rank. Here we show that the production of mating gestures in wild male East African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweunfurthii) was influenced by a conflict of interest with females, which in turn was influenced by the presence and visual attention of rival males. When the conflict of interest was low (the rival male was present and looking away), chimpanzees used visual/tactile gestures over auditory gestures. However, when the conflict of interest was high (the rival male was absent, or was present and looking at the signaller) chimpanzees used auditory gestures over visual/tactile gestures. Further, the production of mating gestures was more common when the number of oestrous and non-oestrus females in the party increased, when the female was visually perceptive and when there was no wind. Females played an active role in mating behaviour, approaching for copulations more often when the number of oestrus females in the party increased and when the rival male was absent, or was present and looking away. Examining how social and ecological factors affect mating tactics in primates may thus contribute to understanding the previously unexplained reproductive success of subordinate male chimpanzees. © 2015 Roberts, Roberts This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.

ABSTRACT: Recovering evidence of past human activities enables us to recreate behaviour where direct observations are missing. Here,we apply archaeological methods to further investigate cultural transmission processes in percussive tool use among neighbouring chimpanzee communities in the Taï National Park, Côte d’Ivoire, West Africa. Differences in the selection of nut-cracking tools between neighbouring groups are maintained over time, despite frequent female transfer, which leads to persistent cultural diversity between chimpanzee groups. Through the recovery of used tools in the suggested natal territory of immigrants, we have been able to reconstruct the tool material selection of females prior to migration. In combination with direct observations of tool selection of local residents and immigrants after migration,we uncovered temporal changes in tool selection for immigrating females. After controlling for ecological differences between territories of immigrants and residents our data suggest that immigrants abandoned their previous tool preference and adopted the pattern of their new community, despite previous personal proficiency of the same foraging task. Our study adds to the growing body of knowledge on the importance of conformist tendencies in animals. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: A vital step in the evolution of language is likely to have been when signalers explicitly intended to direct recipients’ attention to external objects with the use of referential signals. Although animal signals can direct the attention of others to external events, such as in monkey predator alarm calls, there is little evidence that this is the result of an intention to inform the recipient. Two recent studies, however, indicate that the production of chimpanzee quiet alarm calls, given to snakes, complies with some standard behavioral markers of intentional signaling, such as gaze alternation. But it is currently unknown whether the calls alone direct receivers’ attention to the threat. To address this, we carried out a playback experiment with free-ranging chimpanzees in Budongo Forest, Uganda, using a within-subjects design. From a hidden speaker, we broadcast either quiet alarm ‘hoos’ (‘alert hoos’) or acoustically distinguishable hoos produced while resting (‘rest hoos’) and found a significant increase in search behavior after ‘alert’ compared with ‘rest’ hoos, with subjects monitoring either the call provider or the area near the call provider. In sum, chimpanzee ‘alert hoos’ represent a plausible case of an intentionally produced animal vocalization (other studies) that refers recipients to signalers and/or to an external event (this study). © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Individual differences in maternal behavior toward, and investment in, offspring can have lasting consequences, particularly among primate taxa characterized by prolonged periods of development over which mothers can exert substantial influence. Given the role of the neuroendocrine system in the expression of behavior, researchers are increasingly interested in understanding the hormonal correlates of maternal behavior. Here, we examined the relationship between maternal behavior and physiological stress levels, as quantified by fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) concentrations, in lactating chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, at Gombe National Park, Tanzania. After accounting for temporal variation in FGM concentrations, we found that mothers interacted socially (groomed and played) with and nursed their infants more on days when FGM concentrations were elevated compared to days when FGM concentrations were within the range expected given the time of year. However, the proportion of time mothers and infants spent in contact did not differ based on FGM concentrations. These results generally agree with the suggestion that elevated GC concentrations are related to maternal motivation and responsivity to infant cues and are the first evidence of a hormonal correlate of maternal behavior in a wild great ape. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: The transition to a cooked diet represents an important shift in human ecology and evolution.Cooking requires a set of sophisticated cognitive abilities, including causal reasoning, self-control and anticipatory planning. Do humans uniquely possess the cognitive capacities needed to cook food? We address whetherone of humans’ closest relatives, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), possess the domain-general cognitive skills needed to cook. Across nine studies, we show that chimpanzees: (i) prefer cooked foods; (ii) comprehend the transformation of raw food that occurs when cooking, and generalize this causal understanding to new contexts; (iii) will pay temporal costs to acquire cooked foods; (iv) are willing to actively give up possession of raw foods in order to transform them; and (v) can transport raw food as well as save their raw food in anticipation of future opportunities to cook. Together, our results indicate that several of the fundamental psychological abilities necessary to engage in cooking may have been shared with the last common ancestor of apes and humans, predating the control of fire. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Comparative genomics studies in primates are restricted due to our limited access to samples. In order to gain better insight into the genetic processes that underlie variation in complex phenotypes in primates, we must have access to faithful model systems for a wide range of cell types. To facilitate this, we generated a panel of 7 fully characterized chimpanzee induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines derived from healthy donors. To demonstrate the utility of comparative iPSC panels, we collected RNA-sequencing and DNA methylation data from the chimpanzee iPSCs and the corresponding fibroblast lines, as well as from 7 human iPSCs and their source lines, which encompass multiple populations and cell types. We observe much less withinspecies variation in iPSCs than in somatic cells, indicating the reprogramming process erases many inter-individual differences. The low within-species regulatory variation in iPSCs allowed us to identify many novel inter-species regulatory differences of small magnitude. © Gallego Romero et al.

ABSTRACT: A variety of lines of evidence support the idea that neutral evolutionary processes (genetic drift, mutation) have been important in generating cranial differences between Neandertals and modern humans. But how do Neandertals and modern humans compare with other species? And how do these comparisons illuminate the evolutionary processes underlying cranial diversification? To address these questions, we used 27 standard cranial measurements collected on 2524 recent modern humans, 20 Neandertals and 237 common chimpanzees to estimate split times between Neandertals and modern humans, and between Pan troglodytes verus and two other subspecies of common chimpanzee. Consistent with a neutral divergence, the Neandertal versus modern human split-time estimates based on cranial measurements are similar to those based on DNA sequences. By contrast, the common chimpanzee cranial estimates are much lower than DNA-sequence estimates. Apparently, cranial evolution has been unconstrained in Neandertals and modern humans compared with common chimpanzees. Based on these and additional analyses, it appears that cranial differentiation in common chimpanzees has been restricted by stabilizing natural selection. Alternatively, this restriction could be due to genetic and/or developmental constraints on the amount of within-group variance (relative to effective population size) available for genetic drift to act on. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Human walking entails coordinated out-of-phase axial rotations of the thorax and pelvis. A long-held assumption is that this ability relies on adaptations for trunk flexibility present in humans, but not in chimpanzees, other great apes, or australopithecines. Here we use threedimensional kinematic analyses to show that, contrary to current thinking, chimpanzees walking bipedally rotate their lumbar and thoracic regions in a manner similar to humans. This occurs despite differences in the magnitude of trunk motion, and despite morphological Human walking entails coordinated out-of-phase axial rotations of the thorax and pelvis. A long-held assumption is that this ability relies on adaptations for trunk flexibility present in humans, but not in chimpanzees, other great apes, or australopithecines. Here we use threedimensional kinematic analyses to show that, contrary to current thinking, chimpanzees walking bipedally rotate their lumbar and thoracic regions in a manner similar to humans. This occurs despite differences in the magnitude of trunk motion, and despite morphological differences in truncal 'rigidity' between species. These results suggest that, like humans and chimpanzees, early hominins walked with upper body rotations that countered pelvic rotation. We demonstrate that even if early hominins walked with pelvic rotations 50% larger than humans, they may have accrued the energetic and mechanical benefits of out-of-phase thoracic rotations. This would have allowed early hominins to reduce work and locomotor cost, improving walking efficiency early in hominin evolution. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

ABSTRACT: All over the world, humans (Homo sapiens) display resource-sharing behavior, and common patterns of sharing seem to exist across cultures. Humans are not the only primates to share, and observations from the wild have long documented food sharing behavior in our closest phylogenetic relatives, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (Pan paniscus). However, few controlled studies have been made in which groups of Pan are introduced to food items that may be shared or monopolized by a first food possessor, and very few studies have examined what happens to these sharing patterns if the food in question is a highly attractive, monopolizable food source. The one study to date to include food quality as the independent variable used different types of food as high- and low-value items, making differences in food divisibility and size potentially confounding factors. It was the aim of the present study to examine the sharing behavior of groups of captive chimpanzees and bonobos when introducing the same type of food (branches) manipulated to be of 2 different degrees of desirability (with or without syrup). Results showed that the large majority of food transfers in both species came about as sharing in which group members were allowed to cofeed or remove food from the stock of the food possessor, and the introduction of high-value food resulted in more sharing, not less. Food sharing behavior differed between species in that chimpanzees displayed significantly more begging behavior than bonobos. Bonobos, instead, engaged in sexual invitations, which the chimpanzees never did. © 2015 American Psychological Association.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees at numerous study sites are known to prey on army ants by using a single wand to dip into the ant nest or column. However, in Goualougo (Republic of Congo) in Central Africa, chimpanzees use a different technique, use of a woody sapling to perforate the ant nest, then use of a herb stem as dipping tool to harvest the army ants. Use of a tool set has also been found in Guinea, West Africa: at Seringbara in the Nimba Mountains and at nearby Bossou. There are, however, no reports for chimpanzees in East Africa. We observed use of such a tool set in Kalinzu, Uganda, for the first time by Eastern chimpanzees. This behavior was observed among one group of chimpanzees at Kalinzu (S-group) but not among the adjacent group (M-group) with partly overlapping ranging areas despite the fact that the latter group has been under intensive observation since 1997. In Uganda, ant-dipping has not been observed in the northern three sites (Budongo, Semliki, and Kibale) but has been observed or seems to occur in the southern sites (Kalinzu and Bwindi), which suggests that ant-dipping was invented by and spread from the southern region after the northern and southern forest blocks became separated. Use of a tool-set by only one group at Kalinzu further suggests that this behavior was recently invented and has not yet spread to the other group via migrating females. © 2015, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: Humans have a strong proclivity for structuring and patterning stimuli: Whether in space or time, we tend to mentally order stimuli in our environment and organize them into units with specific types of relationships. A crucial prerequisite for such organization is the cognitive ability to discern and process regularities among multiple stimuli. To investigate the evolutionary roots of this cognitive capacity, we tested chimpanzees—which, along with bonobos, are our closest living relatives—for simple, variable distance dependency processing in visual patterns. We trained chimpanzees to identify pairs of shapes either linked by an arbitrary learned association (arbitrary associative dependency) or a shared feature (same shape, feature-based dependency), and to recognize strings where items related to either of these ways occupied the first (leftmost) and the last (rightmost) item of the stimulus. We then probed the degree to which subjects generalized this pattern to new colors, shapes, and numbers of interspersed items. We found that chimpanzees can learn and generalize both types of dependency rules, indicating that the ability to encode both feature-based and arbitrary associative regularities over variable distances in the visual domain is not a human prerogative. Our results strongly suggest that these core components of human structural processing were already present in our last common ancestor with chimpanzees. © 2015, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: One standout feature of human language is our ability to reference external objects and events with socially learned symbols, or words. Exploring the phylogenetic origins of this capacity is therefore key to a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of language. While non-human primates can produce vocalizations that refer to external objects in the environment, it is generally accepted that their acoustic structure is fixed and a product of arousal states [1]. Indeed, it has been argued that the apparent lack of flexible control over the structure of referential vocalizations represents a key discontinuity with language [2]. Here, we demonstrate vocal learning in the acoustic structure of referential food grunts in captive chimpanzees. We found that, following the integration of two groups of adult chimpanzees, the acoustic structure of referential food grunts produced for a specific food converged over 3 years. Acoustic convergence arose independently of preference for the food, and social network analyses indicated this only occurred after strong affiliative relationships were established between the original subgroups. We argue that these data represent the first evidence of non-human animals actively modifying and socially learning the structure of a meaningful referential vocalization from conspecifics. Our findings indicate that primate referential call structure is not simply determined by arousal and that the socially learned nature of referential words in humans likely has ancient evolutionary origins. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The assumption that population density restricts the foraging efficiency of individuals in the population via increased competition for resources underpins socioecological models of female social relationships in primates. We examined this assumption by comparing quantitative measures of foraging efficiency in two communities of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) that inhabit the same contiguous forest in Kibale National Park, Uganda, but differ substantially in size and density. To calculate net caloric gain rates (our measure of foraging efficiency) we obtained data directly from focal follows of individual chimpanzees on 1) residency time in a feeding patch, 2) feeding rate in the patch, 3) the nutrient content of the items fed upon, and 4) the distance walked between feeding patches. We collected foraging efficiency data over 1059 h at Ngogo and 961 h at Kanyawara. We found that individuals in the high-density community (Ngogo) had higher mean foraging efficiency values than those in the low-density community (Kanyawara), and that foraging efficiency varied less over time at Ngogo when assessed over the time scales of individual feeding/traveling bouts and of daily net caloric gain rates. Fluctuation in net caloric gain rates on a monthly time scale was greater at Ngogo than at Kanyawara, but this was likely due to the nutritional effects of a mast fruiting event by one of the most important species at the site. These findings suggest that high population density at Ngogo has not precluded high foraging efficiency. The classic view of increased population density inevitably increasing feeding competition and reducing foraging efficiency likely underemphasizes the ability of primates, especially those in rich habitats, to maximize caloric intake. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: Adenoviruses have been shown to be both immunogenic and efficient at presenting HIV proteins but recent trials have suggested that they may play a role in increasing the risk of HIV acquisition. This risk may be associated with the presence of pre-existing immunity to the viral vectors. Chimpanzee adenoviruses (chAd) have low seroprevalence in human populations and so reduce this risk. ChAd3 and chAd63 were used to deliver an HIV gag, pol and nef transgene. ELISpot analysis of T cell responses in mice showed that both chAd vectors were able to induce an immune response to Gag and Pol peptides but that only the chAd3 vector induced responses to Nef peptides. Although the route of injection did not influence the magnitude of immune responses to either chAd vector, the dose of vector did. Taken together these results demonstrate that chimpanzee adenoviruses are suitable vector candidates for the delivery of HIV proteins and could be used for an HIV vaccine and furthermore the chAd3 vector produces a broader response to the HIV transgene. © 2015 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Several species besides humans respond negatively to inequity (i.e. receiving a less preferred outcome as compared to a social partner). Among primates, the taxon for which inequity responses have been most comprehensively studied, there are large individual differences in responses that have, thus far, not been well explained by demographic features such as sex, rank and age. Recent evidence shows that individuals' personalities are important in explaining differences in behavioural outcomes in other contexts. Thus, in the current study, we explored whether personality was associated with chimpanzees' responses to both inequity and contrast (i.e. receiving less than anticipated). Chimpanzees were paired with multiple members of their social groups. These pairs alternated trading a token to receive food rewards that either differed from what their partner received (inequity condition) or from what was initially offered (contrast condition) and we compared their responses to a control in which both subjects were offered and received the same reward for trading the token. We predicted that both personality and the quality and length of the pairs' relationship would influence subjects' reactions to unequal outcomes, as measured by their refusal to exchange tokens. The quality of subjects' relationships, based on a weighted average of grooming, contact and proximity, did not correlate with refusals to exchange, whereas pairs that had lived together longer were less likely to refuse in the contrast condition than were pairs that had lived together for less time. Considering personality, some of the dimensions influenced responses to both inequity and contrast similarly, but the more 'social' personality dimensions ('extraversion' and 'agreeableness') were more strongly correlated with sensitivity to inequity. These results highlight the importance of considering individual differences, including personality, when evaluating responses in cognitive and behavioural tests. © 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: Cross-species infection among humans, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and baboons (Papio spp.) is potentially a significant public health issue in Africa, and of concern in the conservation of P. troglodytes. However, to date, no statistical comparisons have been made between the prevalence, richness and composition of parasite communities in sympatric populations of baboons and P. troglodytes. We compared parasite communities in sympatric P. troglodytes and Papio papio living in a wilderness site, in the Republic of Senegal, West Africa. We asked whether, in the absence of humans, there are significant differences between these hosts in their interactions with gastrointestinal parasites. We tested whether host, location, or time of collection accounted for variation in prevalence, richness and community composition, and compared prevalence across six studies. We concluded that, despite being closely related, there are significant differences between these two hosts with respect to their parasite communities. At our study site, prevalence of Balantidium, Trichuris and Watsonius was higher in P. papio. Papio papio harboured more parasites per host, and we found evidence of a positive association between Trichuris and Balantidium in P. troglodytes but not P. papio.

ABSTRACT: Hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) are increasingly recognized as an integrated measure of the systemic cortisol secretion. Yet, we still know very little about confounding effects on HCC in animals. The present study therefore used hair from semi-wild and zoo living chimpanzees to investigate (1) intra-individual variability of HCC (body-region effect), and (2) the stability of HCC along the hair shaft (traditionally called the washout effect). Our results indicate that absolute HCC varied substantially between certain body regions, but a factor analysis revealed that these HCC differences were mainly attributable to one common source of variance. Thus, hair from all body regions provides similar biological signals and can be mixed, albeit at the cost of a lower signal-to-noise ratio. With regard to potential underlying mechanisms, we studied skin blood flow, as observed through thermal images from one chimpanzee. We found the general HCC pattern was reflected in differences in surface body temperature observed in this individual in three out of four body regions. In a separate set of samples, we found first evidence to suggest that the systematic cortisol decrease along the hair shaft, as observed in humans, is also present in chimpanzee hair. The effect was more pronounced in semi-wild than in zoo chimpanzees presumably due to more exposure to ambient weather conditions. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Knowledge of chimpanzee development has played an essential role in our understanding of the evolution of human ontogeny. However, recent studies of wild ape dentitions have cast doubt on the use of developmental standards derived from captive individuals. Others have called into question the use of deceased wild individuals to infer normative development. We conducted a high resolution photographic study of living known-age subadults in the Kanyawara community (Kibale National Park, Uganda) to generate a comprehensive three year record of dental eruption (including tooth emergence ages). These non-invasive data allow comparisons of captive and wild chimpanzees, establish accurate developmental standards for relatively healthy wild individuals, and facilitate direct assessments of primate-wide associations between dental development and life history. Emergence ages in the Kanyawara chimpanzees are very similar to living Gombe chimpanzees, and are broadly comparable to deceased Taï Forest chimpanzees. Early-emerging teeth such as the deciduous dentition and first molar (M1) appear during a time of maternal dependence, and are almost indistinguishable from captive chimpanzee emergence ages, while later forming teeth in the Kanyawara population emerge in the latter half of captive age ranges or beyond. Five juveniles whose lower M1s emerged by or before 3.3 years of age continued to nurse for a year or more beyond M1 emergence, and their mothers showed considerable variation in reproductive rates. The third molars of two adolescent females emerged several months to several years prior to the birth of their first offspring. Given that broad primate-wide relationships between molar emergence and life history do not necessarily hold within this population of chimpanzees, particularly for variables that are reported to be coincident with molar emergence, we suggest that further study is required in order to predict life history variables in hominins or hominoids. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Despite the spread of road infrastructures throughout Africa to support regional development, industry, and tourism, few studies have examined how wild animals adapt their behavior and ecology in road-forest ecotones. Indeed, while numerous studies have demonstrated chimpanzee adaptability in anthropogenic landscapes, none have examined the effects of asphalted highways on wild chimpanzee behaviors. In a 29-month survey, we assessed the dangers posed by an asphalted road crossing the Sebitoli area of Kibale National Park (Uganda). We analyzed 122 individual chimpanzee crossings. Although the asphalted road represents a substantial threat to crossing animals (89 motorized vehicles per hour use this road and individuals of six different primate species were killed in 1 year), chimpanzees took into account this risk. More than 90% of the individuals looked right and left before and while crossing. Chimpanzees crossed in small subgroups (average 2.7 subgroups of 2.1 individuals per crossing event). Whole parties crossed more rapidly when chimpanzees were more numerous in the crossing groups. The individuals most vulnerable to the dangers of road crossing (females with dependents, immature, and severely injured individuals) crossed less frequently compared with non-vulnerable individuals (lone and healthy adolescents and adults). Moreover, healthy adult males, who were the most frequent crossing individuals, led progressions more frequently when crossing the road than when climbing or descending feeding trees. Almost 20% of the individuals that crossed paid attention to conspecifics by checking on them or waiting for them while crossing. These observations are relevant for our understanding of adaptive behavior among chimpanzees in human-impacted habitats. Further investigations are needed to better evaluate the effects of busy roads on adolescent female dispersal and on their use of territories. Mitigation measures (e.g., bridges, underpasses, reduced speed limits, speed-bumps, signposts, or police controls) should be established in this area. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: This research traces the long-term effects on health, well-being, personality, and behavior of adult chimpanzees as a function of their attachment to a primary human caregiver assessed when they were 1 year of age. Of the 46 chimpanzees assessed at 1 year of age, we assessed health in 43 individuals, adult behavior in 20 individuals, and adult well-being and personality in 21 individuals. Attachment disorganization was found to be a significant predictor of stereotypic rocking in adult chimpanzees, F(1, 18) = 7.50, p = .013. For those subjects (N = 24) with a full 20 years (birth through age 20 years) of health data available, both rearing experience and disorganized attachment were significant predictors of upper respiratory infection frequency, F(2, 21) = 8.86, p = .002. Chimpanzees with disorganized attachment exhibited average subjective well-being as adults, whereas chimpanzees with organized strategies exhibited higher than average subjective well-being as adults. These results support the findings of human attachment research and are in line with attachment-based predictions for chimpanzees, such that the consequences of an early history of disorganized attachment may be adverse and long lasting. © 2015 American Psychological Association.

ABSTRACT: The common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) is a facultative biped and our closest living relative. As such, the musculoskeletal anatomies of their pelvis and hind limbs have long provided a comparative context for studies of human and fossil hominin locomotion. Yet, how the chimpanzee pelvis and hind limb actually move during bipedal walking is still not well defined. Here, we describe the three-dimensional (3-D) kinematics of the pelvis, hip, knee and ankle during bipedal walking and compare those values to humans walking at the same dimensionless and dimensional velocities. The stride-to-stride and intraspecific variations in 3-D kinematics were calculated using the adjusted coefficient of multiple correlation. Our results indicate that humans walk with a more stable pelvis than chimpanzees, especially in tilt and rotation. Both species exhibit similar magnitudes of pelvis list, but with segment motion that is opposite in phasing. In the hind limb, chimpanzees walk with a more flexed and abducted limb posture, and substantially exceed humans in the magnitude of hip rotation during a stride. The average stride-to-stride variation in joint and segment motion was greater in chimpanzees than humans, while the intraspecific variation was similar on average. These results demonstrate substantial differences between human and chimpanzee bipedal walking, in both the sagittal and non-sagittal planes. These new 3-D kinematic data are fundamental to a comprehensive understanding of the mechanics, energetics and control of chimpanzee bipedalism. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Background: Blood-sucking lice in the genera Pediculus and Pthirus are obligate ectoparasites of great apes. Unlike most bilateral animals, which have 37 mitochondrial (mt) genes on a single circular chromosome, the sucking lice of humans have extensively fragmented mt genomes. The head louse, Pediculus capitis, and the body louse, Pe. humanus, have their 37 mt genes on 20 minichromosomes. The pubic louse, Pthirus pubis, has its 34 mt genes known on 14 minichromosomes. To understand the process of mt genome fragmentation in the sucking lice of great apes, we sequenced the mt genome of the chimpanzee louse, Pe. schaeffi, and compared it with the three human lice. Results: We identified all of the 37 mt genes typical of bilateral animals in the chimpanzee louse; these genes are on 18 types of minichromosomes. Seventeen of the 18 minichromosomes of the chimpanzee louse have the same gene content and gene arrangement as their counterparts in the human head louse and the human body louse. However, five genes, cob, trnS  1  , trnN, trnE and trnM, which are on three minichromosomes in the human head louse and the human body louse, are together on one minichromosome in the chimpanzee louse. Conclusions: Using the human pubic louse, Pt. pubis, as an outgroup for comparison, we infer that a single minichromosome has fragmented into three in the lineage leading to the human head louse and the human body louse since this lineage diverged from the chimpanzee louse ~6 million years ago. Our results provide insights into the process of mt genome fragmentation in the sucking lice in a relatively fine evolutionary scale. © 2015 Herd et al.

ABSTRACT: The extent to which animal vocalizations are referential has long been debated since it reflects on the evolution of language. Our closest living relative, the chimpanzee, has been shown to have functionally referential food calls in captivity but evidence for such capabilities in the wild is lacking. We investigated the context specificity and function of West African chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes verus, food calls in the wild using all day focal follows of adult males and females of one habituated group in the Taï forest, CÔte d'Ivoire. We collected over 750. h of observation and analysed 379 food calls produced for five different food species and found that higher pitched calls were produced for a single fruit species. Additionally, within this species, chimpanzees modified calls according to tree size, whereby smaller trees elicited higher pitched calls. Our results suggest that chimpanzees subtly vary the acoustic structure of food calls with respect to food patch size for a putatively highly valued fruit species, and we propose that arousal alone cannot sufficiently explain the patterns observed. Further work is needed to determine whether variation in food call pitch can influence receiver foraging behaviour. However, in light of our results, we propose that understanding the information content encoded by acoustic variation in chimpanzee food calls requires receiver knowledge about the natural ecological context, specifically spatial memory of tree locations. Therefore, this study highlights the potential significance of feeding ecology in the evolution of flexibly modulated vocal communication. © 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of Giardia duodenalis and Cryptosporidium spp. in primates and determine their zoonotic or anthropozoonotic potential. Methods: Direct immunofluorescence was used to identify Giardia and Cryptosporidium from faecal samples. PCR and DNA sequencing was performed on positive results. Results: Giardia cysts were identified from 5.5% (5/90) of captive chimpanzees and 0% (0/11) of captive mandrills in the Republic of Congo; 0% (0/10) of captive chimpanzees in Norway; and 0% of faecal samples (n = 49) from wild Zanzibar red colobus monkeys. Two Giardia positive samples were also positive on PCR, and sequencing revealed identical isolates of Assemblage B. Cryptosporidium oocysts were not detected in any of the samples. Conclusions: In these primate groups, in which interactions with humans and human environments are quite substantial, Giardia and Cryptosporidium are rare pathogens. In chimpanzees, Giardia may have a zoonotic or anthropozoonotic potential. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Bossou in Guinea is one of the longitudinal study sites of wild chimpanzees, and is located only a few kilometers away from the national border between Guinea and Liberia. The forests in the area spread over the national border of Guinea, and the Bossou chimpanzees have been found to use the neighboring Liberian forest. Local assistants and I started surveying these forests in Liberia, and found that additional groups of chimpanzees lived in Nimba County, Liberia. The present study reports tool use behaviors by chimpanzees living in forests of the Kpala area in Nimba County. We directly observed pestle-pounding behavior, which had been confirmed only in the Bossou group of wild chimpanzees. Moreover, we heard sounds of nut-cracking, and successfully filmed chimpanzees cracking open oil palm nuts with stones. The uniqueness of stone-tool use behaviors has been emphasized with the group of chimpanzees that have been longitudinally studied at Bossou, but the behaviors probably have a wide distribution in this area. Emigrant chimpanzees are thought to contribute to the propagation of the cultural tool-use behaviors. It is also thought that, if the distantly located groups share similar cultural behaviors, there might be genetic exchange between them. Conservation efforts should be needed not only at Bossou, but also in a wider area including nonprotected forests beyond the national border. © 2015, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees are renowned for their use of foraging tools in harvesting social insects and some populations use tools to prey on aggressive army ants (Dorylus spp.). Tool use in army ant predation varies across chimpanzee study sites with differences in tool length, harvesting technique, and army ant species targeted. However, surprisingly little is known about the detailed ecology of army ant predation. We studied army ant predation by chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) at the Seringbara study site in the Nimba Mountains, Guinea (West Africa), over 10 years (2003-2013). We investigated chimpanzee selectivity with regards to army ant prey species. We assessed the temporal variation in army ant-feeding and examined whether army ant predation was related to rainfall or ripe fruit availability. Moreover, we examined whether chimpanzees showed selectivity regarding plant species used for tool manufacture, as well as the relationship between tool species preference and tool collection distance. Lastly, we measured tool properties and investigated the use of tool sets and composite tools in army ant predation. Seringbara chimpanzees preyed on one army ant species (D. nigricans) more often than expected based on encounter rates, which may be explained by the overlap in altitudinal distribution between chimpanzees and D. nigricans. Army ant predation was not related to rainfall or fruit availability. Chimpanzees were selective in their choice of tool materials and collected their preferred tool species (Alchornea hirtella) from greater distances than they did other species. Lastly, Seringbara chimpanzees used both tool sets and composite tools (tree perch) in army ant predation. Tool types (dig vs. dip) differed in width and strength, but not length. Tool composites were found at 40% of ant-feeding sites. Our study sheds new light on the ecology of army ant predation and provides novel insights into chimpanzee selection of army ant prey and tool species. Am. J.

ABSTRACT: A replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus expressing Ag85A (ChAdOx1.85A) was assessed, both alone and in combination with modified vaccinia Ankara also expressing Ag85A (MVA85A), for its immunogenicity and protective efficacy against a Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) challenge in mice. Naïve and BCG-primed mice were vaccinated or boosted with ChAdOx1.85A and MVA85A in different combinations. Although intranasally administered ChAdOx1.85A induced strong immune responses in the lungs, it failed to consistently protect against aerosol M.tb challenge. In contrast, ChAdOx1.85A followed by MVA85A administered either mucosally or systemically, induced strong immune responses and was able to improve the protective efficacy of BCG. This vaccination regime has consistently shown superior protection over BCG alone and should be evaluated further. © 2015 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Three strains TKU9, TKU49 and TKU50T, were isolated from the oral cavities of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). The isolates were all gram-positive, facultative anaerobic cocci that lacked catalase activity. Analysis of partial 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the most closely related species was Streptococcus infantis (96.7%). The next most closely related species to the isolates were S. rubneri, S. mitis, S. peroris and S. australis (96.6 to 96.4%). Based on the rpoB and gyrB gene sequences, TKU50T was clustered with other member of the mitis group. Enzyme activity and sugar fermentation patterns differentiated this novel bacterium from other members of the mitis group streptococci. The DNA G+C content of strain TKU50T was 46.7 mol%, which is the highest reported value for members of the mitis group (40-46 mol%). On the basis of the phenotypic characterization, partial 16S rRNA gene and sequences data for two housekeeping gene (gyrB and rpoB), we propose a novel taxa, S. panodentis for TKU 50T (type strain=CM 30579T=DSM 29921T), for these newly described isolates. © 2015 The Societies and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Balancing selection maintains advantageous genetic and phenotypic diversity in populations. When selection acts for long evolutionary periods selected polymorphisms may survive species splits and segregate in present-day populations of different species. Here, we investigate the role of long-term balancing selection in the evolution of protein-coding sequences in the Homo-Pan clade. We sequenced the exome of 20 humans, 20 chimpanzees, and 20 bonobos and detected eight coding trans-species polymorphisms (trSNPs) that are shared among the three species and have segregated for approximately 14 My of independent evolution. Although the majority of these trSNPs were found in three genes of the major histocompatibility locus cluster, we also uncovered one coding trSNP (rs12088790) in the gene LAD1. All these trSNPs show clustering of sequences by allele rather than by species and also exhibit other signatures of long-term balancing selection, such as segregating at intermediate frequency and lying in a locus with high genetic diversity. Here, we focus on the trSNP in LAD1, a gene that encodes for Ladinin-1, a collagenous anchoring filament protein of basement membrane that is responsible for maintaining cohesion at the dermal-epidermal junction; the gene is also an autoantigen responsible for linear IgA disease. This trSNP results in a missense change (Leucine257Proline) and, besides altering the protein sequence, is associated with changes in gene expression of LAD1. © The Author 2015.

ABSTRACT: We describe the pathologic features of mural arterial dissection involving brain-supplying arteries in a 31-y-old female chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes). Several hours after examination for a possible respiratory tract infection, the chimpanzee became unresponsive, developed seizures, and died within 18 h. At necropsy, the occipital cortex of the brain had a small area of congestion, and the cerebellar cortex contained a small necrotic area. Histologic evaluation confirmed the cortical lesions and revealed an additional necrotic area in the medulla oblongata characterized by mural dissection of the brain-supplying vertebral and basilar arteries and subsequent branches. Lesions in the cortices and medulla were within areas supplied by the vertebrobasilar system. Dissection of brain-supplying arteries has been described in humans but not previously in chimpanzees (or any other NHP), suggesting that these species might be useful in understanding this condition in humans. In addition, the lesion should be added to the NHP clinician's and pathologist's differential diagnosis list for similar presentations in this species.

ABSTRACT: It has been estimated that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 originated from the zoonotic transmission of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) of chimpanzees, SIVcpz, and that SIVcpz emerged by the recombination of two lineages of SIVs in Old World monkeys (SIVgsn/mon/mus in guenons and SIVrcm in red-capped mangabeys) and SIVcpz Nef is most closely related to SIVrcm Nef. These observations suggest that SIVrcm Nef had an advantage over SIVgsn/mon/mus during the evolution of SIVcpz in chimpanzees, although this advantage remains uncertain. Nef is a multifunctional protein which downregulates CD4 and coreceptor proteins from the surface of infected cells, presumably to limit superinfection. To assess the possibility that SIVrcm Nef was selected by its superior ability to downregulate viral entry receptors in chimpanzees, we compared its ability to down-modulate viral receptor proteins from humans, chimpanzees and red-capped mangabeys with Nef proteins from eight other different strains of SIVs. Surprisingly, the ability of SIVrcm Nef to downregulate CCR5, CCR2B and CXCR6 was comparable to or lower than SIVgsn/mon/mus Nef, indicating that ability to down-modulate chemokine receptors was not the selective pressure. However, SIVrcm Nef significantly downregulates chimpanzee CD4 over SIVgsn/mon/mus Nefs. Our findings suggest the possibility that the selection of SIVrcm Nef by ancestral SIVcpz is due to its superior capacity to down-modulate chimpanzees CD4 rather than coreceptor proteins. © 2015 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules determine immune responses to viral infections. These polymorphic cell-surface glycoproteins bind peptide antigens, forming ligands for cytotoxic T and natural killer cell receptors. Under pressure from rapidly evolving viruses, hominoid MHC class I molecules also evolve rapidly, becoming diverse and species-specific. Little is known of the impact of infectious disease epidemics on MHC class I variant distributions in human populations, a context in which the chimpanzee is the superior animal model. Population dynamics of the chimpanzees inhabiting Gombe National Park, Tanzania have been studied for over 50 years. This population is infected with SIVcpz, the precursor of human HIV-1. Because HLA-B is the most polymorphic human MHC class I molecule and correlates strongly with HIV-1 progression, we determined sequences for its ortholog, Patr-B, in 125 Gombe chimpanzees. Eleven Patr-B variants were defined, as were their frequencies in Gombe’s three communities, changes in frequency with time, and effect of SIVcpz infection. The growing populations of the northern and central communities, where SIVcpz is less prevalent, have stable distributions comprising a majority of low-frequency Patr-B variants and a few high-frequency variants. Driving the latter to high frequency has been the fecundity of immigrants to the northern community, whereas in the central community, it has been the fecundity of socially dominant individuals. In the declining population of the southern community, where greater SIVcpz prevalence is associated with mortality and emigration, Patr-B variant distributions have been changing. Enriched in this community are Patr-B variants that engage with natural killer cell receptors. Elevated among SIVcpz-infected chimpanzees, the Patr-B*06:03 variant has striking structural and functional similarities to HLA-B*57, the human allotype most strongly associated with delayed HIV-1 progression. Like HLA-B*57, Patr-B*06:03 correlates with reduced viral load, as assessed by detection of SIVcpz RNA in feces.

ABSTRACT: While natural observations show apes use grooming and play as social currency, no experimental manipulations have been carried out to measure the effects of these behaviours on relationship formation in apes. While previous experiments have demonstrated apes quickly learn the identity of individuals who will provide food in a variety of cooperative and non-cooperative situations, no experiment has ever examined how grooming and play might shape the preferences of apes for different individuals. We gave a group bonobos (N = 25) and chimpanzees (N = 30) a choice between an unfamiliar human who had recently groomed or played with them and one who had not. Both species showed a preference for the unfamiliar human that had interacted with them over the one who did not. The effect was largely driven by the males of both species while interacting with females showed little effect on their preferences for unfamiliar humans. Subjects showed this preference even though they only had social interactions with one of the unfamiliar humans for a few minutes before each trial and their choices were not rewarded with food differentially. Our results support the long held idea that grooming and play act as a form of social currency in great apes (and likely many other species) that can rapidly shape social relationships, particularly between unfamiliar individuals. © 2015 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.

ABSTRACT: Previous research has shown that chimpanzees exploit the behavior of humans and conspecifics more readily in a competitive than a cooperative context. However, it is unknown whether bonobos, who outperform chimpanzees in some cooperative tasks, also show greater cognitive flexibility in competitive contexts. Here we tested the cooperative-competitive hypothesis further by comparing bonobos and chimpanzees in a series of tasks where a human gesture indicated the correct (cooperative) or incorrect (competitive) choice. A human either pointed cooperatively to the object a subject should choose, or competitively to the object subjects should avoid choosing. In contrast to previous research, subjects were most skilled at choosing the correct location when the communicator was cooperative and there were no major differences between bonobos and chimpanzees. Analysis of gaze direction revealed that in some cases subjects visually followed the direction of the experimenter's gesture despite choosing incorrectly, dissociating gesture following from gesture comprehension. This supports the hypothesis that, unlike human children, nonhuman apes respond to the direction of social gestures more readily than they understand the communicative intentions underlying them.We evaluate these findings in regard to previous studies comparing the cooperative and communicative skills of bonobos and chimpanzees. © 2015 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.

ABSTRACT: Although Plasmodium infections have never been clearly associated with symptoms in non-human primates, the question of the pathogenicity of Plasmodium parasites in non-human primates still remains unanswered. A young chimpanzee, followed before and after release to a sanctuary, in a semi-free ranging enclosure located in an equatorial forest, showed fever and strong anaemia associated with a high Plasmodium reichenowi infection, shortly after release. The animal recovered from anaemia after several months despite recurrent infection with other Plasmodium species. This may be the first description of malaria-like symptoms in a chimpanzee infected with Plasmodium. © 2015 Herbert et al.

ABSTRACT: The evolutionary origins of human right-handedness remain poorly understood. Some have hypothesized that tool use served as an important preadaptation for the eventual evolution of populationlevel right-handedness. In contrast, others have suggested that complex gestural and vocal communication served as prerequisite for the evolution of human right-handedness. In this study, we tested these competing hypotheses by comparing the handedness of bonobos and chimpanzees, two closely related species of Pan, on three different measures of hand use including simple reaching, manual gestures and coordinated bimanual actions. Chimpanzees are well known for their tool using abilities whereas bonobos rarely use tools in the wild. In contrast, many have suggested that bonobos have a more flexible gestural and vocal communication system than chimpanzees. The overall results showed that chimpanzees were significantly more right-handed than bonobos for all three measures suggesting that adaptations for tool use rather than communication may have led to the emergence of human right-handedness. We further show that species differences in handedness may be linked to variation in the size and asymmetry of the motor-hand area of the precentral gyrus. The results are discussed within the context of evolutionary theories of handedness, as well as some limitations in the approach to handedness measurement in nonhuman primates. © 2015 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.

ABSTRACT: Proximal femoral morphology and associated musculature are of special relevance to the understanding of hominoid locomotor systems. Knowledge of bone-muscle correspondence in extant hominoids forms an important comparative basis for inferring structure-function relationships in fossil hominids. However, there is still a lack of consensus on the correspondence between muscle attachment sites and surface morphology of the proximal femoral diaphysis in chimpanzees. Two alternative observations have been proposed regarding the attachment site positions of gluteus maximus (GM) and vastus lateralis (VL) relative to two prominent surface features of the proximal femoral diaphysis, the lateral spiral pilaster and the inferolateral fossa. Here, we use a combination of virtual and physical dissection in an attempt to identify the exact correspondence between muscle attachment sites and osteological features in two specimens of Pan troglodytes verus. The results show that the insertion of the GM tendon is consistently inferolateral to the lateral spiral pilaster, and that a part of the inferolateral fossa consistently forms the attachment site of the VL muscular fibers. While overall musculoskeletal features are similar in the two specimens examined in this study, GM and VL exhibit different degrees of segregation at the level of the inferolateral fossa. One specimen exhibited tendinous GM fibers penetrating the posteromedial part of VL, with both GM and VL inserting at the inferolateral fossa. In the other specimen, GM and VL were separated by a lateral intermuscular septum, which inserted into the inferolateral fossa. Variation of proximal femoral muscle attachments in chimpanzees is thus greater than previously thought. Our results indicate that a conspicuous osteological feature such as the inferolateral fossa does not necessarily correspond to the attachment site of a single muscle, but could serve as a boundary region between two muscles. Caution is thus warranted when interpreting the surface topography of muscle attachment sites and inferring locomotor functions. © 2015 Anatomical Society.

ABSTRACT: A 40-yr-old female chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) presented with intermittent, short-duration episodes of nonspecific clinical signs that included lethargy and reduced responsiveness to external stimuli. Clinical examination and diagnostics suggested obstructive hepatic disease, which was confirmed by subsequent ultrasonographic examination. During routine laparotomy, a biliary calculus was removed from the distal common bile duct and the gallbladder was removed, which resulted in complete clinical recovery. The biliary calculus was analyzed as a mixed composition of predominantly cholesterol, bilirubin, and calcium. © Copyright 2015 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: The emergence of HIV-1 groups M, N, O, and P is the result of four independent cross-species transmissions between chimpanzees (cpz) and gorillas (gor) from central/south Cameroon and humans respectively. Although the first two SIVcpz were identified in wild-born captive chimpanzees in Gabon in 1989, no study has been conducted so far in wild chimpanzees in Gabon. To document the SIVcpz infection rate, genetic diversity, and routes of virus transmission, we analyzed 1458 faecal samples collected in 16 different locations across the country, and we conducted follow-up missions in two of them. We found 380 SIV antibody positive samples in 6 different locations in the north and northeast. We determined the number of individuals collected by microsatellite analysis and obtained an adjusted SIV prevalence of 39.45%. We performed parental analysis to investigate viral spread between and within communities and found that SIVs were epidemiologically linked and were transmitted by both horizontal and vertical routes. We amplified pol and gp41 fragments and obtained 57 new SIVcpzPtt strains from three sites. All strains, but one, clustered together within a specific phylogeographic clade. Given that these SIV positive samples have been collected nearby villages and that humans continue to encroach in ape’s territories, the emergence of a new HIV in this area needs to be considered. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: Human and nonhuman primates are not mentally constrained to the present. They can remember the past and-at least to an extent-anticipate the future. Anticipation of the future ranges from long-term prospection such as planning for retirement to more short-term future-oriented cognition such as planning a route through a maze. Here we tested a great ape species (chimpanzees), an Old World monkey species (rhesus macaques), a New World monkey species (capuchin monkeys), and human children on a computerized maze task. All subjects had to move a cursor through a maze to reach a goal at the bottom of the screen. For best performance on the task, subjects had to "plan ahead" to the end of the maze to move the cursor in the correct direction, avoid traps, and reverse directions if necessary. Mazes varied in difficulty. Chimpanzees were better than both monkey species, and monkeys showed a particular deficit when moving away from the goal or changing directions was required. Children showed a similar pattern to monkeys regarding the effects of reversals and moves away from the goal, but their overall performance in terms of correct maze completion was similar to the chimpanzees. The results highlight similarities as well as differences in planning across species and the role that inhibitory control may play in future-oriented cognition in primates. © 2015 American Psychological Association.

ABSTRACT: Recombinant adenoviral vector (rAd)-based vaccines are currently being developed for several infectious diseases and cancer therapy, but pre-existing seroprevalence to such vectors may prevent their use in broad human populations. In this study, we investigated the potential of low seroprevalence non-human primate rAd vectors to stimulate cellular and humoral responses using HIV/SIV Env glycoprotein (gp) as the representative antigen. Mice were immunized with novel simian or chimpanzee rAd (rSAV or rChAd) vectors encoding HIV gp or SIV gp by single immunization or in heterologous prime/boost combinations (DNA/rAd; rAd/rAd; rAd/NYVAC or rAd/rLCM), and adaptive immunity was assessed. Among the rSAV and rChAd tested, rSAV16 or rChAd3 vector alone generated the most potent immune responses. The DNA/rSAV regimen also generated immune responses similar to the DNA/rAd5 regimen. rChAd63/rChAd3 and rChAd3 /NYVAC induced similar or even higher levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell and IgG responses as compared to rAd28/rAd5, one of the most potent combinations of human rAds. The optimized vaccine regimen stimulated improved cellular immune responses and neutralizing antibodies against HIV compared to the DNA/rAd5 regimen. Based on these results, this type of novel rAd vector and its prime/boost combination regimens represent promising candidates for vaccine development. © 2015.

ABSTRACT: Conflict and aggressive interactions are common phenomena in group-living animals and vocal behaviour often plays an important role in determining their outcomes. In some species, vocal signals seem to provide bystanders with information about the nature of an ongoing aggressive interaction, which can be beneficial for the victims. For example, in chimpanzees and some other primates, victims adjust their screams depending on the composition of the by-standing audience, probably to solicit their support. Considerably less is known, however, about the role of other call types produced by victims of aggression. In this study, we focused on the fact that, immediately after screams, chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, victims often produce 'waa' barks, but little is known about their function. Our results showed that for screams, but not 'waa' barks, production was dependent on the audience composition with victims being more likely to scream when adult or late-adolescent males were in close proximity. We also found that after 'waa' barking, but not screaming, victims were more likely to retaliate against and less likely to reconcile with their aggressors, and that 'waa' barking was more common after victims had received support from other party members. These results suggest that, in chimpanzees, victims of aggression vocalize with a dual social strategy of attempting to recruit support from bystanders and to repel their attackers by signalling readiness to retaliate. We conclude that victim scream and 'waa' bark calls, although often produced during the same agonistic event, are directed at different audiences and fulfil different social functions, and that these calls can mediate both aggressive interactions and aggressor-victim relationships following aggression. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: Levels of the steroid hormone testosterone have been found to impact diverse features of cognition from spatial memory to decision-making regarding risk, both in humans and other animals. However less is known about whether closely-related species differ in their testosterone-cognition relationships in line with pressures shaping each species' cognitive evolution. We therefore examined relationships between testosterone and cognition in two-closely related species that differ markedly in their social behaviour, cognition, and patterns of testosterone production: bonobos (Pan paniscus) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). We presented individuals of both species with a battery of 16 cognitive tasks and determined whether performance on these tasks correlated with average testosterone level.We found that among male chimpanzees, high levels of testosterone correlated with higher performance in numerous tasks, including tasks assessing spatial cognition and physical cognitive abilities more broadly. Meanwhile, in male bonobos we found no correlations between testosterone and performance on the cognitive tasks, and found no correlations in females of either species. Building on prior comparative research, these results suggest that bonobos and chimpanzees differ critically in the proximate mechanisms influencing their cognitive capacities, and that in particular the role of testosterone in shaping behaviour and cognition differs dramatically between the two species. © 2015 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.

ABSTRACT: Percussive tool use holds special interest for scientists concerned with human origins. We summarize the findings from two field sites, Taï and Fazenda Boa Vista, where percussive tool use by chimpanzees and bearded capuchins, respectively, has been extensively investigated. We describe the ecological settings in which nut-cracking occurs and focus on four aspects of nut-cracking that have important cognitive implications, namely selection of tools, tool transport, tool modification and modulation of actions to reach the goal of cracking the nut. We comment on similarities and differences in behaviour and consider whether the observed differences reflect ecological, morphological, social and/or cognitive factors. Both species are sensitive to physical properties of tools, adjust their selection of hammers conditionally to the resistance of the nuts and to transport distance, and modulate the energy of their strikes under some conditions. However, chimpanzees transport hammers more frequently and for longer distances, take into account a higher number of combinations of variables and occasionally intentionally modify tools. A parsimonious interpretation of our findings is that morphological, ecological and social factors account for the observed differences. Confirmation of plausible cognitive differences in nut-cracking requires data not yet available. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Liberia has the largest blocks of continuous forest in West Africa, providing habitat for numerous wildlife species. However, there is a lack of empirical data about the status of Liberia's wildlife populations. During 2010-2012 we conducted the first nationwide survey in Liberia along c. 320 km of systematically located transect lines to estimate the abundance of chimpanzees Pan troglodytes verus, the diversity of large mammals and the nature and degree of anthropogenic threats. With >Â 7,000 chimpanzees, Liberia is home to the second largest population of West African chimpanzees and is therefore a priority for conservation of the species. Compared to the fragmented populations in other range countries the Liberian population is potentially one of the most viable. Our study revealed that the majority of chimpanzees and some of the most species-diverse mammal communities in Liberia exist outside protected areas. High hunting rates and plans for large-scale exploitation of natural resources necessitate rapid implementation of effective strategies to ensure the protection of one of West Africa's last strongholds for chimpanzees and other rare and threatened mammal species. We provide a country-wide baseline dataset that may serve as a platform for Liberian wildlife authorities, policy-makers and international conservation agencies to make informed decisions about the location and delineation of proposed protected areas, to identify conservation gaps and to devise a conservation action plan to conserve Liberia's wildlife resources. © 2014 Fauna and Flora International.

ABSTRACT: Apes are important long-distance dispersers of large seeds in African tropical forests. Seed size and shape are likely to affect the ease of swallowing for an animal species. If an endozoochorous seed is larger than the digestive tract of an animal, the seed cannot be swallowed, and a round seed is more difficult to swallow than an elongated seed of the same length. In order to test if such a correlation exists between the seed size and its shape, we investigated the length and width of chimpanzee-dispersed seeds at the Mahale Mountains National Park, Tanzania. Among the 14 species of seeds, longer seeds had significantly narrower relative widths, and thus, they were more ovoid. Since the chimpanzee is the largest arboreal frugivore at Mahale, their food selection might have influenced the shape of larger seeds. The chimpanzee's selective consumption of such fruits with longer, elongated seeds may have facilitated the selective dispersal of such plant species in that area. © 2015 Cambridge University Press.

ABSTRACT: In most primate societies, strong and enduring social bonds form preferentially among kin, who benefit from cooperation through direct and indirect fitness gains. Chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, differ from most species by showing consistent female-biased dispersal and strict male philopatry. In most East African populations, females tend to forage alone in small core areas and were long thought to have weak social bonds of little biological significance. Recent work in some populations is challenging this view. However, difficulties remain in quantifying the influence of shared space use on association patterns, and in identifying the drivers of partner preferences and social bonds. Here, we use the largest data set on wild chimpanzee behaviour currently available to assess potential determinants of female association patterns. We quantify pairwise similarities in ranging, dyadic association and grooming for 624 unique dyads over 38 years, including 17 adult female kin dyads. To search for social preferences that could not be explained by spatial overlap alone, we controlled for expected association based on pairwise kernel volume intersections of core areas. We found that association frequencies among females with above-average overlap correlated positively with grooming rates, suggesting that associations reflected social preferences in these dyads. Furthermore, when available, females preferred kin over nonkin partners for association and grooming, and variability was high among nonkin dyads. While variability in association above and below expected values was high, on average, nonkin associated more frequently if they had immature male offspring, while having female offspring had the opposite effect. Dominance rank, an important determinant of reproductive success at Gombe, influenced associations primarily for low-ranking females, who associated preferentially with each other. Our findings support the hypothesis that female chimpanzees form well-differentiated social relationships that are of potential adaptive value to females and their offspring. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: Changes in diet throughout hominin evolution have been linked with important evolutionary changes. Stable carbon isotope analysis of inorganic apatite carbonate is the main isotopic method used to reconstruct fossil hominin diets; to test its effectiveness as a paleodietary indicator we present bone and enamel carbonate carbon isotope data from a well-studied population of modern wild western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) of known sex and age from Taï, Cote d'Ivoire. We found a significant effect of age class on bone carbonate values, with adult chimpanzees being more 13C- and 18O-depleted compared to juveniles. Further, to investigate habitat effects, we compared our data to existing apatite data on eastern chimpanzees (P. troglodytes schweinfurthii) and found that the Taï chimpanzees are significantly more depleted in enamel δ13Cap and δ18Oap compared to their eastern counterparts. Our data are the first to present a range of tissue-specific isotope data from the same group of wild western chimpanzees and, as such, add new data to the growing number of modern non-human primate comparative isotope datasets providing valuable information for the interpretation of diet throughout hominin evolution. By comparing our data to published isotope data on fossil hominins we found that our modern chimpanzee bone and enamel data support hypotheses that the trend towards increased consumption of C4 foods after 4 Ma (millions of years ago) is unique to hominins. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The immunogenicity of Bacillus anthracis capsule (poly-γ-D-glutamic acid [PGA]) conjugated to recombinant B. anthracis protective antigen (rPA) or to tetanus toxoid (TT) was evaluated in two anthrax-naive juvenile chimpanzees. In a previous study of these conjugates, highly protective monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against PGA were generated. This study examines the polyclonal antibody response of the same animals. Preimmune antibodies to PGA with titers of >103 were detected in the chimpanzees. The maximal titer of anti-PGA was induced within 1 to 2 weeks following the 1st immunization, with no booster effects following the 2nd and 3rd immunizations. Thus, the anti-PGA response in the chimpanzees resembled a secondary immune response. Screening of sera from nine unimmunized chimpanzees and six humans revealed antibodies to PGA in all samples, with an average titer of 103. An anti-PA response was also observed following immunization with PGA-rPA conjugate, similar to that seen following immunization with rPA alone. However, in contrast to anti-PGA, preimmune anti-PA antibody titers and those following the 1st immunization were <300, with the antibodies peaking above 104 following the 2nd immunization. The polyclonal anti-PGA shared the MAb 11D epitope and, similar to the MAbs, exerted opsonophagocytic killing of B. anthracis. Most important, the PGA-TT-induced antibodies protected mice from a lethal challenge with virulent B. anthracis spores. Our data support the use of PGA conjugates, especially PGA-rPA targeting both toxin and capsule, as expanded-spectrum anthrax vaccines. Copyright © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

ABSTRACT: An 18-yr-old female captive-born chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) presented with an intermittent history of inappetence, lethargy, and lower limb stiffness. No notable abnormalities were found on exam or complete blood cell count and serum biochemistry analysis. Serologic testing was strongly positive via indirect fluorescent antibody testing and Western blot for Borrelia burgdorferi. Treatment with doxycycline was initiated, and a clinical response was seen within 1 wk. Convalescent serum exhibited an eightfold increase in titer. Serologic testing was performed on several conspecifics with banked serum; while some low positive titers were present and presumed indicative of past exposure, no titer was elevated to the extent of the affected chimpanzee during its course of disease. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of suspected Lyme borreliosis in a great ape species, and the case originates from an area of the United States with a high incidence of human borreliosis. © 2015 American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: The unprecedented recent decision-making about chimpanzees supported for biomedical science by the US National Institutes of Health attracted international attention and significantly changed many dimensions of chimpanzee research. Many public and media portrayals incorrectly generalized the NIH findings to conclude that chimpanzee research itself was no longer necessary. In fact, the broader question of the necessity and value of the full range of chimpanzee research was never asked, evaluated, or within the NIH's primary charge. The Institute of Medicine evaluative panel found that research with chimpanzees was necessary for some, but not all, purposes. The panel's findings also led the NIH to introduce new standards for the care and management of NIH-supported chimpanzees and a new mechanism for ethical review of grant proposals involving chimpanzees. The NIH evaluation and decisions could not address all captive chimpanzees and all types of research. However, the process did underscore the need for a more expansive framework for continued ethical review and decision-making to responsibly address the future of captive chimpanzee management and research. Among the broader considerations are extension of evidence-informed standards to ensure equitable care and treatment of all chimpanzees; determining the global impact of limited captive populations; and balancing benefit and harm at individual, species, societal, and environmental levels. The breadth and longevity of impact from the current US decisions suggest the need for many voices, disciplines, and stakeholders to address the complex interplay between science, animal welfare, and global health. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: A small chimpanzee habitat in the montane forest of Kahuzi-Biega National Park, Democratic Republic of Congo, is connected with the lowland forest of this park through a corridor, which is affected by human encroachment. To assess the conservation status of the chimpanzee population in this small habitat, we estimated the size of the community and evaluated its genetic diversity by using 279 fecal samples collected in the montane forest of Kahuzi. Using autosomal microsatellite (or short tandem repeat, STR) loci, we identified 32 individuals, comprising 19 females and 13 males. Samples from 24 individuals were collected at least twice and a genetic mark-recapture analysis estimated that the community size was 36 (range: 32-42). Data on nest site sharing confirmed that all the samples belonged to the same community. Nest site sharing information may be useful in population studies of unhabituated chimpanzees. The genetic structure and diversity of the 32 genotyped individuals was assessed using Y-chromosomal short tandem repeat (Y-STR) loci and mitochondrial D-loops. One dominant Y-STR haplotype was found, whereas there was no dominant haplotype in the mitochondrial region, reflecting a female-biased dispersal pattern, which is typical of chimpanzees. The genetic diversity for three markers in Kahuzi chimpanzees was comparable to that in other eastern chimpanzee populations. A relatively high heterozygosity and negative inbreeding coefficient (FIS) for STR loci suggests that the study community belongs to an outbreeding chimpanzee population. These findings suggest that individuals of the study community may have reproductive contact with other chimpanzee individuals from neighboring communities in Kahuzi-Biega National Park, at least in the recent past.

ABSTRACT: Humans often strategically manipulate the informational access of others to their own advantage. Although chimpanzees know what others can and cannot see, it is unclear whether they can strategically manipulate others’ visual access. In this study, chimpanzees were given the opportunity to save food for themselves by concealing it from a human competitor and also to get more food for themselves by revealing it to a human cooperator. When knowing that a competitor was approaching, chimpanzees kept more food hidden (left it covered) than when expecting a cooperator to approach. When the experimenter was already at the location of the hidden food, they actively revealed less food to the competitor than to the cooperator. They did not actively hide food (cover up food in the open) from the competitor, however. Chimpanzees thus strategically manipulated what another could see in order to maximize their payoffs and showed their ability to plan for future situations. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: In two experiments, we investigated whether chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, can use self-experience to infer what another sees. Subjects first gained self-experience with the visual properties of an object (either opaque or see-through). In a subsequent test phase, a human experimenter interacted with the object and we tested whether chimpanzees understood that the experimenter experienced the object as opaque or as see-through. Crucially, in the test phase, the object seemed opaque to the subject in all cases (while the experimenter could see through the one that they had experienced as see-through before), such that she had to use her previous self-experience with the object to correctly infer whether the experimenter could or could not see when looking at the object. Chimpanzees did not attribute their previous self-experience with the object to the experimenter in a gaze-following task (experiment 1); however, they did so successfully in a competitive context (experiment 2). We conclude that chimpanzees successfully used their self-experience to infer what the competitor sees. We discuss our results in relation to the well-known 'goggles experiment' and address alternative explanations. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: Social norms—generalized expectations about how others should behave in a given context—implicitly guide human social life. However, their existence becomes explicit when they are violated because norm violations provoke negative reactions, even from personally uninvolved bystanders. To explore the evolutionary origin of human social norms, we presented chimpanzees with videos depicting a putative norm violation: unfamiliar conspecifics engaging in infanticidal attacks on an infant chimpanzee. The chimpanzees looked far longer at infanticide scenes than at control videos showing nut cracking, hunting a colobus monkey, or displays and aggression among adult males. Furthermore, several alternative explanations for this looking pattern could be ruled out. However, infanticide scenes did not generally elicit higher arousal. We propose that chimpanzees as uninvolved bystanders may detect norm violations but may restrict emotional reactions to such situations to in-group contexts. We discuss the implications for the evolution of human morality. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: Social learning refers to individuals learning from others, including information gained through indirect social influences, such as the results of others' actions and changes in the physical environment. One method to determine the relative influence of these varieties of information is the 'ghost display', in which no model is involved, but subjects can watch the results that a model would produce. Previous research has shown mixed success by chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) learning from ghost displays, with some studies suggesting learning only in relatively simple tasks. To explore whether the failure of chimpanzees to learn from a ghost display may be due to neophobia when tested singly or a requirement for more detailed information for complex tasks, we presented ghost displays of a tool-use task to chimpanzees in their home social groups. Previous tests have revealed that chimpanzees are unable to easily solve this tool-use task asocially, or learn from ghost displays when tested singly, but can learn after observing conspecifics in a group setting. In the present study, despite being tested in a group situation, chimpanzees still showed no success in solving the task via trial-and-error learning, in a baseline condition, nor in learning the task from the ghost display. Simply being in the presence of their group mates and being shown the affordances of the task was not sufficient to encourage learning. Following this, in an escalating series of tests, we examined the chimpanzees' ability to learn from a demonstration by models with agency: (1) a human; (2) video footage of a chimpanzee; (3) a live chimpanzee model. In the first two of these 'social' conditions, subjects showed limited success. By the end of the final open diffusion phase, which was run to determine whether this new behavior would be transmitted among the group after seeing a successful chimpanzee use the task, 83% of chimpanzees were now successful. This confirmed a marked overall effect of observing animate conspecific modeling, in contrast to the ghost condition.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: insert SI title. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Nonhuman primate populations are facing widespread conversion of their habitat to human-modified landscapes dominated by agriculture, in which cultivated species may constitute alternative food resources, particularly during periods of wild food scarcity. We assessed intraseasonal variation in dietary composition and diversity of the western chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) at Lagoas de Cufada Natural Park, Guinea-Bissau, a forest–savannah mosaic disturbed by humans, in relation to food availability. We also investigated spatial variation in dietary composition. We collected phenological data from March 2011 to February 2012 by sampling focal plant taxa and conducted macroscopic analyses of fecal samples and feeding remains during the dry season (February–May and October–December) of 2011. More fruits were available in the dry than in the wet season, and ripe fruit availability peaked in the late dry season. Chimpanzees showed a fruit-based diet composed of 31 identified plant species. Fecal samples (N = 210) were dominated by wild species (82 % volume), while cultivated species were rare (0.9 % volume; 17 % volume of unidentified species). The consumption of fruit species increased with ripe fruit availability, but a few wild fruit species were selected disproportionately to their overall availability. There was no association between dietary composition and distances among fecal samples, suggesting that chimpanzees have access to and largely use the same set of plant species over the entire study area. Moreover, the proximity to agricultural areas did not influence dietary composition. Our findings highlight that chimpanzees in this human-modified landscape still rely mostly on the consumption of wild fruit species and rarely include cultivated foods in their diet. Overall, our study underscores the importance of knowledge of feeding ecology to understand better the effects of anthropogenic habitat modification on primate diet and distribution as well as the limits to their persistence in the expanding human-dominated agricultural landscapes across their range. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: A fundamental characteristic of human language is multimodality. In other words, humans use multiple signaling channels concurrently when communicating with one another. For example, people frequently produce manual gestures while speaking, and the words a person perceives are impacted by visual information. For this study, we hypothesized that similar to the way that humans regularly couple their spoken utterances with gestures and facial expressions, chimpanzees regularly produce vocalizations in conjunction with other communicative signals. To test this hypothesis, data were collected from 101 captive chimpanzees living in mixed-sex social groupings of seven to twelve individuals. A total of 2,869 vocal events were collected. The data indicate that approximately 50% of the vocal events were produced in conjunction with another communicative modality. In addition, approximately 68% were directed to a specific individual, and these directed vocalizations were more likely to include a signal from another communicative modality than were vocalizations that were not directed to a specific individual. These results suggest that, like humans, chimpanzees often pair their vocalizations with signals from other communicative modalities. In addition, chimpanzees appear to use their communicative signals strategically to meet specific socio-communicative ends, providing support for the growing literature that indicates that at least some chimpanzee vocal signaling is intentional. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Snakes are presumed to be hazards to primates, including humans, by the snake detection hypothesis (Isbell in J Hum Evol 51:1–35, 2006; Isbell, The fruit, the tree, and the serpent. Why we see so well, 2009). Quantitative, systematic data to test this idea are lacking for the behavioural ecology of living great apes and human foragers. An alternative proxy is snakes encountered by primatologists seeking, tracking, and observing wild chimpanzees. We present 4 years of such data from Mt. Assirik, Senegal. We encountered 14 species of snakes a total of 142 times. Almost two-thirds of encounters were with venomous snakes. Encounters occurred most often in forest and least often in grassland, and more often in the dry season. The hypothesis seems to be supported, if frequency of encounter reflects selective risk of morbidity or mortality. © 2015, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: Socioecological models predict that as resources become more sparsely distributed, primate populations will occur at lower densities and this demographic shift may have some effect on social structure. In savanna-woodland habitats, chimpanzees live at lower densities and in larger home ranges compared to forested habitats, presumably because of more widely dispersed food availability. These factors may result in chimpanzee home ranges being economically undefendable, leading to a reduction in male philopatry and territoriality. To test this hypothesis, we genotyped 237 fecal samples collected from Ugalla at 12 autosomal and 13 Y-chromosome microsatellite loci. We considered individuals that were sampled together at the same place and time to have been associating in the same party; with repeated sampling of an individual in different places and with different associates, we established which individuals belonged to the same community and the community locations. We identified 44 females and 69 males, carrying four different Y-chromosome haplotypes. One Y-chromosome haplotype was prevalent and found throughout the study site. The three rarer haplotypes occurred in spatially discrete clusters, which corresponded with the locations of communities identified through analysis of autosomal genotypes. Together with an observation of an aggressive interaction, these results suggest that, like chimpanzees living in species-typical forest habitats, the chimpanzees of Ugalla are organized into male philopatric, territorial communities, and that this social structure is reliably expressed under a variety of ecological conditions. This study reminds us that primate social structures may be adaptive across a range of habitats, and/or subject to phylogenetic constraint. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: One of the most conspicuous behavioural differences among great apes is the paucity of tool use among wild bonobos (Pan paniscus) in comparison to chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) who are one of the most prolific and skilled tool users in the animal kingdom. This is in spite of the fact that bonobo tool use repertories are as large and diverse as chimpanzees' in captive settings. In this study, we compared tool using behaviours and potential drivers of these behaviours in the Wamba bonobo population located in central Democratic Republic of Congo with the Goualougo chimpanzee population of northern Republic of Congo. The tool use repertoire of wild bonobos was comprised of only 13 behaviours, compared to 42 for chimpanzees. However, the number of tool behaviours observed in each study site was similar between bonobos and chimpanzees, and many types of tool use for social, self-grooming/stimulation, and comfort/protection functions were commonly used by both species. A marked difference is that 25 of 42 tool behaviours exhibited by chimpanzees are performed for feeding, in contrast to a single report of bonobos using a leaf sponge to drink water. We examined whether the differences in tool use repertoires can be explained by the necessity, opportunity, relative profitability, or invention hypotheses. We found that habitat composition and fluctuation of fruit production at these two sites were similar, particularly when compared with variation observed between sites within each species. Thus it was unlikely that the necessity hypothesis explains the lack of tool use for feeding in bonobos. Though further study at Wamba is needed, we did not identify any obvious differences in prey availability that would indicate differences in tool using opportunities between the sites. This study could not test the relative profitability hypothesis, and further research is needed on whether tool use is the most efficient means of calorie or protein intake for wild apes. Bonobos at Wamba formed much larger and stable parties than chimpanzees at Goualougo, which was contrary to the prediction by the invention hypothesis. Another explanation is that differences in tool use behaviour between bonobos and chimpanzees might not be explained by the current ecological or social conditions, but rather by circumstances during the Pleistocene Epoch. The observed species differences might also reflect divergent behavioural predispositions, rather than actual differences in cognitive abilities. © 2015 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.

ABSTRACT: The presence of neutralising antibodies (NAbs) against adenovirus in the population is a major hurdle preventing the effective use of replication-defective adenoviruses (Ads) as candidates for gene therapy and vaccine vectors for many diseases. Only a few studies have described the epidemiology of pre-existing immunity to chimpanzee Ads in China. To assess the prevalence of NAbs to chimpanzee adenovirus serotypes 6 and 7 (AdC6 and AdC7), we enrolled 998 healthy participants from five regions in China as well as 196 chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) patients and 193 primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients from Chongqing, China. The total seroprevalence rates of AdC6 and AdC7 NAbs in the healthy participants were 12.22 % (122/998) (95 % confidence interval [CI], 10.34-14.40 %) and 13.13 % (131/998) (95 % CI, 11.17-15.36 %), respectively. The seroprevalence rates of AdC6 and AdC7 NAbs in the HBV patients were 21.43 % (42/196) (95 % CI, 16.26-27.69 %) and 25.51 % (50/196) (95 % CI, 19.92-32.04 %), respectively. The seroprevalence rates of AdC6 and AdC7 NAbs in the HCC patients were 27.46 % (53/193) (95 % CI, 21.65-34.15 %) and 31.09 % (60/193) (95 % CI, 24.98-37.93 %), respectively. The seroprevalence rates of these Ads were not associated with age and gender. The present study may provide useful insights for developing future AdC-based vaccines and gene therapies. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.

ABSTRACT: In a highly social species like chimpanzees, the process by which individuals become attuned to their social environment may be of vital importance to their chances of survival. Typically, this socialization process, defined by all acquisition experiences and fine-tuning efforts of social interaction patterns during ontogeny, occurs in large part through parental investment. In this study, we investigated whether maternal presence enhances the socialization process in chimpanzees by comparing the social interactions of orphaned and mother-reared individuals at the Chimfunshi Wildlife Orphanage Trust in Zambia. As response variables, we selected social interactions during which an elaborate level of fine-tuning is assumed to be necessary for sustaining the interaction and preventing escalation: social play. Comparing orphaned (n = 8) to sex- and age-matched mother-reared juvenile chimpanzees (n = 9), we hypothesized that the orphaned juveniles would play less frequently than the mother-reared and would be less equipped for fine-tuning social play (which we assayed by rates of aggression) because of the lack of a safe and facilitating social environment provided by the mother. First, contrary to our hypothesis, results showed that the orphaned juveniles engaged in social play more frequently than the mother-reared juveniles, although for significantly shorter amounts of time. Second, in support of our hypothesis, results showed that social play of the orphaned juveniles more often resulted in aggression than social play of the mother-reared juveniles. In conjunction, these results may indicate that, just like in humans, chimpanzee mothers provide their offspring with adequate social skills that might be of pivotal importance for future challenges like successful group-living and securing competitive fitness advantages. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Human pinworms, Enterobius vermicularis, are normally recognized as minor pathogens. However, a fatal case of human pinworm infection has been reported in a nonhuman primate, a zoo reared chimpanzee. Here, we histopathologically examined the lesions in tissues from the deceased chimpanzee and genetically characterized the isolated worms to investigate the pathogenicity and determine the phylogeny. We identified ulcers deep in the submucosa where many parasites were found to have invaded the lamina propria mucosa or submucous tissue. An inflammatory reaction consisting mainly of neutrophils and lymphocytes but not eosinophils was observed around the parasites, and intense hemorrhage in the lamina propria was confirmed. The parasites were morphologically similar to E. vermicularis based on the shape of the copulatory spicules. Mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene products were amplified from worm DNA by PCR and were genetically identified as E. vermicularis based on >98.7 % similarity of partial sequences. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the sequences clustered together with other chimpanzee E. vermicularis isolates in a group which has been referred to as type C and which differs from human isolates (type A). The samples were negative for bacterial pathogens and Entamoeba histolytica indicating that E. vermicularis could be pathogenic in chimpanzees. Phylogenetic clustering of the isolates indicated that the parasite may be host specific. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: In the wild, primates are selective over the routes that they take when foraging and seek out preferred or ephemeral food. Given this, we tested how a group of captive chimpanzees weighed the relative benefits and costs of foraging for food in their environment when a less-preferred food could be obtained with less effort than a more-preferred food. In this study, a social group of six zoo-housed chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) could collect PVC tokens and exchange them with researchers for food rewards at one of two locations. Food preference tests had revealed that, for these chimpanzees, grapes were a highly-preferred food while carrot pieces were a less-preferred food. The chimpanzees were tested in three phases, each comprised of 30 thirty-minute sessions. In phases 1 and 3, if the chimpanzees exchanged a token at the location they collected them they received a carrot piece (no travel) or they could travel ≥10 m to exchange tokens for grapes at a second location. In phase 2, the chimpanzees had to travel for both rewards (≥10 m for carrot pieces, ≥15 m for grapes). The chimpanzees learned how to exchange tokens for food rewards, but there was individual variation in the time it took for them to make their first exchange and to discover the different exchange locations. Once all the chimpanzees were proficient at exchanging tokens, they exchanged more tokens for grapes (phase 3). However, when travel was required for both rewards (phase 2), the chimpanzees were less likely to work for either reward. Aside fromthe alpha male, all chimpanzees exchanged tokens for both reward types, demonstrating their ability to explore the available options. Contrary to our predictions, low-ranked individuals made more exchanges than high-ranked individuals, most likely because, in this protocol, chimpanzees could not monopolize the tokens or access to exchange locations. Although the chimpanzees showed a preference for exchanging tokens for their more-preferred food, they appeared to develop strategies to reduce the cost associated with obtaining the grapes, including scrounging rewards and tokens fromgroup mates and carrying more than one token when travelling to the farther exchange location. By testing the chimpanzees in their social group we were able to tease apart the social and individual influences on their decision making and the interplay with the physical demands of the task, which revealed that the chimpanzees were willing to travel farther for better. © 2015 Hopper et al.

ABSTRACT: Humans and primates are long-lived animals with long reproductive phases. One factor that appears to contribute to longevity and fertility in humans, as well as to cancer-free survival, is the transcription factor and tumor suppressor p53, controlled by its main negative regulator MDM2. However, p53 and MDM2 homologs are found throughout the metazoan kingdom from Trichoplacidae to Hominidae. Therefore the question arises, if p53/MDM2 contributes to the shaping of primate features, then through which mechanisms. Previous findings have indicated that the appearances of novel p53-regulated genes and wild-type p53 variants during primate evolution are important in this context. Here, we report on another mechanism of potential relevance. Human endogenous retrovirus K subgroup HML-2 (HERV-K(HML-2)) type 1 proviral sequences were formed in the genomes of the predecessors of contemporary Hominoidea and can be identified in the genomes of Nomascus leucogenys (gibbon) up to Homo sapiens. We previously reported on an alternative splicing event in HERV-K(HML-2) type 1 proviruses that can give rise to nuclear protein of 9 kDa (Np9). We document here the evolution of Np9-coding capacity in human, chimpanzee and gorilla, and show that the C-terminal half of Np9 binds directly to MDM2, through a domain of MDM2 that is known to be contacted by various cellular proteins in response to stress. Np9 can inhibit the MDM2 ubiquitin ligase activity toward p53 in the cell nucleus, and can support the transactivation of genes by p53. Our findings point to the possibility that endogenous retrovirus protein Np9 contributes to the regulation of the p53-MDM2 pathway specifically in humans, chimpanzees and gorillas. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

ABSTRACT: The influence of stress in an environment, according with the behavioral and endocrine variables of primates, are increasingly being studied by a diversity of authors, and have shown that abnormal behaviors associated with increased glucocorticoids may be directly related with the impairment of their well-being. In this work were used 22 adult chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), 11 males and 11 females, kept in captivity in three different institutions. All animals had their behavior registered by focal session using a 30 seconds sample interval, during six months, totaling 4,800 registries per each animal. During this period, fecal samples were collected 3 times a week for the extraction and measurement of the concentration of fecal metabolites of glucocorticoid by radioimmunoassay. Of the total observed, stereotypical behaviors represented 13,45±2.76%, and among them, self-mutilation represented 38.28±3.98 %. The animals were classified into three different scores, according with the percentage of body surface with alopecia due to self-mutilation. It was found a positive correlation of high intensity between the scores of alopecia due to the observed mutilation and the average concentrations of fecal metabolites of glucocorticoids. This result strongly suggests that this measurement of self-mutilation in a chimpanzee can be used as an important auxiliary tool to evaluate de conditions of adaptation of an animal in captivity, functioning as a direct indicator of the presence of chronic stress.

ABSTRACT: One of the major contributions of recent personality psychology is the finding that traits are related to each other in an organized hierarchy. To date, however, researchers have yet to investigate this hierarchy in nonhuman primates. Such investigations are critical in confirming the cross-species nature of trait personality helping to illuminate personality as neurobiologically-based and evolutionarily-derived dimensions of primate disposition. Investigations of potential genetic polymorphisms associated with hierarchical models of personality among nonhuman primates represent a critical first step. The current study examined the hierarchical structure of chimpanzee personality as well as sex-specific associations with a polymorphism in the promoter region of the vasopressin V1a receptor gene (AVPR1A), a gene associated with dispositional traits, among 174 chimpanzees. Results confirmed a hierarchical structure of personality across species and, despite differences in early rearing experiences, suggest a sexually dimorphic role of AVPR1A polymorphisms on hierarchical personality profiles at a higher-order level. © 2014 Latzman et al.

ABSTRACT: Ebolavirus disease causes high mortality, and the current outbreak has spread unabated through West Africa. Human adenovirus type 5 vectors (rAd5) encoding ebolavirus glycoprotein (GP) generate protective immunity against acute lethal Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) challenge in macaques, but fail to protect animals immune to Ad5, suggesting natural Ad5 exposure may limit vaccine efficacy in humans. Here we show that a chimpanzee-derived replication-defective adenovirus (ChAd) vaccine also rapidly induced uniform protection against acute lethal EBOV challenge in macaques. Because protection waned over several months, we boosted ChAd3 with modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) and generated, for the first time, durable protection against lethal EBOV challenge. © 2014 Nature America, Inc.

ABSTRACT: When searching for hidden food, do chimpanzees take into account both the number of hidden items and the number of potential hiding locations? We presented chimpanzees with two trays, each of them containing a different food/cup ratio and therefore a different likelihood of finding a baited cup among empty alternatives. Subjects' performance was directly influenced by the relative difference (probability ratio (PR)) between the two given probabilities. Interestingly, however, they did not appreciate the special value of a truly safe option (with P = 1.0). Instead, they seemed to 'blindly' rely on the PR between the two options, systematically preferring the more likely one once a certain threshold had been reached. A control condition ruled out the possibility of low-level learning explanations for the observed performance. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Human societies are characterized by more cultural diversity than chimpanzee communities. However, it is currently unclear what mechanism might be driving this difference. Because reliance on social information is a pivotal characteristic of culture, we investigated individual and social information reliance in children and chimpanzees. We repeatedly presented subjects with a reward-retrieval task on which they had collected conflicting individual and social information of equal accuracy in counterbalanced order. While both species relied mostly on their individual information, children but not chimpanzees searched for the reward at the socially demonstrated location more than at a random location. Moreover, only children used social information adaptively when individual knowledge on the location of the reward had not yet been obtained. Social information usage determines information transmission and in conjunction with mechanisms that create cultural variants, such as innovation, it facilitates diversity. Our results may help explain why humans are more culturally diversified than chimpanzees. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The birth of new genes is an important motor of evolutionary innovation. Whereas many new genes arise by gene duplication, others originate at genomic regions that did not contain any genes or gene copies. Some of these newly expressed genes may acquire coding or non-coding functions and be preserved by natural selection. However, it is yet unclear which is the prevalence and underlying mechanisms of de novo gene emergence. In order to obtain a comprehensive view of this process, we have performed in-depth sequencing of the transcriptomes of four mammalian species—human, chimpanzee, macaque, and mouse—and subsequently compared the assembled transcripts and the corresponding syntenic genomic regions. This has resulted in the identification of over five thousand new multiexonic transcriptional events in human and/or chimpanzee that are not observed in the rest of species. Using comparative genomics, we show that the expression of these transcripts is associated with the gain of regulatory motifs upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) and of U1 snRNP sites downstream of the TSS. In general, these transcripts show little evidence of purifying selection, suggesting that many of them are not functional. However, we find signatures of selection in a subset of de novo genes which have evidence of protein translation. Taken together, the data support a model in which frequently-occurring new transcriptional events in the genome provide the raw material for the evolution of new proteins. © 2015 Ruiz-Orera et al.

ABSTRACT: The virus-host relationship in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infected chimpanzees is thought to be different from that found in other SIV infected African primates. However, studies of captive SIVcpz infected chimpanzees are limited. Previously, the natural SIVcpz infection of one chimpanzee, and the experimental infection of six chimpanzees was reported, with limited follow-up. Here, we present a long-term study of these seven animals, with a retrospective re-examination of the early stages of infection. The only clinical signs consistent with AIDS or AIDS associated disease was thrombocytopenia in two cases, associated with the development of anti-platelet antibodies. However, compared to uninfected and HIV-1 infected animals, SIVcpz infected animals had significantly lower levels of peripheral blood CD4+ T-cells. Despite this, levels of T-cell activation in chronic infection were not significantly elevated. In addition, while plasma levels of β2 microglobulin, neopterin and soluble TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (sTRAIL) were elevated in acute infection, these markers returned to near-normal levels in chronic infection, reminiscent of immune activation patterns in ‘natural host’ species. Furthermore, plasma soluble CD14 was not elevated in chronic infection. However, examination of the secondary lymphoid environment revealed persistent changes to the lymphoid structure, including follicular hyperplasia in SIVcpz infected animals. In addition, both SIV and HIV-1 infected chimpanzees showed increased levels of deposition of collagen and increased levels of Mx1 expression in the T-cell zones of the lymph node. The outcome of SIVcpz infection of captive chimpanzees therefore shares features of both non-pathogenic and pathogenic lentivirus infections. © 2015 Greenwood et al.

ABSTRACT: For years, the animal culture debate has been dominated by the puzzling absence of direct evidence for social transmission of behavioral innovations in the flagship species of animal culture, the common chimpanzee. Although social learning of novel behaviors has been documented in captivity, critics argue that these findings lack ecological validity and therefore may not be relevant for understanding the evolution of culture. For the wild, it is possible that groupspecific behavioral differences emerge because group members respond individually to unspecified environmental differences, rather than learning from each other. In a recent paper, we used social network analyses in wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) to provide direct evidence for social transmission of a behavioral innovation, moss-sponging, to extract water from a tree hole. Here, we discuss the implications of our findings and how our new methodological approach could help future studies of social learning and culture in wild apes. © Thibaud Gruber, Timothée Poisot, Klaus Zuberbühler, William Hoppitt, and Catherine Hobaiter.

ABSTRACT: The importance of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in protection against hepatitis C virus (HCV) remains controversial. We infused a chimpanzee with H06 immunoglobulin from a genotype 1a HCV-infected patient and challenged with genotype strains efficiently neutralized by H06 in vitro. Genotype 1a NAbs afforded no protection against genotype 4a or 5a. Protection against homologous 1a lasted 18 weeks, but infection emerged when NAb titers waned. However, 6a infection was prevented. The differential in vivo neutralization patterns have implications for HCV vaccine development. © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

ABSTRACT: Prospective memory (PM) involves remembering to do something at a specific time in the future. Here, we investigate the beginnings of this ability in young children (3-year-olds; Homo sapiens) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) using an analogous task. Subjects were given a choice between two toys (children) or two food items (chimpanzees). The selected item was delivered immediately, whereas the unselected item was hidden in an opaque container. After completing an ongoing quantity discrimination task, subjects could request the hidden item by asking for it (children) or by pointing to the container and identifying the item on a symbol board (chimpanzees). Children and chimpanzees showed evidence of prospective-like memory in this task, as evidenced by successful retrieval of the item at the end of the task, sometimes spontaneously with no prompting from the experimenter. These findings contribute to our understanding of PM from an ontogenetic and comparative perspective. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: We investigated nesting behavior of non habituated chimpanzees populating the Nimba Mountains to document their abundance and their criterions of nesting-site selection. During a 19-month study we walked 80km of transects and recces each month, and recorded 764 nests (mean group size=2.23 nests) along with characteristics of vegetation structure and composition, topography, and seasonality. Population density estimated with two nest count methods ranged between 0.14 and 0.65chimpanzee/km2. These values are lower than previous estimates, emphasizing the necessity of protecting remaining wild ape populations. Chimpanzees built nests in 108 tree species out of 437 identified, but 2.3% of total species comprised 52% of nests. Despite they preferred nesting in trees of 25-29cm DBH and at a mean height of 8.02m, we recorded an important proportion of terrestrial nests (8.2%) that may reflect a cultural trait of Nimba chimpanzees. A logistic model of nest presence formulated as a function of 12 habitat variables revealed preference for gallery and mountain forests rather than lowland forest, and old-growth forest rather than secondary forests. They nested more frequently in the study area during the dry season (December-April). The highest probability of observing nests was at 770m altitude, particularly in steep locations (mean ground declivity=15.54%). Several of the reported nest characteristics combined with the existence of two geographically separated clusters of nest, suggest that the study area constitutes the non-overlapping peripheral areas of two distinct communities. This nest-based study led us to findings on the behavioral ecology of Nimba chimpanzees, which constitute crucial knowledge to implement efficient and purpose-built conservation. 76:999-1010, © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Although wild chimpanzees and other African great apes live in regions endemic for African sleeping sickness, very little is known about their trypanosome infections, mainly due to major difficulties in obtaining their blood samples. In present work, we established a diagnostic ITS1-based PCR assay that allows detection of the DNA of all four Trypanosoma brucei subspecies (Trypanosoma bruceibrucei, Trypanosoma bruceirhodesiense, Trypanosoma bruceigambiense, and Trypanosoma bruceievansi) in feces of experimentally infected mice. Next, using this assay we revealed the presence of trypanosomes in the fecal samples of wild chimpanzees and this finding was further supported by results obtained using a set of primate tissue samples. Phylogenetic analysis of the ITS1 region showed that the majority of obtained sequences fell into the robust T. brucei group, providing strong evidence that these infections were caused by T. b. rhodesiense and/or T. b. gambiense. The optimized technique of trypanosome detection in feces will improve our knowledge about the epidemiology of trypanosomes in primates and possibly also other endangered mammals, from which blood and tissue samples cannot be obtained.Finally, we demonstrated that the mandrill serum was able to efficiently lyse T. b. brucei and T. b. rhodesiense, and to some extent T. b. gambiense, while the chimpanzee serum failed to lyse any of these subspecies. © 2015 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: The Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes ellioti) is found in the Gulf of Guinea biodiversity hotspot located in western equatorial Africa. This subspecies is threatened by habitat fragmentation due to logging and agricultural development, hunting for the bushmeat trade, and possibly climate change. Although P. t. ellioti appears to be geographically separated from the neighboring central chimpanzee (P. t. troglodytes) by the Sanaga River, recent population genetics studies of chimpanzees from across this region suggest that additional factors may also be important in their separation. The main aims of this study were: 1) to model the distribution of suitable habitat for P. t. ellioti across Cameroon and Nigeria, and P. t. troglodytes in southern Cameroon, 2) to determine which environmental factors best predict their optimal habitats, and 3) to compare modeled niches and test for their levels of divergence from one another. A final aim of this study was to examine the ways that climate change might impact suitable chimpanzee habitat across the region under various scenarios. Results: Ecological niche models (ENMs) were created using the software package Maxent for the three populations of chimpanzees that have been inferred to exist in Cameroon and eastern Nigeria: (i) P. t. troglodytes in southern Cameroon, (ii) P. t. ellioti in northwestern Cameroon, and (iii) P. t. ellioti in central Cameroon. ENMs for each population were compared using the niche comparison test in ENMtools, which revealed complete niche divergence with very little geographic overlap of suitable habitat between populations. Conclusions: These findings suggest that a positive relationship may exist between environmental variation and the partitioning of genetic variation found in chimpanzees across this region. ENMs for each population were also projected under three different climate change scenarios for years 2020, 2050, and 2080. Suitable habitat of P. t. ellioti in northwest Cameroon / eastern Nigeria is expected to remain largely unchanged through 2080 in all considered scenarios. In contrast, P. t. ellioti in central Cameroon, which represents half of the population of this subspecies, is expected to experience drastic reductions in its ecotone habitat over the coming century. © 2015 Sesink Clee et al.; licensee BioMed Central.

ABSTRACT: In the reversed-reward contingency task, subjects are required to choose the less preferred of two options in order to obtain the more preferred one. Usually, this task is used to measure inhibitory skills, but it could also be used to measure how strong the subjects' preferences are. We presented chimpanzees with support tasks where only one of two paper strips could physically bring food into reach. Subjects were rewarded for choosing the non-functional strip. In Experiment 1, subjects failed to pick the non-baited strip. In Experiment 2, subjects failed to pick the broken strip. Chimpanzees performed worse in these tasks than in other similar tasks where instead of paper strips, there were similar shapes painted on a platform. The fact that subjects found the reversed-reward contingency task based on causality more difficult to solve than a perceptually similar task with no causality involved (i.e., arbitrary) suggests that they did not treat real strips as an arbitrary task. Instead, they must have had some causal knowledge of the support problem that made them prefer functional over non-functional strips despite the contrary reward regime.

ABSTRACT: An important question in comparative psychology is whether human and nonhuman animals share similar principles of perceptual organization. Despite much empirical research, no firm conclusion has been drawn. The Solitaire illusion is a numerosity illusion in humans that occurs when one misperceives the relative number of 2 types of items presented in intermingled sets. To date, no study has investigated whether nonhuman animals perceive the Solitaire illusion as humans do. Here, we compared the perception of the Solitaire illusion in human and nonhuman primates in 3 experiments. We first observed (Experiment 1) the spontaneous behavior of chimpanzees when presented with 2 arrays composed of a different number of preferred and nonpreferred food items. In probe trials, preferred items were presented in the Solitaire pattern in 2 different spatial arrangements (either clustered centrally or distributed on the perimeter). Chimpanzees did not show any misperception of quantity in the Solitaire pattern. Next, humans, chimpanzees, rhesus monkeys, and capuchin monkeys underwent the same testing of relative quantity judgments in a computerized task that also presented the Solitaire illusion (Experiments 2 and 3). Unlike humans, chimpanzees did not appear to perceive the illusion, in agreement with Experiment 1. The performance of rhesus monkeys and capuchin monkeys was also different from that of humans, but was slightly more indicative of a potential Solitaire illusion. On the whole, our results suggest a potential discontinuity in the visual mechanisms underlying the Solitaire illusion between human and nonhuman primates. © 2014 American Psychological Association.

ABSTRACT: The basis for the pattern of adrenal androgen production in the chimpanzee, which resembles that of humans, is poorly defined. We characterized the developmental zonation and expression of elements of the androgen biosynthetic pathway in the chimpanzee adrenal. The newborn adrenal contained a broad fetal zone (FZ) expressing CYP17, SULT2A1, and Cytochrome B5 (CB5) but not HSD3B; the outer cortex expressed HSD3B but not SULT2A1 or CB5. During infancy, the FZ involuted and the HSD3B-expressing outer cortex broadened. By 3. years of age, a thin layer of cells that expressed CB5, SULT2A1, and CYP17 adjoined the medulla and likely represented the zona reticularis; the outer cortex consisted of distinct zonae fasiculata and glomerulosa. Thereafter, the zona reticularis broadened as also occurs in the human. The adult chimpanzee adrenal displayed other human-like characteristics: intramedullary clusters of reticularis-like cells and also a cortical cuff of zona fasiculata-like cells adjoining the central vein. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The context in which food is presented can alter quantity judgments leading to sub-optimal choice behavior. Humans often over-estimate food quantity on the basis of how food is presented. Food appears larger if plated on smaller dishes than larger dishes and liquid volumes appear larger in taller cups than shorter cups. Moreover, smaller but fuller containers are preferred in comparison to larger, but less full containers with a truly larger quantity. Here, we assessed whether similar phenomena occur in chimpanzees. Four chimpanzees chose between two amounts of food presented in different sized containers, a large (2 oz.) and small (1 oz.) cup. When different quantities were presented in the same-sized cups or when the small cup contained the larger quantity, chimpanzees were highly accurate in choosing the larger food amount. However, when different-sized cups contained the same amount of food or the smaller cup contained the smaller amount of food (but looked relatively fuller), the chimpanzees often showed a bias to select the smaller but fuller cup. These findings contribute to our understanding of how quantity estimation and portion judgment is impacted by the surrounding context in which it is presented. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Simian foamy virus (SFV) is a ubiquitous retrovirus in nonhuman primates (NHPs) that can be transmitted to humans, mostly through severe bites. In the past few years, our laboratory has identified more than 50 hunters from central Africa infected with zoonotic SFVs. Analysis of the complete sequences of five SFVs obtained from these individuals revealed that env was the most variable gene. Furthermore, recombinant SFV strains, some of which involve sequences in the env gene, were recently identified. Here, we investigated the variability of the env genes of zoonotic SFV strains and searched for possible recombinants. We sequenced the complete env gene or its surface glycoprotein region (SU) from DNA amplified from the blood of (i) a series of 40 individuals from Cameroon or Gabon infected with a gorilla or chimpanzee foamy virus (FV) strain and (ii) 1 gorilla and 3 infected chimpanzees living in the same areas as these hunters. Phylogenetic analyses revealed the existence of two env variants among both the gorilla and chimpanzee FV strains that were present in zoonotic and NHP strains. These variants differ greatly (>30% variability) in a 753-bp-long region located in the receptor-binding domain of SU, whereas the rest of the gene is very conserved. Although the organizations of the Env protein sequences are similar, the potential glycosylation patterns differ between variants. Analysis of recombination suggests that the variants emerged through recombination between different strains, although all parental strains could not be identified. © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

ABSTRACT: Sexual conflict develops when the optimal reproductive strategy for one sex inflicts fitness costs upon the other sex. Among species with intense within-group feeding competition and high costs of reproduction, females are expected to experience reduced foraging efficiency by associating with males, and this may compromise their reproductive ability. Here, we test this hypothesis in chimpanzees, a species with flexible grouping patterns in which female avoidance of large subgroups has been attributed to their relatively high costs of grouping. In an >11-year study of the Kanyawara community of East African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) in the Kibale National Park, Uganda, the availability of sexually receptive females was a key determinant of the number of males in parties. In turn, females experienced significantly lower C-peptide of insulin levels, indicative of reduced energy balance, during periods when they associated with more males. Female associates did not produce the same negative effect. C-peptide levels positively and significantly predicted female ovarian steroid production, indicating that the costs of associating with males can lead to downstream reproductive costs. Therefore, we conclude that Kanyawara chimpanzees exhibit sexual conflict over subgroup formation, with the large groupings that allow males to compete for mating opportunities inflicting energetic and reproductive costs on females. Because association with males is central to female chimpanzees’ anti-infanticide strategy, and males may confer other benefits, we propose that reproductive success in female chimpanzees hinges on a delicate balance between the costs and benefits of associating with male conspecifics. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Why do chimpanzees react when their partner gets a better deal than them? Do they note the inequity or do their responses reflect frustration in response to unattainable rewards? To tease apart inequity and contrast, we tested chimpanzees in a series of conditions that created loss through individual contrast, through inequity, or by both. Chimpanzees were tested in four social and two individual conditions in which they received food rewards in return for exchanging tokens with an experimenter. In conditions designed to create individual contrast, after completing an exchange, the chimpanzees were given a relatively less-preferred reward than the one they were previously shown. The chimpanzees’ willingness to accept the less-preferred rewards was independent of previously offered foods in both the social and individual conditions. In conditions that created frustration through inequity, subjects were given a less-preferred reward than the one received by their partner, but not in relation to the reward they were previously offered. In a social context, females were more likely to refuse to participate when they received a less-preferred reward than their partner (disadvantageous inequity), than when they received a more-preferred reward (advantageous inequity). Specifically, the females’ refusals were typified by refusals to exchange tokens rather than refusals to accept food rewards. Males showed no difference in their responses to inequity or individual contrast. These results support previous evidence that some chimpanzees’ responses to inequity are mediated more strongly by what others receive than by frustration effects. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: In the wild, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are often faced with clumped food resources that they may know how to access but abstain from doing so due to social pressures. To better understand how social settings influence resource acquisition, we tested fifteen semi-wild chimpanzees from two social groups alone and in the presence of others. We investigated how resource acquisition was affected by relative social dominance, whether collaborative problem solving or (active or passive) sharing occurred amongst any of the dyads, and whether these outcomes were related to relationship quality as determined from six months of observational data. Results indicated that chimpanzees obtained fewer rewards when tested in the presence of others compared to when they were tested alone, and this loss tended to be greater when paired with a higher ranked individual. Individuals demonstrated behavioral inhibition; chimpanzees who showed proficient skill when alone often abstained from solving the task when in the presence of others. Finally, individuals with close social relationships spent more time together in the problem solving space, but collaboration and sharing were infrequent and sessions in which collaboration or sharing did occur contained more instances of aggression. Group living provides benefits and imposes costs, and these findings highlight that one cost of group living may be diminishing productive individual behaviors. © 2014 Cronin et al.

ABSTRACT: Positive reinforcement training can be used in many ways to enhance the welfare of captive primates. Training for biologic sample collection is one application of positive reinforcement training. In this study, 35 adult female chimpanzees were trained to cooperate with the collection of urine samples needed to facilitate a research study. A median of 35 training sessions was required for the subjects to reach reliable performance (4 of 5 sequential attempts successful) of the urine collection behavior. Adult age had no effect on the speed of learning as indicated by a rank order correlation. Individual differences in the rate of learning were pronounced but did not vary with the age of the chimpanzees. Approximately 2 y after the initial training, and with continual sample collection taking place twice weekly, we assessed the reliability of their performance and found that the chimpanzees cooperated 100% of the time and that collection of a urine sample required about 5 min. Positive reinforcement training can markedly reduce staff time, particularly for studies such as this that require frequent biologic sample collection over long durations. Similar approaches could be used to train other laboratory primates to cooperate with urine collection procedures. Animal training programs that emphasize positive reinforcement training are an important refinement in the care of laboratory primates.

ABSTRACT: Much of human cooperation takes place in mutualistic contexts in which the main challenge for individuals is how to coordinate decisions. In the current studies,we compared the abilities of chimpanzees and young children to coordinate with a partner in two versions of a Stag Hunt game. When risks were low (the hare was of low value) and information was cheap (the partner’s behaviour was readily observable), partners of both species were able to successfully coordinate on the higher value stag more than 90% of the time. By contrast, when the risks were raised and observing the partner was more difficult, the chimpanzees became less successful, whereas the children compensated, and so remained highly successful, by communicating more often and more specifically. This pattern of results is consistent with the hypothesis that humans evolved unique skills of coordination and communication in the context of especially risky coordination problems. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Along with social grooming and food sharing, social play is considered to be an affiliative interaction among wild chimpanzees. However, infant, juvenile, and adolescent animals engage in social play more frequently than adult animals, while other affiliative interactions occur more commonly between adults. We studied the social play of well-habituated and individually identified wild chimpanzees of the M group in Mahale Mountains National Park, Tanzania over two research periods in 2010 and 2011 (21 and 17 observation days, respectively). In both periods, most members of the M group, including adolescents and adults, took part in social play at least once. The degree centralities of the play network in infants, juveniles, and adolescents were significantly higher than those seen in adults. There was a significant and positive correlation between the total number of participations in social play and the degree centrality of play networks. Partial play networks and partial association networks consisting of individuals in same-age categories were significantly and positively correlated in infants and juveniles, although they were not correlated in adolescents or adults. These results suggest that infants, juveniles and adolescents who played frequently were more central in the group, whilst the adults who played infrequently were more peripheral. In addition, the overall structure of the social play network was stable over time. The frequency of participation in social play positively contributed to the development of affiliative social relationships within the chimpanzee group during the infant or juvenile period, but did not have the same effect during the adolescent and adult period. The social play network may allow individuals to develop the social techniques necessary to acquire a central position in a society and enable them to develop affiliative relationships during the infant or juvenile period. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: We investigated whether chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) misperceived food portion sizes depending upon the context in which they were presented, something that often affects how much humans serve themselves and subsequently consume. Chimpanzees judged same-sized and smaller food portions to be larger in amount when presented on a small plate compared to an equal or larger food portion presented on a large plate and did so despite clearly being able to tell the difference in portions when plate size was identical. These results are consistent with data from the human literature in which people misperceive food portion sizes as a function of plate size. This misperception is attributed to the Delboeuf illusion which occurs when the size of a central item is misperceived on the basis of its surrounding context. These results demonstrate a cross-species shared visual misperception of portion size that affects choice behavior, here in a nonhuman species for which there is little experience with tests that involve choosing between food amounts on dinnerware. The biases resulting in this form of misperception of food portions appear to have a deep-rooted evolutionary history which we share with, at minimum, our closest living nonhuman relative, the chimpanzee. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: For some traits, the human genome is more closely related to either the bonobo or the chimpanzee genome than they are to each other. Therefore, it becomes crucial to understand whether and how morphostructural differences between humans, chimpanzees and bonobos reflect the well known phylogeny. Here we comparatively investigated intra and extra labyrinthine semicircular canals orientation using 260 computed tomography scans of extant humans ( Homo sapiens), bonobos (Pan paniscus) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes ). Humans and bonobos proved more similarities between themselves than with chimpanzees. This finding did not fit with the well established chimpanzee - bonobo monophyly. One hypothesis was convergent evolution in which bonobos and humans produce independently similar phenotypes possibly in response to similar selective pressures that may be associated with postural adaptations. Another possibility was convergence following a ''random walk'' (Brownian motion) evolutionary model. A more parsimonious explanation was that the bonobo-human labyrinthine shared morphology more closely retained the ancestral condition with chimpanzees being subsequently derived. Finally, these results might be a consequence of genetic diversity and incomplete lineage sorting. The remarkable symmetry of the Semicircular Canals was the second major finding of this article with possible applications in taphonomy. It has the potential to investigate altered fossils, inferring the probability of post-mortem deformation which can lead to difficulties in understanding taxonomic variation, phylogenetic relationships, and functional morphology. © 2014 El Khoury et al.

ABSTRACT: Broadly cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies (bNabs) represent powerful tools to combat human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Here, we examined whether HIV-1-specific bNabs are capable of cross-neutralizing distantly related simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) infecting central (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) (SIVcpzPtt) and eastern (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) (SIVcpzPts) chimpanzees (n=11) as well as western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) (SIVgor) (n=1). We found that bNabs directed against the CD4 binding site (n_10), peptidoglycans at the base of variable loop 3 (V3) (n=5), and epitopes at the interface of surface (gp120) and membrane-bound (gp41) envelope glycoproteins (n=5) failed to neutralize SIVcpz and SIVgor strains. In addition, apex V2-directed bNabs (n=3) as well as llama-derived (heavy chain only) antibodies (n=6) recognizing both the CD4 binding site and gp41 epitopes were either completely inactive or neutralized only a fraction of SIVcpzPtt strains. In contrast, one antibody targeting the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of gp41 (10E8), functional CD4 and CCR5 receptor mimetics (eCD4-Ig, eCD4-Igmim2, CD4-218.3-E51, and CD4-218.3-E51-mim2), as well as mono- and bispecific anti-human CD4 (iMab and LM52) and CCR5 (PRO140, PRO140-10E8) receptor antibodies neutralized>90% of SIVcpz and SIVgor strains with low-nanomolar (0.13 to 8.4 nM) potency. Importantly, the latter antibodies blocked virus entry not only in TZM-bl cells but also in Cf2Th cells expressing chimpanzee CD4 and CCR5 and neutralized SIVcpz in chimpanzee CD4_ T cells, with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) ranging from 3.6 to 40.5 nM. These findings provide new insight into the protective capacity of anti-HIV-1 bNabs and identify candidates for further development to combat SIVcpz infection. © 2015 Barbian et al.

ABSTRACT: A few years after the origin of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-2 was identified as the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) of the sooty mangabey, chimpanzees were found to naturally carry an SIV (SIVcpz) that is closely related to HIV-1, the virus responsible for the acquired immune deficiency syndrome pandemic. Among non-human primates, chimpanzees are uniquely susceptible to infection with primary isolates of HIV-1, with a generally nonpathogenic outcome. However, reports of the outcome of SIVcpz infection are conflicting. In this chapter we review the insights gained from extensive investigations of SIVcpz in wild chimpanzee populations, discuss the origin of SIVcpz, and evaluate the most recent estimates for the time that chimpanzees have been exposed to the virus. We examine reports of the consequences of SIVcpz infection in chimpanzees and discuss how SIVcpz might be distinguished from SIVs in other natural hosts. Finally, we outline the major outstanding issues that must be resolved to complete our understanding of this subject. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Wild chimpanzees routinely share high-value resources such as meat obtained through hunting and fruit procured from raiding crops. Although it is predicted that the proximate mechanisms for sharing behaviour are the result of reciprocity, interchange and mutualism, examinations of these factors in captivity have not mirrored the degree to which they are found in the wild. The goal of the current study was to investigate how a group of seven captive chimpanzees responded when a highly desirable and monopolizable resource diminished over the course of eight months. To do this we measured the amount of time that was spent sharing food at an artificial termite mound as well as the relationship between dyads that spent time sharing. Our results contradicted our predictions that rates of aggression would increase and the number of individuals fishing at the termite mound would decrease when resources diminished, as we observed no difference in either variable over time. We did, though, find an increase in the amount of sharing as the number of baited holes decreased. We also found a correlation between the strength of dyadic relationships outside of the study and the amount of time that individuals spent sharing with each other. © 2014 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.

ABSTRACT: Regional variations in tool use among chimpanzee subspecies and between populations within the same subspecies can often be explained by ecological constraints, although cultural variation also occurs. In this study we provide data on tool use by a small, recently isolated population of the endangered Nigeria–Cameroon chimpanzee Pan troglodytesellioti, thus demonstrating regional variation in tool use in this rarely studied subspecies. We found that the Ngel Nyaki chimpanzee community has its own unique tool kit consisting of five different tool types. We describe a tool type that has rarely been observed (ant-digging stick) and a tool type that has never been recorded for this chimpanzee subspecies or in West Central Africa (food pound/grate stone). Our results suggest that there is fine- scale variation in tool use among geographically close communities of P. t. ellioti, and that these variations likely reflect both ecological constraints and cultural variation. © 2014, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: Evolutionary theory predicts that natural selection will fashion cognitive biases to guide when, and from whom, individuals acquire social information, but the precise nature of these biases, especially in ecologically valid group contexts, remains unknown. We exposed four captive groups of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) to a novel extractive foraging device and, by fitting statistical models, isolated four simultaneously operating transmission biases. These include biases to copy (i) higher-ranking and (ii) expert individuals, and to copy others when (iii) uncertain or (iv) of low rank. High-ranking individuals were relatively un-strategic in their use of acquired knowledge, which, combined with the bias for others to observe them, may explain reports that high innovation rates (in juveniles and subordinates) do not generate a correspondingly high frequency of traditions in chimpanzees. Given the typically low rank of immigrants in chimpanzees, a 'copying dominants' bias may contribute to the observed maintenance of distinct cultural repertoires in neighboring communities despite sharing similar ecology and knowledgeable migrants. Thus, a copying dominants strategy may, as often proposed for conformist transmission, and perhaps in concert with it, restrict the accumulation of traditions within chimpanzee communities whilst maintaining cultural diversity. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees' use of gesture was described in the first detailed field study [1, 2], and natural use of specific gestures has been analyzed [3-5]. However, it was systematic work with captive groups that revealed compelling evidence that chimpanzees use gestures to communicate in a flexible, goal-oriented, and intentional fashion [6-8], replicated across all great ape species in captivity [9-17] and chimpanzees in the wild [18, 19]. All of these aspects overlap with human language but are apparently missing in most animal communication systems, including great ape vocalization, where extensive study has produced meager evidence for intentional use ([20], but see [21, 22]). Findings about great ape gestures spurred interest in a potential common ancestral origin with components of human language [23-25]. Of particular interest, given the relevance to language origins, is the question of what chimpanzees intend their gestures to mean; surprisingly, the matter of what the intentional signals are used to achieve has been largely neglected. Here we present the first systematic study of meaning in chimpanzee gestural communication. Individual gestures have specific meanings, independently of signaler identity, and we provide a partial "lexicon"; flexibility is predominantly in the use of multiple gestures for a specific meaning. We distinguish a range of meanings, from simple requests associated with just a few gestures to broader social negotiation associated with a wider range of gesture types. Access to a range of alternatives may increase communicative subtlety during important social negotiations. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees are well known for their tool using abilities. Numerous studies have documented variability in tool use among chimpanzees and the role that social learning and other factors play in their development. There are also findings on hand use in both captive and wild chimpanzees; however, less understood are the potential roles of genetic and non-genetic mechanisms in determining individual differences in tool use skill and laterality. Here, we examined heritability in tool use skill and handedness for a probing task in a sample of 243 captive chimpanzees. Quantitative genetic analysis, based on the extant pedigrees, showed that overall both tool use skill and handedness were significantly heritable. Significant heritability in motor skill was evident in two genetically distinct populations of apes, and between two cohorts that received different early social rearing experiences. We further found that motor skill decreased with age and that males were more commonly left-handed than females. Collectively, these data suggest that though non-genetic factors do influence tool use performance and handedness in chimpanzees, genetic factors also play a significant role, as has been reported in humans. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Cardiovascular disease is increasingly recognized as an important cause of morbidity and mortality in captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). This report records 2 cases of sudden cardiac death in closely related subadult captive chimpanzees with marked replacement fibrosis and adipocyte infiltration of the myocardium, which resemble specific atypical forms of the familial human disease arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Changes were consistent with left-dominant and biventricular subtypes, which are both phenotypic variants found within human families with familial arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Previously reported fibrosing cardiomyopathies in chimpanzees were characterized by nonspecific interstitial fibrosis, in contrast to the replacement fibrofatty infiltration with predilection for the outer myocardium seen in these 2 cases. To the authors’ knowledge, this case report is the first to describe cardiomyopathy resembling arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy in nonhuman primates and the first to describe left-dominant arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy-type lesions in an animal. © The Author(s) 2013.

ABSTRACT: Investigating cognitively complex behaviours in their natural ecological context provides essential insights into the adaptive value of animal cognition. In this study, we investigated the selection of hammers used for cracking Coula nuts by wild chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes verus, in the Taï National Park, CÔte d'Ivoire, taking account of the availability of potential tools at the site and time of tool selection. Using GLMMs and focal follows of five adult females, we estimated the probability of an object being selected as a hammer according to its physical properties, transport distance and the location of the anvil on the ground or in trees. We found that chimpanzees took account of several variables at the same time (multidimensionality) when selecting nut-cracking tools and that their selection for hammer weight was adjusted to the state/value of other variables (conditionality). In particular, chimpanzees (1) preferred stones over wooden clubs and hard woods over soft woods; (2) selected heavy stones, but relatively lighter wooden hammers; (3) selected increasingly heavier hammers the closer they were to the anvil; and (4) selected lighter hammers when they were going to crack nuts on a tree. The latter two results represent instances of conditional tool selection based on the next steps in an operational sequence (transport and/or use of the tool in a stable or unstable location) and suggest that chimpanzees anticipated future events when they chose a tool. This large set of conditional rules suggests a high level of cognitive sophistication in a tool use task. Our results represent a compelling example of how powerful cognitive skills allow the optimization of an ecologically relevant foraging activity, supporting a food extraction hypothesis for the evolution of complex cognition in our closest relatives. © 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: A number of Helicobacter species cause gastrointestinal or hepatic disease in humans, including H. pylori, gastric non- H. pylori helicobacters from animal origin and enterohepatic Helicobacter species. Little is known on the presence of Helicobacter species in great apes, our closest living relatives and potential reservoirs of microorganisms that might emerge in humans. The aim of the present study was to investigate the presence of gastric and enterohepatic Helicobacter species in African chimpanzees and gorillas. Fresh fecal samples were collected from wild endangered chimpanzees and critically endangered western lowland gorillas from different African National Parks, as well as wild-born captive animals from primate sanctuaries. Intact Helicobacter bacteria were demonstrated in feces by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Screening using a Helicobacter genus-specific PCR revealed the presence of Helicobacter DNA in the majority of animals in all groups. Cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments revealed a high homology to sequences from various zoonotic enterohepatic Helicobacter species, including H. cinaedi and H. canadensis. A number of gorillas and chimpanzees also tested positive using PCR assays designed to amplify part of the ureAB gene cluster and the hsp60 gene of gastric helicobacters. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of a putative novel zoonotic gastric Helicobacter taxon/species. For this species, we propose the name '. Candidatus Helicobacter homininae', pending isolation and further genetic characterization. The presence of several Helicobacter species not only implies a possible health threat for these endangered great apes, but also a possible zoonotic transmission of gastric and enterohepatic helicobacters from these primate reservoirs to humans. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: In a broad range of evolutionary studies, an understanding of intraspecific variation is needed in order to contextualize and interpret the meaning of variation between species. However, mechanical analyses of primate crania using experimental or modeling methods typically encounter logistical constraints that force them to rely on data gathered from only one or a few individuals. This results in a lack of knowledge concerning the mechanical significance of intraspecific shape variation that limits our ability to infer the significance of interspecific differences. This study uses geometric morphometric methods (GM) and finite element analysis (FEA) to examine the biomechanical implications of shape variation in chimpanzee crania, thereby providing a comparative context in which to interpret shape-related mechanical variation between hominin species. Six finite element models (FEMs) of chimpanzee crania were constructed from CT scans following shape-space Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of a matrix of 709 Procrustes coordinates (digitized onto 21 specimens) to identify the individuals at the extremes of the first three principal components. The FEMs were assigned the material properties of bone and were loaded and constrained to simulate maximal bites on the P3 and M2. Resulting strains indicate that intraspecific cranial variation in morphology is associated with quantitatively high levels of variation in strain magnitudes, but qualitatively little variation in the distribution of strain concentrations. Thus, interspecific comparisons should include considerations of the spatial patterning of strains rather than focus only on their magnitudes.

ABSTRACT: In sexually reproducing animals, male and female reproductive strategies often conflict [1]. In some species, males use aggression to overcome female choice [2, 3], but debate persists over the extent to which this strategy is successful. Previous studies of male aggression toward females among wild chimpanzees have yielded contradictory results about the relationship between aggression and mating behavior [4-11]. Critically, however, copulation frequency in primates is not always predictive of reproductive success [12]. We analyzed a 17-year sample of behavioral and genetic data from the Kasekela chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) community in Gombe National Park, Tanzania, to test the hypothesis that male aggression toward females increases male reproductive success. We examined the effect of male aggression toward females during ovarian cycling, including periods when the females were sexually receptive (swollen) and periods when they were not. We found that, after controlling for confounding factors, male aggression during a female's swollen periods was positively correlated with copulation frequency. However, aggression toward swollen females was not predictive of paternity. Instead, aggression by high-ranking males toward females during their nonswollen periods was positively associated with likelihood of paternity. This indicates that long-term patterns of intimidation allow high-ranking males to increase their reproductive success, supporting the sexual coercion hypothesis. To our knowledge, this is the first study to present genetic evidence of sexual coercion as an adaptive strategy in a social mammal. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract disease with high morbidity and mortality in young infants and children. Despite numerous efforts, a licensed vaccine against RSV remains elusive. Since young infants form the primary target group of RSV disease, maternal immunization to boost the protection in neonates is an attractive strategy. In this study we tested the efficacy of maternal immunization with a chimpanzee adenovirus expressing codon-optimized RSV fusion protein (AdC7-Fsyn) to protect infants against RSV infection. Single intranasal immunization of mice by AdC7-Fsyn induced robust anti-RSV systemic and mucosal immunity that protected against RSV without causing vaccine-enhanced RSV disease. RSV humoral immunity was transferred to pups born to immunized mothers that provided protection against RSV. Immunization with AdC7-Fsyn was effective even in the presence of Ad5 preimmunity. The maternally derived immunity was durable with the half-life of 14.63 days that reduced the viral replication up to 15 weeks of age. Notably, the passively immunized mice could be actively re-immunized with AdC7-Fsyn to boost and extend the protection. This substantiates maternal immunization with an AdC7-based vaccine expressing RSV F as feasible approach to protect against RSV early in life. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: In a dyadic informed forager task, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are known to exploit the knowledge of informed subordinates; however, the behavioral mechanisms they employ are unknown. It is tempting to interpret outcome measures, such as which individual obtained the food, in a cognitively richer way than the outcomes may justify. We employed a different approach from prior research, asking how chimpanzees compete by maneuvering around each other, whether they use gaze cues to acquire information from others, and what information they use in moment-to-moment decision-making. We used cross correlations, which plot the correlation between two variables as a function of time, systematically to examine chimpanzee interactions in a series of dyadic informed forager contests. We used cross correlations as a "proof of concept" so as to determine whether the target actions were contingent on, or occurred in a time-locked pattern relative to, the referent actions. A subordinate individual was given privileged knowledge of food location. As expected, an ignorant dominant followed the informed subordinate's movement in the enclosure. The dominant also followed the subordinate's gaze direction: after she looked at the subordinate, she was more likely to gaze toward this same direction within one second. In contrast, the subordinate only occasionally followed the dominant's movement and gaze. The dominant also changed her own direction of movement to converge on the location to which the subordinate directed her gaze and movement. Cross correlation proves an effective technique for charting contingencies in social interactions, an important step in understanding the use of cognition in natural situations. Am. J.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) use tools to probe for out-of-reach food, both in the wild and in captivity. Beyond gathering appropriately-sized materials to create tools, chimpanzees also perform secondary modifications in order to create an optimized tool. In this study, we recorded the behavior of a group of zoo-housed chimpanzees when presented with opportunities to use tools to probe for liquid foods in an artificial termite mound within their enclosure. Previous research with this group of chimpanzees has shown that they are proficient at gathering materials from within their environment in order to create tools to probe for the liquid food within the artificial mound. Extending beyond this basic question, we first asked whether they only made and modified probe tools when it was appropriate to do so (i.e. when the mound was baited with food). Second, by collecting continuous data on their behavior, we also asked whether the chimpanzees first (intentionally) modified their tools prior to probing for food or whether such modifications occurred after tool use, possibly as a by-product of chewing and eating the food from the tools. Following our predictions, we found that tool modification predicted tool use; the chimpanzees began using their tools within a short delay of creating and modifying them, and the chimpanzees performed more tool modifying behaviors when food was available than when they could not gain food through the use of probe tools. We also discuss our results in terms of the chimpanzees' acquisition of the skills, and their flexibility of tool use and learning. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: We investigated the dietary preferences of chimpanzees residing in a Nigerian submontane forest using a combination of fecal analysis, observations of feeding remains, evidence from feeding tools and fruiting phenological data between April 2010 and March 2011. A total of 495 fecal samples were collected in which 52 fruit taxa were identified as having being consumed by chimpanzees, including 22 identified to species level and two identified to genus level. Ficus (seven species) was the most common seed genus identified, occurring in 61.2% of all fecal samples. Based on fecal analysis and phenological data, Ngel Nyaki chimpanzees do not solely consume fruits based on their availability within the habitat; while the proportion of fruit consumed did reflect the relative availability of fruit in the forest for some fruit species, Ficus was a preferred fruit even when scarce. In contrast, the proportion consumed of other fruit species was low relative to the abundance of their fruit available in the forest. Our results from the Rank Preference Index (RPI) suggest that relative preferences in fruit are seasonal. We discuss the role of Ficus in the diet of chimpanzees in Ngel Nyaki Forest Reserve. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: A 12-yr-old female chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) was presented as severely emaciated and with generalized muscle weakness. Hematology and biochemistry revealed severe anemia and hypokalemia. The chimpanzee was treated supportively and symptomatically; although initially stable, the animal deteriorated rapidly on day 5, becoming depressed and jaundiced with further deterioration of anemia. To address the decline, a prompt transfusion of compatible and cross-matched fresh whole blood from a healthy adult male chimpanzee was administered over 120 min. During transfusion, an immediate reduction in the recipient's tachycardia was noted and substantial clinical improvement continued over 24 hr posttransfusion; no adverse transfusion reactions were observed. © 2014 American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: A growing body of evidence suggests that human language may have emerged primarily in the gestural rather than vocal domain, and that studying gestural communication in great apes is crucial to understanding language evolution. Although manual and bodily gestures are considered distinct at a neural level, there has been very limited consideration of potential differences at a behavioural level. In this study, we conducted naturalistic observations of adult wild East African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) in order to establish a repertoire of gestures, and examine intentionality of gesture production, use and comprehension, comparing across manual and bodily gestures. At the population level, 120 distinct gesture types were identified, consisting of 65 manual gestures and 55 bodily gestures. Both bodily and manual gestures were used intentionally and effectively to attain specific goals, by signallers who were sensitive to recipient attention. However, manual gestures differed from bodily gestures in terms of communicative persistence, indicating a qualitatively different form of behavioural flexibility in achieving goals. Both repertoire size and frequency of manual gesturing were more affiliative than bodily gestures, while bodily gestures were more antagonistic. These results indicate that manual gestures may have played a significant role in the emergence of increased flexibility in great ape communication and social bonding. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Background: Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) can be divided into four subspecies. Substantial phylogenetic evidence suggests that these subspecies can be grouped into two distinct lineages: A western African group that includes P. t. verus and P. t. ellioti and a central/eastern African group that includes P. t. troglodytes and P. t. schweinfurthii. The geographic division of these two lineages occurs in Cameroon, where the rages of P. t. ellioti and P. t. troglodytes appear to converge at the Sanaga River. Remarkably, few population genetic studies have included wild chimpanzees from this region. Results: We analyzed microsatellite genotypes of 187 wild, unrelated chimpanzees, and mitochondrial control region sequencing data from 604 chimpanzees. We found that chimpanzees in Cameroon and eastern Nigeria comprise at least two, and likely three populations. Both the mtDNA and microsatellite data suggest that there is a primary separation of P. t. troglodytes in southern Cameroon from P. t. ellioti north and west of the Sanaga River. These two populations split ~200-250 thousand years ago (kya), but have exchanged one migrant per generation since separating. In addition, P. t. ellioti consists of two populations that split from one another ~4 kya. One population is located in the rainforests of western Cameroon and eastern Nigeria, whereas the second population appears to be confined to a savannah-woodland mosaic in central Cameroon. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that there are as many as three genetically distinct populations of chimpanzees in Cameroon and eastern Nigeria. P. t. troglodytes in southern Cameroon comprises one population that is separated from two populations of P. t. ellioti in western and central Cameroon, respectively. P. t. ellioti and P. t. troglodytes appear to be characterized by a pattern of isolation-with-migration, and thus, we propose that neutral processes alone can not explain the differentiation of P. t. ellioti and P. t. troglodytes. © 2015 Mitchell et al.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees communicate with facial expressions, vocalizations, postures, and gestures. Vocalizations are of many types for both close and distance communication. Identity of individuals and groups is apparent in vocalizations. Vocalizations occur in specific contexts and there is evidence that some carry referential meaning. Gestures occur in a variety of modalities and chimpanzees vary the modality appropriately with the attentional state of the partner. Communities of chimpanzees have specific repertoires of gestures and the same gesture among communities varies in form. In cross-fostering research chimpanzees acquired American Sign Language. One young chimpanzee acquired signs from his mother and other signing chimpanzees. In a remote videotaping procedure the chimpanzees signed to each other using a variety of signs in a variety of contexts. Other studies have examined chimpanzee communication using artificial languages. Chimpanzee communication shows flexibility as partners navigate through interactions and gestures are acquired through social learning. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

ABSTRACT: Habituation has been the standard methodology used to study the natural history of great apes and other primates. Habituation has invaluable strengths, particularly in quantity and diversity of data collected, but along with these come substantial weaknesses, i.e., costs both in time and effort, health risks, and potential exposure of subjects to poaching. With new technologies, we are able to extend our studies beyond the limitations of habituation; camera traps are one technology that can be used to study unhabituated primate groups. In this study we used eight camera traps over the course of 2 yr (1542 camera trap days) to capture thousands of still images of West African savanna chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) in the Falémé region of southeastern Senegal. Images corroborated behavioral observations from habituated chimpanzees at the Fongoli site, where researchers have observed nocturnal activity and cave use. The cameras also captured interspecies interactions at water sources during the dry season and allowed us to determine demographic composition and minimum community size. The photographs provide data on local fauna, including predators (Panthera pardus pardus, Panthera leo senegalesis, and Crocuta crocuta), potential prey, and competitor species (Papio papio, Cercopithecus aethiops, and Erythrocebus patas). As primate habitat across Africa is further threatened and human–wildlife conflict increases, camera trapping could be used as an essential conservation tool, expanding studies of primates without exacerbating potential threats to the species. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: In intact, mosaic ecosystems, chimpanzees are sympatric with a wide range of other mammals, which may be predators, prey, or competitors. We delve beyond the nominal data of species lists to interval-level data on 35 medium-bodied and large-bodied mammals encountered at a hot, dry, and open field site in far West Africa. Frequency of encounter, habitat where found, and number of individuals encountered are analysed for species for which enough data were accumulated. Further, we compare findings over three periods (1976–1979, 2000, 2012). Species most often encountered were those normally classed as typical savanna forms. Even a crude classification into forest, woodland, and grassland ecotypes yields differences in species likely to meet apes. Comparison of encounter rates over time was surprisingly congruent, although not all species seen in the 1970s survived to the 2000s. Overall, Assirik’s mammalian fauna is comparable to palaeo-faunal guilds sympatric with various extinct hominins. © 2014, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: In recent years, the presence of stable individual variation in animal behaviour has been corroborated by studies across a wide variety of taxa and research disciplines. Reconciliation, or postconflict affiliation between former opponents, is a behavioural domain in which individual differences have not been systematically studied. Using a long-term data set comprising over 2000 conflict and postconflict observations in two groups of outdoor-housed chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, we provide evidence for stable individual variation in reconciliation and test several hypotheses on how this postconflict mechanism relates to social switching behaviour. Results of generalized multilevel models revealed that individual differences remained a substantial source of variation in reconciliation after controlling for a number of situational variables (e.g. the nature of the relationship between opponents) shown by previous research to influence its occurrence. We further demonstrated a positive association between an individual's conciliatory tendency and three separate indices of social switching behaviour, proposing that individual differences in reconciliation may reflect a more fundamental motivation to switch between different social states. In addition to a discussion of potential motivational underpinnings, we provide an impetus for future work to consider how reconciliation relates to the broader constructs and themes identified within animal personality research. To the extent that individual differences in other aspects of conflict and postconflict repertoires exhibit temporal and cross-situational consistency, they too should inform our understanding of animal personalities. Delineating how these and other dimensions of sociality are in part driven by stable individual variation not only has implications for how social interactions themselves unfold, but ultimately for the fitness of the individuals therein. © 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: For many long-lived mammalian species, extended maternal investment has a profound effect on offspring integration in complex social environments. One component of this investment may be aiding young in aggressive interactions, which can set the stage for offspring social position later in life. Here we examined maternal effects on dyadic aggressive interactions between immature (<12 years) chimpanzees. Specifically, we tested whether relative maternal rank predicted the probability of winning an aggressive interaction. We also examined maternal responses to aggressive interactions to determine whether maternal interventions explain interaction outcomes. Using a 12-year behavioural data set (2000-2011) from Gombe National Park, Tanzania, we found that relative maternal rank predicted the probability of winning aggressive interactions in male-male and male-female aggressive interactions: offspring were more likely to win if their mother outranked their opponent's mother. Female-female aggressive interactions occurred infrequently (two interactions), so could not be analysed. The probability of winning was also higher for relatively older individuals in male-male interactions, and for males in male-female interactions. Maternal interventions were rare (7.3% of 137 interactions), suggesting that direct involvement does not explain the outcome for the vast majority of aggressive interactions. These findings provide important insight into the ontogeny of aggressive behaviour and early dominance relationships in wild apes and highlight a potential social advantage for offspring of higher-ranking mothers. This advantage may be particularly pronounced for sons, given male philopatry in chimpanzees and the potential for social status early in life to translate more directly to adult rank. © 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: Prospective memory is remembering to do something at a future time. A growing body of research supports that prospective memory may exist in nonhuman animals, but the methods used to test nonhuman prospective memory differ from those used with humans. The current work tests prospective memory in chimpanzees using a method that closely approximates a typical human paradigm. In these experiments, the prospective memory cue was embedded within an ongoing task. Tokens representing food items could be used in one of two ways: in a matching task with pictures of items (the ongoing task) or to request a food item hidden in a different location at the beginning of the trial. Chimpanzees had to disengage from the ongoing task in order to use the appropriate token to obtain a higher preference food item. In Experiment 1, chimpanzees effectively matched tokens to pictures, when appropriate, and disengaged from the ongoing task when the token matched the hidden item. In Experiment 2, performance did not differ when the target item was either hidden or visible. This suggested no effect of cognitive load on either the prospective memory task or the ongoing task, but performance was near ceiling, which may have contributed to this outcome. In Experiment 3, we created a more challenging version of the task. More errors on the matching task occurred before the prospective memory had been carried out, and this difference seemed to be limited to the hidden condition. This finding parallels results from human studies and suggests that working memory load and prospective memory may have a similar relationship in nonhuman primates. © 2014 Evans et al.

ABSTRACT: Decision-making largely is influenced by the relative value of choice options, and the value of such options can be determined by a combination of different factors (e.g., the quantity, size, or quality of a stimulus). In this study, we examined the competing influences of quantity (i.e., the number of food items in a set) and quality (i.e., the original state of a food item) of choice items on chimpanzees' food preferences in a two-option natural choice paradigm. In Experiment 1, chimpanzees chose between sets of food items that were either entirely whole or included items that were broken into pieces before being shown to the chimpanzees. Chimpanzees exhibited a bias for whole food items even when such choice options consisted of a smaller overall quantity of food than the sets containing broken items. In Experiment 2, chimpanzees chose between sets of entirely whole food items and sets of initially whole items that were subsequently broken in view of the chimpanzees just before choice time. Chimpanzees continued to exhibit a bias for sets of whole items. In Experiment 3, chimpanzees chose between sets of new food items that were initially discrete but were subsequently transformed into a larger cohesive unit. Here, chimpanzees were biased to choose the discrete sets that retained their original qualitative state rather than toward the cohesive or clumped sets. These results demonstrate that beyond a food set's quantity (i.e., the value dimension that accounts for maximization in terms of caloric intake), other seemingly non-relevant features (i.e., quality in terms of a set's original state) affect how chimpanzees assign value to their choice options. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Human empathy can extend to strangers and even other species, but it is unknown whether non-humans are similarly broad in their empathic responses. We explored the breadth and flexibility of empathy in chimpanzees, a close relative of humans. We used contagious yawning to measure involuntary empathy and showed chimpanzees videos of familiar humans, unfamiliar humans and gelada baboons (an unfamiliar species). We tested whether each class of stimuli elicited contagion by comparing the effect of yawn and control videos. After including previous data on the response to ingroup and outgroup chimpanzees, we found that familiar and unfamiliar humans elicited contagion equal to that of ingroup chimpanzees. Gelada baboons did not elicit contagion, and the response to them was equal to that of outgroup chimpanzees. However, the chimpanzees watched the outgroup chimpanzee videos more than any other. The combination of high interest and low contagion may stem from hostility towards unfamiliar chimpanzees, which may interfere with an empathic response. Overall, chimpanzees showed flexibility in that they formed an empathic connection with a different species, including unknown members of that species. These results imply that human empathic flexibility is shared with related species. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Non-human animals, including great apes, have been suggested to share some of the skills for planning that humans commonly exhibit. A crucial difference between human and non-human planning may relate to the diversity of domains and needs in which this skill is expressed. Although great apes can save tools for future use, there is little evidence yet that they can also do so in other contexts. To investigate this question further, we presented the apes with a planning token-exchange task that differed from standard tool-use tasks. Additionally, we manipulated the future outcome of the task to investigate planning flexibility. In the Exchange condition, subjects had to collect, save and transport tokens because they would need them 30 min later to exchange them for food with a human, i.e., “bring-back” response. In the Release condition, the collection and transport of tokens were not needed as no exchange took place after 30 min. Out of 13 subjects, eight solved the task at least once in the Exchange condition, with chimpanzees appearing less successful than the other species. Importantly, three individuals showed a clear differential response between conditions by producing more “bring-back” responses in the Exchange than in the Release conditions. Those bonobo and orangutan individuals hence adapted their planning behavior according to changing needs (i.e., they brought tokens back significantly more often when they would need them). Bonobos and orangutans, unlike chimpanzees, planned outside the context of tool-use, thus challenging the idea that planning in these species is purely domain-specific. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: We report our recent findings on the use of tool sets by chimpanzees in Moukalaba-Doudou National Park, Gabon. Direct observations and evidences left by chimpanzees showed that chimpanzees used sticks as pounders, enlargers, and collectors to extract honey from beehives of stingless bees (Meliponula sp.), which may correspond to those previously found in the same site for fishing termites and to those found in Loango National Park, Gabon. However, we observed chimpanzees using a similar set of tools for hunting a medium-sized mammal (possibly mongoose) that hid inside a log. This is the first report of hunting with tools by a chimpanzee population in Central Africa. Chimpanzees may recognize the multiple functions and applicability of tools (extracting honey and driving prey), although it is still a preliminary speculation. Our findings may provide us a new insight on the chimpanzee’s flexibility of tool use and cognitive abilities of complex food gathering. © 2014, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: Background: Chemerin, encoded by the retinoic acid receptor responder 2 (RARRES2) gene is an adipocytesecreted protein with autocrine/paracrine functions in adipose tissue, metabolism and inflammation with a recently described function in vascular tone regulation, liver, steatosis, etc. This molecule is believed to represent a critical endocrine signal linking obesity to diabetes. There are no data available regarding evolution of RARRES2 in non-human primates and great apes. Expression profile and orthology in RARRES2 genes are unknown aspects in the biology of this multigene family in primates. Thus; we attempt to describe expression profile and phylogenetic relationship as complementary knowledge in the function of this gene in primates. To do that, we performed A RT-PCR from different tissues obtained during necropsies. Also we tested the hypotheses of positive evolution, purifying selection, and neutrality. And finally a phylogenetic analysis was made between primates RARRES2 protein. Results: RARRES2 transcripts were present in liver, lung, adipose tissue, ovary, pancreas, heart, hypothalamus and pituitary tissues. Expression in kidney and leukocytes were not detectable in either species. It was determined that the studied genes are orthologous. Conclusions: RARRES2 evolution fits the hypothesis of purifying selection. Expression profiles of the RARRES2 gene are similar in baboons and chimpanzees and are also phylogenetically related. © 2015 González-Alvarez et al.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To generate reference intervals for ECG variables in clinically normal chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). ANIMALS 100 clinically normal (51 young [< 10 years old] and 49 adult [= 10 years old]) wild-born chimpanzees. PROCEDURES Electrocardiograms collected between 2009 and 2013 at the Tchimpounga Chimpanzee Rehabilitation Centre were assessed to determine heart rate, PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, QRS axis, P axis, and T axis. Electrocardiographic characteristics for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and morphology of the ST segment,T wave, and QRS complex were identified. Reference intervals for young and old animals were calculated as mean ± 1.96•SD for normally distributed data and as 5th to 95th percentiles for data not normally distributed. Differences between age groups were assessed by use of unpaired Student t tests. RESULTS Reference intervals were generated for young and adult wild-born chimpanzees. Most animals had sinus rhythm with small or normal P wave morphology; 24 of 51 (47%) young chimpanzees and 30 of 49 (61%) adult chimpanzees had evidence of LVH as determined on the basis of criteria for humans. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Cardiac disease has been implicated as the major cause of death in captive chimpanzees. Species-specific ECG reference intervals for chimpanzees may aid in the diagnosis and treatment of animals with, or at risk of developing, heart disease. Chimpanzees with ECG characteristics outside of these intervals should be considered for follow-up assessment and regular cardiac monitoring. © 2015, American Veterinary Medical Association.

ABSTRACT: The Real Chimpanzee encapsulates the fascinating behaviour of wild chimpanzees and discusses the differences observed in different populations across the species, and across the many levels of their social behaviour. It explains why sex competition and predation pressures in a forest chimpanzee population made the females of the group highly social and gave the males a high level of within-group solidarity, making them very xenophobic towards outsiders. Love is what makes war possible. Christophe Boesch brings back to the table the debate over ecological pressures and social organization, and the influence they have over issues such as the evolution of warfare, co-operation, altruism and the position of females. Written in an accessible style for a general audience as well as for undergraduate and graduate students, he presents insightful views to give readers the background information to understand the struggle for survival of our closest living relative, the chimpanzee, and through this to find some keys to the ever-so-intriguing question of what makes us human. © C.

ABSTRACT: Many endangered wildlife populations are vulnerable to infectious diseases for which vaccines exist; yet, pragmatic considerations often preclude largescale vaccination efforts. These barriers could be reduced by focusing on individuals with the highest contact rates. However, the question then becomes whether targeted vaccination is sufficient to prevent large outbreaks. To evaluate the efficacy of targeted wildlife vaccinations, we simulate pathogen transmission and control on monthly association networks informed by behavioural data from a wild chimpanzee community (Kanyawara N = 37, Kibale National Park, Uganda). Despite considerable variation across monthly networks, our simulations indicate that targeting the most connected individuals can prevent large outbreaks with up to 35% fewer vaccines than random vaccination. Transmission heterogeneities might be attributed to biological differences among individuals (e.g. sex, age, dominance and family size). Thus, we also evaluate the effectiveness of a trait-based vaccination strategy, as trait data are often easier to collect than interaction data. Our simulations indicate that a trait-based strategy can prevent large outbreaks with up to 18% fewer vaccines than random vaccination, demonstrating that individual traits can serve as effective estimates of connectivity. Overall, these results suggest that fine-scale behavioural data can help optimize pathogen control efforts for endangered wildlife. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: The effectiveness of chimpanzees as seed dispersers may be influenced by the secondary removal and/or dispersal of seeds by other taxa. This study documents species involvement and their influences on seed treatments (fresh seed, dry seed and seeds rubbed in fresh chimpanzee faeces). Field experiments conducted on ten large-seed species consumed by chimpanzees in a Nigerian montane forest showed that secondary seed removal after 24 h varied between species. After 96-h, seed removal still varied between species, but no previous significant differences were observed among treatments, which suggested treatment becomes insignificant with time. Dispersal by chimpanzees may be more important for some large-seeded species than others. The taxa removing seeds varied across seed species but were mainly restricted to rodents. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Group living animals can exhibit fission-fusion behavior whereby individuals temporarily separate to reduce the costs of living in large groups. Primates living in groups with fission-fusion dynamics face numerous challenges in maintaining spatial cohesion, especially in environments with limited visibility. Here we investigated the spatial cohesion of adult male chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) living in Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire, to better understand the mechanisms by which individuals maintain group cohesion during fission-fusion events. Over a 3-year period, we simultaneously tracked the movements of 2-4 males for 4-12 hr on up to 12 consecutive days using handheld GPS devices that recorded locations at one-minute intervals. Analyses of the male's inter-individual distance (IID) showed that the maximum, median, and mean IID values across all observations were 7.2km, 73m, and 483m, respectively. These males (a) had maximum daily IID values below the limits of auditory communication (<1km) for 63% of the observation time, (b) remained out of visual range (≥100m) for 46% of observation time, and (c) remained within auditory range for 70% of the time when they were in different parties. We compared the observed distribution of IIDs with a random distribution obtained from permutations of the individuals' travel paths using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. Observation IID values were significantly smaller than those generated by the permutation procedure. We conclude that these male chimpanzees actively maintain cohesion when out of sight, and that auditory communication is one likely mechanism by which they do so. We discuss mechanisms by which chimpanzees may maintain the level of cohesion observed. This study provides a first analysis of spatial group cohesion over large distances in forest chimpanzees using high-resolution tracking, and illustrates the utility of such data for quantifying socio-ecological processes in primate ecology. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Background: Microsatellites-contiguous arrays of 2-6 base-pair motifs-have formed the cornerstone of populationgenetic studies for over two decades. Their genotype data typically takes the form of PCR fragment lengths obtained using locus-specific primer pairs to amplify the genomic region encompassing the microsatellite. Recently, we reported a dataset of 5,795 human and 84 chimpanzee individuals with genotypes at 246 human-derived autosomal microsatellites as a resource to facilitate interspecies comparisons. A major assumption underlying this dataset is that PCR amplicons at orthologous microsatellites are commensurable between species. Results: We find this assumption to be frequently incorrect owing to discordance in microsatellite organization and variability, as well as nontrivial length imbalances caused by small species-specific indels in microsatellite flanking sequences. Converting PCR fragment lengths into the repeat numbers they represent at 138 microsatellites whose organization and variability was found to be highly similar in both species, we show that interspecies incommensurability among PCR amplicons can inflate FST and DPS estimates by up to 10.6%. Separate investigations of determinants of microsatellite variability in humans and chimpanzees uncover similar patterns with mean and maximum numbers of repeats, as well as numbers and ranges of distinct alleles, all important factors in predicting heterozygosity. In contrast, across microsatellites, numbers of repeats were significantly smaller in chimpanzees than in humans, while numbers and ranges of distinct alleles were instead larger. Conclusions: Our findings have fundamental implications for interspecies comparisons using microsatellites and offer new opportunities for more accurate comparisons of patterns of human and chimpanzee genetic variation in numerous areas of application. © 2014 Kwong and Pemberton

ABSTRACT: Researchers studying primate community ecology have largely focused on primate species only, ignoring the interactive role that primates have within their larger communities. However, non-primate species (e.g., birds, bats, and other mammals) can greatly influence the behavioral ecology of primates, especially by competing for food and habitat space. Shifting the focus of research to include these potential non-primate competitors requires a modification in methods. Patch focals, in which areas of habitat are monitored, allow for observation of all animals within a study area, capture resources that are not used by the study species, and are particularly well suited for unhabituated communities, where closely following fauna is not possible. From October 2010 to October 2011, I collected data pertaining to the ecological role of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) at the dry habitat site of Issa, Ugalla, Tanzania using patch focals. I determined habitat use by chimpanzees and other fauna, resulting in a detailed analysis of chimpanzees within their larger faunal community. Despite limited availability of forested habitat, Issa chimpanzees were encountered more often in forest than woodland patches. Non-chimpanzee fauna exhibited habitat use patterns as expected, based on species’ preferences at other study sites. Overlap in habitat use, and therefore potential for competition, varied greatly between the different faunal categories and chimpanzees. Most importantly, this project highlights that using patch focals successfully allows for the collection of useful data pertaining to multiple socio-ecological aspects of numerous species at the same time. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: Liberia has the largest blocks of continuous forest in West Africa, providing habitat for numerous wildlife species. However, there is a lack of empirical data about the status of Liberia's wildlife populations. During 2010-2012 we conducted the first nationwide survey in Liberia along c. 320 km of systematically located transect lines to estimate the abundance of chimpanzees Pan troglodytes verus, the diversity of large mammals and the nature and degree of anthropogenic threats. With > 7,000 chimpanzees, Liberia is home to the second largest population of West African chimpanzees and is therefore a priority for conservation of the species. Compared to the fragmented populations in other range countries the Liberian population is potentially one of the most viable. Our study revealed that the majority of chimpanzees and some of the most species-diverse mammal communities in Liberia exist outside protected areas. High hunting rates and plans for large-scale exploitation of natural resources necessitate rapid implementation of effective strategies to ensure the protection of one of West Africa's last strongholds for chimpanzees and other rare and threatened mammal species. We provide a country-wide baseline dataset that may serve as a platform for Liberian wildlife authorities, policy-makers and international conservation agencies to make informed decisions about the location and delineation of proposed protected areas, to identify conservation gaps and to devise a conservation action plan to conserve Liberia's wildlife resources.

ABSTRACT: Cross-species transmissions of viruses from animals to humans are at the origin of major human pathogenic viruses. While the role of ecological and epidemiological factors in the emergence of new pathogens is well documented, the importance of host factors is often unknown. Chimpanzees are the closest relatives of humans and the animal reservoir at the origin of the human AIDS pandemic. However, despite being regularly exposed to monkey lentiviruses through hunting, chimpanzees are naturally infected by only a single simian immunodeficiency virus, SIVcpz. Here, we asked why chimpanzees appear to be protected against the successful emergence of other SIVs. In particular, we investigated the role of the chimpanzee APOBEC3 genes in providing a barrier to infection by most monkey lentiviruses. We found that most SIV Vifs, including Vif from SIVwrc infecting western-red colobus, the chimpanzee’s main monkey prey in West Africa, could not antagonize chimpanzee APOBEC3G. Moreover, chimpanzee APOBEC3D, as well as APOBEC3F and APOBEC3H, provided additional protection against SIV Vif antagonism. Consequently, lentiviral replication in primary chimpanzee CD4+ T cells was dependent on the presence of a lentiviral vif gene that could antagonize chimpanzee APOBEC3s. Finally, by identifying and functionally characterizing several APOBEC3 gene polymorphisms in both common chimpanzees and bonobos, we found that these ape populations encode APOBEC3 proteins that are uniformly resistant to antagonism by monkey lentiviruses. © 2015 Etienne et al.

ABSTRACT: [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 40(4) of Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Learning and Cognition (see record 2014-35305-001). For the article, the below files were used to create the audio used in this study. The original West African akan and North Indian raga pieces were used in their entirety and the Japanese taiko piece was used from the 0:19 second mark through the end. The tempo of each piece was adjusted so that they maintained an identical base tempo of 90 beats per minute, then looped to create 40 minutes of continuous music. Additionally, the volume of the music was standardized at 50 dB so that the all music maintained the same average amplitude. All audio manipulations were completed using GarageBand © (Apple Inc.).] All primates have an ability to distinguish between temporal and melodic features of music, but unlike humans, in previous studies, nonhuman primates have not demonstrated a preference for music. However, previous research has not tested the wide range of acoustic parameters present in many different types of world music. The purpose of the present study is to determine the spontaneous preference of common chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) for 3 acoustically contrasting types of world music: West African akan, North Indian raga, and Japanese taiko. Sixteen chimpanzees housed in 2 groups were exposed to 40 min of music from a speaker placed 1.5 m outside the fence of their outdoor enclosure; the proximity of each subject to the acoustic stimulus was recorded every 2 min. When compared with controls, subjects spent significantly more time in areas where the acoustic stimulus was loudest in African and Indian music conditions. This preference for African and Indian music could indicate homologies in acoustic preferences between nonhuman and human primates. .

ABSTRACT: The role that genes play in human intelligence or IQ has remained a point of significant scientific debate dating back to the time of Galton [1]. It has now become increasingly clear that IQ is heritable in humans, but these effects can be modified by nongenetic mechanisms [2-4]. In contrast to human IQ, until recently, views of learning and cognition in animals have largely been dominated by the behaviorist school of thought, originally championed by Watson [5] and Skinner [6]. A large body of accumulated research now demonstrates a variety of cognitive abilities in nonhuman animals and challenges traditional behaviorist interpretations of performance [7, 8]. This, in turn, has led to a renewed interest in the role that social and biological factors might play in explaining individual and phylogenetic differences in cognition [9]. Specifically, aside from early attempts to selectively breed for learning skills in rodents [10-12], studies examining the role that genetic factors might play in individual variation in cognitive abilities in nonhuman animals, particularly nonhuman primates, are scarce. Here, we utilized a modified Primate Cognitive Test Battery [13] in conjunction with quantitative genetic analyses to examine whether cognitive performance is heritable in chimpanzees. We found that some but not all cognitive traits were significantly heritable in chimpanzees. We further found significant genetic correlations between different dimensions of cognitive functioning, suggesting that the genes that explain the variability of one cognitive trait might also explain that of other cognitive traits. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The effective population size is a fundamental parameter for the understanding of microevolutionary process. Indeed, the consideration of population-level phenomena within phylogenies provides insight into the influence of the past evolutionary demography on the genetic diversity of living species. Although the effective population size of the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees has been extensively investigated by molecular evolutionists, variance in the estimates of this parameter among studies is large. However, with the availability of genome sequences, the estimation of evolutionary parameters may be conducted with minimum stochastic error, and the limiting distribution of the estimates may be obtained. This statistical property was utilized in the present study and coupled with analytical derivations from the coalescent theory to examine the limiting distribution of the ancestral effective population size of Homo-Pan. The mean ancestral effective population size of Homo-Pan was inferred at approximately 47,500, and the results showed that the uncertainty of the estimates was large, even under the limiting distribution. Further reductions of the estimates are feasible only if additional calibration information from the fossil record is provided and if a probabilistic model of ancestral generation time is envisioned. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: It is predicted that asymmetries in competitiveness (or resource holding potential (RHP)) would determine the outcomes of animal contests, but it has been difficult to estimate RHP in practice. In long-living animals, individual RHP changes as they age, making it necessary to quantify the individual trajectories of RHP rather than estimate a single representative value. Based on a Bayesian approach and a literature review, we estimated the age-related RHP trajectories of wild male chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, and studied whether estimated RHP predicted the turnover of alpha males. A model containing a quadratic relationship between age and RHP fitted to the longitudinal changes in male dominance rankings well. When alpha male turnover occurred, the estimated RHP of the new alpha male was higher than were those of previous alpha males, which was explained by age. An exception to this pattern involved cases in which males formed coalitions. In these cases, a temporary increase in the RHP of the new alpha male, which was not attributed to age, was necessary for turnover. Cross-validation analysis showed that the turnover of alpha males was predictable except when males achieved alpha status via coalition formation; this exception is explainable by the instability of coalition partners in this species. This study provides a predictive framework for the occurrence of dominance turnover using incomparable long-term data and sophisticated statistical operations. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Conversion of forests to anthropogenic land-uses increasingly subjects chimpanzee populations to habitat changes and concomitant alterations in the plant resources available to them for nesting and feeding. Based on nest count surveys conducted during the dry season, we investigated nest tree species selection and the effect of vegetation attributes on nest abundance of the western chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes verus, at Lagoas de Cufada Natural Park (LCNP), Guinea-Bissau, a forest-savannah mosaic widely disturbed by humans. Further, we assessed patterns of nest height distribution to determine support for the anti-predator hypothesis. A zero-altered generalized linear mixed model showed that nest abundance was negatively related to floristic diversity (exponential form of the Shannon index) and positively with the availability of smaller-sized trees, reflecting characteristics of dense-canopy forest. A positive correlation between nest abundance and floristic richness (number of plant species) and composition indicated that species-rich open habitats are also important in nest site selection. Restricting this analysis to feeding trees, nest abundance was again positively associated with the availability of smaller-sized trees, further supporting the preference for nesting in food tree species from dense forest. Nest tree species selection was non-random, and oil palms were used at a much lower proportion (10%) than previously reported from other study sites in forest-savannah mosaics. While this study suggests that human disturbance may underlie the exclusive arboreal nesting at LCNP, better quantitative data are needed to determine to what extent the construction of elevated nests is in fact a response to predators able to climb trees. Given the importance of LCNP as refuge for Pan t. verus our findings can improve conservation decisions for the management of this important umbrella species as well as its remaining suitable habitats. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Interleukin-15 (IL-15) contributes to natural killer cell development and immune regulation. However, IL-15 and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) production are significantly reduced during progression to AIDS. We have previously reported that HIV infected chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) express CD3-CD8+ IFN-γ+ natural killer (NK) cells with an inverse correlation to plasma HIV viral load. To expand on our initial study, we examined a larger population of HIV infected chimpanzees (n=10). Whole blood flow cytometry analyses showed that recombinant gp120 (rgp120) or recombinant IL-15 induces specific CD3-CD8+ IFN-γ+ NK cells at higher levels than CD3+CD8+ IFN-γ+ T cells in HIV infected specimens. Interestingly, peripheral blood T cells exhibited 0.5-3% IL-15 surface Tcell/NKT cell phenotypes, and rIL-15 stimulation significantly (P<. 0.007) up-regulated CD4+CD25+ T cell expression. Importantly, these data demonstrate novel T cell interleukin-15 expression and indicate a plausible regulatory mechanism for this cell-type during viral infection. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Human and chimpanzeee genomes are 98.8% identical within comparable sequences. However, they differ structurally in nine pericentric inversions, one fusion that originated human chromosome 2, and content and localization of heterochromatin and lineage-specific segmental duplications. The possible functional consequences of these cytogenetic and structural differences are not fully understood and their possible involvement in speciation remains unclear. We show that subtelomeric regions-regions that have a species-specific organization, are more divergent in sequence, and are enriched in genes and recombination hotspots-are significantly enriched for species-specific histone modifications that decorate transcription start sites in different tissues in both human and chimpanzee. The human lineage-specific chromosome 2 fusion point and ancestral centromere locus as well as chromosome 1 and 18 pericentric inversion breakpoints showed enrichment of human-specific H3K4me3 peaks in the prefrontal cortex. Our results reveal an association between plastic regions and potential novel regulatory elements. © 2014 Totoki et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

ABSTRACT: Similarity in oldest parturitions in humans and great apes suggests that we maintain ancestral rates of ovarian aging. Consistent with that hypothesis, previous counts of primordial follicles in postmortem ovarian sections from chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) showed follicle stock decline at the same rate that human stocks decline across the same ages. Here, we correct that finding with a chimpanzee sample more than three times larger than the previous one, which also allows comparison into older ages. Analyses show depletion rates similar until about age 35, but after 35, the human counts continue to fall with age, while the change is much less steep in chimpanzees. This difference implicates likely effects on ovarian dynamics from other physiological systems that are senescing at different rates, and, potentially, different perimenopausal experience for chimpanzees and humans. © 2015, American Aging Association.

ABSTRACT: The use of spatio-temporal memory has been argued to increase food-finding efficiency in rainforest primates. However, the exact content of this memory is poorly known to date. This study investigated what specific information from previous feeding visits chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus), in Taï National Park, Côte d’Ivoire, take into account when they revisit the same feeding trees. By following five adult females for many consecutive days, we tested from what distance the females directed their travels towards previously visited feeding trees and how previous feeding experiences and fruit tree properties influenced this distance. To exclude the influence of sensory cues, the females’ approach distance was measured from their last significant change in travel direction until the moment they entered the tree’s maximum detection field. We found that chimpanzees travelled longer distances to trees at which they had previously made food grunts and had rejected fewer fruits compared to other trees. In addition, the results suggest that the chimpanzees were able to anticipate the amount of fruit that they would find in the trees. Overall, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that chimpanzees act upon a retrieved memory of their last feeding experiences long before they revisit feeding trees, which would indicate a daily use of long-term prospective memory. Further, the results are consistent with the possibility that positive emotional experiences help to trigger prospective memory retrieval in forest areas that are further away and have fewer cues associated with revisited feeding trees. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees confer benefits on group members, both in the wild and in captive populations. Experimental studies of how animals allocate resources can provide useful insights about the motivations underlying prosocial behavior, and understanding the relationship between task design and prosocial behavior provides an important foundation for future research exploring these animals' social preferences. A number of studies have been designed to assess chimpanzees' preferences for outcomes that benefit others (prosocial preferences), but these studies vary greatly in both the results obtained and the methods used, and in most cases employ procedures that reduce critical features of naturalistic social interactions, such as partner choice. The focus of the current study is on understanding the link between experimental methodology and prosocial behavior in captive chimpanzees, rather than on describing these animals' social motivations themselves. We introduce a task design that avoids isolating subjects and allows them to freely decide whether to participate in the experiment. We explore key elements of the methods utilized in previous experiments in an effort to evaluate two possibilities that have been offered to explain why different experimental designs produce different results: (a) chimpanzees are less likely to deliver food to others when they obtain food for themselves, and (b) evidence of prosociality may be obscured by more "complex" experimental apparatuses (e.g., those including more components or alternative choices). Our results suggest that the complexity of laboratory tasks may generate observed variation in prosocial behavior in laboratory experiments, and highlights the need for more naturalistic research designs while also providing one example of such a paradigm. © 2014 House et al.

ABSTRACT: There is an ethical and scientific need for objective, well-validated measures of low mood in captive chimpanzees. We describe the development of a novel cognitive task designed to measure 'pessimistic' bias in judgments of expectation of reward, a cognitive marker of low mood previously validated in a wide range of species, and report training and test data fromthree common chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). The chimpanzees were trained on an arbitrary visual discrimination in which lifting a pale grey paper cone was associated with reinforcement with a peanut, whereas lifting a dark grey cone was associated with no reward. The discrimination was trained by sequentially presenting the two cone types until significant differences in latency to touch the cone types emerged, and was confirmed by simultaneously presenting both cone types in choice trials. Subjects were subsequently tested on their latency to touch unrewarded cones of three intermediate shades of grey not previously seen. Pessimism was indicated by the similarity between the latency to touch intermediate cones and the latency to touch the trained, unreinforced, dark grey cones. Three subjects completed training and testing, two adult males and one adult female. All subjects learnt the discrimination (107-240 trials), and retained it during five sessions of testing. There was no evidence that latencies to lift intermediate cones increased over testing, as would have occurred if subjects learnt that these were never rewarded, suggesting that the task could be used for repeated testing of individual animals. There was a significant difference between subjects in their relative latencies to touch intermediate cones (pessimism index) that emerged following the second test session, and was not changed by the addition of further data. The most dominant male subject was least pessimistic, and the female most pessimistic.We argue that the task has the potential to be used to assess longitudinal changes in sub-clinical levels of low mood in chimpanzees, however further work with a larger sample of animals is required to validate this claim. © 2015 Bateson and Nettle.

ABSTRACT: We carried out a calibration of FLOTAC for ciliates Troglodytella abrassarti and Neobalantidium coli based on the selection of a most appropriate flotation solutions, and we also tested its accuracy (i.e., number of detected stages out of known added number of stages to fecal samples) and sensitivity for trophozoites of both ciliates in chimpanzee feces and N. coli cysts in pig feces, compared the detection threshold of FLOTAC with MIF-based sedimentation, and, subsequently, tested the losses of ciliate stages during sample preparation. Nine flotation solutions were evaluated, and ZnSO4 solution (specific gravity [s.g.] 1.2) showed to be the most suitable for trophozoite detection, while Sheather's solution (s.g. 1.33) was selected as most suitable for cysts. The FLOTAC sensitivity in detection of both stages varied: for trophozoites, we found all samples were positive when the intensity of infection 10 trophozoites per gram and higher, whereas for cysts the sensitivity was lower. The accuracy of FLOTAC negatively correlated with infection intensity, and the merthiolate-iodine-formaldehyde sedimentation-based quantification had a lower detection threshold. We demonstrated additional losses of stages of T. abrassarti and N. coli due to their retention in the sediment, which is probably a major reason for discrepancies in the numbers of countable ciliates between both methods. In conclusion, the FLOTAC should not be considered as a gold standard for quantification of intestinal ciliates in primates; instead, we recommend the modified MIF method. © American Society of Parasitologists 2014.

ABSTRACT:                              The daily construction of a sleeping platform or "nest" is a universal behavior among large-bodied hominoids. Among chimpanzees, most populations consistently select particular tree species for nesting, yet the principles that guide species preferences are poorly understood. At Semliki, Cynometra alexandri constitutes only 9.6% of all trees in the gallery forest in which the study populations ranges, but it was selected for 73.6% of the 1,844 chimpanzee night beds we sampled. To determine whether physical properties influence nesting site selection, we measured the physical characteristics of seven common tree species at the Toro-Semliki Wildlife Reserve, Uganda. We determined stiffness and bending strength for a sample of 326 branches from the seven most commonly used tree species. We selected test-branches with diameters typically used for nest construction. We measured internode distance, calculated mean leaf surface area (cm                             2                             ) and assigned a tree architecture category to each of the seven species. C. alexandri fell at the extreme of the sample for all four variables and shared a tree architecture with only one other of the most commonly selected species. C. alexandri was the stiffest and had the greatest bending strength; it had the smallest internode distance and the smallest leaf surface area. C. alexandri and the second most commonly selected species, Cola gigantea, share a 'Model of Koriba' tree architecture. We conclude that chimpanzees are aware of the structural properties of C. alexandri branches and choose it because its properties afford chimpanzees sleeping platforms that are firm, stable and resilient. © 2014 Samson, Hunt.

ABSTRACT: Self-control has been studied in nonhuman animals using a variety of tasks. The inter-temporal choice (ITC) task presents choices between smaller-sooner (SS) and larger-later (LL) options. Using food amounts as rewards, this presents two problems: (a) choices of the LL option could either reflect self-control or instead result from animals' difficulty with pointing to smaller amounts of food; (b) there is no way to verify whether the subjects would not revert their choice for the LL option, if given the opportunity to do so during the ensuing delay. To address these problems, we have recently introduced a new protocol, the hybrid delay task, which combines an initial ITC with a subsequent accumulation phase in which selection of the SS option leads to its immediate delivery, but choice of the LL option then leads to one-by-one presentation of those items that continues only as long as the subject does not eat any of the accumulated items. The choice of the LL option therefore only reflects self-control when the number of items obtained from LL choices during the accumulation phase is higher than what could be received in the SS option. Previous research with capuchin monkeys demonstrated that their apparent self-control responses in the ITC task may have overestimated their general self-control abilities, given their poor performance in the hybrid delay task. Here, chimpanzees instead demonstrated that their choices for the LL option in the ITC phase of the hybrid delay task were confirmed by their ability to sustain long delays during accumulation of LL rewards. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Biological market theory models the action of natural selection as a marketplace in which animals are viewed as traders with commodities to offer and exchange. Studies of female Old World monkeys have suggested that grooming might be employed as a commodity to be reciprocated or traded for alternative services, yet previous tests of this grooming-trade model in wild adult male chimpanzees have yielded mixed results. Here we provide the strongest test of the model to date for male chimpanzees: we use data drawn from two social groups (communities) of chimpanzees from different populations and give explicit consideration to variation in dominance hierarchy steepness, as such variation results in differing conditions for biological markets. First, analysis of data from published accounts of other chimpanzee communities, together with our own data, showed that hierarchy steepness varied considerably within and across communities and that the number of adult males in a community aged 20-30 years predicted hierarchy steepness. The two communities in which we tested predictions of the grooming-trade model lay at opposite extremes of this distribution. Second, in accord with the grooming-trade model, we found evidence that male chimpanzees trade grooming for agonistic support where hierarchies are steep (despotic) and consequent effective support is a rank-related commodity, but not where hierarchies are shallow (egalitarian). However, we also found that grooming was reciprocated regardless of hierarchy steepness. Our findings also hint at the possibility of agonistic competition, or at least exclusion, in relation to grooming opportunities compromising the free market envisioned by biological market theory. Our results build on previous findings across chimpanzee communities to emphasize the importance of reciprocal grooming exchanges among adult male chimpanzees, which can be understood in a biological markets framework if grooming by or with particular individuals is a valuable commodity. © 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: The last common ancestor (LCA) shared by chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (P. paniscus) was an Early Pleistocene African ape, which, based on the behavior of modern chimpanzees, may be assumed to be a tool-using animal. However, the character of tool use in the Pan lineage prior to the 20th century is largely unknown. Here, I use available data on wild bonobo tool use and emerging molecular estimates of demography during Pan evolution to hypothesise the plausible tool use behavior of the bonobo-chimpanzee LCA (or "Pancestor") at the start of the Pleistocene, over 2 million years ago. This method indicates that the common ancestor of living Pan apes likely used plant tools for probing, sponging, and display, but it did not use stone tools. Instead, stone tool use appears to have been independently invented by Western African chimpanzees (P. t. verus) during the Middle Pleistocene in the region of modern Liberia-Ivory Coast-Guinea, possibly as recently as 200,000-150,000 years ago. If this is the case, then the LCA of humans and chimpanzees likely also did not use stone tools, and this trait probably first emerged among hominins in Pliocene East Africa. This review also suggests that the consistently higher population sizes of Central African chimpanzees (P. t. troglodytes) over the past million years may have contributed to the increased complexity of wild tool use seen in this sub-species today.

ABSTRACT: Tropical forest tree communities exhibit heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales, with important implications for animals relying on these resources. However, different organisms may perceive heterogeneity in the floristic community in very different ways. Here, we characterize the overall extent of heterogeneity in the floristic community at Ngogo, in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Also, using information from studies on the diet of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) inhabiting Ngogo, we quantify the extent to which the habitat is likely perceived as heterogeneous by this species. The forest as a whole is slightly more diverse than comparable sites in the Congo Basin, but this diversity is driven by a relatively high proportion of rare species represented by few individuals. From the perspective of chimpanzees, the forest is, unsurprisingly, even more heterogeneous. Species that provide fruit for chimpanzees during times of low overall fruit abundance and that display interindividual synchrony in fruiting were the most common chimpanzee resource in our sample, whereas species that provide fruit during times of low overall fruit abundance and that display asynchronous fruiting were the least common. We discuss the implications of the differences in density and distribution of various classes of resources for chimpanzee habitat use and foraging efficiency. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Microbial populations in the gastrointestinal tract contribute to host health and nutrition. Although gut microbial ecology is well studied in livestock and domestic animals, little is known of the endogenous populations inhabiting primates or carnivora. We characterized microbial populations in fecal cultures from gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), common chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), Hamadryas baboons (Papio hamadryas) and binturongs (Arctictis binturong) to compare the microbiomes associated with different gastrointestinal morphologies and different omnivorous feeding strategies. Each species was fed a distinct standardized diet for 2 weeks prior to fecal collection. All diets were formulated to reflect the species' feeding strategies in situ. Fresh fecal samples were pooled within species and used to inoculate in vitro batch cultures. Acetate, propionate, butyrate and valerate were measured after 24 h of incubation. Eubacterial DNA was extracted from individual fecal samples, pooled, and the cpn60 gene region was amplified and then sequenced to identify the major eubacterial constituents associated with each host species. Short chain fatty acids (P < 0.001) and methane (P < 0.001) were significantly different across species. Eubacterial profiles were consistent with fermentation data and suggest an increase in diversity with dietary fiber. © 2014 International Society of Zoological Sciences, Institute of Zoology/Chinese Academy of Sciences and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Social learning in chimpanzees has been studied extensively and it is now widely accepted that chimpanzees have the capacity to learn from conspecifics through a multitude of mechanisms. Very few studies, however, have documented the existence of spontaneously emerged traditions in chimpanzee communities. While the rigour of experimental studies is helpful to investigate social learning mechanisms, documentation of naturally occurring traditions is necessary to understand the relevance of social learning in the real lives of animals. In this study, we report on chimpanzees spontaneously copying a seemingly non-adaptive behaviour (“grass-in-ear behaviour”). The behaviour entailed chimpanzees selecting a stiff, straw-like blade of grass, inserting the grass into one of their own ears, adjusting the position, and then leaving it in their ear during subsequent activities. Using a daily focal follow procedure, over the course of 1 year, we observed 8 (out of 12) group members engaging in this peculiar behaviour. Importantly, in the three neighbouring groups of chimpanzees (n = 82), this behaviour was only observed once, indicating that ecological factors were not determiners of the prevalence of this behaviour. These observations show that chimpanzees have a tendency to copy each other’s behaviour, even when the adaptive value of the behaviour is presumably absent. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Different brain components can evolve in a coordinated manner or they can show divergent evolutionary trajectories according to a mosaic pattern of variation. Understanding the relationship between these brain evolutionary patterns, which are not mutually exclusive, can be informed by the examination of intraspecific variation. Our study evaluates patterns of brain anatomical covariation in chimpanzees and humans to infer their influence on brain evolution in the hominin clade. We show that chimpanzee and human brains have a modular structure that may have facilitated mosaic evolution from their last common ancestor. Spatially adjacent regions covary with one another to the strongest degree and separated regions are more independent from each other, which might be related to a predominance of local association connectivity. Despite the undoubted importance of developmental and functional factors in determining brain morphology, we find that these constraints are subordinate to the primary effect of local spatial interactions.

ABSTRACT: The pursuit, capture, and consumption of small-and medium-sized vertebrates appear to be typical of all chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) populations, although large variation exists. Red colobus monkeys (Piliocolobus sp.) appear to be the preferred prey, but intensity and frequency of hunting vary from month to month and among populations. Hunting is a predominately male activity and is typically opportunistic, although there is some evidence of searching for prey. The degree of cooperation during hunting, as well as prey selection, varies between East and West African populations and may be related to the way the kill is divided: in West Africa, hunters often collaborate, with kills tending to be shared according to participation, whereas in East Africa, cooperation in hunting is more limited, and the kill is typically consumed selfishly or divided in response to harassment (begging) by others. In some cases, it may be shared tactically, trading meat with other males to strengthen alliances. The adaptive function of chimpanzee hunting is not well understood, and a variety of hypotheses have been proposed. Ideas that chimpanzees hunt to make up for nutritional shortfalls, or to acquire meat to trade for sex, have failed to find empirical support, while recent work favors nutritional benefits of some kind. Nevertheless, cross-population studies evaluating multiple hypotheses are in their infancy, and there is much to be learned. In particular, very little is known about hunting of nonprimates, particularly ungulates, or the impact that variation in levels of hunting, and of carcasses to share and consume, has on patterns of chimpanzee behavior. If one goal of studying this topic is to shed light on the behavioral ecology of hominins, then efforts to understand the diversity of hunting and carnivory in wild chimpanzees are needed. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007, 2015.

ABSTRACT: Background: The mechanisms that underlie the diversification of tropical animals remain poorly understood, but new approaches that combine geo-spatial modeling with spatially explicit genetic data are providing fresh insights on this topic. Data about the diversification of tropical mammals remain particularly sparse, and vanishingly few opportunities exist to study endangered large mammals that increasingly exist only in isolated pockets. The chimpanzees of Cameroon represent a unique opportunity to examine the mechanisms that promote genetic differentiation in tropical mammals because the region is home to two chimpanzee subspecies: Pan troglodytes ellioti and P. t. trogolodytes. Their ranges converge in central Cameroon, which is a geographically, climatically and environmentally complex region that presents an unparalleled opportunity to examine the roles of rivers and/or environmental variation in influencing the evolution of chimpanzee populations. Results: We analyzed microsatellite genotypes and mtDNA HVRI sequencing data from wild chimpanzees sampled at a fine geographic scale across Cameroon and eastern Nigeria using a spatially explicit approach based upon Generalized Dissimilarity Modeling. Both the Sanaga River and environmental variation were found to contribute to driving separation of the subspecies. The importance of environmental variation differed among subspecies. Gene-environment associations were weak in P. t. troglodytes, whereas environmental variation was found to play a much larger role in shaping patterns of genetic differentiation in P. t. ellioti. Conclusions: We found that both the Sanaga River and environmental variation likely play a role in shaping patterns of chimpanzee genetic diversity. Future studies using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data are necessary to further understand how rivers and environmental variation contribute to shaping patterns of genetic variation in chimpanzees. © 2015 Mitchell et al.; licensee BioMed Central.

ABSTRACT: Even the most rudimentary social cues may evoke affiliative responses in humans and promote social communication and cohesion. The present work tested whether such cues of an agent may also promote communicative interactions in a nonhuman primate species, by examining interaction-promoting behaviours in chimpanzees. Here, chimpanzees were tested during interactions with an interactive humanoid robot, which showed simple bodily movements and sent out calls. The results revealed that chimpanzees exhibited two types of interaction-promoting behaviours during relaxed or playful contexts. First, the chimpanzees showed prolonged active interest when they were imitated by the robot. Second, the subjects requested 'social' responses from the robot, i.e. by showing play invitations and offering toys or other objects. This study thus provides evidence that even rudimentary cues of a robotic agent may promote social interactions in chimpanzees, like in humans. Such simple and frequent social interactions most likely provided a foundation for sophisticated forms of affiliative communication to emerge. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: We studied the nature of information that frugivorous foragers take into account to increase their chances of discovering bountiful fruit crops. We recorded the foraging behaviour of five adult female chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes verus, for continuous periods of 4-8 weeks, totalling 275 full days, throughout multiple fruiting seasons in the Taï National Park, CÔte d'Ivoire. We found that chimpanzees fed on individual trees that were significantly larger than other available and reproductively mature trees of the same species, especially if their fruit emitted an obvious smell. Trees that were merely checked for edible fruit, but where monitoring could not have been triggered by olfactory or auditory cues because the tree did not carry fruit, were also significantly larger. Most trees were monitored along the way during travel, but 13% were approached in a goal-directed manner (assessed using a 'change point test'). These approaches were unlikely to have been initiated by visual cues and occurred more often when females foraged solitarily and when trees were large as opposed to small. Our results suggest that goal-directed monitoring is guided by a long-term 'what-where' memory of the location of large potential food sources. These findings were confirmed in a quasiexperiment that tested which of 15 876 potential food trees with different crown sizes were approached in a goal-directed manner. Observations on one female who was followed intensively over 3 consecutive years indicated that monitoring probability was highest for trees with which she had become more familiar through frequent previous visits and that had carried more fruit, suggesting that she was able to remember this information across fruiting seasons. Long-term phenological data on individual trees indicated that the interval between successive fruiting seasons, and hence the 'memory window' of chimpanzees required for effective monitoring activities, could be up to 3 years. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: Humans routinely communicate to coordinate their activities, persisting and elaborating signals to pursue goals that cannot be accomplished individually. Communicative persistence is associated with complex cognitive skills such as intentionality, because interactants modify their communication in response to another's understanding of their meaning. Here we show that two language-trained chimpanzees effectively use intentional gestures to coordinate with an experimentally naive human to retrieve hidden food, providing some of the most compelling evidence to date for the role of communicative flexibility in successful coordination in nonhumans. Both chimpanzees (named Panzee and Sherman) increase the rate of non-indicative gestures when the experimenter approaches the location of the hidden food. Panzee also elaborates her gestures in relation to the experimenter's pointing, which enables her to find food more effectively than Sherman. Communicative persistence facilitates effective communication during behavioural coordination and is likely to have been important in shaping language evolution. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

ABSTRACT: Oral malignancy is rare in chimpanzees. A 34-year-old female chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) at Kumamoto Sanctuary, Japan, had developed it. Treatment is technically difficult for chimpanzees while malignant neoplasm is seemingly rising in captive populations.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) habitually walk both bipedally and quadrupedally, and have been a common point of reference for understanding the evolution of bipedal locomotion in early ape-like hominins. Here we compare the kinematics, kinetics, and energetics of bipedal and quadrupedal walking and running in a sample of five captive chimpanzees. Kinematics were recorded using sagittal-plane digital high-speed video of treadmill trials. Kinetics were recorded via a forceplate. Metabolic energy cost was measured via steady-state oxygen consumption during treadmill trials. Consistent with previous work on chimpanzees and other hominoids, we found that the spatiotemporal characteristics, joint angles, ground reaction forces, and metabolic cost of bipedal and quadrupedal locomotion are similar in chimpanzees. Notable differences include hip and trunk angles, which reflected a more orthograde trunk posture during bipedalism, and mediolateral ground reaction forces, which were larger during bipedal walking. Stride frequencies were also higher (and step lengths shorter) during bipedal trials. Bipedal and quadrupedal walking among chimpanzees was similar to that reported for bonobos, gibbons, and other primates. The similarity in cost between bipedal and quadrupedal trials suggests that the adoption of bipedal walking would have had no effect on walking costs for early ape-like hominins. However, habitual bipedalism may have favored modifications of the hip to allow a more orthograde posture, and of the hind limb abductor mechanisms to efficiently exert mediolateral ground forces. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Evaluating the familiarity of faces is critical for social animals as it is the basis of individual recognition. In the present study, we examined how face familiarity is reflected in neural activities in our closest living relative, the chimpanzee. Skinsurface event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were measured while a fully awake chimpanzee observed photographs of familiar and unfamiliar chimpanzee faces (Experiment 1) and human faces (Experiment 2). The ERPs evoked by chimpanzee faces differentiated unfamiliar individuals from familiar ones around midline areas centered on vertex sites at approximately 200 ms after the stimulus onset. In addition, the ERP response to the image of the subject's own face did not significantly diverge from those evoked by familiar chimpanzees, suggesting that the subject's brain at a minimum remembered the image of her own face. The ERPs evoked by human faces were not influenced by the familiarity of target individuals. These results indicate that chimpanzee neural representations are more sensitive to the familiarity of conspecific than allospecific faces. © 2013 Fukushima et al.

ABSTRACT: Social animals cooperate with bonding partners to outcompete others. Predicting a competitor's supporter is likely to be beneficial, regardless of whether the supporting relationship is stable or transient, or whether the support happens immediately or later. Although humans make such predictions frequently, it is unclear to what extent animals have the cognitive abilities to recognize others' transient bond partners and to predict others' coalitions that extend beyond the immediate present. We conducted playback experiments with wild chimpanzees to test this. About 2 h after fighting, subjects heard recordings of aggressive barks of a bystander, who was or was not a bond partner of the former opponent. Subjects looked longer and moved away more often from barks of the former opponents' bond partners than non-bond partners. In an additional experiment, subjects moved away more from barks than socially benign calls of the same bond partner. These effects were present despite differences in genetic relatedness and considerable time delays between the two events. Chimpanzees, it appears, integrate memories of social interactions from different sources to make inferences about current interactions. This ability is crucial for connecting triadic social interactions across time, a requirement for predicting aggressive support even after a time delay. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: The foraging activity of chimpanzees requires individuals to balance personal preferences with nutrient requirements, food availability, and interactions with members of their social group. To determine whether chimpanzee food preferences are fixed or malleable across varying socio-ecological contexts, we presented six zoo-housed chimpanzees with pairwise combinations of four different foods under two experimental conditions. First, we individually tested each chimpanzee's choices for the four foods to ascertain individual preferences. Second, we tested the chimpanzees in a situation which more-closely mimicked the foraging pressures experienced by wild chimpanzees. In this second condition, the chimpanzees were tested in a group setting and the food availability was less predictable, such as in a patchy foraging environment. Subjects expressed significant variation in their selection of which foods to consume in the two different contexts and also appeared more willing to consume less-preferred foods in the unpredictable, social environment. These results suggest that chimpanzees' food preferences are not fixed, but change with context and are likely mediated by social facilitation. This is not only important to understand chimpanzees' foraging patterns and dietary requirements, but also has implications for experimental paradigms that rely on food preferences. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Several recent studies show that animal friendships, like human friendships, are durable and have fitness benefits by increasing survival, infant survival, or reproductive success. However, the determinants of especially non-kin friendships are unclear. Human non-kin friendships are partly determined by similarity in personality. We investigated personality similarity of friends in 38 captive chimpanzees. Within-subject comparisons revealed that friends are more similar than non-friends in their Sociability and Boldness. Subsequent analyses, including both kin- and non-kin dyads, revealed higher similarity in Sociability among all individuals who sat in contact more often, while in Boldness and Grooming Equity the positive effect of similarity was only found in non-kin individuals' contact-sitting. Our results show that similar to humans, chimpanzees' friendships are related to homophily in certain personality characteristics, particularly those relevant for socio-positive and cooperative behaviour. We suggest that having friends similar to self in personality decreases uncertainty in interactions by promoting reliability especially in cooperative contexts, and is consequently adaptive. Further, we suggest that homophily in human friendships dates back at least to our last common ancestor with chimpanzees. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Many human societies are patrilineal, with males passing on their name or descent group affiliation to their offspring. Y-chromosomes are also passed on from father to son, leading to the simple expectation that males sharing the same surname or descent group membership should have similar Y-chromosome haplotypes. Although several studies in patrilineal human societies have examined the correspondence between Y-chromosome variation and surname or descent group membership, similar studies in non-human animals are lacking. Chimpanzees represent an excellent species for examining the relationship between descent group membership and Y-chromosome variation because they live in strongly male philopatric communities that arise by a group-fissioning process. Here we take advantage of recent analytical advances in the calculation of the time to the most recent common male ancestor and a large sample size of 273 Y-chromosome short tandem repeat haplotypes to inform our understanding of the potential ages of eight communities of chimpanzees. We find that the times to the most recent common male ancestor of chimpanzee communities are several hundred to as much as over two thousand years. These genetic estimates of the great time depths of chimpanzee communities accord well with behavioral observations suggesting that community fissions are a very rare event and are similar to genetic estimates of the time depth of patrilineal human groups. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The debate on the use of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in biomedical research has been ongoing for several years now. In 2012, the decision was made to retire a large number of laboratory chimpanzees in the United States of America. Relocation of these animals to sanctuaries, rescue centres, and zoos involve several changes in environment and husbandry routines. Because these animals often have a history of maternal deprivation, and consequently may suffer from an increased sensitivity to stress, these management changes may affect their behaviour. In The Netherlands, six groups of adult chimpanzees (n = 28), which were removed from their mother when juvenile and were hand or peer reared, were relocated from a biomedical laboratory to substantially larger enclosures at a Dutch sanctuary. This sanctuary applied different animal management routines. It was studied whether long-term agonistic, affiliative, and abnormal behaviour was affected by the relocation and alteration in behavioural management. The chimpanzees' behaviour was observed at the laboratory and during four years at the sanctuary, which resulted in 309. h of observational data. Results indicated that the chimpanzees performed more allogrooming and less aggressive interactions at the sanctuary compared to the laboratory. However, abnormal behaviour was performed more often at the sanctuary. These results suggest that additional measures should be taken to enhance the welfare level of chimpanzees, at least for those that have a history of maternal deprivation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: It is widely accepted that an animal's early history, including but not limited to its rearing history, can have a profound impact on later behavior. In the case of captive animals, many studies have used categorical measures such as mother reared or human reared that do not account for both the influence of human and conspecific interaction. In order to account for the influence of both human and conspecific early exposure to later behavior, we collected 1385 h of data on 60 chimpanzees, of which 36 were former pets or performers, currently housed at accredited zoos or sanctuaries. We developed a unique metric, the Chimpanzee-Human Interaction (CHI) Index that represented a continuous measure of the proportion of human and chimpanzee exposure subjects experienced and here focused on their exposure during the first four years of life.We found that chimpanzees who experienced less exposure to other chimpanzees as infants showed a lower frequency of grooming and sexual behaviors later in life which can influence social dynamics within groups.We also found chimpanzees who experienced more exposure to other chimpanzees as infants showed a higher frequency of coprophagy, suggesting coprophagy could be a socially-learned behavior. These results help characterize some of the long-term effects borne by chimpanzees maintained as pets and performers and may help inform managers seeking to integrate these types of chimpanzees into larger social groups, as in zoos and sanctuaries. In addition, these results highlight the necessity of taking into account the time-weighted influence of human and conspecific interactions when assessing the impact that humans can have on animals living in captivity. © 2014 Freeman and Ross.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) insectivory across Africa is ubiquitous. Insects provide a significant nutritional payoff and may be important for chimpanzees in dry, open habitats with narrow diets. We tested this hypothesis at Semliki, Uganda, a long-term dry study site. We evaluated prospects for insectivory by measuring insect abundance along de novo transects and trails, monitoring social insect colonies, and surveying available raw materials for elementary technology. We determined the frequency and nature of insectivory through behavioral observation and fecal analysis. We then compared our results with those from 15 other long-term chimpanzee study sites using a cluster analysis. We found that Semliki chimpanzees are one of the most insectivorous populations studied to date in terms of frequency of consumption, but they are very selective in their insectivory, regularly consuming only weaver ants (Oecophylla longinoda) and honey and bees from hives of Apis mellifera. This selectivity obtains despite having a full range of typical prey species available in harvestable quantities. We suggest that Semliki chimpanzees may face ecological time constraints and therefore bias their predation toward prey taxa that can be quickly consumed. Geographical proximity correlated with the results of the cluster analysis, while rainfall, a relatively gross measure of environment, did not. Because broad taxonomic groups of insects were used in analyses, prey availability was unlikely to have a strong effect on this pattern. Instead, we suggest that transmission of cultural knowledge may play a role in determining chimpanzee prey selection across Africa. Further study is needed to test these hypotheses. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: It is an ongoing interdisciplinary pursuit to identify the factors shaping the emergence and maintenance of tool technology. Field studies of several primate taxa have shown that tool using behaviors vary within and between populations. While similarity in tools over spatial and temporal scales may be the product of socially learned skills, it may also reflect adoption of convergent strategies that are tailored to specific prey features. Much has been claimed about regional variation in chimpanzee tool use, with little attention to the ecological circumstances that may have shaped such differences. This study examines chimpanzee tool use in termite gathering to evaluate the extent to which the behavior of insect prey may dictate chimpanzee technology. More specifically, we conducted a systematic comparison of chimpanzee tool use and termite prey between the Goualougo Triangle in the Republic of Congo and the La Belgique research site in southeast Cameroon. Apes at both of these sites are known to use tool sets to gather several species of termites. We collected insect specimens and measured the characteristics of their nests. Associated chimpanzee tool assemblages were documented at both sites and video recordings were conducted in the Goualougo Triangle. Although Macrotermitinae assemblages were identical, we found differences in the tools used to gather these termites. Based on measurements of the chimpanzee tools and termite nests at each site, we concluded that some characteristics of chimpanzee tools were directly related to termite nest structure. While there is a certain degree of uniformity within approaches to particular tool tasks across the species range, some aspects of regional variation in hominoid technology are likely adaptations to subtle environmental differences between populations or groups. Such microecological differences between sites do not negate the possibility of cultural transmission, as social learning may be required to transmit specific behaviors among individuals. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Do chimpanzees engage in religious behaviors? To date this question remains unanswered. I use methods from religious studies and anthropology of religion that demonstrate an answer in the affirmative. A comprehensive review of primatology reports reveals that chimpanzees do perform ritualized patterns of behavior in response to birth, death, consortship, and elemental natural phenomena. A structuralist analysis of these patterns shows that chimpanzees deploy similar formulaic action schemas involving recombination of syntagmatic and paradigmatic behaviors across all four of these life-situations. In the course of these performances, chimpanzees decontextualize and convert everyday communicative signals to express non-ordinary emotions of wonder and awe. The patterning of chimpanzee ritual behaviors evidences all the components of a prototypical trans-species definition of religion. These findings support hypotheses that propose religious behaviors for other species, including hominins prior to Homo sapiens sapiens. © Equinox Publishing Ltd 2014.

ABSTRACT: We examined sleeping site selection by chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in the Ugalla savanna woodland area, western Tanzania, from 1994 to 2012. We established 488 km of line transects and recorded 379 chimpanzee beds within 30 m perpendicular to the transects. Comparisons between 60 × 60 m2 quadrats containing new and recent beds and the remaining quadrats without beds along the transects indicated that evergreen forests accounted for disproportionately more area in quadrats with beds than in those without beds during both the dry and rainy seasons. In Ugalla, chimpanzees coexist with lions (Panthera leo) and leopards (Panthera pardus). They may sleep in forests to reduce predation risk by these carnivores, as trees are dense and the canopy is high and closed. The angle of slope was steeper in quadrats containing beds than in those without beds during the dry season, whereas the angle was less steep in quadrats with beds than in those without beds during the rainy season. Additionally, fewer beds were found further from forests. The distance between beds and forests during the dry season was shorter than that during the rainy season. Chimpanzees may sleep in or near forests and on slopes because of water pools in the valley forests along the slopes during the dry season. Quadrats with beds were at slightly higher altitude than those without beds during the rainy season; however, the difference was not significant during the dry season. The number of beds found in or close to feeding trees was not related to the fruiting period. Sleeping site selection by chimpanzees may be affected by predation pressure and water availability in the savanna woodland area. © 2013 Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: We present information on age related changes of thyroid hormone levels in bonobos (N=96) and chimpanzees (N=100) ranging between one and 56 years of age. Fresh urine samples were used for hormone measurements with a commercial competitive total triiodothyronine (T3) ELISA. In both species, immature individuals had higher TT3 levels than adults and there was a marked decrease in TT3 levels between age classes. The two species differed in terms of the timing of TT3 level changes, with chimpanzees experiencing a significant decline in TT3 levels after 10 years of age and bonobos after 20 years of age. The decline of TT3 in chimpanzees appears to coincide with the time when somatic growth terminates while TT3 values in bonobos decrease much later. This temporal asymmetry in urinary thyroid hormone levels indicates heterochrony in the ontogenetic changes of the two sister species and developmental delay in bonobos. The prolongation of high TT3 levels in bonobos, which is characteristic of immatures of both Pan species may affect the behavior of bonobos; namely, the low intensity of aggression they display. Given that developmental studies are often based on post-mortem analyses of skeletons, measures of urinary thyroid hormones offer a non-invasive tool for exploring ontogenetic changes in living wild and captive hominoids. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Habituation to human observers is an essential tool in animal behaviour research. Habituation occurs when repeated and inconsequential exposure to a human observer gradually reduces an animal's natural aversive response. Despite the importance of habituation, little is known about the psychological mechanisms facilitating it in wild animals. Although animal learning theory offers some account, the patterns are more complex in natural than in laboratory settings, especially in large social groups in which individual experiences vary and individuals influence each other. Here, we investigate the role of social learning during the habituation process of a wild chimpanzee group, the Waibira community of Budongo Forest, Uganda. Through post hoc hypothesis testing, we found that the immigration of two well-habituated, young females from the neighbouring Sonso community had a significant effect on the behaviour of non-habituated Waibira individuals towards human observers, suggesting that habituation is partially acquired via social learning. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: This article elaborates a relational historical geography of human, chimpanzee and elephant populations, working mainly from precolonial and early colonial (nineteenth and twentieth century) narratives by travellers to regions now corresponding to parts of Guinea, Guinea-Bissau and Senegal. It then compares a global 'West African trade' model of human and animal population's spatial distribution with elements of an 'East African settlement colony' model drawn from other historical research. This perspective balances mainstream evolutionary approaches to animal biogeography with the human history, ecology and the geopolitics of their habitats. Taking such historical processes into account helps to unravel contrastive spatial and temporal dynamics of large mammal populations and to raise new questions about the anthropogenic causes of present-day population distributions. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: Primates and other mammals show measurable, heritable variation in behavioral traits such as gregariousness, timidity, and aggression. Connections among behavior, environment, neuroanatomy, and genetics are complex, but small genetic differences can have large effects on behavioral phenotypes. One of the best examples of a single gene with large effects on natural variation in social behavior is AVPR1A, which codes for a receptor of the peptide hormone arginine vasopressin. Work on rodents shows a likely causal association between AVPR1A regulatory polymorphisms and social behavior. Chimpanzees also show variation in the AVPR1A regulatory region, with some individuals lacking a ca. 350-bp segment corresponding to a putative functional element. Thus, chimpanzees have a "short" allele (segment deletion) and a "long" allele (no deletion) at this locus. Here we compare AVPR1A variation in two chimpanzee populations, and we examine behavioral and hormonal data in relation to AVPR1A genotypes. We genotyped AVPR1A in a captive population of western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus, New Iberia Research Center; N = 64) for which we had quantitative measures of personality (based on 15 behavioral style indices, calculated from 3 yr of observational data), dominance rank, and baseline testosterone levels. We also provide the first assessment of AVPR1A genotype frequencies in a wild eastern chimpanzee population (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, Ngogo community, Kibale National Park, Uganda; N = 26). Our results indicated that the AVPR1A long allele was associated with a "smart" social personality in captive western chimpanzees, independent of testosterone levels. Although the frequency of the long allele was relatively low in captive western chimpanzees (0.23), it was the major allele in wild eastern chimpanzees (0.62). Our finding that allele and genotype frequencies for the AVPR1A polymorphism differ among chimpanzee populations also highlights the need for comparative studies -across subspecies and research sites- in primate behavioral genetics. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: CNTNAP2, one of the largest genes in the human genome, has been linked to human-specific language abilities and neurodevelopmental disorders. Our hypothesis is that epigenetic rather than genetic changes have accelerated the evolution of the human brain. To compare the cortex DNA methylation patterns of human and chimpanzee CNTNAP2 at ultra-high resolution, we combined methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) with NimbleGen tiling arrays for the orthologous gene and flanking sequences. Approximately 1.59 Mb of the 2.51 Mb target region could be aligned and analyzed with a customized algorithm in both species. More than one fifth (0.34 Mb) of the analyzed sequence throughout the entire gene displayed significant methylation differences between six human and five chimpanzee cortices. One of the most striking interspecies differences with 28% methylation in human and 59% in chimpanzee cortex (by bisulfite pyrosequencing) lies in a region 300 bp upstream of human SNP rs7794745 which has been associated with autism and parent-of-origin effects. Quantitative real-time RT PCR revealed that the protein-coding splice variant CNTNAP2-201 is 1.6-fold upregulated in human cortex, compared with the chimpanzee. Transcripts CNTNAP2-001, -002, and -003 did not show skewed allelic expression, which argues against CNTNAP2 imprinting, at least in adult human brain. Collectively, our results suggest widespread cortex DNA methylation changes in CNTNAP2 since the human-chimpanzee split, supporting a role for CNTNAP2 fine-regulation in human-specific language and communication traits. © 2014 Landes Bioscience.

ABSTRACT: Recent debates have questioned the extent to which culturally-transmitted norms drive behavioral variation in resource sharing across human populations. We shed new light on this discussion by examining the group-level variation in the social dynamics and resource sharing of chimpanzees, a species that is highly social and forms long-term community associations but differs from humans in the extent to which cultural norms are adopted and enforced. We rely on theory developed in primate socioecology to guide our investigation in four neighboring chimpanzee groups at a sanctuary in Zambia. We used a combination of experimental and observational approaches to assess the distribution of resource holding potential in each group. In the first assessment, we measured the proportion of the population that gathered in a resource-rich zone, in the second we assessed naturally occurring social spacing via social network analysis, and in the third we assessed the degree to which benefits were equally distributed within the group. We report significant, stable group-level variation across these multiple measures, indicating that group-level variation in resource sharing and social tolerance is not necessarily reliant upon human-like cultural norms. © 2014 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Costs of mating effort can affect the reproductive strategies and lifetime fitness of male primates, but interspecific and interindividual variation in the magnitude and distribution of costs is poorly understood. Male costs have primarily been recognized in seasonally breeding species that experience concentrated periods of mating competition. Here, we examine foraging costs associated with male mating effort in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii), a polygynandrous species, in which mating opportunities occur intermittently throughout the year. To quantify male feeding, aggression, and mating, we conducted focal follows on 12 males in a wild community (Kanyawara, Kibale National Park, Uganda) for 11 mo. Males fed less on days when high-value mating opportunities (estrous parous females) were available than on days without any mating opportunities. Reductions in feeding time were related to increased rates of aggression and copulation, indicating that the proximate cause of changes in male foraging was mating effort. Surprisingly, however, there was no relationship between dominance rank and the extent to which feeding time was reduced. High costs of mating effort may reduce the degree of reproductive skew and limit the use of possessive tactics in chimpanzees. We suggest that male bonding in chimpanzees may be favored not only for its benefits but because intragroup competition is so costly. Our results complement the available data on mammals, and primates in particular, by showing that mating effort can have measurable foraging costs even in species, in which breeding is aseasonal and only moderately skewed. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: The discernment of resource quality is pertinent to many daily decisions faced by animals. Public information is a critical information source that promotes quality assessments, attained by monitoring others' performance. Here we provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, that chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) use public information to guide resource selection. Thirty-two chimpanzees were presented with two simultaneous video demonstrations depicting a conspecific acquiring resources at a fast (resource-rich) or slow (resource-poor) rate. Subsequently, subjects selected the resource-rich site above chance expectation. As a comparison, we report evidence of public information use in young children. Investigation of public information use in primates is pertinent, as it can enhance foraging success and potentially facilitate payoff-biased social learning. © 2013 American Psychological Association.

ABSTRACT: The feeding ecology of sympatric great ape species yields valuable information for palaeodietary reconstructions in sympatric early hominin species. However, no isotopic references on sympatrically living apes and their feeding ecology are currently available. Here we present the first isotopic study on sympatric great apes, namely western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and central chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) from Loango National Park, Gabon. We successfully analyzed the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios in a selection of food plants (n=31) and hair samples (n=30) retrieved from sleeping nests to test whether niche partitioning among sympatric chimpanzees and gorillas is detectable using isotope analysis of hair. Ape hair strands with roots were sectioned into sequential segments (n=100) to investigate temporal isotopic variation related to seasonal variations in food resources. We found significant δ13C differences between herbaceous plants and fruits, most likely due to canopy effects. While the δ13C values of chimpanzees indicate the consumption of fruit, the low δ13C values in gorilla hair indicate folivory, most likely the consumption of 13C-depleted herbaceous vegetation. Our isotopic data also confirmed dietary overlap between chimpanzees and gorillas, which varied by season. Gorillas showed significant variation in δ13C values in response to season due to shifting proportions of herbaceous plants versus fruits. In chimpanzees, significant seasonal variation in δ15N was likely related to the seasonal availability of fruit species with particularly high δ15N values. In summary, we found isotopic evidence for niche partitioning and seasonal dietary variation among sympatric great apes at Loango. These findings provide a valuable reference for palaeodietary research on fossil hominins using δ13C analyses, particularly for studies focusing on sympatric taxa and on temporal isotopic variation within incremental tissues such as tooth enamel. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: To understand adenosylmethionine decarboxylase 1 (AMD1)-mediated mRNA processing and cell adhesion activated & inhibited transition mechanisms between chimpanzee and human left hemisphere, AMD1-activated different complete (all no positive correlation, Pearson correlation coefficient < 0.25) and uncomplete (partly no positive correlation except AMD1, Pearson < 0.25) networks were identified in higher human compared with lower chimpanzee left hemisphere from the corresponding AMD1-stimulated (Pearson ≥ 0.25) or inhibited (Pearson ≤ -0.25) overlapping molecules of Pearson and GRNInfer, respectively. This result was verified by the corresponding scatter matrix. As visualized by GO, KEGG, GenMAPP, BioCarta, and disease database integration, we proposed mainly that AMD1-stimulated different complete network was involved in AMD1 activation with cytoplasm ubiquitin specific peptidase (tRNA-guanine transglycosylase) to nucleus paired box-induced mRNA processing, whereas the corresponding inhibited network participated in AMD1 repression with cytoplasm protocadherin gamma and adaptor-related protein complex 3-induced cell adhesion in lower chimpanzee left hemisphere. However, AMD1-stimulated network contained AMD1 activation with plakophilin and phosphodiesterase to SH3 binding glutamic acid-rich protein to dynein and zinc finger-induced cell adhesion, whereas the corresponding inhibited different complete network included AMD1 repression with mitochondrial denine nucleotide translocator, brain protein, and ADH dehydrogenase to ribonucleoprotein-induced mRNA processing in higher human left hemisphere. Our AMD1 different networks were verified by AMD1-activated or -inhibited complete and uncomplete networks within and between chimpanzee left hemisphere or (and) human left hemisphere. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees are our closest living relatives and their positional repertoire likely includes elements shared with our common ancestor. Currently, limitations exist in our ability to correlate locomotor anatomy with behavioral function in the wild. Here we provide a detailed description of developmental changes in chimpanzee locomotion and posture. Fieldwork was conducted on wild chimpanzees at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda. The large size of the Ngogo chimpanzee community permitted cross-sectional analysis of locomotor and postural changes across many individuals. Chimpanzee positional behavior proceeds developmentally through a number of distinct stages, each characterized by its own loading regime. Infants principally used their upper limbs while moving; the loading environment changed to more hindlimb dominated locomotion as infants aged. Infants displayed more diversity in their forms of positional behavior than members of any other age-sex class, engaging in behaviors not habitually exhibited by adults. While the most common locomotor mode for infants was torso-orthograde suspensory locomotion, a large shift toward quadrupedal locomotion during infancy occurred at three years of age, when rates of this behavior increased. Overall, the most dramatic transition in positional behavior occurred during juvenility (at approximately five years), with the advent of complete independent locomotion. Juveniles decreased the amount of time they spent clinging and in torso-orthograde suspensory locomotion and increased their time spent sitting and walking and running quadrupedally compared with younger individuals. Juvenility marked the age at which quadrupedal walking became the most frequent locomotor behavior, but quadrupedal walking did not encompass the majority of locomotor time until individuals reached adolescence. Relative to all younger individuals, adolescent chimpanzees (10-13 years) experienced a further increase in the amount of time they walked quadrupedally. Locomotor behavior did not reach adult form until adolescence, closer to the time of epiphyseal fusion than previously thought. These findings provide new data to make predictions about how behavioral transitions influence skeletal change. © 2013.

ABSTRACT: Quantity discrimination for items spread across spatial arrays was investigated in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and North Island New Zealand robins (Petroica longipes), with the aim of examining the role of spatial separation on the ability of these 2 species to sum and compare nonvisible quantities which are both temporally and spatially separated, and to assess the likely mechanism supporting such summation performance. Birds and chimpanzees compared 2 sets of discrete quantities of items that differed in number. Six quantity comparisons were presented to both species: 1v2, 1v3, 1v5, 2v3, 2v4, and 2v5. Each was distributed 1 at a time across 2 7-location arrays. Every individual item was viewed 1 at a time and hidden, with no more than a single item in each location of an array, in contrast to a format where all items were placed together into 2 single locations. Subjects responded by selecting 1 of the 2 arrays and received the entire quantity of food items hidden within that array. Both species performed better than chance levels. The ratio of items between sets was a significant predictor of performance in the chimpanzees, but it was not significant for robins. Instead, the absolute value of the smaller quantity of items presented was the significant factor in robin responses. These results suggest a species difference for this task when considering various dimensions such as ratio or total number of items in quantity comparisons distributed across discrete 7-location arrays. © American Psychological Association.

ABSTRACT: Our study concerns local knowledge and perceptions of chimpanzees among farming communities within Cantanhez National Park, Guinea-Bissau. We submitted a survey questionnaire to 100 people living in four villages in the Park to enquire about their knowledge of chimpanzee ecology and human-chimpanzee interactions. Local farmers live in close contact with chimpanzees, consider them to be more similar to humans than any other species, and attribute special importance to them primarily due to expectations of tourism revenue. Interviewees' responses, as a function of gender, village, and age, were analyzed statistically using non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis). Age influenced responses significantly, while gender and village had no significant effect. Youngsters emphasized morphological aspects of human-chimpanzee similarities, while adults emphasized chimpanzee behavior and narratives about the shared history of humans and chimpanzees. Tourism, conservation, and crop raiding feature prominently in people's reports about chimpanzees. Local people's engagement with conservation and tourism-related activities is likely to allow them to manage not only the costs but also the benefits of conservation, and can in turn inform the expectations built upon tourism. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Recombination is a major determinant of adaptive and nonadaptive evolution. Understanding how the recombination landscape has evolved in humans is thus key to the interpretation of human genomic evolution. Comparison of fine-scale recombination maps of human and chimpanzee has revealed large changes at fine genomic scales and conservation over large scales. Here we demonstrate how a fine-scale recombination map can be derived for the ancestor of human and chimpanzee, allowing us to study the changes that have occurred in human and chimpanzee since these species diverged. The map is produced from more than one million accurately determined recombination events. We find that this new recombination map is intermediate to the maps of human and chimpanzee but that the recombination landscape has evolved more rapidly in the human lineage than in the chimpanzee lineage. We use the map to show that recombination rate, through the effect of GC-biased gene conversion, is an even stronger determinant of base composition evolution than previously reported. © 2014 Munch et al.

ABSTRACT: Research on age-related changes in morphology, social behavior, and cognition suggests that the development of bonobos (Pan paniscus) is delayed in comparison to chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). However, there is also evidence for earlier reproductive maturation in bonobos. Since developmental changes such as reproductive maturation are induced by a number of endocrine processes, changes in hormone levels are indicators of different developmental stages. Age-related changes in testosterone excretion are an indirect marker for the onset of puberty in human and non-human primates. In this study we investigated patterns of urinary testosterone levels in male and female bonobos and chimpanzees to determine the onset of puberty. In contrast to other studies, we found that both species experience age-related changes in urinary testosterone levels. Older individuals of both sexes had significantly higher urinary testosterone levels than younger individuals, indicating that bonobos and chimpanzees experience juvenile pause. The males of both species showed a similar pattern of age-related changes in urinary testosterone levels, with a sharp increase in levels around the age of eight years. This suggests that species-differences in aggression and male mate competition evolved independently of developmental changes in testosterone levels. Females showed a similar pattern of age-related urinary testosterone increase. However, in female bonobos the onset was about three years earlier than in female chimpanzees. The earlier rise of urinary testosterone levels in female bonobos is in line with reports of their younger age of dispersal, and suggests that female bonobos experience puberty at a younger age than female chimpanzees. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Both wild and captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) share food with non-relatives. Researchers have proposed several hypotheses to explain this behavior, including 'food for sex', 'food for grooming or agonistic support', and 'sharing under pressure'. We examined food sharing in two captive groups of socially-housed chimpanzees. In contrast to previous captive studies, which only examined transfers of low-quality foods, we conducted seven trials with high-quality food and seven with low-quality food for each group to directly compare transfers of different food qualities. We recorded how male chimpanzees shared food, including active transfers, passive transfers, and co-feeding. We also noted all instances of copulations, female estrous states, benign attempts to access food (termed 'perseverance'), and aggressive attempts (termed 'harassment') to examine whether any of these factors influenced food sharing. Male food possessors shared at the same rate in both food quality conditions, but seemingly for different reasons, indicating that food quality may affect the exchange of social benefits in chimpanzees. In the low-quality condition, there was an interaction with rank and perseverance: while low- and middle-ranking females received more food the more they persevered, high-ranking females received more food without perseverance and gained relatively little benefit from persevering. In the high-quality condition, there was an interaction between copulations and perseverance: females who copulated with the male food possessor received more food during that trial with less perseverance. Non-copulating females received more transfers the more they persevered. This result was only observed in the shortterm - copulations over the previous year were not correlated with food transfers. Further, the copulations observed here were unusual for these chimpanzees in that they were not confined to peak fertility, suggesting a non-conceptive function for copulations in chimpanzees. Copulations in this study may have functioned to reduce tension and increase short-term tolerance, allowing females better access to food. © 2013 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.

ABSTRACT: Given the deleterious consequences associated with chronic stress, individual differences in stress susceptibility can have important fitness implications. These differences may be explained in part by dominance status because high rank is typically associated with decreased aggression and improved nutrition. Here, we examined the relationship between dominance and social stress in lactating chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, at Gombe National Park, Tanzania. We did so by pairing daily demographic and behavioural data with faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) concentrations collected over 37 months. While there was no main effect of rank, interesting differences emerged by adult subgroup size and adult sex ratio (males/females). We found that differences in FGM concentrations between high- and low-ranking females were most pronounced as adult subgroup size and sex ratio increased. Low-ranking females had higher FGM concentrations in larger subgroups and in subgroups biased towards adult males; we observed no comparable change in FGM concentrations amongst high-ranking females. Because low-ranking females were the recipient of significantly more male aggression relative to females of high rank, these patterns may be driven by psychosocial stress in low-ranking females. There was no significant change in diet quality across subgroup sizes; this finding suggests that nutritional stressors were not driving differences in female FGM concentrations. Being susceptible to social stress has important fitness implications as it may constrain low-ranking females from 'choosing' optimal subgroups to take advantage of food resources and/or for the socialization of their offspring. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: Background: The diversity of malaria parasites (Plasmodium sp.) infecting chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and their close relatedness with those infecting humans is well documented. However, their biology is still largely unexplored and there is a need for baseline epidemiological data. Here, the effect of pregnancy, a well-known risk factor for malaria in humans, on the susceptibility of female chimpanzees to malaria infection was investigated. Methods: A series of 384 faecal samples collected during 40 pregnancies and 36 post-pregnancies from three habituated groups of wild chimpanzees in the Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire, were tested. Samples were tested for malaria parasites by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. Data were analysed using a generalized linear mixed model. Results: Probability of malaria parasite detection significantly increased towards the end of pregnancy and decreased with the age of the mother. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that susceptibility to malaria parasite infection increases during pregnancy, and, as shown before, in younger individuals, which points towards similar dynamics of malaria parasite infection in human and chimpanzee populations and raises questions about the effects of such infections on pregnancy outcome and offspring morbidity/mortality. © 2014 De Nys et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Humans will, at times, act against their own economic self-interest, for example, in gambling situations. To explore the evolutionary roots of this behavior, we modified a traditional human gambling task, the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), for use with chimpanzees, capuchin monkeys and humans. We expanded the traditional task to include two additional payoff structures to fully elucidate the ways in which these primate species respond to differing reward distributions versus overall quantities of rewards, a component often missing in the existing literature. We found that while all three species respond as typical humans do in the standard IGT payoff structure, species and individual differences emerge in our new payoff structures. Specifically, when variance avoidance and reward maximization conflicted, roughly equivalent numbers of apes maximized their rewards and avoided variance, indicating that the traditional payoff structure of the IGT is insufficient to disentangle these competing strategies. Capuchin monkeys showed little consistency in their choices. To determine whether this was a true species difference or an effect of task presentation, we replicated the experiment but increased the intertrial interval. In this case, several capuchin monkeys followed a reward maximization strategy, while chimpanzees retained the same strategy they had used previously. This suggests that individual differences in strategies for interacting with variance and reward maximization are present in apes, but not in capuchin monkeys. The primate gambling task presented here is a useful methodology for disentangling strategies of variance avoidance and reward maximization. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: One of the three categories of biodiversity for conservation priority recommended by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature is genetic diversity. In this study, we estimate the genetic diversity of eastern chimpanzees in the Ugalla region of western Tanzania, which represents the easternmost distribution of the subspecies Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii. We collected 237 fecal samples from a 624 km2 area of the Ugalla region, analyzed the DNA at 12 autosomal loci and identified 113 individuals (69 males and 44 females). We also analyzed 13 Y-chromosome loci in the Ugalla males. While autosomal genetic diversity is within the range of other eastern populations, at 0.27 the gene diversity of the Y-chromosome haplotypes present among 61 Ugalla males is extremely low as compared to other eastern chimpanzee populations. In addition, the most prevalent haplotype, found in 52 of the males, is distributed across the entire surveyed area of 624 km2. This low level of paternally-transmitted genetic diversity among the Ugalla males may be the result of a small or highly related, recent founder population (i.e., genetic drift), exacerbated by the male philopatric structure of chimpanzee communities and by male reproductive skew. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

ABSTRACT: Objective- To generate reference ranges for echocardiographic variables in clinically normal adult chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Design-Retrospective cohort study. Animals-88 clinically normal adult chimpanzees. Procedures-Echocardiographic data obtained between 2002 and 2011 from chimpanzees at the Alamogordo Primate Facility were reviewed (263 echocardiograms obtained from 158 individuals). Data from clinically normal individuals (33 females and 55 males) were analyzed. Basic cardiac parameters measured in all individuals included aortic root diameter and left atrial diameter in the short and long axis during diastole. Left ventricular measurements included left ventricular internal diameter in systole and diastole and diastolic septal and posterior wall thickness. The E point to septal separation was also measured. Spectral Doppler measurements included the peak flow velocity of the pulmonary artery and aorta and diastolic transmitral flow. The presence of arrhythmias was also noted. Results-Standard echocardiographic findings for a large group of adult female and male chimpanzees were obtained. Female and male chimpanzees were grouped by age in 10- year blocks, and echocardiographic findings were analyzed statistically by 10-year block. In male chimpanzees, cardiac arrhythmias were noted to increase with age. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Cardiovascular disease is an important cause of morbidity and death in captive chimpanzees; however, basic echocardiographic measurements from a large cohort of clinically normal animals have not previously been reported. The number of animals in the present study was insufficient to generate reference ranges; however, data from a large cohort of clinically normal animals are presented. This information will be useful for veterinarians working in clinical and research settings with this species.

ABSTRACT: Mating strategies are sets of decisions aimed at maximizing reproductive success. For male animals, the fundamental problem that these strategies address is attaining mating access to females in a manner that maximizes their chances of achieving paternity. For chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), despite substantial interest in mating strategies, very little attention has been paid to the most fundamental problem that mating strategies need to solve: finding mates. Only a single model, Dunbar's general model of male mating strategies, exists to explain mate-searching behaviour in chimpanzees. Under this model, males in most populations are regarded as pursuing a 'roving' strategy: searching for and sequestering fertile females who are essentially passive with respect to mate searching. The roving mating strategy is an assumption deeply embedded in the way chimpanzee behaviour is considered; it is implicit in the conventional model for chimpanzee social structure, which posits that male ranging functions both to monitor female reproductive state and to ward these females from other groups of males through collective territoriality: essentially, ranging as mating effort. This perspective is, however, increasingly at odds with observations of chimpanzee behaviour. Herein, I review the logic and evidence for the roving-male mating strategy and propose a novel alternative, a theoretical framework in which roving is a strategy pursued by female chimpanzees in order to engage successfully in promiscuous mating. Males, unable to thwart this female strategy, instead maximise the number of reproductive opportunities encountered by focusing their behaviour on countering threats to health, fertility and reproductive career. Their prolonged grooming bouts are seen, in consequence, as functioning to mitigate the negative impacts of socially induced physiological stress. In this new framework, the roving-male strategy becomes, at best, a 'best of a bad job' alternative for low-ranking males when faced with high levels of competition for mating access. Male chimpanzees do not search for mates, but for one another, for food, and, at times, for rivals in other communities. To the extent that female promiscuity functions to counter infanticide risk, mate searching by female chimpanzees-and any associated costs-can be seen as an unavoidable consequence of male sexual coercion. This novel framework is a better fit to the available data than is the conventional account. This review highlights the desperate need for additional work in an area of chimpanzee biology that has been somewhat neglected, perhaps in part because assumptions of roving males have remained unquestioned for too long. It also highlights the need, across taxa, to revisit and revise theory, and to test old assumptions, when faced with contrary data. © 2014 Cambridge Philosophical Society.

ABSTRACT: Despite the importance of individual problem solvers for group- and individual-level fitness, the correlates of individual problem-solving success are still an open topic of investigation. In addition to demographic factors, such as age or sex, certain personality dimensions have also been revealed as reliable correlates of problem-solving by animals. Such correlates, however, have been little-studied in chimpanzees. To empirically test the influence of age, sex, estrous state, and different personality factors on chimpanzee problem-solving, we individually tested 36 captive chimpanzees with two novel foraging puzzles. We included both female (N = 24) and male (N = 12) adult chimpanzees (aged 14-47 years) in our sample. We also controlled for the females' estrous state-a potential influence on cognitive reasoning-by testing cycling females both when their sexual swelling was maximally tumescent (associated with the luteinizing hormone surge of a female's estrous cycle) and again when it was detumescent. Although we found no correlation between the chimpanzees' success with either puzzle and their age or sex, the chimpanzees' personality ratings did correlate with responses to the novel foraging puzzles. Specifically, male chimpanzees that were rated highly on the factors Methodical, Openness (to experience), and Dominance spent longer interacting with the puzzles. There was also a positive relationship between the latency of females to begin interacting with the two tasks and their rating on the factor Reactivity/Undependability. No other significant correlations were found, but we report tentative evidence for increased problem-solving success by the females when they had detumescent estrous swellings. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Unidirectional grooming is a low-cost behaviour for which the groomer is repaid via kin selection or reciprocity. Return benefits can come in the form of increased probability of being groomed or social benefits such as coalitionary support. By contrast, the reasons for mutual grooming, which occurs when two individuals simultaneously groom each other, are not understood. In this study, we test three hypotheses regarding the function of mutual grooming among wild male chimpanzees, using 16 years of data. The social bonding hypothesis posits that mutual grooming promotes a return benefit by serving to strengthen and maintain social bonds, whereas the immediate investment hypothesis states that it functions as a signal to indicate willingness to invest in (continue) the grooming bout. The switching hypothesis states that mutual grooming results from overlap created when the direction of the grooming interaction is switched. The social bonding hypothesis was not supported: measures of association were not correlated with the probability of mutual grooming. We also found no support for the switching hypothesis, as mutual grooming was equally likely to occur without a switch in the direction of grooming as when a switch occurred. The immediate investment hypothesis was supported by our finding that bouts with mutual grooming (1) were longer, (2) contained a more equitable distribution of unidirectional grooming and (3) had more unidirectional grooming switches than bouts without mutual grooming. We conclude that male chimpanzees use mutual grooming to obtain short-term benefits in the form of prolonging a grooming bout, and suggest that mutual grooming thus represents a form of overlapping parcelling. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: Background: Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is a viral zoonosis that historically affects livestock production and human health in sub-Saharan Africa, though epizootics have also occurred in the Arabian Peninsula. Whilst an effective live-attenuated vaccine is available for livestock, there is currently no licensed human RVF vaccine. Replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAd) vectors are an ideal platform for development of a human RVF vaccine, given the low prevalence of neutralizing antibodies against them in the human population, and their excellent safety and immunogenicity profile in human clinical trials of vaccines against a wide range of pathogens. Methods. Here, in BALB/c mice, we evaluated the immunogenicity and efficacy of a replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus vector, ChAdOx1, encoding the RVF virus envelope glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, which are targets of virus neutralizing antibodies. The ChAdOx1-GnGc vaccine was assessed in comparison to a replication-deficient human adenovirus type 5 vector encoding Gn and Gc (HAdV5-GnGc), a strategy previously shown to confer protective immunity against RVF in mice. Results: A single immunization with either of the vaccines conferred protection against RVF virus challenge eight weeks post-immunization. Both vaccines elicited RVF virus neutralizing antibody and a robust CD8§ssup§+§esup§ T cell response. Conclusions: Together the results support further development of RVF vaccines based on replication-deficient adenovirus vectors, with ChAdOx1-GnGc being a potential candidate for use in future human clinical trials. © 2013 Warimwe et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The most significant hominin adaptations, including features used to distinguish and/or classify taxa, are critically tied to the dietary environment. Stable isotopic analyses of tooth enamel from hominin fossils have provided intriguing evidence for significant C4/CAM (crassulacean acid metabolism) resource consumption in a number of Plio-Pleistocene hominin taxa. Relating isotopic tooth signatures to specific dietary items or proportions of C3 versus C4/CAM plants, however, remains difficult as there is an ongoing need to document and quantify isotopic variability in modern ecosystems. This study investigates the ecological variables responsible for carbon isotopic discrimination and variability within the C3-dominated dietary niche of a closed canopy East African hominoid, Pan troglodytes, from Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda.δ13C values among C3 resources utilized by Ngogo chimpanzees were highly variable, ranging over 13‰. Infrequent foraging on papyrus (the only C4 plant consumed by chimpanzees at the site) further extended this isotopic range. Variation was ultimately most attributable to mode of photosynthesis (C3 versus C4), food type, and elevation, which together accounted for approximately 78% of the total sample variation. Among C3 food types, bulk carbon values ranged from-24.2‰ to-31.1‰ with intra-plant variability up to 12.1‰. Pith and sapling leaves were statistically more 13C depleted than pulp, seeds, flowers, cambium, roots, leaf buds, and leaves from mature trees. The effect of elevation on carbon variation was highly significant and equivalent to an approximately 1‰ increase in δ13C for every 150m of elevation gain, likely reflecting habitat variability associated with topography. These results indicate significant δ13C variation attributable to food type and elevation among C3 resources and provide important data for hominin dietary interpretations based on carbon isotopic analyses. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Spontaneous vascular mineralization (deposition of iron or calcium salts) has been observed in marble brain syndrome, mineralizing microangiopathy, hypothyroidism, Fahr syndrome, Sturge-Weber syndrome, cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, and calciphylaxis in humans and as an aging or idiopathic lesion in the brains of horses, cats, nonhuman primates, mice, rats, cattle, white-tailed deer, and dogs. Here we present a 27-y-old, adult male chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) with spontaneous, extensive vascular mineralization localized solely to the brain. The chimpanzee exhibited tremors and weakness of the limbs, which progressed to paralysis before euthanasia. Magnetic resonance brain imaging in 2002 and 2010 (immediately before euthanasia) revealed multiple hypointense foci, suggestive of iron- and calcium-rich deposits. At necropsy, the brain parenchyma had occasional petechial hemorrhage, and microscopically, the cerebral, cerebellar and brain stem, gray and white matter had moderate to severe mural aggregates of a granular, basophilic material (mineral) in the blood vessels. In addition, these regions often had moderate to severe medial to transmural deposition of mature collagen in the blood vessels. We ruled out common causes of brain mineralization in humans and animals, but an etiology for the mineralization could not be determined. To our knowledge, mineralization in brain has been reported only once to occur in a chimpanzee, but its chronicity in our case makes it particularly interesting.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees regularly hunt for meat in the wild, including both solo and group hunting; however, theft of prey from non-chimpanzee hunters, or scavenging of carcasses is extremely rare. Here we report the first observations of a novel prey capture technique by the chimpanzees in two adjacent communities in the Budongo Conservation Field Station, Uganda. In both cases blue duikers were found caught in human laid snare traps, and then retrieved by the chimpanzees. In one case the duiker was still alive when retrieved and subsequently fully consumed by the chimpanzees. In the other, the chimpanzees encountered the duiker while alive, but retrieved it soon after its death; here only a small portion was consumed. These observations are discussed in comparison to observations of chimpanzee hunting, scavenging, and their exploitation of an environment increasingly modified by human activity. © 2014 Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: We tested 114 faecal samples from wild simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-positive (n=43) and SIV-negative (n=71) chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) in southeast Cameroon for the presence of gastrointestinal parasites by direct smear. We observed cysts from different protozoa (Entamoeba coli and Entamoeba histolytica / Entamoeba dispar, Endolimax nana, Iodamoeba butschlii, Chilomastix mesnili, Balantidium coli and Blastocystis cells) and trophozoites from Troglodytella abrassarti and Balantidium coli. Eggs from different helminths (strongylids, Ascaris lumbricoides, Abbreviata caucasica, Trichuris sp., Capillaria sp., Enterobius anthropopeci, Bertiella sp., Hymenolepis diminuta and an undetermined fluke) were also observed. Finally, we observed eggs that could not be properly identified and classified. We did not observe any differences between the SIV+and SIV-samples except for the unidentified eggs. The studied chimpanzees were highly parasitised by strongylid (85.1 % of prevalence), Troglodytella (43.8 %) and Blastocystis (2.9 %), and the frequency of the other parasites ranged from 0.9 to 8.8 %. These high levels of parasite infections could represent an additional burden in a population where there is a high rate of the SIV virus in circulation. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: Genomic subsequences conserved between closely related species such as human and chimpanzee exhibit an exponential length distribution, in contrast to the algebraic length distribution observed for sequences shared between distantly related genomes. We find that the former exponential can be further decomposed into an exponential component primarily composed of orthologous sequences, and a truncated algebraic component primarily composed of paralogous sequences. © 2014 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Vpu enhances the release of viral particles from infected cells by interfering with the function of BST-2/tetherin, a cellular protein inhibiting virus release. The Vpu protein encoded by NL4-3, a widely used HIV-1 laboratory strain, antagonizes human BST-2 but not monkey or murine BST-2, leading to the conclusion that BST-2 antagonism by Vpu is species specific. In contrast, we recently identified several primary Vpu isolates, such as Vpu of HIV-1DH12, capable of antagonizing both human and rhesus BST-2. Here we report that while Vpu interacts with human BST-2 primarily through their respective transmembrane domains, antagonism of rhesus BST-2 by Vpu involved an interaction of their cytoplasmic domains. Importantly, a Vpu mutant carrying two mutations in its transmembrane domain (A14L and W22A), rendering it incompetent for interaction with human BST-2, was able to interact with human BST-2 carrying the rhesus BST-2 cytoplasmic domain and partially neutralized the ability of this BST-2 variant to inhibit viral release. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis to detect Vpu-BST-2 interactions suggested that the physical interaction of Vpu with rhesus or chimpanzee BST-2 involves a 5-residue motif in the cytoplasmic domain of BST-2 previously identified as important for the antagonism of monkey and great ape BST-2 by simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Nef. Thus, our study identifies a novel mechanism of antagonism of monkey and great ape BST-2 by Vpu that targets the same motif in BST-2 used by SIV Nef and might explain the expanded host range observed for Vpu isolates in our previous study. © 2013, American Society for Microbiology.

ABSTRACT: Perceptuomotor functions that support using hand tools can be examined in other manipulation tasks, such as alignment of objects to surfaces. We examined tufted capuchin monkeys' and chimpanzees' performance at aligning objects to surfaces while managing one or two spatial relations to do so. We presented six subjects of each species with a single stick to place into a groove, two sticks of equal length to place into two grooves, or two sticks joined as a T to place into a T-shaped groove. Tufted capuchins and chimpanzees performed equivalently on these tasks, aligning the straight stick to within 22.5° of parallel to the groove in approximately half of their attempts to place it, and taking more attempts to place the T stick than two straight sticks. The findings provide strong evidence that tufted capuchins and chimpanzees do not reliably align even one prominent axial feature of an object to a surface, and that managing two concurrent allocentric spatial relations in an alignment problem is significantly more challenging to them than managing two sequential relations. In contrast, humans from 2 years of age display very different perceptuomotor abilities in a similar task: they align sticks to a groove reliably on each attempt, and they readily manage two allocentric spatial relations concurrently. Limitations in aligning objects and in managing two or more relations at a time significantly constrain how nonhuman primates can use hand tools. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: I examined the possible cause of night awakening among wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in Mahale Mountains National Park, Tanzania. Chimpanzee vocalizations and activity-related sounds (CVSs) were used to indicate awakening because I was unable to visually observe them. Over a 5-night observation period, CVSs (n = 128) were heard every night, and most (n = 91) were observed within 5 min of previous CVSs. Chimpanzees use CVSs as social communication to maintain spatial contact with other chimpanzees who occasionally travel at night. The first sound in a sequence of CVSs (CVS bout) was heard immediately following the vocalization or sound of another animal (n = 11), defecation or urination by a chimpanzee (n = 7), or unknown (n = 19). CVS bouts were longer when preceded by defecation or urination than when preceded by the vocalization or sound of other animals or an unknown factor. This suggests that the degree of wakefulness varies according to the possible cause of the disturbance. CVSs at night may be provoked by various factors, and awakening during the night is probably common among diurnal primates. © 2013 Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: Prior to a chimpanzee adenovirus-based (ChAd63) malarial vaccine trial, sera were collected to assess ChAd63-specific neutralizing antibody titers in Banfora (Burkina Faso). The low neutralizing antibody titers reported in both adults and children (median titers, 139.1 and 35.0, respectively) are encouraging for the potential use of ChAd63 as a malarial vaccine vector.

ABSTRACT: The purpose of the present study was to push the boundaries of cooperation among captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). There has been doubt about the level of cooperation that chimpanzees are able to spontaneously achieve or understand. Would they, without any pre-training or restrictions in partner choice, be able to develop successful joint action? And would they be able to extend cooperation to more than two partners, as they do in nature? Chimpanzees were given a chance to cooperate with multiple partners of their own choosing. All members of the group (N = 11) had simultaneous access to an apparatus that required two (dyadic condition) or three (triadic condition) individuals to pull in a tray baited with food. Without any training, the chimpanzees spontaneously solved the task a total of 3,565 times in both dyadic and triadic combinations. Their success rate and efficiency increased over time, whereas the amount of pulling in the absence of a partner decreased, demonstrating that they had learned the task contingencies. They preferentially approached the apparatus when kin or nonkin of similar rank were present, showing a preference for socially tolerant partners. The forced partner combinations typical of cooperation experiments cannot reveal these abilities, which demonstrate that in the midst of a complex social environment, chimpanzees spontaneously initiate and maintain a high level of cooperative behavior. © 2014 Suchak et al.

ABSTRACT: Demographic data from wild chimpanzees are of considerable interest for understanding the evolution of the human life history. Published mortality data, however, come primarily from chimpanzee populations that have recently suffered dramatic, human-induced declines, and exhibit rates of reproduction well below replacement. Here we present a life table for chimpanzees living in the Kanyawara community of Kibale National Park, comprising 1129 individual risk years and 56 deaths. This community has shown modest growth over the past 25 years, avoiding some of the worst impacts of human contact. Sex differences in mortality at Kanyawara appeared similar to those reported from other sites. However, overall mortality rates were significantly lower than those reported from the long-term study sites of Gombe, Taï and Mahale. Kanyawara chimpanzees in this sample had a life expectancy at birth of 19 years, and individuals living to age 14 could expect to live for another 24 years. Life table data from Kanyawara indicate a mean mortality rate of 3.9% per year over the ages of 10-35, substantially less than the equivalent figure of 6.8% from a sample of other long-term chimpanzee study sites. The comparable adult mortality rate from a range of human foraging societies is ~2%. The Kanyawara data thus suggest an important downward revision in adult mortality rates for wild chimpanzees, but they do not challenge the existence of an important difference in adult mortality between humans and chimpanzees. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The Pleistocene epoch was a period of dramatic climate change that had profound impacts on the population sizes of many animal species. How these species were shaped by past events is often unclear, hindering our understanding of the population dynamics resulting in present day populations. We analyzed complete mitochondrial genomes representing all four recognized chimpanzee subspecies and the bonobo to infer the recent demographic history and used simulations to exclude a confounding effect of population structure. Our genus-wide Bayesian coalescent-based analysis revealed surprisingly dissimilar demographic histories of the chimpanzee subspecies and the bonobo, despite their overlapping habitat requirements. Whereas the central and eastern chimpanzee subspecies were inferred to have expanded tenfold between around 50,000 and 80,000 years ago and today, the population size of the neighboring bonobo remained constant. The changes in population size are likely linked to changes in habitat area due to climate oscillations during the late Pleistocene.

ABSTRACT: We present the first longitudinal data on cognitive and motor aging in the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes). Thirty-eight adult female chimpanzees (10-54 years old) were studied. The apes were tested longitudinally for 3 years in a modified Primate Cognition Test Battery, which comprised 12 tests of physical and social cognition. The chimpanzees were also administered a fine motor task requiring them to remove a steel nut from rods of various complexity. There was little evidence for an age-related decline in tasks of Physical Cognition: for most tasks, performance was either stable or improved with repeated testing across age groups. An exception was Spatial Memory, for which 4 individuals more than 50 years old experienced a significant performance decline across the 3 years of testing. Poorer performance with age was found in 2 tasks of Social Cognition, an attention-getting task and a gaze-following task. A slight motor impairment was also observed, with old chimpanzees improving less than younger animals with repeated testing on the simplest rod. Hormonal status effects were restricted to spatial memory, with non-cycling females outperforming cycling females independently of age. Unexpectedly, older chimpanzees were better than younger individuals in understanding causality relationships based on sound. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to gather baseline information about chimpanzee nesting and density in Lagoas de Cufada Natural Park (LCNP), in Guinea-Bissau. Old and narrow trails were followed to estimate chimpanzee density through marked-nest counts and to test the effect of canopy closure (woodland savannah, forest with a sparse canopy, and forest with a dense canopy) on nest distribution. Chimpanzee abundance was estimated at 0.79 nest builders/km2, the lowest among the areas of Guinea-Bissau with currently studied chimpanzee populations. Our data suggest that sub-humid forest with a dense canopy accounts for significantly higher chimpanzee nest abundance (1.50 nests/km of trail) than sub-humid forest with a sparse canopy (0.49 nests/km of trail) or woodland savannah (0.30 nests/km of trail). Dense-canopy forests play an important role in chimpanzee nesting in the patchy and highly humanized landscape of LCNP. The tree species most frequently used for nesting are Dialium guineense (46 %) and Elaeis guineensis (28 %). E. guineensis contain nests built higher in the canopy, while D. guineense contain nests built at lower heights. Nests observed during baseline sampling and replications suggest seasonal variations in the tree species used for nest building. © 2014 Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: The purpose of the present study was to determine the efficacy of investigating spatial cognitive abilities across two primate species using virtual reality. In this study, we presented four captive adult chimpanzees and 16 humans (12 children and 4 adults) with simulated environments of increasing complexity and size to compare species' attention to visuo-spatial features during navigation. The specific task required participants to attend to landmarks in navigating along routes in order to localize the goal site. Both species were found to discriminate effectively between positive and negative landmarks. Assessing path efficiency revealed that both species and all age groups used relatively efficient, distance reducing routes during navigation. Compared to the chimpanzees and adult humans however, younger children's performance decreased as maze complexity and size increased. Surprisingly, in the most complex maze category the humans' performance was less accurate compared to one female chimpanzee. These results suggest that the method of using virtual reality to test captive primates, and in particular, chimpanzees, affords significant cross-species investigations of spatial cognitive and developmental comparisons. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Most primate populations remain unobservable; therefore, researchers depend on the analyses of indirect evidence encountered at a study-site in order to understand their behavioral ecology. Diet can be determined through the analyses of scats or feeding remains encountered on-site. This allows aspects of their dietary repertoire to be established, which has implications both for conservation efforts (by locating food resources), and for understanding the evolution of hominin diet (if used as referential models). Macroscopic inspection of fecal samples is a common method applied to ascertain a primate population's diet. However, new approaches are required to identify food-items unrecognizable at this level. We applied a dry ash extraction method to fecal samples (N=50) collected from 10 adult chimpanzees in Kanyawara, Kibale National Park, Uganda and also to plant parts (N=66) from 34 species known to be included in the diet of this community of apes. We recovered phytoliths in 26 of the 34 plant species. Fifteen phytolith morphotypes were only detected in 14 plant species (termed "distinct" phytoliths). We used these distinct phytoliths to identify plant foods (i.e., that they were associated with) in fecal samples. We then validated findings by checking if the 10 chimpanzees had eaten parts of these plants ∼24hr prior to fecal sample collection; six plant species associated with five distinct phytoliths had been eaten. Finally, we compared plant foods identified in fecal samples from phytolith analyses with plants that had been identified from macroscopic inspection of the same fecal samples. Findings from phytolith analyses corroborate with those from macroscopic inspection by expanding the total number of plant species identified per fecal sample (i.e., we identified certain plant parts that remained unrecognizable at macroscopic level). This study highlights the potential of phytolith analyses of feces to increase our knowledgebase of the dietary repertoire of primate populations. Am. J.

ABSTRACT: Infectious diseases are widely presumed to be one of the greatest threats to ape conservation in the wild. Human diseases are of particular concern, and the costs and benefits of human presence in protected areas with apes are regularly debated. While numerous syndromes with fatal outcomes have recently been described, precise identification of pathogens remains difficult. These diagnostic difficulties are compounded by the fact that direct veterinary intervention on wild apes is quite rare. Here we present the unique case of a wild chimpanzee at Gombe National Park that was observed with a severe illness and was subsequently examined and treated in the field. Multiple specimens were collected and tested with the aim of identifying the pathogen responsible for the illness. Our findings represent the first extensive screening of a living wild chimpanzee, yet despite our efforts, the cause and source of illness remain unknown. Nevertheless, our findings represent valuable baseline data for the ape conservation community and for comparison with other recent findings. In addition, we present the case here to demonstrate the planning required and multiple types of expertise necessary to maximize the amount of data obtained from such a rare intervention, and to provide lessons learned for future studies. © 2013 Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: Researchers investigating the evolutionary roots of human culture have turned to comparing behaviours across nonhuman primate communities, with tool-based foraging in particular receiving much attention. This study examined whether natural extractive foraging behaviours other than tool selection differed across nonhuman primate colonies that had the same foods available. Specifically, the behaviours applied to open the hard-shelled fruits of Strychnos spp. were examined in three socially separate, semi-wild colonies of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) that lived under shared ecological conditions at Chimfunshi Wildlife Orphanage, and were comparable in their genetic makeup. The chimpanzees (N = 56) consistently applied six techniques to open these fruits. GLMM results revealed differences in the number of combined technique types to open fruits across the colonies. They also showed colony differences in the application of three specific techniques. Two techniques (full biting and fruit cracking) were entirely absent in some colonies. This study provides empirical evidence that natural hard-shelled fruit-opening behaviours are distinct across chimpanzee colonies, differences that most likely have not resulted from ecological and genetic reasons. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees are frequently used to illustrate the relationship between sex differences in dispersal and sex differences in cooperation in primates and other group-living mammals. Male chimpanzees are highly philopatric, typically remaining in their natal communities for their entire lives to cooperate with related males in competition against less related males from other groups, whereas females typically disperse once at adolescence and cooperate with each other less frequently. However, there have been a few reports of dependent male offspring joining groups when their mothers transferred between communities as adults. Although such events are difficult to document, determining how often they actually occur is important for elucidating the links between philopatry, kinship, and cooperation in both chimpanzees and group-living animals more generally. Here we use genetic analyses to investigate a previous report of a large-scale transfer of many females and their offspring into the Sonso community of chimpanzees in the Budongo Forest Reserve, Uganda. Using autosomal microsatellite genotypes, we assigned a Sonso father to ten of the fourteen putative immigrants, and found that the four putative immigrants for whom we could not assign a Sonso father (perhaps due to incomplete sampling of all Sonso candidate fathers) nevertheless had Y-chromosome microsatellite haplotypes that were common in Sonso males but absent in males from four other chimpanzee communities at Budongo. These results suggest that these putative immigrant females and their offspring were probably actually long-term residents of Sonso whose identifications were delayed by their peripheral or unhabituated status. These results are consistent with other genetic and behavioral evidence showing that male between-community gene flow is exceedingly rare in east African chimpanzees. Am. J.

ABSTRACT: Communicative skills of chimpanzees are of significant interest across many domains, such as developmental psychology (how does communication emerge in prelinguistic beings?), evolution (e.g., did human language evolve from primate gestures?), and in comparative psychology (how does the nonverbal communication of chimpanzees and humans compare?). Here we ask about how gestures develop in chimpanzee infants (n=16) that were raised in an interactive program designed to study skill development. Data on socio-communicative development were collected following 4hr of daily interaction with each infant, longitudinally from birth through the first year of life. A consistent and significant developmental pattern was found across the contexts of tickle play, grooming, and chase play: Infant chimpanzees first engaged in interactions initiated by others, then they initiated interactions, and finally, they requested others to join them in the interaction. Gestures were documented for initiating and requesting tickle play, for initiating and requesting grooming, and for initiating and requesting chase play. Gestural requests emerged significantly later than gestural initiations, but the age at which gestures emerged was significantly different across contexts. Those gestures related to hierarchical rank relations, that is, gestures used by subordinates in interaction with more dominant individuals, such as wrist presenting and rump presenting, did not emerge in the same manner as the other gestures. This study offers a new view on the development of gestures, specifically that many develop through interaction and communicate socio-emotional desires, but that not all gestures emerge in the same manner.

ABSTRACT: Female space use can have important fitness consequences, which are likely due to differential access to food resources. Many studies have explored spatial competition in solitary species, but little is known about how individuals in social species compete over shared space. In this study, we investigate spatial patterns of aggression among female East African chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii. This species provides an excellent opportunity to study spatial competition since (1) female chimpanzees occupy overlapping core areas (small areas of the community range in which individuals concentrate their space use) and (2) female core area quality is correlated with reproductive success, suggesting that females compete over long-term access to core areas. Here, we examine how female aggression towards other females varies inside and outside individual female core areas during a 14-year period at Gombe National Park, Tanzania. Overall, females showed higher rates of aggression inside than outside their own core areas. This pattern was driven by spatial variation in aggression in nonfeeding contexts. While food-related aggression did not vary spatially, females were more aggressive in nonfeeding contexts inside their core areas than they were outside their core areas. These results suggest that female chimpanzees follow a mixed strategy in which they compete for long-term access to resources in their core areas as well as for immediate access to food throughout the community range. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: Understanding variability in patterns of parasite infections requires studies of multiple populations inhabiting a variety of habitats. Gastrointestinal parasites of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) have been studied extensively at several forested sites, but the parasite fauna of chimpanzees living in dry, open habitats is less well known. We studied the parasites of savanna chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) living in the Issa Valley, Ugalla (Tanzania). We examined 119 fresh fecal samples using standard coproscopical methods. We detected protozoans including Blastocystis sp., Entamoeba coli, E. histolytica/dispar, Iodamoeba buetschlii, Troglodytella abrassarti, and Troglocorys cava, but only two types of spirurid nematodes among the helminths. The parasites of the Ugalla chimpanzees differ from those of forest chimpanzees in the absence of Strongyloides sp. and strongylid nematodes and a high prevalence of spirurids. Strongylids and Strongyloides sp. have thin-shelled eggs and larvae, which develop in the external environment; thus they may not be able to survive for prolonged periods in the extreme environment of Ugalla. The Ugalla chimpanzees also live at a lower population density and exhibit a larger home range than forest chimpanzees, factors that may lead to lower exposure to infective nematode larvae. Spirurid eggs, however, have thick shells and a life cycle dependent on intermediary hosts, making their survival and transmission in such extreme conditions more feasible. These differences between parasite fauna of closed and open forest chimpanzees contribute to our understanding of the ecology of infectious disease, and have the potential to contribute to conservation policies and practices. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: The recent development of methods that apply coalescent theory to phylogenetic problems has enabled the study of the population-level phenomena that drove the diversification of anthropoid primates. Effective population size, Ne, is one of the main parameters that constitute the theoretical underpinning of these new analytical approaches. For this reason, the ancestral Ne of selected primate lineages has been thoroughly investigated. However, for some of these lineages, the estimates of ancestral Ne reported in several studies present significant variation. This is the case for the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees. Moreover, several ancestral anthropoid lineages have been ignored in the studies conducted so far. Because Ne is fundamental to understand historic species demography, it is a crucial component of a complete description of the historical scenario of primate evolution. It also provides information that is helpful for differentiating between competing biogeographical hypotheses. In this study, the effective population sizes of the anthropoid ancestors of the human-chimp lineage are inferred using data sets of coding and noncoding sequences. A general pattern of a serial decline of population sizes is found between the ancestral lineage of Anthropoidea and that of Homo and Pan. When the theoretical distribution of gene trees was derived from the parametric estimates obtained, it closely corresponded to the empirical frequency of inferred gene trees along the genome. The most abrupt decrease of Ne was found between the ancestors of all great apes and those of the African great apes alone. This suggests the occurrence of a genetic bottleneck during the evolution of Homininae, which corroborates the origin of African apes from a Eurasian ancestor. © 2013 The Author 2013.

ABSTRACT: A 49-y-old, female chimpanzee presented with a history of cardiac failure. Postmortem examination revealed lesions consistent with congestive heart failure and 2 incidental, round, firm, pale-tan intramural nodules (diameter, 2 cm) in the stomach at the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ). Histologically, the GEJ nodules were diagnosed as benign spindle-cell tumors. Immunohistochemical evaluation revealed neoplastic cells diffusely labeled with α-smooth muscle actin and vimentin, multifocally labeled for desmin, and were negative for c-kit (CD117). Electron microscopy revealed intracytoplasmic bundles of myofilaments with dense bodies, basal lamina, and few pinocytic vesicles in the neoplastic cells. According to these findings, leiomyomas of the GEJ were diagnosed. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors have been documented to occur in chimpanzees, but there are no reports of GEJ leiomyomas. To our knowledge, this report is the first description of spontaneous leiomyomas of the GEJ in a chimpanzee. Copyright 2014 by the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science.

ABSTRACT: The rate of DNA mutation and divergence is highly variable across the tree of life. However, the reasons underlying this variation are not well understood. Comparing the rates of genetic changes between hosts and parasite lineages that diverged at the same time is one way to begin to understand differences in genetic mutation and substitution rates. Such studies have indicated that the rate of genetic divergence in parasites is often faster than that of their hosts when comparing single genes. However, the variation in this relative rate of molecular evolution across different genes in the genome is unknown. We compared the rate of DNA sequence divergence between humans, chimpanzees and their ectoparasitic lice for 1534 protein-coding genes across their genomes. The rate of DNA substitution in these orthologous genes was on average 14 times faster for lice than for humans and chimpanzees. In addition, these rates were positively correlated across genes. Because this correlation only occurred for substitutions that changed the amino acid, this pattern is probably produced by similar functional constraints across the same genes in humans, chimpanzees and their ectoparasites. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Type 2 diabetes can be a problem for captive chimpanzees. Accurate blood glucose (BG) readings are necessary to monitor and treat this disease. Thus, obtaining voluntary samples from primates through positive reinforcement training (PRT) is critical. The current study assessed the voluntary participation of 123 chimpanzees in BG sampling and investigated factors that may contribute to individual success. All subjects participate in regular PRT sessions as part of a comprehensive behavioral management program. Basic steps involved in obtaining BG values include: voluntarily presenting a finger/toe; allowing digit disinfection; holding for the lancet device; and allowing blood collection onto a glucometer test strip for analysis. We recorded the level of participation (none, partial, or complete) when each chimpanzee was first asked to perform the testing procedure. Nearly 30% of subjects allowed the entire procedure in one session, without any prior specific training for the target behavior. Factors that affected this initial successful BG testing included sex, personality (chimpanzees rated higher on the factor "openness" were more likely to participate with BG testing), and past training performance for "present-for-injection" (chimpanzees that presented for their most recent anesthetic injection were more likely to participate). Neither age, rearing history, time since most recent anesthetic event nor social group size significantly affected initial training success. These results have important implications for captive management and training program success, underlining individual differences in training aptitude and the need for developing individual management plans in order to provide optimal care and treatment for diabetic chimpanzees in captivity. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) and humans (Homo sapiens) share physiological and genetic characteristics, but have remarkably different life spans, with chimpanzees living 50-60 % and the rhesus living 35-40 % of maximum human survival. Since oxidative processes are associated with aging and longevity, we might expect to see species differences in age-related oxidative processes. Blood and extracellular fluid contain two major thiol redox nodes, glutathione (GSH)/glutathione-disulfide (GSSG) and cysteine (Cys)/cystine (CySS), which are subject to reversible oxidation-reduction reactions and are maintained in a dynamic non-equilibrium state. Disruption of these thiol redox nodes leads to oxidation of their redox potentials (EhGSSG and EhCySS) which affects cellular physiology and is associated with aging and the development of chronic diseases in humans. The purpose of this study was to measure age-related changes in these redox thiols and their corresponding redox potentials (Eh) in chimpanzees and rhesus monkeys. Our results show similar age-related decreases in the concentration of plasma GSH and Total GSH as well as oxidation of the EhGSSG in male and female chimpanzees. Female chimpanzees and female rhesus monkeys also were similar in several outcome measures. For example, similar age-related decreases in the concentration of plasma GSH and Total GSH, as well as age-related oxidation of the EhGSSG were observed. The data collected from chimpanzees and rhesus monkeys corroborates previous reports on oxidative changes in humans and confirms their value as a comparative reference for primate aging.

ABSTRACT: An intracranial arachnoid cyst was detected in a 32-year-old, 44.6-kg, female chimpanzee at the Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) were performed and the cognitive studies in which she participated were reviewed. MRI revealed that the cyst was present in the chimpanzee's right occipital convexity, and was located in close proximity to the posterior horn of the right lateral ventricle without ventriculomegaly. CT confirmed the presence of the cyst and no apparent signs indicating previous skull fractures were found. The thickness of the mandible was asymmetrical, whereas the temporomandibular joints and dentition were symmetrical. She showed no abnormalities in various cognitive studies since she was 3 years old, except a different behavioural pattern during a recent study, indicating a possible visual field defect. Detailed cognitive studies, long-term observation of her physical condition and follow-up MRI will be continued. © 2013 Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: Background: γδT cells are effector cells that eliminate cancer and virus-infected cells. Chimpanzees are an endangered species that can naturally and experimentally be infected with SIV and HIV, respectively, but no information about the functionality of γδT cells during chronic lentiviral infection is currently available. Methods: Healthy and HIV-infected chimpanzee γδT cells were characterized by flow cytometry. γδT subsets were studied after stimulation with T-cell activators, and the release of cytokines was analyzed by Luminex assay. Results: γδT-cell subsets, Vδ1 and Vδ2Vγ9, showed different patterns in the expression of CD4, CD195, CD159a, and CD159c. Stimulation of γδT cells resulted in increased levels of CD4 and HLA-DR, which is more pronounced in Vδ1 T cells. Distinct cytokine patterns were found between healthy and HIV-infected chimpanzees. Conclusions: Analyses of major chimpanzee γδT subsets show similarities to human γδT cells and suggest different functionality and roles in their immune response against HIV infection. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

ABSTRACT: Population parameters such as size, density, and distribution of a species across a landscape are important metrics that inform conservation science and are key to management strategies. In this study, we used genetic capture-recapture methods to estimate the population size and density of the little-studied chimpanzees in the Ugalla region of western Tanzania. From 237 fecal samples collected non-invasively over a 10-month period, we identified a minimum of 113 individuals. Based on the two-innate rate method (TIRM) modeled in the software capwire, we obtained a maximum-likelihood estimate of 322 (CI 227-373) individuals over the 624km2 area surveyed. Using a spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) method, we estimated a population density of 0.25 (CI 0.16-0.38) individuals/km2. Observations of nests and search effort data revealed areas of more intense usage. The findings of this study are an important step in the characterization of the Ugalla chimpanzees, and substantially improve our understanding of the number of chimpanzees that occupy this savanna-woodland region at the easternmost extent of the geographic range of this endangered subspecies. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Remembering the location of fruiting trees for extended periods of time has been hypothesized to play a major role in the evolution of primate cognition. Such ability would be especially useful when paired with a fast learning mechanism capable of consolidating long-term memory after minimal exposure. We investigated whether chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) can remember different food locations after minimal exposure (i.e., 1-2 trials) both after 24hr and after 3-month. We released pairs of chimpanzees in their indoor enclosure (the enclosure of group A measured 430m2 and group B's measured 175m2) and tested them for four consecutive days (Baseline, Test, Retest, and Post-test). During the Test and Retest food was hidden in the same location whereas no food was hidden during the Baseline and Post-test days (control trials). Subjects were tested with four different locations and assessed for their retention after 24hr and 3-month since the initial food discovery. Results revealed that chimpanzees accurately remembered the locations in which they found the food after one or two exposures to them, and both after 24hr and a 3-month retention interval. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Persistent infection is a key feature of hepatitis C virus (HCV). However, chimpanzee infections with cell culture-derived viruses (JFH1 or related chimeric viruses that replicate efficiently in cell culture) have been limited to acute-transient infections with no pathogenicity. Here, we report persistent infection with chronic hepatitis in a chimpanzee challenged with cell culture-derived genotype 1a virus (H77S.2) containing 6 cell culture-adaptive mutations. Following acute-transient infection with a chimeric H77/JFH1 virus (HJ3-5), intravenous (i.v.) challenge with 106 FFU H77S.2 virus resulted in immediate seroconversion and, following an unusual 4-to 6-week delay, persistent viremia accompanied by alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation, intrahepatic innate immune responses, and diffuse hepatopathy. This first persistent infection with cell culture-produced HCV provided a unique opportunity to assess evolution of cell culture-adapted virus in vivo. Synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution rates were greatest during the first 8 weeks of infection. Of 6 cell culture-adaptive mutations in H77S.2, Q1067R (NS3) had reverted to Q1067 and S2204I (NS5A) was replaced by T2204 within 8 weeks of infection. By 62 weeks, 4 of 6 mutations had reverted to the wild-type sequence, and all reverted to the wild-type sequence by 194 weeks. The data suggest H77S.2 virus has greater potential for persistence and pathogenicity than JFH1 and demonstrate both the capacity of a nonfit virus to persist for weeks in the liver in the absence of detectable viremia as well as strong selective pressure against cell culture-adaptive mutations in vivo. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

ABSTRACT: Information on the chimpanzee nasopharygeal colonization in captive sanctuaries and in the wild is rare. This study was undertaken to establish the nasopharygeal colonization and potential bacterial pathogens in sanctuary chimpanzees as a basis for improving chimpanzee and employee health. Nasopharygeal colonization of 39 healthy chimpanzees were analyzed by microbiological cultivation method and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. We report four major phyla dominated by Proteobacteria (50%), Fermicutes (35.7%), Bacteriodes (7.1%), and Cynobacteria (7.1%) in healthy semi-captive chimpanzees. Further classification based on 7-base oligomers revealed the following genera: Streptococcus, Veillonella, Neisseria, Prevotella, Kingella and unclassified Cynobacteria, Actinobacillus, Bacteriodes and Pasteurellaceae. On microbiological cultivation we were able to identify and characterize some of the bacteria to species level as Klebsiella pneumonie and Pseudomonas aeruginosa being dominant bacteria with 54.7% and 50% colonization, respectively. Of these, Streptococcus, Neisseria, Klebsiella, and Haemophillus have representatives known to potentially cause severe respiratory disease. Our data present important information on chimpanzee nasopharygeal colonization as a guide to understanding disease processes and pharmaceutical therapies required for improving the health of chimpanzees. The results from this study will guide the processes to improve procedures for routine management of sanctuary chimpanzees and use it as a basis for evaluation of future reintroduction possibilities. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Recently, several reports have revealed that some simian adenoviruses (AdVs) strains show a close relationship to human AdVs. In the present study, a simian AdV strain named SAdV-ch1 was detected in chimpanzees in China, and its complete genome was determined. Phylogenetic analysis revealed SAdV-ch1 clustering in a clade that was separate from all of the other simian AdVs but genetically close to a human AdV strain, HAdV-18 (GenBank no. GU191019), sharing 92.5% sequence identity with it. Recombination analysis provided evidence that a recombination event had occurred between SAdV-ch1 and HAdV-61 (JF964962), where SAdV-ch1 exchanged partial of its hexon gene segment with HAdV-61, leading to the recombinant HAdV-31 (AM749299). © 2014 Springer-Verlag Wien.

ABSTRACT: Insects are a nutritious food source for many primates. In chimpanzees, insectivory is most prevalent among communities that manufacture tools to harvest social insects, particularly ants and termites. In contrast to other long-term study sites, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) in Budongo Forest and Kibale National Park, Uganda, rarely eat insects and have small foraging tool kits, supporting speculation that infrequent insectivory-technically aided or otherwise-characterises chimpanzees in this part of Uganda's Rift Valley. To expand the dataset for this region, insect foraging was investigated at Bulindi (25 km from Budongo) over 19 months during two studies in 2007-2008 and 2012-2013. Systematic faecal analysis demonstrated that insectivory is a habitual foraging activity at this site. Overall levels of insect consumption varied considerably across months but were not predicted by monthly changes in rainfall or fruit intake. Unlike their Budongo and Kibale counterparts, Bulindi chimpanzees often consume ants (principally weaver ants, Oecophylla longinoda) and use sticks to dig out stingless bee (Meliponini) ground nests. In other respects, however, insectivory at Bulindi conforms to the pattern observed elsewhere in this region: they do not manufacture 'fishing' or 'dipping' tools to harvest termites and aggressive or hard-to-access ants (e.g., army ants, Dorylus spp.), despite availability of suitable prey. The Bulindi data lend support to the supposition that chimpanzees in this part of the Rift Valley rarely exploit termites and Dorylus ants, apparently lacking the 'cultural knowledge' that would enable them to do so most efficiently (i.e., tool use). The study's findings contribute to current debates about the relative influence of genetics, environment and culture in shaping regional and local variability in Pan foraging ecology. © 2014 Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: Social network analysis methods have made it possible to test whether novel behaviors in animals spread through individual or social learning. To date, however, social network analysis of wild populations has been limited to static models that cannot precisely reflect the dynamics of learning, for instance, the impact of multiple observations across time. Here, we present a novel dynamic version of network analysis that is capable of capturing temporal aspects of acquisition—that is, how successive observations by an individual influence its acquisition of the novel behavior. We apply this model to studying the spread of two novel tool-use variants, “moss-sponging” and “leaf-sponge re-use,” in the Sonso chimpanzee community of Budongo Forest, Uganda. Chimpanzees are widely considered the most “cultural” of all animal species, with 39 behaviors suspected as socially acquired, most of them in the domain of tool-use. The cultural hypothesis is supported by experimental data from captive chimpanzees and a range of observational data. However, for wild groups, there is still no direct experimental evidence for social learning, nor has there been any direct observation of social diffusion of behavioral innovations. Here, we tested both a static and a dynamic network model and found strong evidence that diffusion patterns of moss-sponging, but not leaf-sponge re-use, were significantly better explained by social than individual learning. The most conservative estimate of social transmission accounted for 85% of observed events, with an estimated 15-fold increase in learning rate for each time a novice observed an informed individual moss-sponging. We conclude that group-specific behavioral variants in wild chimpanzees can be socially learned, adding to the evidence that this prerequisite for culture originated in a common ancestor of great apes and humans, long before the advent of modern humans. © 2014 Hobaiter et al.

ABSTRACT: The obligate-heritable endosymbionts of insects possess some of the smallest known bacterial genomes. This is likely due to loss of genomic material during symbiosis. The mode and rate of this erosion may change over evolutionary time: faster in newly formed associations and slower in long-established ones. The endosymbionts of human and anthropoid primate lice present a unique opportunity to study genome erosion in newly established (or young) symbionts. This is because we have a detailed phylogenetic history of these endosymbionts with divergence dates for closely related species. This allows for genome evolution to be studied in detail and rates of change to be estimated in a phylogenetic framework. Here, we sequenced the genome of the chimpanzee louse endosymbiont (Candidatus Riesia pediculischaeffi) and compared it with the closely related genome of the human body louse endosymbiont. From this comparison, we found evidence for recent genome erosion leading to gene loss in these endosymbionts. Although gene loss was detected, it was not significantly greater than in older endosymbionts from aphids and ants. Additionally, we searched for genes associated with B-vitamin synthesis in the two louse endosymbiont genomes because these endosymbionts are believed to synthesize essential B vitamins absent in the louse's diet. All of the expected genes were present, except those involved in thiamin synthesis. We failed to find genes encoding for proteins involved in the biosynthesis of thiamin or any complete exogenous means of salvaging thiamin, suggesting there is an undescribed mechanism for the salvage of thiamin. Finally, genes encoding for the pantothenate de novo biosynthesis pathway were located on a plasmid in both taxa along with a heat shock protein. Movement of these genes onto a plasmid may be functionally and evolutionarily significant, potentially increasing production and guarding against the deleterious effects of mutation. These data add to a growing resource of obligate endosymbiont genomes and to our understanding of the rate and mode of genome erosion in obligate animal-associated bacteria. Ultimately sequencing additional louse p-endosymbiont genomes will provide a model system for studying genome evolution in obligate host associated bacteria. © 2014 Boyd et al.

ABSTRACT: Plasmodium falciparum causes most human malaria deaths, having prehistorically evolved from parasites of African Great Apes. Here we explore the genomic basis of P. falciparum adaptation to human hosts by fully sequencing the genome of the closely related chimpanzee parasite species P. reichenowi, and obtaining partial sequence data from a more distantly related chimpanzee parasite (P. gaboni). The close relationship between P. reichenowi and P. falciparum is emphasized by almost complete conservation of genomic synteny, but against this strikingly conserved background we observe major differences at loci involved in erythrocyte invasion. The organization of most virulence-associated multigene families, including the hypervariable var genes, is broadly conserved, but P. falciparum has a smaller subset of rif and stevor genes whose products are expressed on the infected erythrocyte surface. Genome-wide analysis identifies other loci under recent positive selection, but a limited number of changes at the host-parasite interface may have mediated host switching. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

ABSTRACT: Long-distance calls have a variety of functions in different animal species. However, where multiple functions are proposed for a single long-distance call type, little is known about their relative importance. Chimpanzees are one species where several functions have been proposed for their long-distance call, the pant hoot. In this study, we investigated the effect of social factors, including the rank of the caller, party size, fission-fusion rates, and the presence of estrus females as well as ecological factors including the type of food consumed and travel time, on male chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) pant hooting, in order to identify the key correlates of this behavior. The wild male chimpanzees of the Kanyawara community, Uganda, produced more pant hoots on days when there were frequent changes in the male, but not female, composition of the focal's party. This factor accounted for the largest amount of variation in pant hoot production, and we found that males were more likely to repeat a call prior to rather than after fusion with other males, suggesting that the calls facilitate fusion. Pant hoots therefore seem to play a pivotal role in regulating grouping dynamics in chimpanzees. Our study also shows that pant hooting was positively correlated with the rank of the caller, the presence of parous females in estrus, and the consumption of high-quality food, suggesting that pant hoots signal social status or social bonds when between-male competition is high. This study supports the view that pant hoots fulfill a complex social function. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees manufacture flexible fishing probes to fish for termites in Issa, Ugalla, western Tanzania. These termite-fishing tools are similar in size and material to those used by long-studied communities of chimpanzees in western Tanzania (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) and in West Africa (P. t. verus), but not central African populations (P. t. troglodytes). This report adds to the patchwork of evidence of termite-fishing tool use behaviour by chimpanzees across Africa. © 2013 Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: At least 10% of the Sebitoli chimpanzee community of the Kibale National Park (Uganda) present a characteristic facial phenotype with flattened nose, reduced nostrils, and concave mid-face. Affected individuals do not present skin lesions, and also young infants are affected. We suggest, therefore, a congenital origin of this defect. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

ABSTRACT: The notion of animal culture has been well established mainly through research aiming at uncovering differences between populations. In chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus), cultural diversity has even been found in neighboring communities, where differences were observed despite frequent immigration of individuals. Female chimpanzees transfer at the onset of sexual maturity at an age, when the behavioral repertoire is fully formed. With immigrating females, behavioral variety enters the group. Little is known about the diversity and the longevity of cultural traits within a community. This study is building on previous findings of differences in hammer selection when nut cracking between neighboring communities despite similar ecological conditions. We now further investigated the diversity and maintenance of cultural traits within one chimpanzee community and were able to show high levels of uniformity in group-specific behavior. Fidelity to the behavior pattern did not vary between dispersing females and philopatric males. Furthermore, group-specific tool selection remained similar over a period of 25 years. Additionally, we present a study case on how one newly immigrant female progressively behaved more similar to her new group, suggesting that the high level of similarity in behavior is actively adopted by group members possibly even when originally expressing the behavior in another form. Taken together, our data support a cultural transmission process in adult chimpanzees, which leads to persisting cultural behavior of one community over time. Am. J. Primatol. 76:649-657, 2014.

ABSTRACT: Sex differences in the behaviour of human children are a hotly debated and often controversial topic. However, several recent studies have documented a biological basis to key aspects of child social behaviour. To further explore the evolutionary basis of such differences, we investigated sex differences in sociability in wild chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, infants at Gombe National Park, Tanzania. We used a long-term data set on mother-infant behaviour to analyse the diversity of infant chimpanzee social partners from age 30 to 36 months. Male infants (N=12) interacted with significantly more individuals than female infants did (N=8), even when maternal sociability was controlled for. Furthermore, male infants interacted with significantly more adult males than female infants did. Our data indicate that the well-documented sex differences in adult chimpanzee social tendencies begin to appear quite early in development. Furthermore, these data suggest that the behavioural sex differences of human children are fundamentally rooted in our biological and evolutionary heritage. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: It has been revealed that gene content changes, or gene gains or losses, have played an important role in the evolution of modern humans. As one of the major players accounting for gene content changes, gene pseudogenization is abundant in mammalian genomes, and approximately 20000 pseudogenes have been identified in ape genomes. Therefore, it is an interesting question how to exploit rich information embedded in pseudogenes. Here, I present a bioinformatic pipeline that utilizes a pseudogene database to identify both lineage-specific genes and pseudogenes in humans and chimpanzees. I found 6 human-specific gene gains (HSGs), 1 chimpanzee-specific gene gain, and 4 chimpanzee-specific pseudogenes, most not discovered in previous studies. Further analysis showed that HSGs have been evolving under strong purifying selection and are broadly expressed, indicating strong functional constraint. This study demonstrates the usage of pseudogene information in comparative genomics and suggests that new genes during primate evolution may acquire essential functions in a short time. The pipeline developed here could also be applied to other species. © 2014 © The American Genetic Association 2014. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Objectives: Slower rates of aging distinguish humans from our nearest living cousins. Chimpanzees rarely survive their forties while large fractions of women are postmenopausal even in high-mortality hunter-gatherer populations. Cellular and molecular mechanisms for these somatic aging differences remain to be identified, though telomeres might play a role. To find out, we compared telomere lengths across age-matched samples of female chimpanzees and women. Methods: We used a monochrome multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction to assay canonical telomere repeats in blood cells from captive female chimpanzees (65 individuals; age: 6.2-56.7 years) and compared them to the same measure in human females (43 individuals; age: 7.4-57.3 years). Results: Our samples showed little difference in attrition rates between the species (∼0.022 T/S per year for chimpanzees and ∼0.012 T/S per year for humans with overlapping 95% confidence intervals), but telomeres were twice as long in chimpanzees as in humans (T/S ratios=2.70 and 1.26, respectively). Conclusions: Based on the longevity differences, we initially hypothesized that telomere shortening rates would be faster in chimpanzees than in humans. Instead, it is shorter telomere length that appears to be the derived state in humans. This comparison indicates that better characterization of physiological aging in our closest living relatives will be indispensable for understanding the evolution of distinctive human longevity. Am.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees cooperate in a variety of contexts, but communicating to influence and regulate cooperative activities is rare. It is unclear whether this reflects chimpanzees' general inability or whether they have found other means to coordinate cooperative activities. In the present study chimpanzees could help a partner play her role in a mutually beneficial food-retrieval task either by transferring a needed tool (transfer condition) or by visually or acoustically communicating the hiding-location of the needed tool (communication condition). Overall, chimpanzees readily helped their partner by delivering the needed tool, but none of them communicated the hiding location of the tool to their partner reliably across trials. These results demonstrate that although chimpanzees can coordinate their cooperative activities by instrumentally helping their partner in her role, they do not readily use communication with their partner for this same end. © 2014 American Psychological Association.

ABSTRACT: Understanding the benefits and costs of acquiring and consuming different forms of animal matter by primates is critical for identifying the selective pressures responsible for increased meat consumption in the hominin lineage. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are unusual among primates in the amount of vertebrate prey they consume. Still, surprisingly little is known about the nutritional benefits of eating meat for this species. In order to understand why chimpanzees eat vertebrates, it is critical to consider the relative benefits and costs of other types of faunivory - including invertebrates. Although we lack specific nutritional data on the flesh and organs of chimpanzee prey, the macronutrient profiles of insects and wild vertebrate meat are generally comparable on a gram-to-gram basis. There are currently very few data on the micronutrient (vitamin and mineral) content of meat consumed by chimpanzees. With few exceptions, the advantages of hunting vertebrate prey include year-round availability, rapid acquisition of larger packages and reduced handling/processing time (once prey are encountered or detected). The disadvantages of hunting vertebrate prey include high potential acquisition costs per unit time (energy expenditure and risk of injury) and greater contest competition with conspecifics. Acquiring an equivalent mass of invertebrates (to match even a small scrap of meat) is possible, but typically takes more time. Furthermore, in contrast to vertebrate prey, some insect resources are effectively available only at certain times of the year. Here we identify the critical data needed to test our hypothesis that meat scraps may have a higher (or at least comparable) net benefit:cost ratio than insect prey. This would support the 'meat scrap' hypothesis as an explanation for why chimpanzees hunt in groups even when doing so does not maximize an individual's energetic gain. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) substitutions are the most common type of RNA editing in mammals. A-to-I RNA editing is particularly widespread in the brain and is known to play important roles in neuronal functions. In this study we investigated RNA-editing changes during human brain development and maturation, as well as evolutionary conservation of RNA-editing patterns across primates. We used high-throughput transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) to quantify the RNA-editing levels and assess ontogenetic dynamics of RNA editing at more than 8000 previously annotated exonic A-to-I RNA-editing sites in two brain regions - prefrontal cortex and cerebellum - of humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus macaques. We observed substantial conservation of RNA-editing levels between the brain regions, as well as among the three primate species. Evolutionary changes in RNA editing were nonetheless evident, with 40% of the annotated editing sites studied showing divergent editing levels among the three species and 16.5% of sites displaying statistically significant human-specific editing patterns. Across lifespan, we observed an increase of the RNA-editing level with advanced age in both brain regions of all three primate species. © 2013 Li et al.

ABSTRACT: Insectivory is hypothesized to be an important source of macronutrients, minerals, and vitamins for chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), yet nutritional data based on actual intake are lacking. Drawing on observations from 2008 to 2010 and recently published nutritional assays, we determined the energy, macronutrient and mineral yields for termite-fishing (Macrotermes), ant-dipping (Dorylus), and ant-fishing (Camponotus) by the Kasekela chimpanzees of Gombe National Park, Tanzania. We also estimated the yields from consumption of weaver ants (Oecophylla) and termite alates (Macrotermes and Pseudacanthotermes). On days when chimpanzees were observed to prey on insects, the time spent in insectivorous behavior ranged from <1min to over 4h. After excluding partial bouts and those of <1min duration, ant-dipping bouts were of significantly shorter duration than the other two forms of tool-assisted insectivory but provided the highest mass intake rate. Termite-fishing bouts were of significantly longer duration than ant-dipping and had a lower mass intake rate, but provided higher mean and maximum mass yields. Ant-fishing bouts were comparable to termite-fishing bouts in duration but had significantly lower mass intake rates. Mean and maximum all-day yields from termite-fishing and ant-dipping contributed to or met estimated recommended intake (ERI) values for a broad array of minerals. The mean and maximum all-day yields of other insects consistently contributed to the ERI only for manganese. All forms of insectivory provided small but probably non-trivial amounts of fat and protein. We conclude that different forms of insectivory have the potential to address different nutritional needs for Kasekela chimpanzees. Other than honeybees, insects have received little attention as potential foods for hominins. Our results suggest that ants and (on a seasonal basis) termites would have been viable sources of fat, high-quality protein and minerals for extinct hominins employing Pan-like subsistence technology in East African woodlands. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Humans excel in cooperative exchanges between unrelated individuals. Although this trait is fundamental to the success of our species, its evolution and mechanisms are poorly understood. Other social mammals also build long-term cooperative relationships between non-kin, and recent evidence shows that oxytocin, a hormone involved in parent-offspring bonding, is likely to facilitate non-kin as well as kin bonds. In a population of wild chimpanzees, we measured urinary oxytocin levels following a rare cooperative event-food sharing. Subjects showed higher urinary oxytocin levels after single food-sharing events compared with other types of social feeding, irrespective of previous social bond levels. Also, urinary oxytocin levels following food sharing were higher than following grooming, another cooperative behaviour. Therefore, food sharing in chimpanzees may play a key role in social bonding under the influence of oxytocin. We propose that food-sharing events co-opt neurobiological mechanisms evolved to support mother-infant bonding during lactation bouts, and may act as facilitators of bonding and cooperation between unrelated individuals via the oxytocinergic system across social mammals. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Many recent comparative studies have addressed "episodic" memory in nonhuman animals, suggesting that birds, rodents, great apes, and others can remember their own behavior after at least a half-day delay. By contrast, despite numerous studies regarding long-termmemory, few comparable studies have been conducted on shortterm retention for own behavior. In the current study, we addressed the following question: Do chimpanzees remember what they have just done? Four chimpanzees performed matching-to-sample and visual search tasks on a routine basis and were occasionally (every four sessions) given a "recognition" test immediately after their response during visual search trials. Even though these test trials were given very rarely, all four chimpanzees chose the stimulus they selected in the visual search trials immediately before the test trial significantly more frequently than they chose the stimulus they selected in another distractor trial. Subsequent experiments ruled out the possibility that preferences for the specific stimuli accounted for the recognition test results. Thus, chimpanzees remembered their own behavior even within a shortterminterval. This type of memory may involve the transfer of episodic information fromworking memory to long-termepisodic-like memory (i.e., an episodic buffer). © 2014 Tomonaga and Kaneko.

ABSTRACT: Facial expressions have long been proposed to be important agents in forming and maintaining cooperative interactions in social groups. Human beings are inordinately cooperativewhen compared with their closest-living relatives, the great apes, and hence one might expect species differences in facial expressivity in contexts in which cooperation could be advantageous. Here, human children and chimpanzees were given an identical task designed to induce an element of frustration (itwas impossible to solve). In children, but not chimpanzees, facial expressions associated with effort and determination positively correlated with persistence at the task. By contrast, bodily indicators of stress (self-directed behaviour) negatively correlated with task persistence in chimpanzees. Thus, children exhibited more behaviour as they persisted, and chimpanzees exhibited less. The facial expressions produced by children, could, therefore, function to solicit prosocial assistance from others. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Background: Plasmodium falciparum shares its most recent common ancestor with parasites found in African apes; these species constitute the so-called Laverania clade. In this investigation, the evolutionary history of Plasmodium lineages found in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) was explored. Methods. Here, the remainders of 74 blood samples collected as part of the chimpanzees' routine health examinations were studied. For all positive samples with parasite lineages belonging to the Laverania clade, the complete mitochondrial genome (mtDNA), the gene encoding dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (dhfr-ts), the chloroquine resistance transporter (Pfcrt), the circumsporozoite protein (csp), merozoite surface protein 2 (msp2), and the DBL-1 domain from var2CSA were amplified, cloned, and sequenced. Other Plasmodium species were included in the mtDNA, dhfr-ts, and csp analyses. Phylogenetic and evolutionary genetic analyses were performed, including molecular clock analyses on the mtDNA. Results/Conclusions. Nine chimpanzees were malaria positive (12.2%); four of those infections were identified as P. falciparum, two as a Plasmodium reichenowi-like parasite or Plasmodium sp., one as Plasmodium gaboni, and two as Plasmodium malariae. All P. falciparum isolates were resistant to chloroquine indicating that the chimpanzees acquired such infections from humans in recent times. Such findings, however, are not sufficient for implicating chimpanzees as an animal reservoir for P. falciparum. Timing estimates support that the Laverania clade has co-existed with hominids for a long-period of time. The proposed species P. gaboni, Plasmodium billbrayi, and Plasmodium billcollinsi are monophyletic groups supporting that they are indeed different species. An expanded CSP phylogeny is presented, including all the Laverania species and other malarial parasites. Contrasting with other Plasmodium, the Laverania csp exhibits great conservation at the central tandem repeat region. Msp2 and var2CSA, however, show extended recent polymorphism in P. falciparum that likely originated after the P. reichenowi-P. falciparum split. The accumulation of such diversity may indicate adaptation to the human host. These examples support the notion that comparative approaches among P. falciparum and its related species will be of great value in understanding the evolution of proteins that are important in parasite invasion of the human red blood cell, as well as those involved in malaria pathogenesis. © 2013 Pacheco et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzee is the most intellectual species among the animal kingdom. One-year (2009-2010) study on Chimpanzee was conducted to access the impact of captivity on their social behavior at Lahore Zoo. The group consisted of two pairs; one adult and other sub-adult housed in two separate cages. The data was recorded by instantaneous point-sampling technique to determine the frequency, prevalence and duration of different behaviors including abnormal behaviors, activity level, social behaviors and visitors-oriented behaviors. The findings revealed that Chimpanzees of Lahore Zoo were suffering from low level to high-level abnormal behavior and they also displayed natural behavior patterns like their wild relatives. The observed abnormal behaviors such as clapping, urine drinking, fumble nipple, stereotypical grooming, pacing, hair plucking and spiting were more frequent in adult pair than sub-adult pair. However, social behaviors i.e., social grooming, play, and aggression were frequent in sub-adult pair. The prevalence of visitors-oriented behaviors like affiliative and aggressive behaviours was observed in all Chimps. It was observed that attempt to interact with visitors for food, hand hold and play convert the aggression to affiliative relation. It was concluded the lack of social set up, little chance to adapt associative patterns, small cages in contrast to wild habitat and scheduled diet were the major causes to alter the social behavior of Chimps at Lahore Zoo. It is recommended that these animals should be shifted to newly constructed Chimpanzee Island for their welfare and well-being.

ABSTRACT: Summary: This study reports the complete genome sequence of chimpanzee herpesvirus (ChHV), an alphaherpesvirus isolated from a chimpanzee. Although closely related to human herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV2), the level of sequence diversity confirms that ChHV is sufficiently distinct to be considered a member of a different virus species rather than a variant strain of HSV2. Phylogenetic comparison with other simplexviruses at several levels supports the hypothesis that HSV2 and ChHV co-evolved with their respective human and chimpanzee hosts and raises questions regarding the evolutionary origins of HSV1. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.

ABSTRACT: One of the major factors threatening chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) in Guinea-Bissau is habitat fragmentation. Such fragmentation may cause changes in symbiont dynamics resulting in increased susceptibility to infection, changes in host specificity and virulence. We monitored gastrointestinal symbiotic fauna of three chimpanzee subpopulations living within Cantanhez National Park (CNP) in Guinea Bissau in the areas with different levels of anthropogenic fragmentation. Using standard coproscopical methods (merthiolate-iodine formalin concentration and Sheather's flotation) we examined 102 fecal samples and identified at least 13 different symbiotic genera (Troglodytella abrassarti, Troglocorys cava, Blastocystis spp., Entamoeba spp., Iodamoeba butschlii, Giardia intestinalis, Chilomastix mesnili, Bertiella sp., Probstmayria gombensis, unidentified strongylids, Strongyloides stercoralis, Strongyloides fuelleborni, and Trichuris sp.). The symbiotic fauna of the CNP chimpanzees is comparable to that reported for other wild chimpanzee populations, although CNP chimpanzees have a higher prevalence of Trichuris sp. Symbiont richness was higher in chimpanzee subpopulations living in fragmented forests compared to the community inhabiting continuous forest area. We reported significantly higher prevalence of G. intestinalis in chimpanzees from fragmented areas, which could be attributed to increased contact with humans and livestock. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: We have conducted long-term research on sympatric gorillas and chimpanzees in Kahuzi-Biega National Park since 1987. The demographic history of habituated gorillas has provided insights into their reproductive strategies. Infanticide by male gorillas, which has occurred frequently in the Virunga mountain gorilla population, had not been reported in Kahuzi for more than 20 years. However, soon after the large-scale killing of gorillas during a war in the late 1990s, it occurred three times within a few months. The infanticidal male might have discriminated between infants who were not his offspring and an infant whom he presumably sired based on past interactions with their mothers. At Kahuzi, births occurred most frequently during the period of ripe fruit abundance, and female Grauer's gorillas show longer inter-birth interval than female mountain gorillas in the Virungas. A comparison of reproductive strategies among different gorilla populations suggests that seasonal fluctuation in food abundance may lead to slow reproduction, whereas the potential pressure of infanticide may promote rapid reproduction. The reduced ranges and increased encounters between unfamiliar groups induced by large human disturbance, such as wars or conversion of their habitat to farmland, might have produced conditions leading to infanticide. Long-term data on diet composition indicate extensive overlap in fruit foods between sympatric gorillas and chimpanzees. However, their ranging and fallback strategies differed. The gorillas tended to use a large area evenly, whereas the chimpanzees visited small areas repeatedly. When preferred fruits were scarce, gorillas increased consumption of vegetative foods including leaves, pith, and barks, and chimpanzees ate more leaves, pith, and animal foods. These differences are tied to differences in food processing and digestive abilities, positional behavior, and cognitive abilities that mitigate feeding competition between the two species. The growing human population and political instability caused by the recent war have increased pressures on wildlife in and around the park. Conflicts between the park authorities and unemployed local people could be an important additional factor that predisposes individuals to hunt gorillas. The role of local conservation NGOs has become increasingly important for mitigating such conflicts and reducing destructive activities. We should use our knowledge of gorillas and chimpanzees gained by long-term studies for creating appropriate conservation measures. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012. All rights are reserved.

ABSTRACT: Ticks in the nostrils of humans visiting equatorial African forests have been reported sporadically for decades, but their taxonomy and natural history have remained obscure. We report human infestation with a nostril tick in Kibale National Park, Uganda, coincident with infestation of chimpanzees in the same location with nostril ticks, as shown by high-resolution digital photography. The human-derived nostril tick was identified morphologically and genetically as a nymph of the genus Amblyomma, but the mitochondrial 12S ribosomal RNA or the nuclear intergenic transcribed spacer 2 DNA sequences of the specimen were not represented in GenBank. These ticks may represent a previously uncharacterized species that is adapted to infesting chimpanzee nostrils as a defense against grooming. Ticks that feed upon apes and humans may facilitate cross-species transmission of pathogens, and the risk of exposure is likely elevated for persons who frequent ape habitats.

ABSTRACT: An adult male chimpanzee living in a captive social group at the Primate Research Institute of Kyoto University developed acute tetraparesis. He was paralyzed and received intensive care and veterinary treatment as previously reported in Miyabe-Nishiwaki et al. (J Med Primatol 39:336-346, 2010). The behavioral recovery of the chimpanzee was longitudinally monitored using an index of upright posture between 0 and 41 months after the onset of tetraparesis. Four phases were identified during the course of behavioral recovery. During Phase 0 (0-13 months), the chimpanzee remained lying on his back during the absence of human caretakers. An increase in upright posture occurred in Phase I (14-17 months), then remained at a stable level of around 50-70 % in Phase II (18-29 months). During Phases I and II, the subject's small treatment cage represented a spatial limitation. Thus, behavioral recovery was mainly mediated by arm muscle strengthening caused by raising the body trunk with the aid of materials attached to the cage walls as environmental enrichment. When the chimpanzee was moved to a larger rehabilitation room in Phase III (30-41 months), the percentage of upright posture constantly exceeded 80 %, except in the 40th month when he injured his ankle and was inactive for several days. The enlargement of the living space had a positive effect on behavioral recovery by increasing the types of locomotion exhibited by the subject, including the use of legs during walking. Rehabilitation works were applied in face-to-face situations which enabled the use of rehabilitation methods used in humans. The process of behavioral recovery reported in this study provides a basic data set for planning future rehabilitation programs and for comparisons with further cases of physical disability in non-human primates. © 2013 Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: Cultural transmission, by definition, involves some form of social learning. Chimpanzees and other nonhuman primates clearly engage in some forms of social learning enabling some types of cultural transmission, but there is controversy about whether they copy the actual bodily actions of demonstrators. In this study chimpanzees recognized when a human actor was using particular bodily actions that had led to successful problem solving in the past. But then when it was their turn to solve the problem, they did not reproduce the human actor's bodily actions themselves, even though they were clearly capable of producing the movements. These results help us identify more precisely key reasons for the differences in the social learning and cultural transmission of humans and other primates. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: Despite ample focus on this endangered species, conservation planning for chimpanzees residing outside Africa has proven a challenge because of the lack of ancestry information. Here, we analysed the largest number of chimpanzee samples to date, examining microsatellites in >100 chimpanzees from the range of the species in Africa, and 20% of the European zoo population. We applied the knowledge about subspecies differentiation throughout equatorial Africa to assign origin to chimpanzees in the largest conservation management programme globally. A total of 63% of the genotyped chimpanzees from the European zoos could be assigned to one of the recognized subspecies. The majority being of West African origin (40%) will help consolidate the current breeding programme for this subspecies and the identification of individuals belonging to the two other subspecies so far found in European zoos can form the basis for breeding programmes for these. Individuals of various degree of mixed ancestry made up 37% of the genotyped European zoo population and thus highlight the need for appropriate management programmes guided by genetic analysis to preserve maximum genetic diversity and reduce hybridization among subspecies. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: A male chimpanzee was presented with a chronic swelling near the left cheek region. Various attempts to treat the chimpanzee went in vain. Vices of the animal, emotional attitude of his family members, and rules and regulations of the Central Zoo Authority made the treatment a challenging task. Meanwhile, the swelling turned into an open wound because of the female chimpanzee that further aggravated the situation. Proper behavioral study of the subject, positive reinforcement training, and accurate treatment protocol resulted in complete healing of the wound without any complications. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: We have analyzed the ranging patterns of the Mimikire group (M group) of chimpanzees in the Mahale Mountains National Park, Tanzania. During 16 years, the chimpanzees moved over a total area of 25. 2 or 27. 4 km2, as estimated by the grid-cell or minimum convex polygon (MCP) methods, respectively. Annually, the M group used an average of 18. 4 km2, or approximately 70 %, of the total home-range area. The chimpanzees had used 80 % of their total home range after 5 years and 95 % after 11 years. M group chimpanzees were observed more than half of the time in areas that composed only 15 % of their total home range. Thus, they typically moved over limited areas, visiting other parts of their range only occasionally. On average, the chimpanzees used 7. 6 km2 (in MCP) per month. Mean monthly range size was smallest at the end of the rainy season and largest at the end of the dry season, but there was much variability from year to year. The chimpanzees used many of the same areas every year when Sabacomorensis fruits were abundant between August and January. In contrast, the chimpanzees used several different areas of their range in June. Here range overlap between years was relatively small. Over the 16 years of the study we found that the M group reduced their use of the northern part of their range and increased their frequency of visits to the eastern mountainous side of their home range. Changes in home-range size correlated positively with the number of adult females but not with the number of adult males. This finding does not support a prediction of the male-defended territory model proposed for some East African chimpanzee unit-groups. © 2012 Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: Nonhuman animals quantify all manner of things, and the way in which this is done is fairly well understood. However, little research has been conducted to determine how they know what is or is not relevant in the instances in which they quantify stimuli. We assessed how four chimpanzees chose between two sets of food items when the items were distributed across separate spatial arrays. Each item was covered by a container, and then was revealed in sequence so that neither whole set was visible at one time. After all containers were revealed, some were revealed again. The chimpanzees should have ignored items that were seen a second time and instead enumerated each item only once. In another test, some of the items were transposed in location and then uncovered again. Here, the chimpanzees needed to recognize that the newly shown food items were ones they already had seen. Overall, the chimpanzees were successful in selecting the truly larger array of items despite these potential distracting re-presentations of items. Discrimination performance also reflected analogue magnitude estimation because comparisons of sets that differed by larger amounts were easier than comparisons that differed by smaller amounts. Thus, chimpanzee quantity judgments for nonvisible sets of items are inexact, but they include an aspect of control for determining when items are uniquely presented versus re-presented. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: In addition to behavioral evaluations, stress assessments are also important for measuring animal welfare. Assessments of long-term stress are particularly important given that prolonged stress can affect physical health and reproduction. The use of hair cortisol as a marker of long-term stress has been increasing, but there has not yet been any report on the use of such methods with chimpanzees. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to establish and validate a methodology for analyzing hair cortisol in captive chimpanzees. In the first experiment, hair was removed from the arms of nine chimpanzees living in the Kumamoto Sanctuary (KS) and the regrown hair was sampled 3. months later. Fecal samples were collected periodically during the hair-growth period. The results showed that hair cortisol level was positively correlated with the rate of receiving aggression. Although the correlation between hair and fecal cortisol levels was not significant, the individual with the highest hair cortisol concentration also had the highest fecal cortisol concentration. These results suggest that hair cortisol may reflect long-term stress in chimpanzees. In the second experiment, we investigated the physiological factors affecting hair cortisol concentrations. We cut hair from the arms, sides, and backs of 25 chimpanzees living at the KS and the Primate Research Institute. The results revealed that cortisol varied based on source body part and hair whiteness. Therefore, we recommend that hair should always be collected from the same body part and that white hair should be avoided as much as possible. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Wild animals increasingly inhabit human-influenced environments such as forest fragments amid agricultural systems. Dietary studies provide a means of assessing wildlife responses to anthropogenic habitat changes. Chimpanzees are specialist frugivores that consume other plant parts, e.g., fibrous pith and leaves, in greater amounts during fruit shortages. I examined the plant diet and seasonal foraging strategies of chimpanzees inhabiting small forest fragments within a cultivated landscape in Uganda. I determined diet over 13 mo via systematic fecal analysis, supplemented by direct observation and feeding trace evidence. I identified important foods and examined their role as seasonal fallbacks. Diet composition and breadth were overall species typical. Chimpanzees were highly frugivorous and the fruit component of fecal samples exceeded that of nonfruit fiber in all months. Forest fruit availability fluctuated seasonally, including a 3-mo low fruiting season, when overall fruit intake declined. During this time chimpanzees pursued a mixed strategy of increasing fiber consumption and feeding more heavily on energy-rich cultivars, including those obtained through crop raiding. The data suggest that exploiting agricultural fruits helped chimpanzees maintain a fruit-dominated diet when forest fruit was scarce. No evidence suggested this disturbed forest-farm mosaic is a food-impoverished habitat for chimpanzees overall. Nevertheless, cultivar feeding creates conflict with people and the high nutritional quality of crops is likely offset by the inherent risk associated with obtaining them. This study adds to growing evidence of ecological and behavioral adaptability of Pan troglodytes in response to anthropogenic habitat alteration. Targeted conservation of key natural foods for wildlife -particularly fallbacks- would help reduce conflicts and improve the survival prospects of threatened species sharing environments with people. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: There is currently great interest in the phylogenetic origins of altruistic behaviour within the primate order. Considerable attention has been focused on chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, because they are our closest living relatives and participate in a wide range of collective activities, including hunting and food sharing. Food sharing is of particular importance because it plays a critical role in the human foraging niche, but food sharing among adults is rare in nonhuman primates. Some research suggests that chimpanzees selectively share meat with reciprocating partners and allies, while other work indicates that chimpanzees primarily share to reduce harassment from other group members (tolerated theft). We examined the effects of kinship, relationship quality, reciprocity and the intensity of solicitations on the pattern of food transfers in six captive groups of chimpanzees. We observed events that occurred after the chimpanzees were provisioned with large frozen juice disks. These disks share some properties with prey carcasses: they are a valued, but limited, resource; they take a considerable period of time to consume; they can be monopolized by one individual, but bits can be broken off and transferred to others. Our analyses suggest that food transfers serve multiple functions for chimpanzees. Individuals may use food transfers to enhance the welfare of closely related group members, strengthen social relationships with favoured partners and reduce the costs of persistent solicitations. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: The intense arousal and excitement shown by adult male chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, during territorial attacks on other chimpanzees and predation upon monkeys suggest that similar psychological mechanisms may be involved. Specifically, it has been proposed that hunting behaviour in chimpanzees evolved from intraspecies aggression. Over 32 years, chimpanzees at Gombe National Park, Tanzania were significantly more likely to engage in a territorial border patrol on days when they hunted red colobus monkeys (. Procolobus spp.), and vice versa, even after statistically controlling for male chimpanzee party size. We test the hypothesis that this correlation arises because hunting and patrolling are components of a species-level aggressive behavioural syndrome; specifically that predation arose as a by-product of territorial aggression in this species. However, hunting was equally likely to occur after a patrol and/or an intergroup interaction as it was before, and the occurrence of an intergroup interaction in which the chimpanzees approached strangers did not increase subsequent hunting probability. We also reject the hypothesis that hunting and patrolling reflect an individual-level behavioural syndrome. We identified two 'impact hunters' whose presence increased hunting probability. Similarly, there were also three 'impact patrollers', who increased the likelihood that a visit to the periphery of the community range resulted in a patrol. While this discovery has important implications for our understanding of the proximate causes of cooperation, it does not explain the temporal correlation between patrolling and hunting, since no males had such an impact in both contexts. Instead, the data suggest that the correlation arose because patrols typically involved males travelling long distances, which increased the probability of encountering prey. Additionally, parties that travelled to the periphery were more likely to encounter colobus in woodland, where hunts are more likely to occur and to succeed. Therefore, we conclude that ecological, rather than psychological, factors promote the co-occurrence of hunting and territorial aggression in this species. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: Some chimpanzee populations prey upon army ants, usually with stick tools. However, how their prey's subterranean nesting and nomadic lifestyle influence the apes' harvesting success is still poorly understood. This is particularly true for chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes ellioti) at Gashaka/Nigeria, which consume army ants (Dorylus rubellus) with much higher frequency than at other sites. We assessed various harvesting and search options theoretically available to the apes. For this, we reconstructed annual consumption patterns from feces and compared the physical characteristics of exploited ant nests with those that were not targeted. Repeated exploitation of a discovered nest is viable only in the short term, as disturbed colonies soon moved to a new site. Moreover, monitoring previously occupied nest cavities is uneconomical, as ants hardly ever re-used them. Thus, the apes have to detect new nests regularly, although colony density is relatively low (1 colony/1.3ha). Surprisingly, visual search cues seem to be of limited importance because the probability of a nest being exploited was independent of its conspicuousness (presence of excavated soil piles, concealing leaf-litter or vegetation). However, chimpanzees preferentially targeted nests in forests or at the base of food trees, that is, where the apes spend relatively more time and/or where ant colony density is highest. Taken together, our findings suggest that, instead of employing a search strategy based on visual cues or spatial memory, chimpanzee predation on army ants contains a considerable opportunistic element. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: All of the great apes build nests, but captive chimpanzees rarely have vegetation from which to build nests. The forested environment at Chimp Haven does allow captive chimpanzees to build nests of natural vegetation. Between February 2007 and December 2010, 238 nests were found in 2 forested habitats. Nests were made of naturally available vegetation, and more nests were made on the ground than in the trees (Z = 7.27, p < 0.001); nests were also built in the interior forest rather than on the periphery (Z = 7.06, p < 0.001). There was no correlation between the number of months in the habitat and the nests built per chimpanzee (rs = -0.07, p = 0.52). More nests were observed when more wild-born females were in the group (rs = 0.27, p = 0.01), and during warmer temperatures (rs = 0.45, p < 0.001). These findings support the goal of naturalistic environments in suitable climates for captive chimpanzees. © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.

ABSTRACT: The muscular and skeletal morphology of the chimpanzee ankle and foot differs from that of humans in many important respects. However, little information is available on the moment arms and architecture of the muscles that function around chimpanzee ankle and foot joints. The main goals of this study were to determine the influence of changes in leg and foot position on the moment arms of these muscle-tendon units (MTUs), and provide new measurements of their architecture. Three-dimensional moment arm data were collected from two adult, cadaveric Pan troglodytes specimens for 11 MTUs that cross the ankle and foot joints. Tendon-excursion measurements were made throughout the full range of plantarflexion-dorsiflexion (PF-DF) and eversion-inversion (EV-IN), including repeated measurements for mm. gastrocnemius at 0°, 45°, 90° and 135° of knee flexion. The total range of motion was calculated from three-dimensional joint motion data while ensuring that foot movement was restricted to a single plane. Measurements of muscle mass, fascicle length, pennation angle and physiological cross-sectional area were then collected for each MTU. Our results demonstrate that joint position has a significant effect on moment arm lengths, and that in some cases this effect is counterintuitive. These new data contribute to filling a significant gap in previously published chimpanzee moment arm data, providing a comprehensive characterization of the MTUs that move the chimpanzee ankle and foot joints. They also provide empirical support to the notion that chimpanzees have larger ranges of motion at these joints than humans. Comparison of osteometric estimates of moment arm lengths to direct tendon-excursion measures provides some guidance for the use of skeletal features in estimations of PF-DF moment arms. Finally, muscle architecture data are consistent with the findings of previous studies, and increase the sample size of the chimpanzee data that are currently available. © 2013 Anatomical Society.

ABSTRACT: Reliable evidence was obtained of the simultaneous performance of social grooming and social play behaviors by individuals among wild chimpanzees of the M group in Mahale Mountains National Park. I observed three cases of this performance: in an old female, a young female, and an adult male. While the agent was grooming the back of an adult bimanually, an infant or a juvenile approached the agent. The agent then started playing with the infant/juvenile using only the right hand, while simultaneously grooming the back of the adult with the left hand. In one case, an old female continued the simultaneous performance for about 1 min. Such performances probably occur at low frequency because they are not often required. The similarity in the neurobiological bases and the functions of social grooming and social play behaviors, both of which include repetitive contact with the body of another individual, may facilitate their simultaneous performance. © 2013 Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: In captive animal facilities, human staff members are a relevant part of the animals' social environment in addition to providing care and managing the social group. Structured, predictable interactions and relaxed, spontaneous contacts may all affect the animals' behavior and well-being, both immediately and in the long term. This study examined the association between unstructured, affiliative caretaker-animal interactions and the behavior of zoo-housed chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and Western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla). The interactions in question included play, spontaneous feeding, and other positive vocal and visual interactions performed through a protective mesh barrier. Behavioral data collected over 48 months were used to identify correlates of caretaker interactions among key behaviors relevant to welfare assessment, including agonism, sexual behavior, abnormal behavior, prosocial behavior, and self-directed behavior, as well as the presence of wounds. In observational sessions containing one or more caretaker interactions, chimpanzees and gorillas both showed higher agonism (P=0.044 and P=0.042, respectively) and lower self-directed behavior (P=0.035 for chimpanzees and P=0.001 for gorillas) than in control samples. Agonism rose in chimpanzees from an average of 0.01-0.12% of overall behaviors, and in gorillas from 0% to 0.1%, while self-directed behavior decreased in chimpanzees from an average of 9.54-7.81% and in gorillas from 11.02% to 7.38%. Chimpanzees also showed lower intraspecific prosocial behavior in samples with caretaker interactions (P=0.044), decreasing from an average of 11.5% to 5.52% of overall behaviors. Finally, gorillas exhibited less abnormal behavior in caretaker interaction samples than in control samples (P=0.029), decreasing from a mean of 2.42-1.77% of overall behaviors. In chimpanzees, higher agonism and lower prosocial behavior are indicative of greater arousal, although we would expect self-directed behavior to rise rather than decrease in that situation. The results in gorillas are mixed with respect to welfare outcomes: higher agonism is indicative of arousal, but lower abnormal and self-directed behaviors suggest a decrease in stress and anxiety. These findings underscore the importance of understanding the influence of all forms of interaction with heterospecifics and demonstrate a need for welfare assessments that include even positively intended interactions. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Determining the memory systems that support nonhuman animals' capacity to remember distant past events is currently the focus an intense research effort and a lively debate [1-3]. Comparative psychology has largely adopted Tulving's framework by focusing on whether animals remember what-where-when something happened (i.e., episodic-like memory) [4-6]. However, apes have also been reported to recall other episodic components [7] after single-trial exposures [8, 9]. Using a new experimental paradigm we show that chimpanzees and orangutans recalled a tool-finding event that happened four times 3 years earlier (experiment 1) and a tool-finding unique event that happened once 2 weeks earlier (experiment 2). Subjects were able to distinguish these events from other tool-finding events, which indicates binding of relevant temporal-spatial components. Like in human involuntary autobiographical memory, a cued, associative retrieval process triggered apes' memories: when presented with a particular setup, subjects instantaneously remembered not only where to search for the tools (experiment 1), but also the location of the tool seen only once (experiment 2). The complex nature of the events retrieved, the unexpected and fast retrieval, the long retention intervals involved, and the detection of binding strongly suggest that chimpanzees and orangutans' memories for past events mirror some of the features of human autobiographical memory. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Humans can behave fairly, but can other species? Recently we tested chimpanzees on aclassic human test for fairness, the Ultimatum Game, and found that they behaved similarly to humans. In humans, Ultimatum Game behavior is cited as evidence for a human sense offairness. By that same logic, we concluded that chimpanzees behaved fairly in our recent study. However, we make a distinction between behavior and motivation. Both humans and chimpanzees behaved fairly, but determining why they did so is more challenging. © 2013 Landes Bioscience.

ABSTRACT: Musculoskeletal models have become important tools for studying a range of muscle-driven movements. However, most work has been in modern humans, with few applications in other species. Chimpanzees are facultative bipeds and our closest living relatives, and have provided numerous important insights into our own evolution. A chimpanzee musculoskeletal model would allow integration across a wide range of laboratory-based experimental data, providing new insights into the determinants of their locomotor performance capabilities, as well as the origins and evolution of human bipedalism. Here, we described a detailed three-dimensional (3D) musculoskeletal model of the chimpanzee pelvis and hind limb. The model includes geometric representations of bones and joints, as well as 35 muscle-tendon units that were represented using 44 Hill-type muscle models. Muscle architecture data, such as muscle masses, fascicle lengths and pennation angles, were drawn from literature sources. The model permits calculation of 3D muscle moment arms, muscle-tendon lengths and isometric muscle forces over a wide range of joint positions. Muscle-tendon moment arms predicted by the model were generally in good agreement with tendon-excursion estimates from cadaveric specimens. Sensitivity analyses provided information on the parameters that model predictions are most and least sensitive to, which offers important context for interpreting future results obtained with the model. Comparisons with a similar human musculoskeletal model indicate that chimpanzees are better suited for force production over a larger range of joint positions than humans. This study represents an important step in understanding the integrated function of the neuromusculoskeletal systems in chimpanzee locomotion. © 2013 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Human adenovirus (AdHu)-based candidate AIDS vaccine can provide protection from simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) transmission and disease progression. However, their potential use may be limited by widespread preexisting immunity to the vector. In contrast, preexisting immunity to chimpanzee adenoviruses (AdC) is relatively rare. In this study, we utilized two regimens of prime-boost immunizations with AdC serotype SAd-V23 (also called AdC6) and SAd-V24 (also called AdC7) expressing SIV Gag/Tat to test their immunogenicity and ability to protect rhesus macaques (RMs) from a repeated low-dose SIVmac239 challenge. Both AdC6 followed by AdC7 (AdC6/7) and AdC7 followed by AdC6 (AdC7/6) induced robust SIV Gag/Tat-specific T cell responses as measured by tetramer staining and functional assays. However, no significant protection from SIV transmission was observed in either AdC7/6- or AdC7/6-vaccinated RMs. Interestingly, in the RMs showing breakthrough infections, AdC7/6- SIV immunization was associated with a transient but significant (P = 0.035 atday 90 and P = 0.033 at day 120 postinfection) reduction in the setpoint viral load compared to unvaccinated controls. None of the measured immunological markers (i.e., number orfunctionality of SIV-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses and level of activated and/or CCR5+ CD4+ target cells) at the time of challenge correlated with protection from SIV transmission in the AdC-SIV-vaccinated RMs. The robust immunogenicity observed in all AdC-immunized RMs and the transient signal of protection from SIV replication exhibited by AdC7/6- vaccinated RMs even in the absence of any envelope immunogen suggest that AdC-based vectors may represent a promising platform for candidate AIDS vaccines. © 2013, American Society for Microbiology.

ABSTRACT: Acupuncture is an ancient practice that is currently used to treat disorders ranging from osteoarthritis to cardiomyopathy. Acupuncture involves the insertion of thin, sterile needles into defined acupuncture points that stimulate physiologic processes through neural signaling. Numerous scientific studies have proven the benefits of acupuncture, and given this scientific support, we hypothesized that acupuncture could benefit the nonhuman primates at our facility. As our chimpanzee colony ages, we are observing an increase in osteoarthritis and have focused our initial acupuncture treatments on this condition. We successfully trained 3 chimpanzees, by using positive- reinforcement training techniques, to voluntarily participate in acupuncture treatments for stifle osteoarthritis. We used 3 acupuncture points that correlate with alleviation of stifle pain and inflammation in humans. A mobility scoring system was used to assess improvements in mobility as a function of the acupuncture treatments. The 2 chimpanzees with the most severe osteoarthritis showed significant improvement in mobility after acupuncture treatments. Acupuncture therapy not only resulted in improved mobility, but the training sessions also served as enrichment for the animals, as demonstrated by their voluntary participation in the training and treatment sessions. Acupuncture is an innovative treatment technique that our data show to be safe, inexpensive, and, most importantly, effective for chimpanzees.

ABSTRACT: Humans are believed to have evolved a unique motivation to participate in joint activities that first develops during infancy and supports the development of shared intentionality. We conducted five experiments with bonobos (Pan paniscus) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) (Total n 119) to assess their motivation to spontaneously participate in joint activities with a conspecific or a human. We found that even the youngest subjects preferred to interact together with a human and a toy rather than engaging in an identical game alone. In addition, we found that subjects could spontaneously interact with a human in a turn-taking game involving passing a ball back and forth and used behaviors to elicit additional interaction when the game was disrupted. However, when paired with a conspecific, subjects preferred to interact with an object individually rather than together. Our results indicate that nonhuman apes are motivated to engage in triadic activities if they occur spontaneously with humans and require a minimum amount of coordination. These findings leave open the question of whether these activities are coordinated through shared intentions. © 2013 American Psychological Association.

ABSTRACT: Researchers have described apparently self-medicative behaviors for a variety of nonhuman species including birds and primates. Wild chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas have been observed to swallow rough leaves without chewing, a behavior proposed to be self-medicative and to aid control of intestinal parasites. Researchers have hypothesized that the presence of hairs on the leaf surface elicits the behavior. We investigated the acquisition and the underlying mechanisms of leaf swallowing. We provided 42 captive great apes (24 chimpanzees, six bonobos, six gorillas, and six orangutans) with both rough-surfaced and hairless plants. None of the subjects had previously been observed to engage in leaf swallowing behavior and were therefore assumed naïve. Two chimpanzees and one bonobo swallowed rough-surfaced leaves spontaneously without chewing them. In a social setup six more chimpanzees acquired the behavior. None of the gorillas or orangutans showed leaf swallowing. Because this behavior occurred in naïve individuals, we conclude that it is part of the behavioral repertoire of chimpanzees and bonobos. Social learning is thus not strictly required for the acquisition of leaf swallowing, but it may still facilitate its expression. The fact that apes always chewed leaves of hairless control plants before swallowing, i.e., normal feeding behavior, indicates that the surface structure of leaves is indeed a determinant for initiating leaf swallowing in apes where it occurs. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: Exploration and problem-solving are highly motivated behaviors in non-human primates, but little research has focused on whether cognitively challenging tasks can enhance primates' psychological well-being, particularly in the absence of food rewards. We evaluated whether a novel cognitive challenge device (CCD) consisting of a maze of opaque tubes enhanced the well-being of a group of six adult chimpanzees housed at ZSL Whipsnade Zoo, UK, over a two-month period. Chimpanzees had the opportunity to interact with two versions of the CCD: the first contained tokens which fell into a transparent chamber when extracted from the CCD and could not be eaten. The second contained unshelled Brazil nuts, which could be extracted and eaten. CCD-use was low over the study, occupying on average 2.5% of observation time. However, compared to baseline levels, chimpanzees exhibited more problem-solving behaviors (directed toward the CCD) and spent significantly more time engaged in social play when the CCD was present. Cage exploration was rare whether the CCD was present or not. Chimpanzees used the CCD (including tool-use) significantly more when it contained tokens. The relationship between the presence of the CCD and self-directed behavior (rough-scratching) was difficult to interpret. Although rough-scratching was significantly higher in the cage when the CCD was present and 18% of these scratching events occurred within one arm's length from the CCD, rough-scratching decreased when device use increased. This study provides a preliminary investigation of the CCD and two reward types, and suggests how the design could be modified to enhance its effects. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Most humans are right-handed and, like many behavioral traits, there is good evidence that genetic factors play a role in handedness. Many researchers have argued that non-human animal limb or hand preferences are not under genetic control but instead are determined by random, non-genetic factors. We used quantitative genetic analyses to estimate the genetic and environmental contributions to three measures of chimpanzee handedness. Results revealed significant population-level handedness for two of the three measures-the tube task and manual gestures. Furthermore, significant additive genetic effects for the direction and strength of handedness were found for all three measures, with some modulation due to early social rearing experiences. These findings challenge historical and contemporary views of the mechanisms underlying handedness in non-human animals. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and International Behavioural and Neural Genetics Society.

ABSTRACT: A large array of communication signals supports the fission/fusion social organization in chimpanzees, and among them the acoustic channel plays a large part because of their forest habitat. Adult vocalizations convey social and ecological information to their recipients allowing them to obtain cues about an ongoing event from calls only. In contrast to adult vocalizations, information encoded in infant calls had been hardly investigated. Studies mainly focused on vocal development. The present article aims at assessing the acoustic cues that support individual identity coding in infant chimpanzees. By analyzing recordings performed in the wild from seven 3-year-old infant chimpanzees, we showed that their calls support a well-defined individual vocal signature relying on spectral cues. To assess the reliability of the signature across the calls of an individual, we defined two subsets of recordings on the basis of the characteristics of the frequency modulation (whimpers and screams) and showed that both call types present a reliable vocal signature. Early vocal signature may allow the mother and other individuals in the group to identify the infant caller when visual contact is broken. Chimpanzee mothers may have developed abilities to cope with changing vocal signatures while their infant, still vulnerable, gains in independence in close habitat. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Explaining cooperative behaviour is a fundamental issue for evolutionary biology. The challenge for any cooperative strategy is to minimize the risks of nonreciprocation (cheating) in interactions with immediate costs and delayed benefits. One of a variety of proposed strategies, the raise-the-stakes (RTS) strategy, posits that individuals establish cooperation by increasing investment across interactions from an initial interaction. This model has received little quantitative support, however, probably because individuals of many social species engage in repeated interactions from a young age. In some situations, however, such as following conflicts, after prolonged absences or during social instability, established relationships may become unreliable predictors of future behaviour, creating an environment for RTS. We investigated grooming interactions among wild male chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, testing RTS in these specific contexts. We found evidence to support the view that male chimpanzees employed RTS during social instability, but not under the other conditions. However, we also found that the duration of episodes (discrete parcels) of grooming was negatively related to aggression risk and in consequence suggest that the patterning of grooming interactions indicative of RTS was less to do with preventing cheating, and more to do with avoiding the elevated risks of intramale aggression during the period of social instability. We interpret the apparent support for RTS in our data as a by-product of the way chimpanzees cope with fluctuating (here, elevated then diminishing) risks of aggression. We suggest that social instability raises the stakes for grooming by creating a more hazardous marketplace in which to trade. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: A 40-yr-old male captive chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) presented with depression and anorexia for 7 days. The tentative diagnosis, following a physical examination under anesthesia, was pneumonia with sepsis. Despite antibiotic treatment and supportive care the chimpanzee died a week following presentation. Gross pathology confirmed severe purulent pneumonia and diffuse hepatosplenic abscesses. Detected in serum at the time of the initial examination, the melioidosis serum antibody titer was elevated (>1:512). Soil samples were collected from three sites in the exhibit at three depths of 5, 15, and 30 cm. By direct and enrichment culture, positive cultures for Burkholderia pseudomallei were found at 5 and 15 cm in one site. The other two sites were positive by enrichment culture at the depth of 5 cm. To prevent disease in the remaining seven troop members, they were relocated to permit a soil treatment with calcium oxide. The exhibit remained empty for approximately 1 yr before the chimpanzees were returned. During that period, the soil in the exhibit area was again cultured as before and all samples were negative for B. pseudomallei. Following the soil treatment in the exhibit, all chimpanzees have remained free of clinical signs consistent with melioidosis. © 2013 American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Many animal species cooperate, but the underlying proximate mechanisms are often unclear. We presented chimpanzees with a mutualistic collaborative food-retrieval task requiring complementary roles, and tested subjects' ability to help their partner perform her role. For each role, subjects required a different tool, and the tools were not interchangeable. We gave one individual in each dyad both tools, and measured subjects' willingness to transfer a tool to their partner as well as which tool (correct versus incorrect) they transferred. Most subjects helped their partner and transferred the tool the partner needed. Thus, chimpanzees not only coordinate different roles, but they also know which particular action the partner needs to perform. These results add to previous findings suggesting that many of chimpanzees' limitations in collaboration are, perhaps, more motivational than cognitive. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Within the limits imposed by a number of developmental and rheological factors, endostructural arrangement of the appendicular skeleton is consistent with the functional patterns of stress, where cortical bone topographic thickness variation in long bones primarily reflects the nature, direction, intensity, and frequency of the locomotion-related biomechanical loads. By applying techniques of cross-sectional geometric analysis and 3D morphometric mapping to a (micro)tomographic record consisting of 12 modern human and 10 chimpanzee adult femora, we have shown two distinct patterns (functional "signatures") of cortical bone arrangement along the shaft (20-80% portion of the biomechanical length) specifically associated to the bipedal (Homo) and the quadrupedal modes (Pan). In particular, the inner structure of the human femoral diaphysis is adapted to antero-posterior loadings and presents a greater rigidity against posterior bending, while that of Pan is characterized by the presence of strong medial and lateral bony reinforcements positioned above its femoral midshaft. © 2013 Académie des sciences.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees in the Mahale Mountains of Tanzania consume several species of stem- and branch-inhabiting ants throughout the year, without tools. Those ants are cryptic species, and it was unknown how to find them constantly. There has been little research on how the chimpanzees locate these ants. In this study, I use behavioral observations of the chimpanzee predators and surveys of the ant fauna and plants across different habitats to test the hypothesis that chimpanzees use plant species as a cue to efficiently locate ant colonies in litter units (dead parts of the plant). Ants were found to be associated with live plants and with spaces within litter units which provide nesting places. Such ant-plant litter relationships were not necessarily as strong as the mutualism often observed between live plants and ants. The proportion of available litter units inhabited by ants was 20 %, and litter units of three plant species (Vernonia subligera, Dracaena usambarensis, and Senna spectabilis) were well occupied by ants in the home range of the chimpanzees. The ant-inhabited ratio in chimpanzee-foraged litter units was higher than that in the available units in the home range. Chimpanzees fed more often on Crematogaster spp. than on other resident ants and at a higher rate than expected from their occurrence in the litter units. Above three plant species were well occupied by Crematogaster sp. 3 or C. sp. 18. It is concluded that chimpanzees locate ants by selecting litter units of plant species inhabited by ants. © 2013 Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: Data on chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) nesting patterns were collected in Issa, Ugalla, western Tanzania. Ugalla is one of the driest, most open, and seasonal habitats inhabited by chimpanzees. We investigated the physical characteristics of nests and trees used for nesting to understand environmental influences on nest building and identify the characteristics preferred by the chimpanzees and the basis for such preferences. We analyzed 2,167 nests and 1,523 nesting trees. Most nests were built in the middle section of the tree crown and close to the tree trunk, and used a single tree in construction. Some physical characteristics of nests (e.g., distance from tree trunk) seemed to be the result of constraints imposed by tree structure. Issa chimpanzees preferred tall trees with high first branches for nesting supporting the hypothesis that elevated height of a sleeping place is a predator defense strategy. The height from the ground to the first branch showed less variation than either tree height or crown height and correlated weakly with tree height, suggesting that height from the ground to the first branch may be a more important factor than tree height alone in selecting a tree in which to nest. As in other study sites, the chimpanzees used tree species in proportions that did not correspond to their abundance suggesting tree species preference. We report for the first time that chimpanzees directionally oriented their nests and propose that this may be to maximize sunlight. We compare our data to those of other chimpanzee study sites. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Some chimpanzee populations exhibit ground night nesting, which occurs in different habitat types, is driven by a variety of interconnected factors, and may reflect cultural or social differences. This has important implications for ape conservation management, given that accurate nest builder identification is required to estimate density, crucial in monitoring, and allows inferences about environmental and social factors that may have contributed to the transition from tree to ground sleeping in early hominins. We conducted a 24-month marked nest count survey in La Belgique, Cameroon, and recorded the occurrence of chimpanzee tree and ground night nests, temperature and rainfall, predator and large mammal abundance, human activities, nesting tree species, and Uapaca spp. consumption. Ground night nesting occurred at a rate of 3.47% (n = 1,008), with more in swamps, in the dry season and with increasing human activities. We found no influence of leopard/elephant presence, but a possible influence of lack of nesting trees. We suggest chimpanzees visit swamps in the dry season (low water levels) for relief from hunting pressure and to consume Uapaca spp. fruits. Ground nesting may be enabled due to high abundance of terrestrial herbaceous vegetation, and may be favoured for inconspicuousness and safety from gun hunters. © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.

ABSTRACT: We evaluated the use of an RNA stabilisation buffer, RNA. later® (Ambion, Austin, Texas), as a preservation medium for parasitic coprology analysis of faecal samples collected from chimpanzees living in the wild (Pan troglodytes troglodytes). Thirty faecal samples collected in the forests of south-east Cameroon (Mambele area) from 2003 to 2011 were preserved in RNA. later® at -80. °C and analysed for their parasite content. We identified and counted parasitic elements and assessed their shape, size and morphology in relation to the storage time of the samples. We found that parasite elements were identifiable in RNA. later® preserved samples after as many as 7. years, showing that RNA. later® could be an effective and reliable preservation medium for coprology. Thus, its use could be an interesting way to optimise sample collection for several types of studies (parasitology and bacteriology/virology) at once, especially considering the logistically challenging and time-consuming field campaigns needed to obtain these faecal samples. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Wild chimpanzee populations are still declining due to logging, disease transmission and hunting. The bushmeat trade frequently leads to an increase in the number of orphaned primates. HELP Congo was the first project to successfully release wild-born orphan chimpanzees into an existing chimpanzee habitat. A collection of post monitoring data over 16 years now offers the unique opportunity to investigate possible behavioural adaptations in these chimpanzees. We investigated the feeding and activity patterns in eight individuals via focal observation techniques from 1997-1999 and 2001-2005. Our results revealed a decline in the number of fruit and insect species in the diet of released chimpanzees over the years, whereas within the same period of time, the number of consumed seed species increased. Furthermore, we found a decline in time spent travelling, but an increase in time spent on social activities, such as grooming, as individuals matured. In conclusion, the observed changes in feeding and activity patterns seem to reflect important long-term behavioural and ecological adaptations in wild-born orphan released chimpanzees, demonstrating that the release of chimpanzees can be successful, even if it takes time for full adaptation. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: Induction of antigen-specific CD8 + T cells offers the prospect of immunization against many infectious diseases, but no subunit vaccine has induced CD8 + T cells that correlate with efficacy in humans. Here we demonstrate that a replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus vector followed by a modified vaccinia virus Ankara booster induces exceptionally high frequency T-cell responses (median >2400 SFC/10 6 peripheral blood mononuclear cells) to the liver-stage Plasmodium falciparum malaria antigen ME-TRAP. It induces sterile protective efficacy against heterologous strain sporozoites in three vaccinees (3/14, 21%), and delays time to patency through substantial reduction of liver-stage parasite burden in five more (5/14, 36%), P=0.008 compared with controls. The frequency of monofunctional interferon-γ-producing CD8 + T cells, but not antibodies, correlates with sterile protection and delay in time to patency (P corrected =0.005). Vaccine-induced CD8 + T cells provide protection against human malaria, suggesting that a major limitation of previous vaccination approaches has been the insufficient magnitude of induced T cells. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

ABSTRACT: The overall structure and temporally changing configuration of members of social play among the wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) of Mahale Mountains National Park, Tanzania, were described on both the microscopic 'clique' levels, conceptualized as directly connected configurations through social play behavior, and macroscopic 'cluster' levels, conceptualized as indirectly connected gatherings of members of adjacent multiple cliques at the same time and space. Most playing clusters started as dyads. Although the cumulative number of participants increased, each clique size remained at 2 for most of the observational units. Dyadic cliques were more stable and lasted longer than larger cliques. Of all clusters' playing fields, 64.7 % had maximum diameters of 3 m. In summary, chimpanzees played stably in dyadic pairs in most of the time. As time passed, other chimpanzees often joined in the playing groups to form large polyadic clusters. Even when all chimpanzees in a cluster played socially at the same time, they normally did so in separate dyadic pairs, forming multiple dyadic cliques simultaneously in a small space. These social play dynamics may be explained assuming a hypothesis based on a balance model among socially playing chimpanzees, as the balanced cliques are limited only to those in which all the existing pairs form the mutual dyads, and they tend to avoid unbalanced and maintain balanced relationships during social play. As a result, larger cliques were difficult to maintain for long periods and tended to transition into dyadic mutual cliques. Thus, Heider's balance theory can be one of the possible theories to explain not only human social phenomena, but also the proximate mechanism of the structure and the temporal change of social play among wild chimpanzees. Although both mutual and transitive relationships are known to be balanced in various human networks, only mutual relationships among socially playing chimpanzees were balanced. © 2013 Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: Changes in gene expression have been proposed to have an important role in the evolutionary changes in phenotypes. Interspecific changes in gene expression can result not only from genetic changes in regulatory regions but also from epigenetic changes in such regions. Here we report the identification of genomic regions showing differences in DNA methylation between humans and chimpanzees (termed S-DMRs for species-specific differentially methylated regions) on chromosomes 21 and 22. These regional methylation differences are frequently associated with genes, including those relevant to a disease, such as Alzheimer's disease, diabetes mellitus or cancer. Methylation differences are often correlated with changes in promoter activity or alternative splicing. Comparative studies including other great ape species provide evidence for the contribution of genetic changes to some of these S-DMRs. Genetic changes responsible for the S-DMRs include gain or loss of CTCF-binding site and changes in CpG density in microsatellite repeats. Our results suggest that DNA methylation changes, often caused by small sequence changes, contribute to transcriptional and phenotypic diversification in hominid evolution. © 2013 The Japan Society of Human Genetics All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Heterogeneity in host association patterns can alter pathogen transmission and strategies for control. Great apes are highly social and endangered animals that have experienced substantial population declines from directly transmitted pathogens; as such, network approaches to quantify contact heterogeneity could be crucially important for predicting infection probability and outbreak size following pathogen introduction, especially owing to challenges in collecting real-time infection data for endangered wildlife. We present here the first study using network analysis to quantify contact heterogeneity in wild apes, with applications for predicting community-wide infectious disease risk. Specifically, within a wild chimpanzee community, we ask how associations between individuals vary over time, and we identify traits of highly connected individuals that might contribute disproportionately to pathogen spread. We used field observations of behavioural encounters in a habituated wild chimpanzee community in Kibale National Park, Uganda to construct monthly party level (i.e. subgroup) and close-contact (i.e. ≤5 m) association networks over a 9-month period. Network analysis revealed that networks were highly dynamic over time. In particular, oestrous events significantly increased pairwise party associations, suggesting that community-wide disease outbreaks should be more likely to occur when many females are in oestrus. Bayesian models and permutation tests identified traits of chimpanzees that were highly connected within the network. Individuals with large families (i.e. mothers and their juveniles) that range in the core of the community territory and to a lesser extent high-ranking males were central to association networks, and thus represent the most important individuals to target for disease intervention strategies. Overall, we show striking temporal variation in network structure and traits that predict association patterns in a wild chimpanzee community. These empirically-derived networks can inform dynamic models of pathogen transmission and have practical applications for infectious disease management of endangered wildlife species. © 2013 British Ecological Society.

ABSTRACT: There is considerable interest in comparative research on different species' abilities to respond to human communicative cues such as gaze and pointing. It has been reported that some canines perform significantly better than monkeys and apes on tasks requiring the comprehension of either declarative or imperative pointing and these differences have been attributed to domestication in dogs. Here we tested a sample of chimpanzees on a task requiring comprehension of an imperative request and show that, though there are considerable individual differences, the performance by the apes rival those reported in pet dogs. We suggest that small differences in methodology can have a pronounced influence on performance on these types of tasks. We further suggest that basic differences in subject sampling, subject recruitment and rearing experiences have resulted in a skewed representation of canine abilities compared to those of monkeys and apes. © 2013 Hopkins et al.

ABSTRACT: If primates were capable of vocalizing to inform a receiver about an external entity, it would represent an important element of continuity with human language. We tested experimentally whether chimpanzee rough grunts, which function to refer to food, are produced selectively, indicating voluntary control, and whether they are directed at specific individuals. These are prerequisites for a system capable of actively informing others about external events. We conducted a field playback experiment in which we presented silently feeding male chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, with arrival pant hoots of a familiar group member. We found that subjects were significantly more likely to respond with food calls to the simulated arrival of an individual with whom the caller had a high rather than low level of friendship and where there was a large rather than small positive dominance rank difference between the individuals (i.e. caller was lower ranking). We concluded that chimpanzee food calls are not simply reflexive responses to food, but can be selectively directed at socially important individuals. Our findings are thus inconsistent with traditional views of primate vocalizations as inflexibly and indiscriminately produced. Instead, our results indicate that great apes can produce semantically meaningful calls in a highly selective, recipient-directed manner. Further research is needed to test whether chimpanzees use this flexible system to inform ignorant individuals about food, but the prerequisites to support this type of communication seem to be present. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: The interface between cognition, emotion, and motivation is thought to be of central importance in understanding complex cognitive functions such as decision-making and executive control in humans. Although nonhuman apes have complex repertoires of emotional expression, little is known about the role of affective processes in ape decision-making. To illuminate the evolutionary origins of human-like patterns of choice, we investigated decision-making in humans' closest phylogenetic relatives, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (Pan paniscus). In two studies, we examined these species' temporal and risk preferences, and assessed whether apes show emotional and motivational responses in decision-making contexts. We find that (1) chimpanzees are more patient and more risk-prone than are bonobos, (2) both species exhibit affective and motivational responses following the outcomes of their decisions, and (3) some emotional and motivational responses map onto species-level and individual-differences in decision-making. These results indicate that apes do exhibit emotional responses to decision-making, like humans. We explore the hypothesis that affective and motivational biases may underlie the psychological mechanisms supporting value-based preferences in these species. © 2013 Rosati, Hare.

ABSTRACT: A previously undocumented group of wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) was recently discovered along the Pampana River in the Tonkolili District of Sierra Leone. Based on interviews from local residents (N=6), we estimate the group size to be approximately 30 individuals. Though this population does not show up in the most recent census of chimpanzees in Sierra Leone, it concurs with findings that indicate most of the chimpanzees in Sierra Leone live scattered throughout the country alongside villages, rather than in protected areas. During a three-week observation in the area, two chimpanzees were hunted and killed. The reason for these deaths, along with other reported instances of hunting in the area, are primarily due to crop-raiding and competition for resources between chimpanzees and humans. We conclude that this is a heavily imperiled population. Based on the ecology of the area and composition of local villages, we propose a number of conservation strategies that will promote a symbiotic relationship between the chimpanzees and human populations residing in the area. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: We provided chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) with the ability to improve the quality of food rewards they received in a dyadic test of inequity.We were interested to see if this provision influenced their responses and, if so, whether it was mediated by a social partner's outcomes. We tested eight dyads using an exchange paradigm in which, depending on the condition, the chimpanzees were rewarded with either high-value (a grape) or low-value (a piece of celery) food rewards for each completed exchange. We included four conditions. In the first, "Different" condition, the subject received different, less-preferred, rewards than their partner for each exchange made (a test of inequity). In the "Unavailable" condition, high-value rewards were shown, but not given, to both chimpanzees prior to each exchange and the chimpanzees were rewarded equally with low-value rewards (a test of individual contrast). The final two conditions created equity. In theseHigh-value and Low-value "Same" conditions both chimpanzees received the same food rewards for each exchange.Within each condition, the chimpanzees first completed ten trials in the Baseline Phase, in which the experimenter determined the rewards they received, and then ten trials in the Test Phase. In the Test Phase, the chimpanzees could exchange tokens through the aperture of a small wooden picture frame hung on their cage mesh in order to receive the high-value reward. Thus, in the Test Phase, the chimpanzees were provided with an opportunity to improve the quality of the rewards they received, either absolutely or relative to what their partner received. The chimpanzees responded in a targeted manner; in the Test Phase they attempted to maximize their returns in all conditions in which they had received low-value rewards during the Baseline Phase. Thus, the chimpanzees were apparently motivated to increase their reward regardless of their partners', but they only used the mechanism provided when it afforded the opportunity for themto increase their rewards.We also found evidence that the chimpanzees' responses were enhanced by social facilitation. Specifically, the chimpanzees were more likely to exchange their tokens through the frame when their test partner also did so, even in circumstances in which their reward value could not be improved. Our paradigm provided the chimpanzees with the possibility to improve the quality ofrewards they received in the Test Phase.We found that refusals-to exchange tokens or to eat rewards-decreased significantly in the Test Phase compared to the Baseline Phase, where no such opportunity for improvement of outcomes existed. Thus, the chimpanzees participated more when they could improve the rewards they received. © 2013 Hopper et al.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are capable of extreme violence. They engage in inter-group, sometimes lethal, aggression that provides the winners with an opportunity to enlarge their territory, increase their food supply and, potentially, attract more mates. Lethal violence between adult males also occurs within groups but this is rare; to date, only four cases (three observed and one inferred) have been recorded despite decades of observation. In consequence, the reasons for within-group lethal violence in chimpanzees remain unclear. Such aggression may be rare due to the importance of coalitions between males during inter-group encounters; cooperation between males is also thought to be key in the defense or advancement of social rank within the group. Previous accounts of within-group lethal violence concern victims who were low-ranking males; here we provide the first account of the killing of an incumbent alpha male by a coalition of adult males from the same community. We found no clear evidence that the alpha male's position was under threat during the months before the lethal attack: the male dominance hierarchy was highly stable, with low rates of male-male aggression, and there were no significant changes in social interactions (i.e. grooming and aggression) between the alpha male and the other adult males. Two of the four attackers were former alpha males and were the individuals with whom the victim appeared, in the period preceding his death, to be most strongly affiliated: his most frequent grooming partners and those with whom he spent most time in proximity. The lethal attack triggered a period of instability in the male hierarchy and was likely an opportunistic attempt to seize alpha status by the third-ranking male. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Wild great apes are widely infected with a number of malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.). Yet, nothing is known about the biology of these infections in the wild. Using faecal samples collected from wild chimpanzees, we investigated the effect of age on Plasmodium spp. detection rates. The data show a strong association between age and malaria parasite positivity, with significantly lower detection rates in adults. This suggests that, as in humans, individuals reaching adulthood have mounted an effective protective immunity against malaria parasites.

ABSTRACT: Human and other primate genomes consist of many segmental duplications (SDs) due to fixation of copy number variations (CNVs). Structure of these duplications within the human genome has been shown to be a complex mosaic composed of juxtaposed subunits (called duplicons). These duplicons are difficult to be uncovered from the mosaic repeat structure. In addition, the distribution and evolution of duplicons among primates are still poorly investigated. In this paper, we develop a statistical framework for discovering duplicons via integration of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and a permutation test. Our comparative analysis indicates that the mosaic structure of duplicons is common in CNV/SD regions of both human and chimpanzee genomes, and a subset of core duplicons is shared by the majority of CNVs/SDs. Phylogenetic analyses using duplicons suggested that most CNVs/SDs share common duplication ancestry. Many human/chimpanzee duplicons flank both ends of CNVs, which may be hotspots of nonallelic homologous recombination. © 2013 Trees-Juen Chuang et al.

ABSTRACT: Human and nonhuman animals show personality: temporal and contextual consistency in behavior patterns that vary among individuals. In contrast to most other species, personality of chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, has mainly been studied with non-behavioral methods. We examined boldness, exploration tendency, persistence and tool-orientation in 29 captive chimpanzees using repeated experiments conducted in an ecologically valid social setting. High temporal repeatability and contextual consistency in all these traits indicated they reflected personality. In addition, Principal Component Analysis revealed two independent syndromes, labeled exploration-persistence and boldness. We found no sex or rank differences in the trait scores, but the scores declined with age. Nonetheless, there was considerable inter-individual variation within age-classes, suggesting that behavior was not merely determined by age but also by dispositional effects. In conclusion, our study complements earlier rating studies and adds new traits to the chimpanzee personality, thereby supporting the existence of multiple personality traits among chimpanzees. We stress the importance of ecologically valid behavioral research to assess multiple personality traits and their association, as it allows inclusion of ape studies in the comparison of personality structures across species studied behaviorally, and furthers our attempts to unravel the causes and consequences of animal personality. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) have been frequently observed to share food with one another, with numerous hypotheses proposed to explain why. These often focus on reciprocity exchanges for social benefits (e.g., food for grooming, food for sex, affiliation, kinship, and dominance rank) as well as sharing based on begging and deterring harassment. Although previous studies have shown that each of these hypotheses has a viable basis, they have only examined situations in which males have preferential access to food whereby females are required to obtain the food from males. For example, studies on male chimpanzee food sharing take advantage of successful crop-raids and/or acquisitions of meat from hunting, situations that only leave females access to food controlled by male food possessors. This begs the question how and with whom might a female chimpanzee in sole possession of a high-quality food item choose to share? In two large captive groups of chimpanzees, we examined each of the hypotheses with female food possessors of a high-quality food item and compared these data to a previous study examining food transfers from male chimpanzees. Our results show that alpha females shared significantly more with closely affiliated females displaying perseverance, while kinship and dominance rank had no effect. This positive interaction between long-term affiliation and perseverance shows that individuals with whom the female possessor was significantly affiliated received more food while persevering more than those with neutral or avoidant relationships towards her. Furthermore, females with avoidant relationships persevered far less than others, suggesting that this strategy is not equally available to all individuals. In comparison to the mixed-sex trials, females chose to co-feed with other females more than was observed when the alpha male was sharing food. This research indicates that male and female chimpanzees (as possessors of a desired food item) share food in ways influenced by different factors and strategies. © 2013 Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: There is an ongoing debate about the adaptive function of chimpanzee's food-associated calls. Here, we tested a new hypothesis that food-associated calls in male chimpanzees function to signal that the calling individual is likely to initiate or prolong feeding. We propose that the signal functions to coordinate activities between individuals and that its ultimate function is to retain the nearby individuals in proximity. To test this hypothesis, we collected data on social and ecological correlates of food-associates calls in male chimpanzees. The results of this study, which was conducted on the Kanyawara community in the Kibale National Park, Uganda, show that males tended to feed for significantly longer after giving food-associated calls upon initiating feeding than after remaining silent. The type of audience had a significant effect on food calling, with males producing food-associated calls more often when males rather than females and preferred rather than neutral male social partners were in close proximity. However, the total party or male party size did not correlate with food calling behaviors, suggesting that the signal "targets" those in close proximity. Finally, a male feeding partner was more likely to remain with the focal until the end of a feeding bout after the focal gave a food-associated call at the beginning of the feeding bout than when he was silent. These results support our hypothesis and suggest that one of the functions of food calling in chimpanzees might be signaling that the caller is likely to initiate and prolong a feeding bout. This information might be used by receivers to make the decision whether or not to stay with the calling individual on a feeding patch or leave him (fission). The study suggests therefore that ultimately the function of food calling might be to coordinate feeding behaviors between males. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: There has been extensive research investigating self-control in humans and nonhuman animals, yet we know surprisingly little about how one's social environment influences self-control. The present study examined the self-control of chimpanzees in a task that required active engagement with conspecifics. The task consisted of transferring a token back and forth with a partner animal in order to accumulate food rewards, one item per token transfer. Self-control was required because at any point in the trial, either chimpanzee could obtain their accumulated rewards, but doing so discontinued the food accumulation and ended the trial for both individuals. Chimpanzees readily engaged the task and accumulated the majority of available rewards before ending each trial, and they did so across a number of conditions that varied the identity of the partner, the presence/absence of the experimenter, and the means by which they could obtain rewards. A second experiment examined chimpanzees' self-control when given the choice between immediately available food items and a potentially larger amount of rewards that could be obtained by engaging the token transfer task with a partner. Chimpanzees were flexible in their decision-making in this test, typically choosing the option representing the largest amount of food, even if it involved delayed accumulation of the rewards via the token transfer task. These results demonstrate that chimpanzees can exhibit self-control in situations involving social interactions, and they encourage further research into this important aspect of the self-control scenario. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: A long-standing question in evolutionary biology concerns the effect of recombination in shaping the genomic architecture of organisms and, in particular, how this impacts the speciation process. Despite efforts employed in the last decade, the role of chromosomal reorganizations in the human-chimpanzee speciation process remains unresolved. Through whole-genome comparisons, we have analyzed the genome-wide impact of genomic shuffling in the distribution of human recombination rates during the human-chimpanzee speciation process. We have constructed a highly refined map of the reorganizations and evolutionary breakpoint regions in the human and chimpanzee genomes based on orthologous genes and genome sequence alignments. The analysis of the most recent human and chimpanzee recombination maps inferred from genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism data revealed that the standardized recombination rate was significantly lower in rearranged than in collinear chromosomes. In fact, rearranged chromosomes presented significantly lower recombination rates than chromosomes that have been maintained since the ancestor of great apes, and this was related with the lineage in which they become fixed. Importantly, inverted regions had lower recombination rates than collinear and noninverted regions, independently of the effect of centromeres. Our observations have implications for the chromosomal speciation theory, providing new evidences for the contribution of inversions in suppressing recombination in mammals. © 2012 The Author(s) 2012.

ABSTRACT: Understanding how human activities affect wild primates is critical to the design of effective conservation strategies. Despite this need, few studies have examined the physiological and behavioral effects of field research methods in the wild. Here, we examine how the stress response, i.e., fecal cortisol, and behavior of Ugandan red colobus monkeys (Procolobus rufomitratus) in Kibale National Park are affected by chemical immobilization and collaring, i.e., capture. We compare this anthropogenic stressor to a naturally occurring stressor: a chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) predation attack. Two adult males had peak cortisol levels of 283 and 284 ng/g 2-3 d after capture, which were 190% and 182% above their baseline levels, i.e., the first sample taken immediately after capture, but these peak levels did not remain elevated. Using long-term data, i.e., 11 mo of data, we found no difference in fecal cortisol levels between 10 darted and collared individuals and 14 individuals living in the same social group that were not darted or collared. For the chimpanzee attack, peak fecal cortisol levels (147-211% above baseline) were recorded 1-4 d after the attack, but these levels also did not remain elevated for long. These data show that darting and collaring and a chimpanzee predation attempt caused an acute stress response, but neither leads to sustained elevated cortisol levels. Thus, in situations in which research contributes significantly to the conservation of primates and cannot be conducted noninvasively, capture darting appears to be a useful technique with minimal long-term effects as long as injury and mortality are avoided. However, we encourage researchers to make similar physiological and behavioral comparisons in other field studies using similar techniques to provide a better understanding of the effects of research practices on the stress physiology and social behavior of wild primates. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: Duetting or chorusing behaviour occurs in a wide variety of animals and is posited to fulfil various important functions including territory defence and social bonding. The structure of calls produced in choruses might be shaped in a way that facilitates such joint vocal displays. In this study, we test the hypothesis that flexibility to modify the temporal structure of chimpanzee pant-hoots, vocalisations often given jointly with other individuals, facilitates chorusing. The results of this study, which was conducted on two communities of wild chimpanzees in Uganda, support this hypothesis. First, the duration of the build-up phase of the pant-hoot correlated with the latency with which the partner joined in the call, suggesting that males prolong the duration of the build-up to allow others to join in the call and to increase the likelihood of a chorus occurring. Second, the loud climax phases were significantly longer when produced in choruses than alone, which suggests that males prolong this part of the call when calling in choruses. Within chorus pant-hoots, there was a positive relationship between the number of climax elements given by two calling partners, suggesting that males adjust the temporal structure of their call to mirror their partner's call. We conclude that the basic acoustic structure of chimpanzee pant-hoots and the flexibility with which males adjust the duration of the constituent phases promote chorusing, and that the temporal structure of this rather stereotyped vocalisation is sensitive to fine details of the vocal responses of the audience. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC) is a recombination-associated process that favors the fixation of G/C alleles over A/T alleles. In mammals, gBGC is hypothesized to contribute to variation in GC content, rapidly evolving sequences, and the fixation of deleterious mutations, but its prevalence and general functional consequences remain poorly understood. gBGC is difficult to incorporate into models of molecular evolution and so far has primarily been studied using summary statistics from genomic comparisons. Here, we introduce a new probabilistic model that captures the joint effects of natural selection and gBGC on nucleotide substitution patterns, while allowing for correlations along the genome in these effects. We implemented our model in a computer program, called phastBias, that can accurately detect gBGC tracts about 1 kilobase or longer in simulated sequence alignments. When applied to real primate genome sequences, phastBias predicts gBGC tracts that cover roughly 0.3% of the human and chimpanzee genomes and account for 1.2% of human-chimpanzee nucleotide differences. These tracts fall in clusters, particularly in subtelomeric regions; they are enriched for recombination hotspots and fast-evolving sequences; and they display an ongoing fixation preference for G and C alleles. They are also significantly enriched for disease-associated polymorphisms, suggesting that they contribute to the fixation of deleterious alleles. The gBGC tracts provide a unique window into historical recombination processes along the human and chimpanzee lineages. They supply additional evidence of long-term conservation of megabase-scale recombination rates accompanied by rapid turnover of hotspots. Together, these findings shed new light on the evolutionary, functional, and disease implications of gBGC. The phastBias program and our predicted tracts are freely available. © 2013 Capra et al.

ABSTRACT: Determining the intentionality of primate communication is critical to understanding the evolution of human language. Although intentional signalling has been claimed for some great ape gestural signals, comparable evidence is currently lacking for their vocal signals. We presented wild chimpanzees with a python model and found that two of three alarm call types exhibited characteristics previously used to argue for intentionality in gestural communication. These alarm calls were: (i) socially directed and given to the arrival of friends, (ii) associated with visual monitoring of the audience and gaze alternations, and (iii) goal directed, as calling only stopped when recipients were safe from the predator. Our results demonstrate that certain vocalisations of our closest living relatives qualify as intentional signals, in a directly comparable way to many great ape gestures. We conclude that our results undermine a central argument of gestural theories of language evolution and instead support a multimodal origin of human language. © 2013 Schel et al.

ABSTRACT: An HIV-1 infection progresses in most human individuals sooner or later into AIDS, a devastating disease that kills more than a million people worldwide on an annual basis. Nonetheless, certain HIV-1-infected persons appear to act as long-term non-progressors, and elite control is associated with the presence of particular MHC class I allotypes such as HLA-B*27 or -B*57. The HIV-1 pandemic in humans arose from the cross-species transmission of SIVcpz originating from chimpanzees. Chimpanzees, however, appear to be relatively resistant to developing AIDS after HIV-1/SIVcpz infection. Mounting evidence illustrates that, in the distant past, chimpanzees experienced a selective sweep resulting in a severe reduction of their MHC class I repertoire. This was most likely caused by an HIV-1/SIV-like retrovirus, suggesting that chimpanzees may have experienced long-lasting host-virus relationships with SIV-like viruses. Hence, if natural selection is allowed to follow its course, prospects for the human population may look grim, thus underscoring the desperate need for an effective vaccine. © 2013 de Groot and Bontrop; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Replication-defective chimpanzee adenovirus vectors are emerging as a promising new class of genetic vaccine carriers. Chimpanzee adenovirus vectors have now reached the clinical stage and appear to be endowed with all the properties needed for human vaccine development, including high quality and magnitude of the immune response induced against the encoded antigens, good safety and ease of manufacturing on a large-scale basis. Here the authors review the recent findings of this novel class of adenovirus vectors and compare their properties to other clinical stage vaccine vectors derived from poxvirus, alphavirus and human adenovirus. © 2013 2013 Expert Reviews Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Monitoring populations of endangered species over time is necessary to guide and evaluate conservation efforts. This is particularly important for nonprotected areas that ensure connectivity between protected populations but are prone to uncontrolled hunting pressure. We investigated whether use of transects by local people and transect reuse for repeated surveys influence great ape nesting and bias results. We conducted simultaneous marked nest count surveys over 12 mo on established and newly opened transects in a nonprotected area subject to traditional heavy use by local people and recorded forest composition and signs of human activity. Chimpanzee and gorilla density estimates and encounter rates per kilometer were lower on established transects than on new ones. A generalized linear model indicated that hunting activity, distance to a regularly used forest trail, and transect type (old or new) predicted chimpanzee nest abundance, and distance to the trail and transect type predicted gorilla nest abundance, with no effect of habitat type (percentage suitable habitat) for either species. We, therefore, suggest that the difference in great ape nesting is a result of high levels of hunting by local people on established transects and forest trails. Our results support the use of repeated line transect surveys for monitoring great ape populations in many circumstances, although we advocate taking precautions in nonprotected areas, to avoid the bias imposed by use of established transects for hunting. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: Although male-female relationships can offer a number of advantages such as protection or social support, they are poorly studied among primates compared to same-sex relationships. We used 12 yr of data from the Kanyawara chimpanzee community to compare three independent measures of association (party association, 5m association, and grooming) among all adult dyads. Party association exhibited by male-female dyads was of intermediate strength between strong male-male and weak female-female association. Male-female dyads were less likely to be within 5m of one another and to groom as male-male dyads, but equally likely to be within 5m and more likely to groom as female-female dyads. Variation in male-female association strength was not related to male rank but was affected by female ranging patterns and female reproductive states. Females with core areas in the center of the home range were more likely to be in parties with males but did not show higher spatial proximity or grooming indices compared to females ranging in the periphery. Party association and 5m indices were higher for dyads of males and estrous females compared to those with anestrous females. These results indicate that male-female dyads are likely to associate with one another more often than female-female dyads because of overlapping ranging patterns and short-term changes in female reproductive state. We conclude that male and female chimpanzees do not exhibit proximity and grooming patterns indicative of strong affiliative bonds. This study also highlights the importance of using multiple independent measures of bond strength in studies of primate social dynamics. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: Ascertaining the full range of dietary constituents of a primate population allows the identification of habitats with important food resources and can assist efforts to conserve primates. For unhabituated populations, we can acquire otherwise unobtainable dietary information from macroscopic inspection of fecal samples. This method has made a significant contribution to understanding food intake in various primate species. Increasing knowledge of the omnivorous diet of our closest living relatives, the common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and the bonobo (P. paniscus), which range and forage in various habitats to meet daily nutrient requirements, provides more scope to assess human omnivory and its evolution from our last common ancestor. However, macroscopic inspection may lead to bias toward undigested and therefore identifiable food items, e.g., fruit seeds, vs. pulverized components, e.g., leaves, that are unidentifiable at this level. This study seeks to validate findings from macroscopic inspection by comparing species identified in fecal samples from select individuals vs. data from direct observations of their feeding. We collected data from 10 adult chimpanzees of the Kanyawara community in Kibale National Park. We identified 86% of species from which fruit had been eaten vs. only 21% from which leaves had been eaten in fecal samples analyzed. This study provides empirical support for previous assumptions and confirms the limitations of macroscopic inspection of feces for identifying the nonfrugivorous dietary elements to species level. However, valuable insights into seasonality of diet can be gleaned from macroscopic inspection. Also, if we combine data on species identified in feces with direct observation of food intake, we can establish when food items were eaten, which enables estimations of gut passage rates for wild populations. Finally, analyzing fecal samples collected from various group members can provide insight into the dietary repertoire at the individual level. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: Replication-defective adenoviruses have been utilized as candidate vaccine vectors. However, clinical application of the best-studied human adenovirus type-5 (AdHu5) is limited by the high prevalence of preexisting neutralizing antibodies resulting from natural infection. Therefore, rare adenovirus serotypes, such as human adenovirus type-26 (AdHu26) and chimpanzee adenovirus type-68 (AdC68), have been employed as substitutes for AdHu5. However, few studies have described the epidemiology of pre-existing immunity to these adenoviruses in China. Thus, 1,154 participants from six regions in China were examined to assess the presence of neutralizing antibodies against AdHu5, AdHu26, and AdC68. The seroprevalence rates of neutralizing antibodies were as follows: AdHu5, 73.1% (844/1,154) (95% confidence interval: 70.5-75.6%); AdHu26, 35.3% (407/1,154) (95% confidence interval: 32.6-38.1%); and AdC68, 12.7% (147/1,154) (95% confidence interval: 10.9-14.8%), respectively. The most frequently detected and highest titer antibodies were specific for AdHu5. The results indicate that AdHu26 and AdC68 serve as more suitable vaccine vectors than AdHu5. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Among primates, humans are uniquely vulnerable to many age-related neurodegenerative disorders. We used structural and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine the brains of chimpanzees and rhesus monkeys across each species' adult lifespan, and compared these results with published findings in humans. As in humans, gray matter volume decreased with age in chimpanzees and rhesus monkeys. Also like humans, chimpanzees showed a trend for decreased white matter volume with age, but this decrease occurred proportionally later in the chimpanzee lifespan than in humans. Diffusion MRI revealed widespread age-related decreases in fractional anisotropy and increases in radial diffusivity in chimpanzees and macaques. However, both the fractional anisotropy decline and the radial diffusivity increase started at a proportionally earlier age in humans than in chimpanzees. Thus, even though overall patterns of gray and white matter aging are similar in humans and chimpanzees, the longer lifespan of humans provides more time for white matter to deteriorate before death, with the result that some neurological effects of aging may be exacerbated in our species. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) hunt various primates, but concentrate on red colobus monkeys (Piliocolobus spp.) wherever the two species are sympatric. The extraordinarily large Ngogo chimpanzee community in Kibale National Park, Uganda, preys heavily on the local population of red colobus (P. tephrosceles). Census data showed a steep decline in this population in the center of the chimpanzees' home range between 1975 and 2007 [Lwanga et al., 2011; Teelen, 2007b]. Given no obvious change in food availability, predation by chimpanzees was the most likely cause [ibid.; Teelen, 2008]. However, census data from other parts of the home range raised the possibility that the decline was restricted to this central area [Teelen, 2007a] We present data from 1998 to 2012 on the rate of encounters between chimpanzees and red colobus that provide a chimpanzee-centered estimate of red colobus density, thus of predation opportunities, throughout the home range. These corroborate census data by showing a long-term decline in encounters near the center. They also show that encounters become relatively more common at increasing distances from the center, but encounter rates have decreased even in peripheral areas and, by implication, the red colobus population has declined throughout the study area. These data corroborate Teelen's [2008] conclusion that chimpanzee predation on red colobus during the 1990s and early 2000s was unsustainable. Hunting rates and prey offtake rates have also declined markedly; whether this will allow the red colobus population to recover is unknown. In contrast, rates at which chimpanzees encountered redtail monkeys (Cercopithecus ascanius) and grey-cheeked mangabeys (Lophocebus albigena) did not decrease. Neither did they increase, however, contrary to long-term census data from the center of the study area [Lwanga et al., 2011]. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Recent evidence has shown that humans are remarkably sensitive to artificial cues of conspecific observation when making decisions with potential social consequences. Whether similar effects are found in other great apes has not yet been investigated. We carried out two experiments in which individual chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, took items of food from an array in the presence of either an image of a large conspecific face or a scrambled control image. In experiment 1 we compared three versions of the face image varying in size and the amount of the face displayed. In experiment 2 we compared a fourth variant of the image with more prominent coloured eyes displayed closer to the focal chimpanzee. The chimpanzees did not look at the face images significantly more than at the control images in either experiment. Although there were trends for some individuals in each experiment to be slower to take high-value food items in the face conditions, these were not consistent or robust. We suggest that the extreme human sensitivity to cues of potential conspecific observation may not be shared with chimpanzees. © 2013 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to analyze the distribution and phenotypic properties of the indigenous streptococci in chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) oral cavities. Eleven chimpanzees (aged from 9 to 44 years, mean±SD, 26.9±12.6 years) in the Primate Research Institute of Kyoto University were enrolled in this research and brushing bacterial samples collected from them. Streptococci were isolated from the oral cavities of all chimpanzees. The isolates (n=46) were identified as thirteen species by 16S rRNA genes analysis. The predominant species was Streptococcus sanguinis of mitis streptococci from five chimpanzees (45%). Mutans streptococci were isolated from six chimpanzees (55%). The predominant species in the mutans streptococci were Streptococcus troglodytae from four chimpanzees (36%), this species having been proposed as a novel species by us, and Streptococcus dentirousetti from three chimpanzees (27%). Streptococcus mutans was isolated from one chimpanzee (9%). However, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus macacae and Streptococcus downei, which are indigenous to human and monkey (Macaca fasciclaris) oral habitats, were not isolated. Of the mutans streptococci, S. troglodytae, S. dentirousetti, and S. mutans possessed strong adherence activity to glass surface. © 2013 The Societies and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

ABSTRACT: One effective method for measuring personality in primates is to use personality trait ratings to distill the experience of people familiar with the individual animals. Previous rating instruments were created using either top-down or bottom-up approaches. Top-down approaches, which essentially adapt instruments originally designed for use with another species, can unfortunately lead to the inclusion of traits irrelevant to chimpanzees or fail to include all relevant aspects of chimpanzee personality. Conversely, because bottom-up approaches derive traits specifically for chimpanzees, their unique items may impede comparisons with findings in other studies and other species. To address the limitations of each approach, we developed a new personality rating scale using a combined top-down/bottom-up design. Seventeen raters rated 99 chimpanzees on the new 41-item scale, with all but one item being rated reliably. Principal components analysis, using both varimax and direct oblimin rotations, identified six broad factors. Strong evidence was found for five of the factors (Reactivity/Undependability, Dominance, Openness, Extraversion, and Agreeableness). A sixth factor (Methodical) was offered provisionally until more data are collected. We validated the factors against behavioral data collected independently on the chimpanzees. The five factors demonstrated good evidence for convergent and predictive validity, thereby underscoring the robustness of the factors. Our combined top-down/bottom-up approach provides the most extensive data to date to support the universal existence of these five personality factors in chimpanzees. This framework, which facilitates cross-species comparisons, can also play a vital role in understanding the evolution of personality and can assist with husbandry and welfare efforts. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Specimens from men with acute non-gonococcal urethritis were tested to determine their microbial content and then given intra-urethrally to male chimpanzees. Two animals received ureaplasmas only and one became infected. The second did so when given a different strain. Both developed a polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNL) response. Two chimpanzees received a mixture of ureaplasmas and Chlamydia trachomatis and there was a suggestion that the ureaplasmas delayed or suppressed the chlamydial response. The latter, that is urethral infection with a pronounced PMNL response, was most clearly seen in a chimpanzee given C. trachomatis only. No inflammation was detected in two chimpanzees acting as controls. Three of five chimpanzees given ureaplasmas genitally, and one that had them endogenously, had them transiently in the oropharynx about 2 weeks later. The occurrence of ureaplasmas in the conjunctiva of three chimpanzees inoculated at this site was also transient and without inflammation. The possibility that Mycoplasma genitalium might have been in the inocula and caused urethral inflammation was discounted largely because no animal had antibody to this mycoplasma. © 2013 SGM.

ABSTRACT: Social structure in group-living animals is defined by the nature and patterning of social interactions among members of the society. Social structure is shaped in large part by kinship and competition among group members, but can also be influenced by affiliative interactions among both kin and nonkin and can vary based on sex differences in dispersal patterns and social dynamics. Chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, live in fission-fusion societies in which males form strong dyadic bonds and have social networks that can influence the social structure of the community. Females are generally less gregarious than males and bonding among females is considered rare or absent in East African populations. Although females in some populations are known to form 'neighbourhoods', these are assumed to reflect passive spatial arrangements. In this study I used data on female chimpanzee association and social interactions to examine how social dynamics among the dispersing sex influence social structure at Ngogo, Kibale National Park. Females at Ngogo were relatively gregarious and exhibited association preferences that extended beyond the dyadic level. Females formed distinct association clusters termed 'cliques' within which affiliative interactions occurred more than expected by chance. In addition, association patterns were found to be active social units and not a by-product of space use overlap. These findings demonstrate that intrasexual bonding is not limited to males in this population and that female social relationships, not just those of males, can influence chimpanzee grouping patterns and the corresponding social structure of the community. This study contributes to our growing understanding chimpanzee behavioural diversity. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: There is increasing evidence that some behavioural differences between groups of chimpanzees can be attributed neither to genetic nor to ecological variation. Such differences are likely to be maintained by social learning. While humans teach their offspring, and acquire cultural traits through imitative learning, there is little evidence of such behaviours in chimpanzees. However, by appealing only to incremental changes in motivation, attention and attention-soliciting behaviour, and without expensive changes in cognition, we can hypothesise the possible emergence of imitation and pedagogy in evolutionary history. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

ABSTRACT: A reclassification of captive chimpanzees as endangered by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) would have devastating consequences on critical areas of basic biomedical research for which chimpanzees are uniquely suitable as animal models. It also would have a negative impact on the survival of wild chimpanzees and the preservation of the species. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees have been shown to be adept learners, both individually and socially. Yet, sometimes their conservative nature seems to hamper the flexible adoption of superior alternatives, even to the extent that they persist in using entirely ineffective strategies. In this study, we investigated chimpanzees' behavioural flexibility in two different conditions under which social animals have been predicted to abandon personal preferences and adopt alternative strategies: i) under influence of majority demonstrations (i.e. conformity), and ii) in the presence of superior reward contingencies (i.e. maximizing payoffs). Unlike previous nonhuman primate studies, this study disentangled the concept of conformity from the tendency to maintain one's first-learned strategy. Studying captive (n=16) and semi-wild (n=12) chimpanzees in two complementary exchange paradigms, we found that chimpanzees did not abandon their behaviour in order to match the majority, but instead remained faithful to their first-learned strategy (Study 1a and 1b). However, the chimpanzees' fidelity to their first-learned strategy was overridden by an experimental upgrade of the profitability of the alternative strategy (Study 2). We interpret our observations in terms of chimpanzees' relative weighing of behavioural options as a function of situation-specific trade-offs. More specifically, contrary to previous findings, chimpanzees in our study abandoned their familiar behaviour to maximize payoffs, but not to conform to a majority. © 2013 van Leeuwen et al.

ABSTRACT: Human and chimpanzee introns contain numerous sequences strongly related to known microRNA hairpin structures. The relative frequency is precisely maintained across all chromosomes, suggesting the possible co-evolution of gene networks dependent upon microRNA regulation and with origins corresponding to the advent of primate transposable elements (TEs). While the motifs are known to be derived from transposable elements, the most common are far more numerous than expected from the number of TEs and their paralogous sequences, and exhibit striking conservation in comparison to the surrounding TE sequence context. Several of these motifs also exhibit structural complimentarity to each other, suggesting a pairing function at the level of DNA or RNA. These "pseudomicroRNAs," in semblance to pseudogenes, include hundreds of thousands of vestigial paralogs of primate microRNAs, many of which may have functioned historically or remain active today.

ABSTRACT: Among social animals, group size is constrained by competition over resources. Because female reproductive success is limited by access to food resources, and that of males by access to fertile females, chimpanzee females are proposed to be less social than males and to maintain weak intrasexual relations. Findings from Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire, challenged this view, as chimpanzee females were described as generally gregarious, and close intrasexual bonds were common. Here, in a new analysis that focuses on the South Group of chimpanzees in Taï forest, we reevaluate the proposed differences in female association patterns between the Taï and East African populations. We find that mean party size and dyadic association index between females has decreased in Taï, although the level of dyadic associations remains high compared with East African chimpanzees. We attribute the decrease in female gregariousness to the decline in community size over the last 10 years. In addition, we use a multivariate approach to analyze social and ecological factors influencing party size in females. We show that female gregariousness increased when the fruit resources were more clumped and with increased number of females in estrus present. Party size of mothers with sons, however, was smaller with increasing number of sexually receptive females. The results of our model and the reviewed findings of other studies support the socioecological model because food distribution affects female gregariousness, but social and demographic aspects are equally influencing female grouping tendencies. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Infections caused by the intestinal ciliate Neobalantidium coli are asymptomatic in most hosts. In humans and captive African great apes clinical infections occasionally occur, manifested mainly by dysentery; however, factors responsible for development of clinical balantidiasis have not been fully clarified. We studied the effect of dietary starch on the intensities of infection by N. coli in two groups of captive chimpanzees. Adult chimpanzees infected by N. coli from the Hodonín Zoo and from the Brno Zoo, Czech Republic, were fed with a high starch diet (HSD) (average 14.7% of starch) for 14 days, followed by a five-day transition period and subsequently with a period of low starch diet (LoSD) (average 0.1% of starch) for another 14 days. We collected fecal samples during the last seven days of HSD and LoSD and fixed them in 10% formalin. We quantified trophozoites of N. coli using the FLOTAC method. The numbers of N. coli trophozoites were higher during the HSD (mean ± SD: 49.0±134.7) than during the LoSD (3.5±6.8). A generalized linear mixed-effects model revealed significantly lower numbers of the N. coli trophozoites in the feces during the LoSD period in comparison to the HSD period (treatment contrast LoSD vs. HSD: 2.7±0.06 (SE), z = 47.7; p≪0.001). We conclude that our data provide a first indication that starch-rich diet might be responsible for high intensities of infection of N. coli in captive individuals and might predispose them for clinically manifested balantidiasis. We discuss the potential nutritional modifications to host diets that can be implemented in part to control N. coli infections. © 2013 Schovancová et al.

ABSTRACT: The gut microbial communities within great apes have been shown to reflect the phylogenetic history of their hosts, indicating codiversification between great apes and their gut microbiota over evolutionary timescales. But because the great apes examined to date represent geographically isolated populations whose diets derive from different sources, it is unclear whether this pattern of codiversification has resulted from a long history of coadaptation between microbes and hosts (heritable factors) or from the ecological and geographic separation among host species (environmental factors). To evaluate the relative influences of heritable and environmental factors on the evolution of the great ape gut microbiota, we assayed the gut communities of sympatric and allopatric populations of chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas residing throughout equatorial Africa. Comparisons of these populations revealed that the gut communities of different host species can always be distinguished from one another but that the gut communities of sympatric chimpanzees and gorillas have converged in terms of community composition, sharing on average 53% more bacterial phylotypes than the gut communities of allopatric hosts. Host environment, independent of host genetics and evolutionary history, shaped the distribution of bacterial phylotypes across the Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria, the four most common phyla of gut bacteria. Moreover, the specific patterns of phylotype sharing among hosts suggest that chimpanzees living in sympatry with gorillas have acquired bacteria from gorillas. These results indicate that geographic isolation between host species has promoted the evolutionary differentiation of great ape gut bacterial communities. © 2013, Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

ABSTRACT: Conceptual metaphors are linguistic constructions. Such a metaphor is humans' mental representation of social rank as a pyramidal-like structure. High-ranked individuals are represented in higher positions than low-ranked individuals. We show that conceptual metaphorical mapping between social rank and the representational domain exists in our closest evolutionary relatives, the chimpanzees. Chimpanzee participants were requested to discriminate face identities in a vertical arrangement. We found a modulation of response latencies by the rank of the presented individual and the position on the display: a high-ranked individual presented in the higher and a low-ranked individual in the lower position led to quicker identity discrimination than a high-ranked individual in the lower and a low-ranked individual in the higher position. Such a spatial representation of dominance hierarchy in chimpanzees suggests that a natural tendency to systematically map an abstract dimension exists in the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees. © Dahl and Adachi.

ABSTRACT: In developing human children, joint attention (JA) is an important preverbal skill fundamental to the development of language. Poor JA skills have been described as a behavioral risk factor for some neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder. It has been hypothesized that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays an important role in the development of JA in human children. Here, we tested whether the morphometry and lateralization of the ACC differed between chimpanzees that were classified as either consistently or inconsistently engaging in JA with a human experimenter. Results showed that chimpanzees that performed poorly on the JA task had larger gray matter (GM) volumes in the ACC compared to apes that performed well on the task. In addition, both population-level asymmetries and sex differences in the volume of GM were found within the ACC. Specifically, females had relatively larger GM volumes in two of the three subregions of the ACC compared to males, and significant leftward asymmetries were found for two of the subregions whereas a rightward bias was observed in the third. Based on these findings, we suggest that the ACC plays an important role in mediating JA, not just in humans, but also chimpanzees. We further suggest that the differences found between groups may reflect inherent differences in the amount of white matter within the ACC, thereby suggesting reduced connectivity between the ACC and other cortical regions in chimpanzees with poor JA skills.

ABSTRACT: Carbon and oxygen stable isotopes within modern and fossil tooth enamel record the aspects of an animal's diet and habitat use. This investigation reports the first isotopic analyses of enamel from a large chimpanzee community and associated fauna, thus providing a means of comparing fossil ape and early hominin palaeoecologies with those of a modern ape. Within Kibale National Park forest, oxygen isotopes differentiate primate niches, allowing for the first isotopic reconstructions of degree of frugivory versus folivory as well as use of arboreal versus terrestrial resources. In a comparison of modern and fossil community isotopic profiles, results indicate that Sivapithecus, a Miocene ape from Pakistan, fed in the forest canopy, as do chimpanzees, but inhabited a forest with less continuous canopy or fed more on leaves. Ardipithecus, an early hominin from Ethiopia, fed both arboreally and terrestrially in a more open habitat than inhabited by chimpanzees. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: We systematically recorded all long-distance chimpanzee vocalizations and tree drums over a 26-month study period in 13 forest regions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We found that the frequency of chimpanzee vocalizations and tree drums was considerably higher in the remote Gangu Forest than in other forest regions closer to human settlements and roads. We present evidence indicating that chimpanzees may reduce their levels of vocalizations in areas characterized by high levels of human hunting. The chimpanzees appear to have the behavioural flexibility necessary to modify their behaviour in areas where humans are a major threat. We discuss the possible consequences of this reduction in vocalization rate on the social system of the chimpanzees. Copyright © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.

ABSTRACT: Communication and social relationships are two of the most important aspects of primate life, but few studies have focused on linking these aspects in apes. There are some shared social pressures between the two sexes (e.g., kin selection, alliance formation, and protection against attack), but there are also differences (e.g., mate selection, dispersal, and social ranking systems). The aim of this study was to identify the communication strategies of the sexes with respect to their particular communication partner. I hypothesized the sexes use different strategies in their gestural communication based on their different social pressures. Specifically, males should have more positive intra-sexual relationships than females because of high focus on male-male alliance formation and maintaining high social rank, both of which directly affect their mating opportunities and relationships with all other members of the group. On the other hand, females should have more positive inter-sexual relationships due to the abuse they could receive from insubordination to males and because there is less focus on maintaining multiple, positive relationships with other females. Furthermore, because of differences in social pressures, males should have higher incidence of reassurance in same-sex interactions than females because it should be more important for males to mitigate negative interactions. I analyzed the characteristics of the gesture repertoire and frequency of gesture use for each sex in each of four contexts: (1) aggression, (2) submission, (3) greeting, and (4) reassurance. I looked at intra-sexual and inter-sexual interactions, separately. I found that, indeed, males and females utilize different strategies of gestural communication. I also found that females, but not males, have a distinct gesture strategy for communicating with the opposite sex than for the same sex. This study shows there are distinct strategies utilized by the two sexes and these differences may be explained by their differing social pressures. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzee nesting behaviours and the factors that may influence these behaviours are rarely studied in captive settings. In the present study, the daytime associations, sleeping site selections and nesting groups of 11 zoo-housed chimpanzees over a 29-day period were analysed. Neither daytime associations nor presence of kin influenced sleeping site selection in females. Daytime associations did influence sleeping arrangements in males. Nighttime spatial arrangements and individual preferences for specific sleeping areas were broadly comparable to nesting patterns reported in free-living chimpanzee communities. In the interests of captive ape welfare, we conclude that exhibits should incorporate multilevel nesting areas and a choice of several potential sleeping sites. Copyright © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.

ABSTRACT: Simian immunodeficiency virus of chimpanzees (SIVcpz) is the ancestor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the etiologic agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in humans. Like HIV-1-infected humans, SIVcpz-infected chimpanzees can develop AIDS-like symptoms. Because SIVcpz/HIV-1 may disrupt regulation of the gut microbiome and because it has not been possible to sample individual humans pre- and postinfection, we investigated the influence of infection on gut communities through long-term monitoring of chimpanzees from Gombe National Park, Tanzania. SIVcpz infection accelerated the rate of change in gut microbiota composition within individuals for periods of years after the initial infection and led to gut communities marked by high frequencies of pathogen-containing bacterial genera absent from SIVcpz-negative individuals. Our results indicate that immune function maintains temporally stable gut communities that are lost when individuals become infected with SIVcpz. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: This study examined the use of sensory modalities relative to a partner's behavior in gesture sequences during captive chimpanzee play at the Chimpanzee and Human Communication Institute. We hypothesized that chimpanzees would use visual gestures toward attentive recipients and auditory/tactile gestures toward inattentive recipients. We also hypothesized that gesture sequences would be more prevalent toward unresponsive rather than responsive recipients. The chimpanzees used significantly more auditory/tactile rather than visual gestures first in sequences with both attentive and inattentive recipients. They rarely used visual gestures toward inattentive recipients. Auditory/tactile gestures were effective with and used with both attentive and inattentive recipients. Recipients responded significantly more to single gestures than to first gestures in sequences. Sequences often indicated that recipients did not respond to initial gestures, whereas effective single gestures made more gestures unnecessary. The chimpanzees thus gestured appropriately relative to a recipient's behavior and modified their interactions according to contextual social cues. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Simian foamy viruses (SFVs) are thought to infect virtually any adult nonhuman primate (NHP). While many data have accumulated about patterns of codivergence with their hosts and cross-species transmission events, little is known about the modalities of SFV transmission within NHP species, especially in the wild. Here we provide a detailed investigation of the dynamics of SFV circulation in a wild community of Western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus). We demonstrate that mother-offspring (vertical) SFV transmission is common and hypothesize that it accounts for a number of primary infections. We also show that multiple infections with several chimpanzee-specific SFV strains (i.e., superinfection) commonly happen in adult chimpanzees, which might point to adult-specific aggressive behaviors as a lifelong source of SFV infection. Our data give evidence for complex SFV dynamics in wild chimpanzees, even at a single community scale, and show that linking wild NHP social interactions and their microorganisms' dynamics is feasible. © 2013, American Society for Microbiology.

ABSTRACT: Primates are unusual among terrestrial quadrupedal mammals in that at walking speeds they prefer diagonal rather than lateral gaits. A number of reasons have been proposed for this preference in relation to the arboreal ancestry of modern primates: stability, energetic cost, neural control, skeletal loading, and limb interference avoiding. However, this is a difficult question to explore experimentally since most primates only occasionally use anything other than diagonal gaits. An alternative approach is to produce biologically realistic computer simulations of primate gait that enable the constraints of biomechanical loading and the energetics of different modes of locomotion to be explored. In this paper we describe such a model for the chimpanzee Pan troglodytes. The simulation is able to produce spontaneous quadrupedal locomotion, and the footfall sequences generated are split between lateral and diagonal footfall sequences with no obvious energetic benefit associated with either option. However, out of 10 successful simulation runs, 5 were lateral sequence/lateral couplet gaits indicating a preference for a specific lateral footfall sequence with a relatively tightly constrained phase difference between the fore- and hindlimbs. This suggests that the choice of diagonal walking gaits in chimpanzees is not a simple mechanical phenomenon and that diagonal walking gaits in primates are selected for by multiple factors.

ABSTRACT: Vocal interactions, such as call exchanges or chorusing, are common behaviours in many animal species and their function has often been attributed to social bonding. However, few studies have investigated the effectiveness of vocalizations as bonding signals in comparison to other affiliative behaviours. We tested the hypothesis that male chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, pant hoot chorusing, a common behaviour in these primates, is a reliable but also flexible signal of affiliative relationships. The results of our study, conducted on the Kanyawara community of chimpanzees in Uganda, show that males were more likely to join in with the pant hoot of preferred long-term social partners to form a chorus. This supports the hypothesis that this behaviour is a good indicator of strong or long-term social bonds between male chimpanzees. However, our results also show that pant hoot chorusing reliably reflects short-term affiliations between males. For instance, male dyads were more likely to be involved in affiliative behaviours, such as reciprocated grooming, joint nonvocal displays and coalitions, on days when they chorused together, compared to days when they did not. This pattern applied to both preferred and neutral social partners. Moreover, on a short-term basis chorusing was a better indicator of other affiliative behaviours than grooming. We suggest that in male chimpanzees pant hoot choruses are efficient signals of short-term affiliative relationships. We conclude that potentially low-cost bonding behaviours such as coordinated vocal displays might be especially adaptive in highly fluid fission-fusion societies where grouping patterns are often unpredictable. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: Sleep is a vulnerable state for animals as it compromises the ability to detect predators. The evolution of shelter construction in the great apes may have been a solution to the trade-off between restorative sleep and predation-risk, which allowed a large bodied ape to sleep recumbent in a safe, comfortable spot. In this article we review the evidence of predator pressure on great apes and specifically investigate the potential influence of predation-risk on chimpanzee nesting behavior by comparing nests between chimpanzees living in a habitat of several potential predators (Issa, Ugalla, Tanzania) and a habitat relatively devoid of predators (Fongoli, Senegal). Chimpanzees in Issa did not nest more frequently in forest vegetation than chimpanzees in Fongoli although forest vegetation is expected to provide greater opportunity for escape from terrestrial predators. Nor do chimpanzees in Issa nest in larger groups or aggregate together more than Fongoli chimpanzees, as would be expected if larger groups provide protection from or greater detection of predators. Nests in Issa also did not appear to provide greater opportunities for escape than nests in Fongoli. Chimpanzees in Issa nested more frequently within the same tree as other community members, which may indicate that these chimpanzees nest in greater proximity than chimpanzees in Fongoli. Finally, Issa chimpanzees built their nests proportionately higher and more peripherally within trees. The selection of high and peripheral nesting locations within trees may make Issa chimpanzees inaccessible to potential predators. Many factors influence nest site selection in chimpanzees, of which danger from terrestrial predators is likely to be one. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Primate feeding behavior varies over long (e.g., weekly, seasonally, yearly) and short (e.g., hourly) scales of time due to changes in resource availability and the nutritional composition of foods. While the factors that affect long-term changes in feeding behavior have received considerable attention, few data exist regarding what drives variability in feeding behavior over the course of a single day. To address this problem, we investigated diurnal variation in chimpanzee feeding on the leaves of two species of saplings, Pterygota mildbraedii and Celtis africana, at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda. Specifically, we related short-term changes in chimpanzee feeding behavior on these leaves to diurnal variation in their nutritional composition. Results showed that chimpanzees fed on the leaves of both saplings more in the evening than they did in the morning. The nutritional quality of leaves also improved over the course of the day. Concentrations of cellulose and lignin were lower and total nonstructural carbohydrates (including sugars and starch) were higher in the evening for P. mildbraedii, and sugars were higher in the evening for C. africana. These data suggest that chimpanzees consume these resources when their quality is highest, and consequently, may track the nutrient composition of their foods over very short periods that span only a few hours. In the future, foods collected for analyses must control for time of sampling to ensure biologically meaningful assays of nutrient composition. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Recent research on primates and other taxa has shown that the relationships individuals form with members of the same sex affect their reproductive success. Evidence showing that intersexual relationships also influence reproduction, however, is more equivocal. Here, we show that male chimpanzees living in an exceptionally large community display long-term tendencies to associate with particular females. These association patterns are likely to arise because individuals of both sexes selectively range in specific areas of the communal territory, with males inheriting the ranging patterns of their mothers. These differentiated male-female socio-spatial relationships involved males of widely varying ranks, and their effect on reproduction is as strong as that of male dominance rank, which in turn is as strong a predictor of reproductive success at Ngogo as in other smaller chimpanzee communities. These results show that male-female socio-spatial relationships can play a large role in chimpanzee male reproductive strategies, although they probably neither weaken nor strengthen the relationship between male dominance rank and reproductive success. Our results linking male-female socio-spatial relationships to reproduction in chimpanzees suggest that the gap between the social and mating systems of humans and their closest living relatives may not be as large as previously thought. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Fruit foragers are known to use spatial memory to relocate fruit, yet it is unclear how they manage to find fruit in the first place. In this study, we investigated whether chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) in the Taï National Park make use of fruiting synchrony, the simultaneous emergence of fruit in trees of the same species, which can be used together with sensory cues, such as sight and smell, to discover fruit. We conducted observations of inspections, the visual checking of fruit availability in trees, and focused our analyses on inspections of empty trees, so to say "mistakes". Learning from their "mistakes", we found that chimpanzees had expectations of finding fruit days before feeding on it and significantly increased inspection activity after tasting the first fruit. Neither the duration of feeding nor density of fruit-bearing trees in the territory could account for the variation in inspection activity, which suggests chimpanzees did not simply develop a taste for specific fruit on which they had fed frequently. Instead, inspection activity was predicted by a botanical feature-the level of synchrony in fruit production of encountered trees. We conclude that chimpanzees make use of the synchronous emergence of rainforest fruits during daily foraging and base their expectations of finding fruit on a combination of botanical knowledge founded on the success rates of fruit discovery, and a categorization of fruit species. Our results provide new insights into the variety of food-finding strategies employed by primates and the adaptive value of categorization capacities. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Token exchange inherently introduces an element of delay between behavior and reward and so token studies may help us better understand delay of gratification and self-control. To examine this possibility, we presented three language-trained chimpanzees with repeated choices involving different foods that could be eaten immediately or lexigram (graphic symbol) tokens that represented (and could be traded for) foods later. When both options were foods, chimpanzees always chose more preferred foods over less preferred foods. When both options were lexigram tokens representing those same foods, performance remained the same as chimpanzees selected the higher value token and then traded it for food. Then, when faced with choosing a token that could be traded later or choosing a food item that could be eaten immediately, most chimpanzees learned to make whatever response led to the more preferred food. They did this even when that meant selecting a high value lexigram token that could be traded only 2 to 3 min later instead of a medium value, but immediately available, food item. Thus, chimpanzees flexibly selected tokens even though such selections necessarily delayed gratification and required forgoing immediately available food. This finding illustrates the utility of symbolic token exchange for assessing self-control in nonhuman animals. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: While Schistosoma rodhaini is typically considered a parasite of small mammals and is very scantly distributed in the Lake Victoria basin, it is known to hybridize with the more widespread Schistosoma mansoni, the causative agent of intestinal schistosomiasis. As part of broader parasitological and malacological surveys for S. mansoni across Lake Victoria, schistosome cercariae were harvested from a field-caught Biomphalaria choanomphala taken on Ngamba Island Chimpanzee Sanctuary, Uganda. Upon DNA barcoding, these cercariae were found to be a mixture of both S. rodhaini and S. mansoni, with further phylogenetic analysis revealing a hitherto unknown sub-lineage within S. rodhaini. Despite repeated sampling for eggs and miracidia from both chimpanzees and staff on Ngamba Island Sanctuary, detection of S. rodhaini within local definitive hosts awaits additional efforts, which should be mindful of a potential host role of spotted-necked otters. © American Society of Parasitologists 2012.

ABSTRACT: The anatomical comparative studies among the primates are important for the investigation of ethology, evolution, taxonomy, and comprehension of tools by hominoids. Especially the anatomical knowledge of Cebus contributes to conservation of the species, and to development of surgical procedures and clinical treatments of these animals, as they frequently are victims of automobile accidents. Recent anatomical studies came to a wrong conclusion regarding behavioral traits of Cebus, ascribed to few data available in previous literature. Therefore, to provide anatomical data and to support the other sciences related to anatomy, and to develop surgical and/or clinical procedures, we described the nerves of the legs of Cebus foccusing on their position and trajectory, as wll as innerved muscles, and compared these results with those of humans and other primates. Eight adult capuchin specimens were used for this study. The anatomical comparative study of the leg's nerves of Cebus demonstrated that, in general, structural organization of the nerves is similar among the four primates analyzed here (Cebus, chimpanzees, baboons and humans), which might be attributed to the fact that the all four primates have similar body structures. However, nerve trajectory and muscles innervation in Cebus was more similar to baboons.

ABSTRACT: Studies of primate lentiviruses continue to provide information about the evolution of simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) and the origin and emergence of HIV since chimpanzees in west-central Africa (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) were recognized as the reservoir of SIVcpzPtt viruses, which have been related phylogenetically to HIV-1. Using in-house peptide ELISAs to study SIV prevalence, we tested 104 wild-born captive chimpanzees from Gabon and Congo. We identified two new cases of SIVcpz infection in Gabon and characterized a new SIVcpz strain, SIVcpzPtt-Gab4. The complete sequence (9093 bp) was obtained by a PCR-based 'genome walking' approach to generate 17 overlapping fragments. Phylogenetic analyses of separated genes (gag, pol-vif and env-nef) showed that SIVcpzPtt-Gab4 is closely related to SIVcpzPtt-Gab1 and SIVcpzPtt-Gab2. No significant variation in viral load was observed during 3 years of follow-up, but a significantly lower CD4+ T cells count was found in infected than in uninfected chimpanzees (p<0.05). No clinical symptoms of SIV infection were observed in the SIV-positive chimpanzees. Further field studies with non-invasive methods are needed to determine the prevalence, geographic distribution, species association, and natural history of SIVcpz strains in the chimpanzee habitat in Gabon. © 2012 Souquière et al.

ABSTRACT: Cardiovascular disease is a primary cause of morbidity and mortality in captive chimpanzees. Four years of blood pressure (BP) data were analyzed from a captive former laboratory population of 201 healthy adult chimpanzees with assessment of age and obesity on elevated BP. Five different measures of obesity were compared: abdominal girth, basal metabolic rate, body-mass index (BMI), body weight, and surface area. Systolic BP varied by sex. Obesity did not influence male BP. For females, obesity was a significant determinant of BP. The best measure of female obesity was basal metabolic rate and the worst was BMI. Median systolic BP of healthy weight females (<54.5 kg) was significantly lower (128 mmHg) than overweight or obese females (140 mmHg), but both were lower than all males (147 mmHg). For diastolic BP, neither sex nor any of the five obesity measures was significant. But age was highly significant, with geriatric chimpanzees (>30 years) having higher median diastolic BP (74 mmHg) than young adults of 10-29 years of age (65 mmHg). By these criteria, 80% of this population is normotensive, 7% prehypertensive, and 13% hypertensive. In summary, systolic BP intervals required adjustment for obesity among females but not males. Diastolic BP required adjustment for advanced age (≥30 years). Use of these reference intervals can facilitate timely clinical care of captive chimpanzees. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: We examined the perceptions of emergent configurations in humans and chimpanzees using a target-localization task. The stimulus display consisted of a target placed among multiple identical distractors. The target and distractors were presented either solely, within congruent contexts in which salient configurations emerge, or within incongruent contexts in which salient configurations do not emerge. We found that congruent contexts had similar facilitative effects on target localization by humans and chimpanzees, whereas similar disruptive effects emerged when the stimuli were presented within incongruent contexts. When display size was manipulated, targets under the congruent-context condition were localized in a parallel manner, but those under the no-context and incongruent-context conditions were localized in a serial manner by both species. These results suggest that both humans and chimpanzees perceive emergent configurations when targets and distractors are presented within certain congruent contexts and that they process such emergent configurations preattentively. © 2012 American Psychological Association.

ABSTRACT: The insight that animals' cognitive abilities are linked to their evolutionary history, and hence their ecology, provides the framework for the comparative approach. Despite primates renowned dietary complexity and social cognition, including cooperative abilities, we here demonstrate that cleaner wrasse outperform three primate species, capuchin monkeys, chimpanzees and orang-utans, in a foraging task involving a choice between two actions, both of which yield identical immediate rewards, but only one of which yields an additional delayed reward. The foraging task decisions involve partner choice in cleaners: they must service visiting client reef fish before resident clients to access both; otherwise the former switch to a different cleaner. Wild caught adult, but not juvenile, cleaners learned to solve the task quickly and relearned the task when it was reversed. The majority of primates failed to perform above chance after 100 trials, which is in sharp contrast to previous studies showing that primates easily learn to choose an action that yields immediate double rewards compared to an alternative action. In conclusion, the adult cleaners' ability to choose a superior action with initially neutral consequences is likely due to repeated exposure in nature, which leads to specific learned optimal foraging decision rules. © 2012 Salwiczek et al.

ABSTRACT: Humans, but not chimpanzees, punish unfair offers in ultimatum games, suggesting that fairness concerns evolved sometime after the split between the lineages that gave rise to Homo and Pan. However, nothing is known about fairness concerns in the other Pan species, bonobos. Furthermore, apes do not typically offer food to others, but they do react against theft. We presented a novel game, the ultimatum theft game, to both of our closest living relatives. Bonobos and chimpanzee 'proposers' consistently stole food from the responders' portions, but the responders did not reject any non-zero offer. These results support the interpretation that the human sense of fairness is a derived trait. © 2012 The Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: The regulation of aggression in captive animals is an important welfare concern. Captive environments typically provide limited space for animals and many species exhibit heightened aggression in response to spatial restriction. However, primates appear to regulate aggression under these conditions. These findings have led to the proposal of three models for responses to spatial density changes: the density-intensity, tension-reduction and conflict-avoidance models. Our study aimed to investigate whether spatial restriction in two groups of captive chimpanzees at the Johannesburg Zoo, South Africa, supported the hypotheses of one or more of these models. In addition, a forth model based on the coping hypothesis of stereotypic behaviour was tested. Behavioural observations of both chimpanzee groups were conducted during the nine month reconstruction of the chimpanzee exhibit, and the associated variation in spatial limitation. Both chimpanzee groups used a tension-reduction tactic to limit aggression in the outdoor environments under high spatial density. In the indoor environments, the one (orphan) group of chimpanzees adopted a tension-reduction tactic to limit aggression while the other (family) group adopted a conflict-avoidance tactic. In both groups, indoor high-density conditions generated significant increases in abnormal behaviour. Our findings provide mixed support for the tension-reduction and conflict-avoidance models, while offering no clear evidence for the density-intensity model. The outcomes suggest that the chimpanzees may also have utilised abnormal behaviour as an outlet for the stress of spatial restriction. Together with evidence from other studies, our results suggest that chimpanzees are flexible in their response to the stress of spatial restriction and may employ aggression-mediation tactics in a context dependent manner. With regard to primate welfare, our findings suggest that aggression during spatial restriction may not necessarily be as prominent a welfare concern as previously thought but redirected and abnormal behaviour may still compromise animal wellbeing under spatial restriction. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Rejections of infants among non-human primates occasionally occur in the wild as well as in captive settings. Controlled adoptions of orphans and introductions of individuals into new groups are therefore sometimes necessary in captivity. Consequently, behavioral research on integration procedures and on the acceptance of infants by adoptive mothers is much needed. In this study, the introduction and subsequent adoption were examined in an 18-month-old hand-reared chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes). The infant was introduced into an age/sex-diversified social group of conspecifics at Furuvik Zoo, Gävle, Sweden, and continuous focal data was collected during the final stage of integration, including infant care exhibited by the group members and the infant's secure base behavior. The infant was successfully integrated into the group and engaged in positive social interactions with all group members. An adult primiparous female chimpanzee formed a bond resembling a mother-infant relationship with the infant, which continues to be maintained at publication. However, the female initially showed very limited interest in the infant. It was, in fact, two other younger female group members that exhibited most infant care. The infant's secure base behavior patterns indicate that she adapted well to the new circumstances in the chimpanzee group as the integration progressed. This provides evidence that a final adopter does not necessarily initially show maternal interest and that there can be flexibility in maternal behavior in adult chimpanzee females. Moreover, the methods applied employing gradual familiarization with all the group members and the use of an integration enclosure, may have contributed to a successful result. These findings extend our knowledge of introduction procedures in captivity as well as provide information on foster mother-infant attachment in chimpanzees. © 2012 Japan Monkey Centre and Springer.

ABSTRACT: Background: Evolution of splice sites is a well-known phenomenon that results in transcript diversity during human evolution. Many novel splice sites are derived from repetitive elements and may not contribute to protein products. Here, we analyzed annotated human protein-coding exons and identified human-specific splice sites that arose after the human-chimpanzee divergence.Results: We analyzed multiple alignments of the annotated human protein-coding exons and their respective orthologous mammalian genome sequences to identify 85 novel splice sites (50 splice acceptors and 35 donors) in the human genome. The novel protein-coding exons, which are expressed either constitutively or alternatively, produce novel protein isoforms by insertion, deletion, or frameshift. We found three cases in which the human-specific isoform conferred novel molecular function in the human cells: the human-specific IMUP protein isoform induces apoptosis of the trophoblast and is implicated in pre-eclampsia; the intronization of a part of SMOX gene exon produces inactive spermine oxidase; the human-specific NUB1 isoform shows reduced interaction with ubiquitin-like proteins, possibly affecting ubiquitin pathways.Conclusions: Although the generation of novel protein isoforms does not equate to adaptive evolution, we propose that these cases are useful candidates for a molecular functional study to identify proteomic changes that might bring about novel phenotypes during human evolution. © 2012 Kim and Hahn; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Female chimpanzees exhibit exceptionally slowrates of reproduction and raise their offspring without direct paternal care. Therefore, their reproductive success depends critically on long-term access to high-quality food resources over a long lifespan. Chimpanzee communities contain multiple adult males, multiple adult females and their offspring. Because males are philopatric and jointly defend the community range while most females transfer to new communities before breeding, adult females are typically surrounded by unrelated competitors. Communities are fission-fusion societies in which individuals spend time alone or in fluid subgroups, whose size depends mostly on the abundance and distribution of food. To varying extents in different populations, females avoid direct competition by foraging alone or in small groups in distinct, but overlapping core areas within the community range towhich they showhigh fidelity. Although rates of aggression are low, females compete for space and access to food. High rank correlates with high reproductive success, and high-ranking females win direct contests for food and gain preferential access to resource-rich sites. Females are aggressive to immigrant females and even kill the newborn infants of community members. The intensity of such aggression correlates with population density. These patterns are compared to those in other species, including humans. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Complications due to uterine leiomyomata in chimpanzees have rarely been documented. Here we describe a female chimpanzee that developed severe hydronephrosis in the right kidney due to leiomyoma. Because hysterectomy did not alleviate the hydronephrosis, nephrectomy was elected. After these procedures, the chimpanzee is doing well. Leiomyomata screening programs with treatment algorithms are a useful component of a comprehensive chimpanzee program.

ABSTRACT: Recombinant adenoviral vectors (rAds) are the most potent recombinant vaccines for eliciting CD8+; T cell-mediated immunity in humans; however, prior exposure from natural adenoviral infection can decrease such responses. In this study we show low seroreactivity in humans against simian- (sAd11, sAd16) or chimpanzee-derived (chAd3, chAd63) compared with human-derived (rAd5, rAd28, rAd35) vectors across multiple geographic regions. We then compared the magnitude, quality, phenotype, and protective capacity of CD8 +; T cell responses in mice vaccinated with rAds encoding SIV Gag. Using a dose range (1 3 107-109 particle units), we defined a hierarchy among rAd vectors based on the magnitude and protective capacity of CD8+; T cell responses, from most to least, as: rAd5 and chAd3, rAd28 and sAd11, chAd63, sAd16, and rAd35. Selection of rAd vector or dose could modulate the proportion and/or frequency of IFN-γ+;TNF- α+;IL-2+; and KLRG1+;CD1272CD8 +; T cells, but strikingly ∼30-80% of memory CD8+; T cells coexpressed CD127 and KLRG1. To further optimize CD8+; T cell responses, we assessed rAds as part of prime-boost regimens. Mice primed with rAds and boosted with NYVAC generated Gag-specific responses that approached ∼60% of total CD8+; T cells at peak. Alternatively, priming with DNA or rAd28 and boosting with rAd5 or chAd3 induced robust and equivalent CD8+; T cell responses compared with prime or boost alone. Collectively, these data provide the immunologic basis for using specific rAd vectors alone or as part of prime-boost regimens to induce CD8+; T cells for rapid effector function or robust long-term memory, respectively.

ABSTRACT: Over the last century, the issue of brain lateralization in primates has been extensively investigated and debated, yet no previous study has reported eye preference in great apes. This study examined eye preference in 45 captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in response to various stimuli. Eye preference was assessed when animals looked through a hole that only accommodated one eye at an empty box, a mirror, a picture of a dog, a rubber snake, food biscuits, bananas, a rubber duck, and a video camera. Main effects of stimulus type were found for direction of eye preference, number of looks, and looking duration, but not for strength of eye preference. A left-eye bias was found for viewing the rubber snake and a right-eye bias was found for viewing the bananas, supporting theories that emotional valence may affect lateralized behaviors. In addition, a significant shift in eye preference took place from the initial look to subsequent looks when viewing the snake. These results are not consistent with previous reports of human eye preference and may reflect lateralization differences for emotional processing. No relationship between eye preference and previously recorded hand preference was found. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: An important adaptive problem for mammals in general, and primates in particular, is how females can manage the high costs of reproduction in the face of fluctuating energetic supplies. For many species, the best solution is to breed seasonally such that high costs are temporally coincident with predictable periods of resource abundance. This is an unreliable strategy for some primates, such as chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), for which large body size forces an increase in dietary complexity and prolonged reproductive efforts. Here, I review data on reproductive function in chimpanzees, a species that demonstrates a risk-averse reproductive strategy wherein reproductive investment is allocated in accordance with maternal condition. Life history parameters for chimpanzees indicate that most females produce very few surviving offspring. However, comparisons between captive and wild populations and within wild populations illustrate that variation in resource access leads to highly variable reproductive success. Focused hormonal studies have demonstrated these effects at a proximate level, with energetic influences on female dispersal, receptivity, cycle quality, conception success, and lactational amenorrhea. Downstream of these effects, female reproductive function affects sexual attractiveness, and by virtue of males' own optimal reproductive strategies, can lead to coercive aggression and decreased foraging efficiency. Because of their extreme reproductive costs, female chimpanzees utilize a highly conservative reproductive strategy, one that minimizes the costs of ecological variation but makes them vulnerable to sexual conflict and costs of sociality. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The potential of human activities, including research, to alter parasite transmission ecology in wildlife is unknown. We examined gastrointestinal parasitism in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) in Budongo Forest, Uganda. Trail use and time spent on the ground was recorded during 10 months of observations in four sites with differing human disturbance. Disturbance was quantified using transect plots (n = 320). Fecal (n = 435) samples were examined for helminth eggs, larvae, and for protozoan cysts. Individuals that spent more time on the ground had more infections and higher intensity infections. Prevalence of 13 parasite species was similar across sites, but percentage of multiple infections and infection intensity differed, as did ground use. Chimpanzees at the long-term research site spent more time on the ground or on human trails. We hypothesize that researcher presence and trail creation may influence ground use, and thereby parasite burden, by altering trade-offs between foraging and predation risk. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are susceptible to many viral and bacterial pathogens of human origin. This case series reports an acute outbreak of respiratory disease due to human respiratory syncytial virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae in a single group of 30 captive chimpanzees. Both pathogens are potentially zoonotic. The diagnosis was made antemortem and enabled a targeted response to the outbreak; but it more importantly, prompted improvements to the disease surveillance, biosecurity for risk mitigation and risk communication protocols within the zoo. A defined zoonotic disease risk communication pathway provides a model for management and compliance requirements for other collections. Copyright 2013 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Much of the debate about reciprocity in humans and other primates hinges on proximate mechanisms, or more precisely, the contingency of one service on another. While there is good evidence for long-term statistical contingencies of services given and received in primates, results for short-term behavioral contingencies are mixed. Indeed, as we show here controlled experiments using artificial tasks and explicit turn-taking were unlikely to find short-term effects. We therefore used more naturalistic experiments to test for short-term contingencies of grooming on food sharing and vice versa in one group of chimpanzees and two groups of bonobos. Overall, we found significant effects of grooming on food sharing and vice versa, however, in the chimpanzees these effects disappeared when controlling for long-term characteristics of the dyad including services exchanged over the whole study period. In the bonobos, short-term contingencies remained significant which was likely a consequence of considerable tension surrounding monopolizable food resulting in higher rates of grooming and other affiliative behaviors around sharing sessions. These results are consistent with the fact that previous evidence for short-term contingency often involved grooming and that long-term contingency is more commonly observed in primates. We propose that long-term contingency is proximately regulated by a 'relationship score' computed through a tally of past interactions which tend to outweigh recent single events. We therefore suggest that future research into the proximate mechanisms of reciprocity should trace the development of such a score by focusing on newly formed dyads with no history of interactions. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Species commonly exist in sympatry, yet ecological studies are often based on a single species approach while ignoring the impact of sympatric competitors. Over 13 mo we used 24 remote video-camera traps to monitor habitat use of sympatric chimpanzee, gorilla and elephant in four different habitat types in Loango National Park, Gabon. Habitat use by each species was predicted to vary according to seasonal changes in food availability and precipitation. Increased interspecific competition between the three species was expected at times of reduced resource availability, leading to exclusion of the inferior competitor. Supporting the predictions, species abundance per habitat showed seasonal variation: all three species responded positively to increased fruit availability in all habitats, but the response was only significant for gorilla in mature forest and elephant in coastal forest. Responses to rainfall varied, with the chimpanzee responding negatively to rainfall in swamp forest, the gorilla responding positively to rainfall in coastal and secondary forest, and the elephant responding positively to rainfall in mature forest. Elephant presence resulted in competitive exclusion of the apes under certain conditions: the chimpanzee was excluded by the elephant where fruit availability was low, whereas the gorilla was excluded by the elephant in areas of low herb density despite high fruit availability. Our results emphasize the value of applying a multi-species, longer-term approach to studying variation in habitat use among sympatric species and highlight the impact competitors can exert on one another's distribution. © Cambridge University Press 2012.

ABSTRACT: Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) in wildlife are major threats both to human health and to biodiversity conservation. An estimated 71. 8 % of zoonotic EID events are caused by pathogens in wildlife and the incidence of such diseases is increasing significantly in humans. In addition, human diseases are starting to infect wildlife, especially non-human primates. The chimpanzee is an endangered species that is threatened by human activity such as deforestation, poaching, and human disease transmission. Recently, several respiratory disease outbreaks that are suspected of having been transmitted by humans have been reported in wild chimpanzees. Therefore, we need to study zoonotic pathogens that can threaten captive chimpanzees in primate research institutes. Serological surveillance is one of several methods used to reveal infection history. We examined serum from 14 captive chimpanzees in Japanese primate research institutes for antibodies against 62 human pathogens and 1 chimpanzee-borne infectious disease. Antibodies tested positive against 29 pathogens at high or low prevalence in the chimpanzees. These results suggest that the proportions of human-borne infections may reflect the chimpanzee's history, management system in the institute, or regional epidemics. Furthermore, captive chimpanzees are highly susceptible to human pathogens, and their induced antibodies reveal not only their history of infection, but also the possibility of protection against human pathogens. © 2012 Japan Monkey Centre and Springer.

ABSTRACT: Previous studies have shown a strong correspondence between long bone bilateral asymmetry and reported handedness. Here, we compare the pattern of asymmetry in mechanical properties of the humerus and second metacarpal of Pan troglodytes, recent British industrial and medieval populations, and a broad range of human hunter-gatherers, to test whether technological variation corresponds with lateralization in bone function. The results suggest that P. troglodytes are left-lateralized in the morphology of the humerus and right-lateralized in the second metacarpal, while all human populations are predominantly right-biased in the morphology of these bones. Among human populations, the second metacarpals of 63% of hunter-gatherers show right-hand bias, a frequency similar to that found among chimpanzees. In contrast, the medieval and recent British populations show over 80% right-lateralization in the second metacarpal. The proportion of individuals displaying right-directional asymmetry is less than the expected 90% among all human groups. The variation observed suggests that the human pattern of right-biased asymmetry developed in a mosaic manner throughout human history, perhaps in response to technological development. © 2013 New York Academy of Sciences.

ABSTRACT: Great apes spend half of their lives in a nightly "nest" or sleeping platform (SP), a complex object created by modifying foliage, which functions as a stable substrate on which to sleep. Of the several purported functions of SPs, one hypothesis is that they protect against parasitic infection. Here we investigate the role of SP site choice in avoiding molestation by arthropods. This study presents preliminary data on the insect-repellent properties of preferred sleeping tree species Cynometra alexandri. Insect traps were deployed in gallery forest habitats in which chimpanzees typically "nest." We compared traps placed adjacent to SPs artificially manufactured with C. alexandri trees to an open area within the same habitat. Multiple measures of arthropod counts indicate that simulated C. alexandri SP sites have fewer arthropods than similar non-SP sites. Volatile compounds secreted by C. alexandri foliage are hypothesized to repel annoying arthropods and/or mask chimpanzee olfactory signals. Of the total insects captured (n = 6,318), n = 145 were mosquitoes. Of the total mosquitoes captured, n = 47 were identified as Anopheles (female, n = 12). The prominent malarial vector Anopheles gambiae was identified among the captured mosquito sample. These results suggest that the presence of broken branches of the tree species C. alexandri reduce the amount of insects a chimpanzee is exposed to throughout a night's sleep. This great ape behavioral and socio-technological adaptation may have evolved, in part, to increase quality of sleep as well as decrease exposure to vectors of disease. © 2012 Japan Monkey Centre and Springer.

ABSTRACT: Tanzania is located at the southeastern end of the eastern chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) distribution. Except for two national parks, their habitats have been degraded due to human activities. To clarify the gene flow and genetic diversity of chimpanzees in Tanzania, we analyzed the mitochondrial sequences of chimpanzees in six sites (Lwazi, Wansisi, Mahale, Karobwa, Ugalla-Masito, and Gombe), some of which are now isolated. The southernmost habitat (Lwazi) was about 150 km away from the nearest habitat but, considering the geographic distance, the genetic distance of the chimpanzees between Lwazi and the other habitats was not high. In contrast, the genetic distance between the chimpanzees in the northernmost habitat (Gombe), and the other habitats was relatively high considering the geographic distance. The results suggest that the Malagarasi River, which runs between Gombe and the southern habitats, limits gene flow. The genetic difference analyses also suggest that the habitats of Wansisi, Mahale, Karobwa, and Ugalla-Masito can be regarded as one population ("Greater Mahale"). The genetic distance between Lwazi and Gombe was lower than that between Gombe and the Greater Mahale habitats. This result suggests that early chimpanzees came to the Greater Mahale habitats through the southern habitats around Lwazi. The nucleotide diversity was not different from that in other countries, probably due to the sequence variety. There were unique haplotypes in several habitats where the number of chimpanzees was estimated to be small, which implies that some haplotypes are probably be at risk of disappearing. These data will be useful for conservation planning.

ABSTRACT: Coalitionary aggression occurs when at least two individuals jointly direct aggression at one or more conspecific targets. Scientists have long argued that this common form of cooperation has positive fitness consequences. Nevertheless, despite evidence that social bond strength (which is thought to promote coalition formation) is correlated with fitness in primates, cetaceans, and ungulates, few studies have directly examined whether coalitionary aggression improves reproductive success. We tested the hypothesis that among free-ranging chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii), participation in coalitionary aggression increases reproductive output. Using 14 years of genetic and behavioral data from Gombe National Park, Tanzania, we found that coalitionary aggression increased a male's chances of (A) siring offspring, compared to other males of similar dominance rank, and (B) ascending in rank, a correlate of future reproductive output. Because male chimpanzees form coalitions with many others within a complex network, we used social network analysis to identify the types of connections correlated with these fitness benefits. The beneficiaries of coalitionary aggression were males with the highest "betweenness"-that is, those who tended to have coalition partners who themselves did not form coalitions with each other. This suggests that beyond simply recognizing third-party relationships, chimpanzees may use this knowledge to choose coalition partners. If so, this is a significant step forward in our knowledge of the adaptive value of social intelligence. Regardless of mechanism, however, this is the first evidence of genetic benefits of coalitionary aggression in this species, and therefore has important implications for understanding the evolution of cooperation. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: The interferon-induced host restriction factor tetherin poses a barrier for SIV transmission from primates to humans. After cross-species transmission, the chimpanzee precursor of pandemic HIV-1 switched from the accessory protein Nef to Vpu to effectively counteract human tetherin. As we report here, the experimental reintroduction of HIV-1 into its original chimpanzee host resulted in a virus that can use both Vpu and Nef to antagonize chimpanzee tetherin. Functional analyses demonstrated that alterations in and near the highly conserved ExxxLL motif in the C-terminal loop of Nef were critical for the reacquisition of antitetherin activity. Strikingly, just two amino acid changes allowed HIV-1 Nef to counteract chimpanzee tetherin and promote virus release. Our data demonstrate that primate lentiviruses can reacquire lost accessory gene functions during a single in vivo passage and suggest that other functional constraints keep Nef ready to regain antitetherin activity. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Across Africa, chimpanzees prey on army ants, typically using stick tools. Population differences in predation patterns reflect environmental as well as sociocultural factors. However, as for ecological constraints, we lack information about how the ants' defensive response unfolds over the course of a predatory attempt and how this influences chimpanzee reward. We studied these aspects of insectivory in the habitat of Nigerian chimpanzees through field experiments with previously used tools. The speed with which ants run up a tool decreased continuously during experimental dips into nests. This suggests that soldiers with long legs run up the tools first, before fanning out to deter the intruder. Workers attacking later on were increasingly smaller, thus running less fast. Yet, because more and more insects join the defence, harvesting yield (g dry weight) steadily increased for the first 17min, to then drop markedly. We hypothesize that the length of dipping sessions by wild chimpanzees is limited by either diminishing return or discomfort caused by being continually bitten. Actual harvesting success cannot be reconstructed from ant remains in chimpanzee faeces without knowing what proportion of consumed insects is detectable in excreta. Through human self-experiments, we found that only 10% of ingested ants are found in a subsequent excretion. Based on counts of ant heads in chimpanzee faeces, this translates into 12.9g dry weight ingested per dipping session, which is far more than elsewhere. Although prey availability and harvesting technique varies across sites, our data still suggest a much greater yield for Nigeria. One reason for this may be a particular aggressiveness of Dorylus rubellus. While this is the only army ant species preyed upon in Nigeria, it is not regularly eaten elsewhere. Standardized experiments and faecal analyses across study sites will be necessary to better understand how ecological constraints influence chimpanzee myrmecophagy. © 2012 The Zoological Society of London.

ABSTRACT: Blockade of inhibitory molecules such as PD-1 and IL-10 has been developing to overcome immune tolerance in chronic disease. Here, we report the first evaluation of the safety and efficacy of a therapeutic DNA vaccine following pretreatment of PD-1/IL-10R blockades in two chronically HCV-infected chimpanzees. Both chimpanzees exhibited no significant changes in body weight, liver enzymes, hematological or biochemical parameters after six treatments with HCV DNA vaccine ( 36mg in total ) following three-times administration of DNAs encoding sPD-1-hyFc and sIL-10R-hyFc ( 36 mg in total ), indicating that DNA vaccine with electroporation is very safe. Blocking of PD-1 and IL-10R pathways did not affect HCV-specific T cell responses, viral load, or LDL cholesterol levels in either chimpanzee. However, it transiently induced the elevation of cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-10, G-CSF, IFN-α and TNF-α), but not chemokines, in 98A002, but not in X140. Interestingly, in that chimpanzee, HCV DNA vaccine also appeared to induce HCV-specific T cell responses. These results provide new insight for the immunological status of HCV-infected host in the development of therapeutic vaccine.

ABSTRACT: The popularity of nonreplicating adenoviruses of chimpanzee origin (ChAdVs) as vectors for subunit vaccines is on the rise. This is mainly for their excellent safety and impressive immunogenicity observed in human studies to date. Here, we recloned the chimpanzee adenovirus sero type 68 (ChAdV-68), also designated SAdV-25 and AdC68, genome and demonstrated its straightforward genetic manipulation facilitated by the use of bacterial artificial chromosome recombineering. To generate the ChAdV68.GagB vaccine, the HIV-1 consensus clade B Gag-derived Tg was inserted into the E1 region. In part confirming previous observations, the ChAdV68.GagB vaccine alone and in heterologous prime-boost regimens with plasmid DNA- and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA)-vectored vaccines induced robust polyfunctional HIV-1-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses with a gut-homing phenotype. Importantly, we showed that when a single epitope is expressed as an immunodominant CD8+ T-cell determinant, responses elicited by ChAdV68.GagB alone and in combination lowered surrogate challenge EcoHIV/NDK (where EcoHIV is chimeric ecotropic HIV) virus load in mice both at the peak T-cell frequencies 2 weeks after vaccination and 16 weeks later indicating development of protective effector memory. These results parallel the immunogenicity of similar vaccine regimens in macaques and an ongoing phase I/IIa trial in humans, and support further development of vaccines vectored by ChAdVs. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

ABSTRACT: The Challenge Hypothesis proposes that testosterone mediates aggression during periods of heightened conflict between males, especially episodes that have important fitness consequences. Considerable evidence from seasonally breeding species provides support for this hypothesis, but few data exist in animals that mate year-round. We tested predictions generated by the Challenge Hypothesis in chimpanzees, a non-seasonally breeding primate, through a study of individuals living in an exceptionally large community at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda. Results indicated that dominance rank had no influence on testosterone levels. Instead of rank influencing testosterone production, additional analyses revealed an important role for reproductive competition. Male chimpanzees displayed more aggression when they were in the same party as parous estrous females than when reproductively active females were unavailable. Male chimpanzees competed more intensely for mating opportunities with parous females than with nulliparas, and as a consequence, males displayed more aggression around the former than the latter. When males accompanied parous estrous females, their urinary testosterone concentrations were significantly higher than baseline concentrations. In contrast, urinary testosterone concentrations did not exceed baseline when males associated with nulliparous estrous females. These differences in testosterone levels could not be attributed to mating per se because males copulated equally often with parous and nulliparous females. Furthermore, variation in testosterone concentrations were not due to males gathering together in large parties, as their levels in these situations did not exceed baseline. Taken together, these findings, derived from a relatively large sample of males and estrous females, replicate those from a prior study and furnish additional support for the Challenge Hypothesis. Our results suggest that the Challenge Hypothesis is likely to be broadly applicable to chimpanzees and increase our understanding of the physiological costs to males who compete for estrous females. © 2012 Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: Predatory behavior in wild chimpanzees and other primates has been well documented over the last 30 years. However, as it is an opportunistic behavior, conditions which may promote such behavior are left up to chance. Until now, predatory behavior among captive chimpanzees has been poorly documented. In this paper, we present five instances providing evidence of predatory behavior: four performed by isolated individuals and one carried out in cooperation. The evidence of group predation involved the chimpanzees adopting different roles as pursuers and ambushers. Prey was partially eaten in some cases, but not in the social episode. This study confirms that naturalistic environments allow chimpanzees to enhance species-typical behavioral patterns. © 2010 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: We constructed the significant low-expression P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) inhibited transport and signal network in chimpanzee compared with high-expression (fold change ≥2) the human left cerebrum in GEO data set, by using integration of gene regulatory activated and inhibited network inference method with gene ontology (GO) analysis. Our result showed that ABCB1 transport and signal upstream network RAB2A inhibited ABCB1, and downstream ABCB1-inhibited SMAD1_2, NCK2, SLC25A46, GDF10, RASGRP1, EGFR, LRPPRC, RASSF2, RASA4, CA2, CBLB, UBR5, SLC25A16, ITGB3BP, DDIT4, PDPN, RAB2A in chimpanzee left cerebrum. We obtained that the different biological processes of ABCB1 inhibited transport and signal network repressed carbon dioxide transport, ER to Golgi vesicle-mediated transport, folic acid transport, mitochondrion transport along microtubule, water transport, BMP signaling pathway, Ras protein signal transduction, transforming growth factor beta receptor signaling pathway in chimpanzee compared with the inhibited network of the human left cerebrum, as a result of inducing inhibition of mitochondrion transport along microtubule and BMP signal-induced cell shape in chimpanzee left cerebrum. Our hypothesis was verified by the same and different biological processes of ABCB1 inhibited transport and signal network of chimpanzee compared with the corresponding activated network of chimpanzee and the human left cerebrum, respectively. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd..

ABSTRACT: Among cultural behaviors of chimpanzees, the developmental processes of complex skills involved in tool use are relatively well known. However, few studies have examined the ontogeny of social customs that do not require complex skills. Thus, in this study, we describe the developmental process of the grooming hand-clasp (GHC), one of the well-known social customs of chimpanzees at Mahale. We have collected 383 cases of GHC where at least one of the participants was 15 years old or younger during 1994-2007. First performances of GHC with the mother were observed at around 4-6 years old; the earliest observed age was 4 years and 4 months old. The first performances of GHC with nonrelated females were at around age 9 years, and those with adult males at around 11 years. However, some orphans engaged in GHC earlier than nonorphans. By gradually expanding GHC partners from the mother to other females and then to males, chimpanzees increased the number of GHC partners with age. Young males were observed to perform GHC with larger numbers of partners than were young females. GHC by young chimpanzees was shorter in duration than that among adults. Overall, the ontogeny of GHC showed several dissimilarities with that of tool use and was more an extension of the development of typical grooming behavior. For example, infants did not try to perform GHC initially; instead, mothers were more active in the earliest stages. These results suggest that not all socially learned cultural behaviors are acquired in the way of learning tool use. There may be various ways of learning behavioral patterns that are performed continuously in a group and that consequently comprise culture in chimpanzees. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The emergence of technology has been suggested to coincide with scarcity of staple resources that led to innovations in the form of tool-assisted strategies to diversify or augment typical diets. We examined seasonal patterns of several types of tool use exhibited by a chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) population residing in central Africa, to determine whether their technical skills provided access to fallback resources when preferred food items were scarce. Chimpanzees in the Goualougo Triangle exhibit a diverse repertoire of tool behaviours, many of which are exhibited throughout the year. Further, they have developed specific tool sets to overcome the issues of accessibility to particular food items. Our conclusion is that these chimpanzees use a sophisticated tool technology to cope with seasonal changes in relative food abundance and gain access to high-quality foods. Subgroup sizes were smaller in tool using contexts than other foraging contexts, suggesting that the size of the social group may not be as important in promoting complex tool traditions as the frequency and type of social interactions. Further, reports from other populations and species showed that tool use may occur more often in response to ecological opportunities and relative profitability of foraging techniques than scarcity of resources. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: In humans, clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with genetic variation near the IL-28B gene and the induction of interferon-stimulated genes, like IP-10. Also in chimpanzees spontaneous clearance of HCV is observed. To study whether similar correlations exist in these animals, a direct comparison of IP-10 and IL-28B polymorphism between chimpanzees and patients was performed. All chimpanzees studied were monomorphic for the human IL-28B SNPs which are associated with spontaneous and treatment induced HCV clearance in humans. As a result, these particular SNPs cannot be used for clinical association studies in chimpanzees. Although these human SNPs were absent in chimpanzees, gene variation in this region was present however, no correlation was observed between different SNP-genotypes and HCV outcome. Strikingly, IP-10 levels in chimpanzees correlated with HCV-RNA load and γGT, while such correlations were not observed in humans. The correlation between IP-10, γGT and virus load in chimpanzees was not found in patients and may be due to the lack of lifestyle-related confounding factors in chimpanzees. Direct comparison of IP-10 and IL-28B polymorphism between chimpanzees and patients in relation to HCV infection, illustrates that the IFN-pathways are important during HCV infection in both species. The Genbank EMBL accession numbers assigned to chimpanzees specific sequences near the IL-28B gene are HE599784 and HE599785. © 2012 Verstrepen et al.

ABSTRACT: The notion of a biological marketplace as a framework for explaining cooperative acts among animals is well supported. However, direct evidence for a biological market in a mating context is limited to a handful of studies. We collected data over a 3-year period to test supply/demand predictions of male grooming of swollen females according to a biological market in captive chimpanzees while controlling for other potential interchange. Females received more grooming from and gave less grooming to males when swollen than when not swollen, with parous females receiving more grooming from males than nulliparous females. The central tenet of a biological market that the market value of a commodity should vary according to its availability was supported. Males groomed swollen females less as the availability of swollen females in the group increased. There was also an effect of male dominance rank such that higher ranking males groomed swollen females less than lower ranking males. Taken together, our findings provide evidence for male grooming of swollen females according to a biological market while controlling for potential confounds. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: We monitored chimpanzee welfare during the introduction of on-exhibit cognitive research training and testing, as measured by behavior and interest in such training, and related individual variation to personality assessments. We observed 11 chimpanzees (six males; five females) over a 16-month period and compared their behavior across three conditions: (1) Baseline (nontraining/research situations) and (2) an on-going, off-exhibit program of Husbandry Training and (3) Research Pod Activities, on-exhibit, group training for cognitive testing. There was considerable individual variation in their interest levels during research sessions; females and those scoring higher for Openness were present more frequently (including those who actively participated and those who observed others participating), but interest did not vary in relation to rates of self-directed behaviors (SDBs), rank, or the level of social disruptions within the group (i.e. large-scale displays or fights). The frequency of SDBs was predicted by the Neuroticism personality factor, but did not differ across baseline and training contexts, indicating that these activities do not negatively impact welfare. We also explored vigilance as an indicator of social uncertainty, but social monitoring did not differ in relation to either social context or rank. Finally, we explored how the specific characteristics of the research context impacted on SDBs; namely, social context, reward contingency, and visual access to keepers. SDBs increased only when visual access to keepers was restricted, suggesting that visual contact reduced uncertainty in novel training contexts. Overall, the introduction of a cognitive research program did not compromise welfare, and the chimpanzees' repeated interest and willingness to participate suggests that the research was enriching. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Knowing how habitat determines the distribution of great apes is essential for understanding their ecology and conservation requirements. Habitats in the northern Lac Tumba Landscape where this study was conducted are mostly swamp and flooded forests, which types have been overlooked in many great ape surveys. This study describes and discusses patterns of bonobo and chimpanzee nesting sites across these habitat types in the general scope of habitat use by great apes. Considerable efforts were deployed to survey forests of the Ngiri Triangle (186 km), Bomongo-Lubengo (126 km) and Bolombo-Losombo (112 km). Great ape nesting site encounter rates (r) were calculated for Bonobos (r = 0.21 nesting sites km -1; Bolombo-Losombo), chimpanzees (r = 0.11 nesting sites km -1; Ngiri Triangle) and (r = 0.02 nesting sites km -1; Bomongo-Lubengo). Swamps and flooded forests dominated the three zones. Nesting sites were at the highest encounter rates in flooded forests; both great ape species were significantly associated with swampy and flood forests. Human signs did not influence the occurrence of nesting sites in these forests. These results confirm findings from other sites where great apes were observed using swamps; they suggest that future surveys include these types of habitat to avoid under-estimating population sizes. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Six strains, TKU 25, TKU 28, TKU 30, TKU 31T, TKU 33 and TKU 34, were isolated from the oral cavity of a chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes). Colonies of strains grown on Mitis-Salivarius agar were similar in morphology to that of Streptococcus mutans. The novel strains were Gram-stainpositive, facultatively anaerobic cocci that lacked catalase activity. Analysis of the partial 16S rRNA gene sequences of these isolates showed that the most closely related strain was the type strain of S. mutans (96.4%). The next closely related strains to the isolates were the type strains of Streptococcus devriesei (94.5%) and Streptococcus downei (93.9%). These isolates could be distinguished from S. mutans by inulin fermentation and alkaline phosphatase activity (API ZYM system). The peptidoglycan type of the novel isolates was Glu-Lys-Ala3. Strains were not susceptible to bacitracin. On the basis of phenotypic characterization, partial 16S rRNA gene and two housekeeping gene (groEL and sodA) sequence data, we propose a novel taxon, Streptococcus troglodytae sp. nov.; the type strain is TKU 31T (=JCM 18038T=DSM 25324T). © 2013 IUMS.

ABSTRACT: Parental provisioning of offspring is an intensive energetic investment that is expected to compromise future offspring production. This trade-off is particularly salient for mammals in which mothers bear the exclusive burden of lactation and draw from their own energy reserves to provision offspring. The degree to which lactation impacts future reproductive ability should vary not only by the absolute cost of milk production but also by the ability of individual mothers to afford it. Few studies have been able to quantify the costs of lactation or how they affect reproductive rates. Here, we examine the metabolic load of lactation in chimpanzees, a species with intensive parental investment and extremely slow reproductive rates. We used urinary C-peptide of insulin to trace changes in energetic condition in 17 wild, unprovisioned chimpanzee mothers in Kibale National Park, Uganda. C-peptide levels of nursing mothers were depressed for six months postpartum, thereafter showing a net increase through the second year. These changes are consistent with milestones of infant physical and behavioral development. Mothers inhabiting lower quality foraging areas experienced a higher metabolic load of lactation, as indicated by lower C-peptide profiles than mothers in food-rich areas. Ovarian activity was closely correlated with energetic condition. Cycling resumed only after a sustained period of energy gain, suggesting that the slow reproductive pattern in wild chimpanzees results not only from the direct expense of milk production but also from the long period that mothers require to recover their physical condition in a food-limited environment. © 2012 The Author.

ABSTRACT: We examined hand preference in the intentional gestural communication of wild chimpanzees in the Budongo forest, Uganda. Individuals showed some tendency to be lateralized, although less than has been reported for begging and pointing gestures in captivity; on average, their absolute bias was around 0.25 (where 1.0 represents complete right- or left-hand use and 0.0 represents no bias). Lateralization was incomplete even in individuals with major manual disabilities. Where individuals had a stronger preference, this was more often toward the right hand; moreover, as age increased, the direction (but not the extent) of hand preference shifted toward the right. While the gestural repertoire as a whole was largely employed ambilateraly, object-manipulation gestures showed a strong right-hand bias. © 2013 New York Academy of Sciences.

ABSTRACT: Although testosterone (T) has well known organizational and activational effects on aggression, the relationship between the two is not always clear. The challenge hypothesis addresses this problem by proposing that T will affect aggression only in fitness-enhancing situations. One way to test the challenge hypothesis is to examine the relationship between T and different types of aggression. Chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, show aggressive behaviours in several contexts and provide an opportunity for such a test. Here we show that urinary T influences a form of male chimpanzee reproductive aggression, territorial boundary patrols. In contrast, T does not affect predatory behaviour, a form of aggression that has no immediate link to male reproduction. While these results are consistent with the challenge hypothesis, our results indicate that male chimpanzees experience a significant drop in urinary T during hunts. Additional analyses reveal that males who share meat with others display this decrease. The reason for this decrement is unclear, but we hypothesize that the relative lack of aggression that results from voluntary sharing episodes and the tolerance engendered by such acts may be contributory factors. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: A facultative anaerobic, non-motile, non-spore-forming, Gram-positive-staining, coccus-shaped bacterium was isolated from an abscess on the right foot of a chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes). The colonies were β-haemolytic. Catalase and oxidase activities were negative. The Lancefield group B antigen was expressed. On the basis of morphological and biochemical characteristics, the bacterium was tentatively identified as a streptococcal species. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that the bacterium shared 96.7%, 96.4%, 96.1%, 95.8% and 95.7% sequence similarities with Streptococcus gordonii, S. cristatus, S. intermedius, S. anginosus and S. constellatus, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses based on the sequences of the 16S rRNA gene and housekeeping genes encoding D-alanine: D-alanine ligase (ddl), the β-subunit of RNA polymerase (rpoB) and manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase (sodA) revealed that the bacterium represented a novel species closely related to, albeit different from, S. gordonii, S. cristatus and the anginosus streptococci. The name Streptococcus troglodytidis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is M09-11185T (5ATCC BAA-2337T5KCTC 33006T). © 2013 IUMS.

ABSTRACT: Dominance relationships are common among primates, and are usually the result of resource competition. Adult male chimpanzees have pronounced dominance relationships, and can be ranked relative to one another in dominance hierarchies. Adult male chimpanzees achieve, and maintain, high rank through a combination of physical size, strength and political ability. Dominance in male chimpanzees has very real benefits as high-ranking males have priority access to resources and potential mates, and father more offspring than do low-ranking conspecifics. Previous research has suggested that adolescent male chimpanzees do not have dominance relationships with each other. Here, I report the first evidence of decided dominance relationships and a linear dominance hierarchy in adolescent male chimpanzees from an unusually large community of wild chimpanzees at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda. © 2012 S.

ABSTRACT: Abstract A main concern of farmers worldwide is how to reduce crop losses to wildlife. Some potentially lethal crop protection methods are non-selective. It is important to understand the impact of such methods on species of conservation concern. Uganda has important populations of Endangered eastern chimpanzees Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii. Farmers sometimes use large metal mantraps to guard their fields against crop-raiding wildlife, particularly baboons Papio anubis and wild pigs Potamochoerus sp.. Chimpanzees that range onto farmland also step in these illegal devices and without rapid veterinary invention face severe injury or eventual death. Unlike inadvertent snaring of great apes in African forests, the problem of mantraps in forest-farm ecotones has received little attention. We report 10 cases of entrapped chimpanzees in the cultivated landscape surrounding Uganda's Budongo Forest during 2007-2011, undoubtedly only a portion of the actual number of cases. Mantraps currently present a substantial threat to ape populations in this important conservation landscape. Our data underscore the need for conservation programmes to consider the techniques used by rural farmers to protect their livelihoods from wild animals. © 2012 Fauna & Flora International.

ABSTRACT: Menopause in women occurs at mid-life. Chimpanzees, in contrast, continue to display cycles of menstrual bleeding and genital swelling, suggestive of ovulation, until near their maximum life span of about 60 years. Because ovulation was not confirmed hormonally, however, the age at which chimpanzees experience menopause has remained uncertain. In the present study, we provide hormonal data from urine samples collected from 30 female chimpanzees, of which 9 were old (>30 years), including 2 above the age of 50 years. Eight old chimpanzees showed clear endocrine evidence of ovulation, as well as cycles of genital swelling that correlated closely with measured endocrine changes. Endocrine evidence thus confirms prior observations (cyclic anogenital swelling) that menopause is a late-life event in the chimpanzee. We also unexpectedly discovered an idiopathic anovulation in some young and middle-aged chimpanzees; this merits further study. Because our results on old chimpanzees validate the use of anogenital swelling as a surrogate index of ovulation, we were able to combine data on swelling and urinary hormones to provide the first estimates of age-specific rates of menopause in chimpanzees. We conclude that menopause occurs near 50 years of age in chimpanzees as it does in women. Our finding identifies a basic difference between the human and chimpanzee aging processes: female chimpanzees can remain reproductively viable for a greater proportion of their life span than women. Thus, while menopause marks the end of the chimpanzee's life span, women may thrive for decades more. © American Aging Association 2011.

ABSTRACT: The chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) is well-known in both nature and captivity as an impressive maker and user of tools, but recently the New Caledonian crow (Corvus moneduloides) has been championed as being equivalent or superior to the ape in elementary technology. I systematically compare the two taxa, going beyond simple presence/absence scoring of tool-using and -making types, on four more precise aspects of material culture: (i) types of associative technology (tools used in combination); (ii) modes of tool making; (iii) modes of tool use; and (iv) functions of tool use. I emphasize tool use in nature, when performance is habitual or customary, rather than in anecdotal or idiosyncratic. On all four measures, the ape shows more variety than does the corvid, especially in modes and functions that go beyond extractive foraging. However, more sustained field research is required on the crows before this contrast is conclusive. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: We employed a bottom-up, quantitative method to investigate great ape handedness. Our previous investigation of gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) demonstrated that contextual information influenced an individual's handedness toward target objects. Specifically, we found a significant right-hand bias for unimanual actions directed toward inanimate target objects but not for actions directed to animate target objects (Forrester et al. in Anim Cogn 14(6):903-907, 2011). Using the identical methodological technique, we investigated the spontaneous hand actions of nine captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) during naturalistic, spontaneous behavior. We assessed both the frequencies and proportions of lateralized hand actions directed toward animate and inanimate targets employing focal follow video sampling. Like the gorillas, the chimpanzees demonstrated a right-handed bias for actions directed toward inanimate targets, but not toward animate targets. This pattern was evident at the group level and for the majority of subjects at the individual level. We postulate that a right-hand bias for only inanimate targets reflects the left hemisphere's dominant neural processing capabilities for objects that have functional properties (inanimate objects). We further speculate that a population-level right-hand bias is not a human-unique characteristic, but one that was inherited from a common human-ape ancestor. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: Background: African catarrhine primates differ in bacterial disease susceptibility. Methods: Human, chimpanzee, and baboon blood were stimulated with TLR-detected bacterial agonists and cytokine/chemokine induction assessed by real-time PCR. Results: Humans and chimpanzees shared similar cytokine/chemokine responses, while baboon cytokine/chemokine induction differed. Generally, responses were agonist independent. Conclusions: These primates tend to generate species rather than agonist-specific responses to bacterial agonists. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

ABSTRACT: Recent research suggests that gorillas' and orangutans' object representations survive cohesion violations (e. g., a split of a solid object into two halves), but that their processing of quantities may be affected by them. We assessed chimpanzees' (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos' (Pan paniscus) reactions to various fission events in the same series of action tasks modelled after infant studies previously run on gorillas and orangutans (Cacchione and Call in Cognition 116:193-203, 2010b). Results showed that all four non-human great ape species managed to quantify split objects but that their performance varied as a function of the non-cohesiveness produced in the splitting event. Spatial ambiguity and shape invariance had the greatest impact on apes' ability to represent and quantify objects. Further, we observed species differences with gorillas performing lower than other species. Finally, we detected a substantial age effect, with ape infants below 6 years of age being outperformed by both juvenile/adolescent and adult apes. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: Previous studies showed that in modern humans the basicranium is formed of two modules: the midline cranial base and the lateral basicranium which are integrated with the face in very different ways. The study of the relationship between these structures is of prime interest in the context of hominids craniofacial evolutionary history. In this study, we aim to test if the relationship between the midline cranial base and the face on one hand and the lateral basicranium and the face on the other hand are qualitatively and quantitatively different in modern humans and chimpanzees: two phylogenetically close but morphologically different hominids. This work is performed using three-dimensional (3D) landmarks to take into account the face and basicranium 3D shape. Modern humans and chimpanzees both exhibit a significant relationship between lateral basicranium and face, and a nonsignificant relationship between midline cranial base and face. However, the patterns of integration are different for the two species. These results underscore the essential role of the lateral basicranial shape in the setting of the facial morphology in modern humans and chimpanzees. The important differences in the patterns of integration may be related to the genetic, developmental, and functional requirements of each taxon, acquired along their respective evolution. From a common, tight, relationship between lateral basicranium, and face, each taxon may develop different patterns of integration in order to adapt to particular functions and morphologies.

ABSTRACT: To date few studies, especially among non-human primates, have evaluated or monitored rehabilitation effectiveness and identified key species-specific behavioral indicators for release success. This four-months study aimed to identify behavioral indicators of rehabilitation success among ten infant and juvenile orphaned chimpanzees cared for in peer groups at the Centre for Conservation of Chimpanzees (CCC), Guinea, West Africa. Behavioral data focused on foraging skills and activity budget. During bush-outings, rehabilitants spent on average nearly a quarter of their activity budget foraging, resting or traveling, respectively. Neither age, sex, the level of abnormal behaviors demonstrated upon arrival nor human contact during bush-outings predicted individual dietary knowledge. However, individuals who spent more time arboreal demonstrated a greater dietary breadth than conspecifics who dwelled more terrestrially. Although our data failed to demonstrate a role of conspecific observation in dietary acquisition, we propose that the mingling of individuals from different geographical origins may act as a catalyst for acquiring new dietary knowledge, promoted by ecological opportunities offered during bush-outings. This "Super Chimpanzee" theory opens up new questions about cultural transmission and socially-biased learning among our closest living relatives and provides a novel outlook on rehabilitation in chimpanzees. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: The nightly construction of a sleeping platform (SP) or "nest" is widely regarded as a universal behavior among great apes, yet SP structural morphology has been incompletely quantified to date. This is in part due to the inherent difficulties of gathering empirical data on arboreally sited SPs. I gathered quantitative structural data on SPs (n = 65) at the Toro-Semliki Wildlife Reserve from May to June 2008 and from August 2010 to January 2011. I measured SP length (semi-major axis length), width (semi-minor axis length), radii (length from the surface center to the rim edge 45° from the axis), depth (width of the concavity from the surface center to the parallel rim), and thickness (ventral center to the dorsal underside of the SP). SP complexity was defined with a scored index. SP complexity was found to be correlated with SP circumference, surface area, mass, proportion of soft leafy material to hard woody material, number of frame support branches used in its construction, and other measures that are argued to index "comfort." In addition, the height of the tree canopy above the SP was negatively correlated with SP complexity. Greater complexity (and therefore stability) is argued to maintain SP integrity, stability and restraint in the face of greater wind speeds, thereby reducing the probability of falls. Given the observation that males site SPs lower than females (Fruth and Hohmann, Ethology 94:113-126, 1994; Brownlow et al., Am J Primatol 55:49-55, 2001), and that SP diameters were greater for SPs sited low in the canopy at Semliki, it is inferred that more massive males benefit from lower climbing expenses and greater stability. These data support Baldwin and colleagues' (Primates 22:474-486, 1981) hypothesis that the principal advantage of SPs over open-branch sleeping sites is the greater stability required by large-bodied great apes. © 2012 Japan Monkey Centre and Springer.

ABSTRACT: Background: The human apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is polymorphic, with three primary alleles (E2, E3, E4) that differ at two key non-synonymous sites. These alleles are functionally different in how they bind to lipoproteins, and this genetic variation is associated with phenotypic variation for several medical traits, including cholesterol levels, cardiovascular health, Alzheimer's disease risk, and longevity. The relative frequencies of these alleles vary across human populations, and the evolution and maintenance of this diversity is much debated. Previous studies comparing human and chimpanzee APOE sequences found that the chimpanzee sequence is most similar to the human E4 allele, although the resulting chimpanzee protein might function like the protein coded for by the human E3 allele. However, these studies have used sequence data from a single chimpanzee and do not consider whether chimpanzees, like humans, show intra-specific and subspecific variation at this locus. Methodology and Principal Findings: To examine potential intraspecific variation, we sequenced the APOE gene of 32 chimpanzees. This sample included 20 captive individuals representing the western subspecies (P. troglodytes verus) and 12 wild individuals representing the eastern subspecies (P. t. schweinfurthii). Variation in our resulting sequences was limited to one non-coding, intronic SNP, which showed fixed differences between the two subspecies. We also compared APOE sequences for all available ape genera and fossil hominins. The bonobo APOE protein is identical to that of the chimpanzee, and the Denisovan APOE exhibits all four human-specific, non-synonymous changes and appears functionally similar to the human E4 allele. Conclusions: We found no coding variation within and between chimpanzee populations, suggesting that the maintenance of functionally diverse APOE polymorphisms is a unique feature of human evolution. © 2012 McIntosh et al.

ABSTRACT: Based on the analysis of computed tomography (CT) scan imagery, Morimoto et al. (Anatomical Record 2011; 294:1433-1445) concluded that the proximal femoral shaft attachment of the chimpanzee gluteus maximus (GM) lies in a position similar to that of modern humans (medial to a longitudinal bony structure that runs superoinferiorly along the lateral proximal shaft), contradicting the previous reports of similarity with the other extant apes. Based on a broader comparative osteological perspective and examination of some of the same CT imageries, we here demonstrate that: 1) although the chimpanzee insertion of the GM appears to lie more posteromedially than it does in gorillas and orangutans, the validity of the extent of this reassessment remains in doubt, pending crossvalidation of CT analyses by parallel dissections of the imaged specimens, and 2) the chimpanzee and human conditions are, nevertheless, distinct. We agree with Morimoto et al. (Anatomical Record 2011; 294:1433-1445) that these observations support the interpretation that superficially similar osteological topographies of the proximal femur were acquired independently by chimpanzees and gorillas, but we disagree about the significance of their suggested human-chimpanzee similarities. Although Morimoto et al. (Anatomical Record 2011; 294:1433-1445) considered these to be shared-derived features of the chimpanzee-human clade, we instead argue that the shared absence of strong anterolateral displacement of the GM attachment among chimpanzees, basal hominids (such as Orrorin and Ardipithecus), and humans likely reflects the primitive condition characteristic of a wide range of Miocene apes. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Adverse rearing conditions are considered a major factor in the development of abnormal behavior. We investigated the overall levels, the prevalence and the diversity of abnormal behavior of 18 adult former laboratory chimpanzees, who spent about 20 years single caged, over a two-year period following re-socialization. According to the onset of deprivation, the individuals were classified as early deprived (EDs, mean: 1.2 years) or late deprived (LDs, mean: 3.6 years). The results are based on 187.5 hours of scan sampling distributed over three sample periods: subsequent to re-socialization and during the first and second year of group-living. While the overall levels and the diversity of abnormal behavior remained stable over time in this study population, the amplifying effects of age at onset of deprivation became apparent as the overall levels of abnormal behavior of EDs were far above those of LDs in the first and second year of group-living, but not immediately after re-socialization. The most prevalent abnormal behaviors, including eating disorders and self-directed behaviors, however, varied in their occurrence within subjects across the periods. Most important, the significance of social companionship became obvious as the most severe forms of abnormal behavior, such as dissociative and self-injurious behaviors declined. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: We examine evidence for communicative intent during conspecific interactions in wild chimpanzees (Budongo Forest, Uganda), focusing on persistence in gestural communication. Previous research indicates that great apes have large gestural repertoires and produce gestural communication in a flexible and intentional manner, including the production of gesture sequences. Although there is a lack of consensus on the form and function of sequences, there is some evidence that sequences are produced when signallers fail to receive any response from a recipient. Here, we provide first systematic evidence for communicative persistence in wild chimpanzees. Rather than examining only the presence or absence of a response, we used the most commonly observed response to assign meanings to gestures and examined sequence production in relation to response congruency. Chimpanzees ceased communication if successful, but persevered when unsuccessful. Chimpanzees repeated gestures when a response partially matched their goal but substituted the original gesture when a response was incongruent. Persistence was also mediated by recipient intent to respond, with more sequences produced within competitive than affiliative contexts. Gestures within sequences were homogenous in semantic meaning and signallers continued until the response matched the assigned meaning of the initial gesture. Gestural sequence production was not primarily affective; gesture intensity (in terms of modality) did not increase within sequences. Chimpanzee gestural sequences emerged to achieve specific outcomes; given variability in recipient behaviour following initial gestures, signallers were flexible in their persistence towards these goals. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Virtually all theories of the evolution of cooperation require that cooperators find ways to interact with one another selectively, to the exclusion of cheaters. This means that individuals must make reputational judgments about others as cooperators, based on either direct or indirect evidence. Humans, and possibly other species, add another component to the process: they know that they are being judged by others, and so they adjust their behavior in order to affect those judgments - so-called impression management. Here, we show for the first time that already preschool children engage in such behavior. In an experimental study, 5-year-old human children share more and steal less when they are being watched by a peer than when they are alone. In contrast, chimpanzees behave the same whether they are being watched by a groupmate or not. This species difference suggests that humans' concern for their own self-reputation, and their tendency to manage the impression they are making on others, may be unique to humans among primates. © 2012 Engelmann et al.

ABSTRACT: Background: The evidence for culture in non-human animals has been growing incrementally over the past two decades. However, the ability for cumulative cultural evolution, with successive generations building on earlier achievements, in non-human animals remains debated. Faithful social learning of incremental improvements in technique is considered to be a defining feature of human culture, differentiating human from non-human cultures. This study presents the first experimental evidence for chimpanzees' social transmission of a more efficient tool-use technique invented by a conspecific group member. Methodology/Principal Findings: The chimpanzees were provided with a straw-tube, and spontaneously demonstrated two different techniques in obtaining juice through a small hole: "dipping" and "straw-sucking". Both the "dipping" and "straw-sucking" techniques depended on the use of the same tool (straw-tube) for the same target (juice) accessible from exactly the same location (small hole 1 cm in diameter). Therefore the difference between "dipping" and "straw-sucking" was only in "technique". Although the two techniques differed significantly in their efficiency, their cognitive and perceptuo-motor complexity were comparable. All five chimpanzees who initially performed the "dipping" technique switched to using the more efficient "straw-sucking" technique upon observing a conspecific or human demonstrate the more proficient alternate "straw-sucking" technique. Conclusions/Significance: The social learning mechanism involved here was clearly not local or stimulus enhancement, but imitation or emulation of a tool-use technique. When there is no biologically relevant difference in cognitive or perceptuo-motor complexity between two techniques, and when chimpanzees are dissatisfied with their own technique, chimpanzees may socially learn an improved technique upon close observation of a proficient demonstrator. This study provides important insights into the cognitive basis for cumulative culture in chimpanzees, and also suggests possible conditions in which cumulative cultural evolution could arise even in non-human animals. © 2013 Yamamoto et al.

ABSTRACT: GB virus type C (GBV-C) is a lymphotropic virus that can cause persistent infection in humans. GBV-C is not associated with any disease, but is associated with reduced mortality in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals. Related viruses have been isolated from chimpanzees (GBV-Ccpz) and from New World primates (GB virus type A, GBV-A). These viruses are also capable of establishing persistent infection. We determined the nucleotide sequence encoding the envelope glycoprotein (E2) of two GBV-Ccpz isolates obtained from the sera of captive chimpanzees. The deduced GBV-Ccpz E2 protein differed from human GBV-C by 31% at the amino acid level. Similar to human GBV-C E2, expression of GBV-Ccpz E2 in a tet-off human CD4+ Jurkat T-cell line significantly inhibited the replication of diverse HIV-1 isolates. This anti-HIV-replication effect of GBV-Ccpz E2 protein was reversed by maintaining cells in doxycycline to reduce E2 expression. Previously, we found a 17 aa region within human GBV-C E2 that was sufficient to inhibit HIV-1. Although GBV-Ccpz E2 differed by 3 aa differences in this region, the chimpanzee GBV-C 17mer E2 peptide inhibited HIV-1 replication. Similarly, the GBV-A peptide that aligns with this GBV-C E2 region inhibited HIV-1 replication despite sharing only 5 aa with the human GBV-C E2 sequence. Thus, despite amino acid differences, the peptide region on both the GBV-Ccpz and the GBV-A E2 protein inhibit HIV-1 replication similar to human GBV-C. Consequently, GBV-Ccpz or GBV-A infection of non-human primates may provide an animal model to study GB virus-HIV interactions. © 2013 SGM.

ABSTRACT: Despite treatment with praziquantel (PZQ) at 40 mg/kg in food, several chimpanzees on Ngamba Island Chimpanzee Sanctuary (NICS) continue to excrete eggs of Schistosoma mansoni. To monitor disease, 8 animals were closely examined under anaesthesia in March 2011 with portable ultrasonography and by rectal snip biopsy. Schistosome genetic diversity had been previously assayed within 4 of these chimpanzees, finding extensive diversity with 27 DNA barcodes encountered, although none was common to all animals. Calcified schistosome eggs were found in the rectal snips from 5 chimpanzees and liver fibrosis was clearly documented, indicative of progressive disease in 6 animals, the latter being surprisingly advanced in a younger chimpanzee. All 8 animals were treated under anaesthesia by oral gavage with PZQ at 60 mg/kg dosing that was well tolerated. These animals were again re-examined in June 2012 using stool and urine sampling. Only 1 chimpanzee appeared to be free from infection and active egg excretion was confirmed in 6 animals. If intestinal schistosomiasis is to be controlled within this setting, a long-term disease management plan is required which should combine active case-detection with an insistent treatment regime with praziquantel for these chimpanzees, exploring perhaps the performance of even higher dosing. © Cambridge University Press 2012.

ABSTRACT: Increasing human populations and the rapid conversion of forest to agricultural land increase the likelihood of interactions and conflict between humans and nonhuman primates. Understanding such interactions requires a broad cross-disciplinary approach that assesses the implications of sympatry for primate conservation and human social, cultural and economic needs. Although chimpanzees were declared extinct in Guinea-Bissau in 1988, recent reports estimate that between 600 and 1,000 individuals are currently present, with the largest population occupying the Cantanhez National Park (105,700 ha; northeast limit: 11°22′58″N,14°46′12″W; southwest limit: 11°2′18″N,15°15′58″W). These heavily fragmented coastal forests have been identified as one of seven priority areas in West Africa for urgent chimpanzee conservation efforts (Kormos et al. 2003. West African Chimpanzees. Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan. IUCN, Gland. 2003). Here we set the context for human-chimpanzee sympatry in Guinea-Bissau, and provide a platform from which further studies can expand. We review past findings that might affect current and future sympatric relationships, and integrate preliminary data on resource competition from one hitherto unstudied chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) community inhabiting a forested-agricultural matrix in Caiquene and Cadique, central Cantanhez National Park. While local human cultural traditions provide a degree of tolerance and protection to chimpanzees in Cantanhez National Park, which is beneficial for long-term conservation initiatives, human-chimpanzee interactions have the potential to grow increasingly negative in character, especially as human populations expand and further pressure is exerted on the land.

ABSTRACT: Animals that maintain cooperative relationships show gains in longevity and offspring survival. However, little is known about the cognitive or hor-monal mechanisms involved in cooperation. Indeed, there is little support for a main hypothesis that non-human animals have the cognitive capacities required for bookkeeping of cooperative exchanges. We tested an alternative hypothesis that cooperative relationships are facilitated by an endocrino-logical mechanism involving oxytocin, a hormone required for bonding in parental and sexual relationships across mammals. We measured urinary oxytocin after single bouts of grooming in wild chimpanzees. Oxytocin levels were higher after grooming with bond partners compared with non-bond partners or after no grooming, regardless of genetic relatedness or sexual interest. We ruled out other possible confounds, such as grooming duration, grooming direction or sampling regime issues, indicating that changes in oxytocin levels were mediated by social bond strength. Oxytocin, which is thought to act directly on neural reward and social memory systems, is likely to play a key role in keeping track of social interactions with multiple individuals over time. The evolutionary linkage of an ances-tral hormonal system with complex social cognition may be the primary mechanism through which long-term cooperative relationships develop between both kin and non-kin in mammals. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: In nature, the thermoregulatory strategies of species have evolved in response to the environmental conditions in which they live. Primates display extensive behavioural flexibility but few have examined the role of this behavioural flexibility with regard to thermoregulation. Chimpanzees, under free-living conditions, utilise natural vertical light/thermal gradients in rainforest canopies as a means of thermoregulation, moving along the gradient to maintain homoeostasis. In contrast, captive chimpanzees are often housed at latitudes outside their natural range under conditions that do not allow for this natural behavioural thermoregulation. We investigated the use of shade by captive chimpanzees as a behavioural thermoregulatory strategy at the Johannesburg Zoo, South Africa. We performed behavioural observations over the austral winter/spring period on a group of captive chimpanzees recording their behaviour in relation to shade use. Despite experiencing temperatures in Johannesburg below or just within their thermoneutral zone, chimpanzees consistently spent more time in shade than in direct sun. This pattern of shade use was most pronounced for the hotter midday period than for other times, was not dependent on the overall availability of shade within the enclosure and was not predicted by mean daily or hourly temperatures nor thermal maxima or minima. Instead, ultraviolet radiation and humidity levels appear to predict the observed patterns of shade utilisation and these findings suggest that chimpanzees in captivity adopt a sun-avoidance strategy, possibly as a result of the rapid heat gain associated with their dark skin and pelage. The findings suggest that chimpanzees are flexible when responding to the thermal challenges associated with housing outside of their natural environment. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Is human handedness unique? That is, do our nearest living relations, chimpanzee and bonobo (Pan spp.) show species-wide handedness, as is seen in living Homo sapiens? The answer may depend on definition: Handedness (congruence across subjects and across tasks) should be distinguished from hand preference (within subject and task), manual specialization (within subject, across tasks), and task specialization (across subjects, within task). Comparison is required at both population and species level. Several methodological issues (e.g., ecological validity) are crucial, as are major confounding variables (e.g., bimanuality). The behavioral manual laterality of chimpanzees is well-studied in a variety of contexts. Especially important is tool use, which seems to enhance extent of lateralization, but this varies both within and across populations. There is much evidence for task specialization in chimpanzees, but no conclusive evidence of handedness in the strictest sense. Thus, human handedness seems to be unique among living hominoids. © 2013 New York Academy of Sciences.

ABSTRACT: Various populations of chimpanzees attack beehives to obtain honey, often with the help of wooden tools. However, little is known about how honey abundance in tropical habitats fluctuates with season and how chimpanzees respond to this. For a woodland-savannah habitat inhabited by the Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee subspecies, we analyzed monthly proportions of flowering trees and vines as a proxy for honey production. We found a stria negative correlation between flowering and rainfall, probably because pollination benefits from dry conditions. Honey-gathering behavior of the Gashaka-Kwano chimpanzee community was reconstructed from tools abandoned at extraction sites. The apes use sturdy digging sticks and more slender probes, sometimes successively as a tool set, to access honey from subterranean and tree-dwelling colonies of stingless bees and honeybees. Chimpanzees exploited beehives throughout the year. However, during the dry season, when colonies had presumably hoarded more honey, hives were targeted with a greater number of tools. This was not because chimpanzee foraging party sizes had increased. Instead, individual apes used more probes during a given honey-gathering event - suggesting that dipping remained worthwhile for longer. In this situation, as tool tips become soft and unsuitable after prolonged dipping, the chimpanzees need to source new implements that possess hard tool points. The apes did not obtain them by breaking previously used tools into fragments, as these would be too short for successful insertions. We assume this because the average length of tools did not decrease with the increased number of apes that worked a hive. This indicates that each tool is sourced individually from raw material in the surroundings of the extraction site. Chimpanzees thus adjust the use and manufacture of tools to honey abundance, reflecting that the sugary fluid is a sought-after resource. © Society for Tropical Ecology.

ABSTRACT: Many orphaned chimpanzees whose mothers are illegally killed for their meat (bushmeat) in Africa are sold as pets or kept caged at hotels and businesses to attract tourists. As a result of being separated from their mothers and other chimpanzees at an early age, and spending years in impoverished captive conditions, some of these individuals engage in abnormal behaviors, including stereotypically scratching at their flesh and repetitively rocking back and forth. This paper presents case studies of Poco and Safari, two chimpanzees who were rescued by sanctuaries after living alone on display for humans at businesses for the first 7 to 8 years of their lives. Decades after their rescue, they still engage in stereotypical behaviors as a result of the psychological and physical trauma they endured early on. This paper combines data from in depth interviews with caregivers and direct observations of abnormal behaviors to assess psychological distress in captive-living chimpanzees. Our results highlight some lesser known harms of the bushmeat trade and the detrimental life-long consequences that keeping chimpanzees as “pets” can have on their mental health. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: The role learning plays in the acquisition of communicative gestures by wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) is unclear. We aimed to evaluate the likelihood that social experience influences the structure of chimpanzee buttress drumming displays by examining whether individuals differed in the way they used their hands and feet to strike trees. We analyzed digital video recordings of 245 bouts by 9 adult males from Gombe National Park, Tanzania, frame by frame in conjunction with acoustic analysis. We investigated 1) how limb sequences used to approach drumming trees influenced limb use during drumming, 2) the relative use of hands vs. feet in drumming, and 3) the relative amplitude of beats produced by hands vs. feet. We found that the chimpanzees most often approached trees at a gallop and usually initiated drumming bouts with limb sequences that were identical to gait limb sequences. All individuals produced more beats with their feet than with their hands, and foot beats were higher in relative amplitude than hand beats. In only one instance did an individual produce a bout with hands only, whereas in three of nine observations of drumming on resonant camp equipment, the individuals primarily used their hands rather than their feet. We suggest that although chimpanzees may, by observing others, learn to use buttresses as tools to generate loud sounds, it is unlikely that learning influences the structure of displays because they result from innately determined gait patterns deployed to generate sound from comparatively nonresonant substrates. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: This study examined the anxiety levels and social interactions of two orphan and four mother-reared adolescent chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) in the Kasekela community at Gombe National Park, Tanzania. We used focal sampling in the field at Gombe to observe these adolescent individuals. Their social interactions and anxious behavior, measured as rough scratching, were recorded. The two orphans differed from others of a similar age by exhibiting higher levels of anxiety and lower levels of play. These results suggest that a mother's absence, even in naturalistic conditions in which other members of the community are available to the orphan, may have long-lasting impact on an adolescent's anxiety and its ability to engage in complex social interactions, such as play. © 2012 Japan Monkey Centre and Springer.

ABSTRACT: Monitoring adrenocortical activity in wild primate populations is critical, given the well-documented relationship between stress, health, and reproduction. Although many primate studies have quantified fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) concentrations, it is imperative that researchers validate their method for each species. Here, we describe and validate a technique for field extraction and storage of FGMs in wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Our method circumvents many of the logistical challenges associated with field studies while yielding similar results to a commonly used laboratory method. We further validate that our method accurately reflects stress physiology using an adrenocorticotropic hormone challenge in a captive chimpanzee and an FGM peak at parturition in a wild subject. Finally, we quantify circadian patterns for FGMs for the first time in this species. Understanding these patterns may allow researchers to directly link specific events with the stress response. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The ability to predict how another individual will behave is useful in social competition. Chimpanzees can predict the behaviour of another based on what they observe her to see, hear, know and infer. Here we show that chimpanzees act on the assumption that others have preferences that match their own. All subjects began with a preference for a box with a picture of food over one with a picture of nothing, even though the pictures had no causal relation to the contents. In a back-and-forth food competition, chimpanzees then avoided the box with the picture of food when their competitor had chosen one of the boxes before them-presumably on the assumption that the competitor shared their own preference for it and had already chosen it. Chimpanzees predicted that their competitor's preference would match their own and adjusted their behavioural strategies accordingly. © 2012 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: This study offers a new method for examining the bodily, manual, and eye movements of a chimpanzee at the micro-level. A female chimpanzee wore a lightweight head-mounted eye tracker (60 Hz) on her head while engaging in daily interactions with the human experimenter. The eye tracker recorded her eye movements accurately while the chimpanzee freely moved her head, hands, and body. Three video cameras recorded the bodily and manual movements of the chimpanzee from multiple angles. We examined how the chimpanzee viewed the experimenter in this interactive setting and how the eye movements were related to the ongoing interactive contexts and actions. We prepared two experimentally defined contexts in each session: a face-to-face greeting phase upon the appearance of the experimenter in the experimental room, and a subsequent face-to-face task phase that included manual gestures and fruit rewards. Overall, the general viewing pattern of the chimpanzee, measured in terms of duration of individual fixations, length of individual saccades, and total viewing duration of the experimenter's face/body, was very similar to that observed in previous eye-tracking studies that used non-interactive situations, despite the differences in the experimental settings. However, the chimpanzee viewed the experimenter and the scene objects differently depending on the ongoing context and actions. The chimpanzee viewed the experimenter's face and body during the greeting phase, but viewed the experimenter's face and hands as well as the fruit reward during the task phase. These differences can be explained by the differential bodily/manual actions produced by the chimpanzee and the experimenter during each experimental phase (i.e., greeting gestures, task cueing). Additionally, the chimpanzee's viewing pattern varied depending on the identity of the experimenter (i.e., the chimpanzee's prior experience with the experimenter). These methods and results offer new possibilities for examining the natural gaze behavior of chimpanzees. © 2013 Kano, Tomonaga.

ABSTRACT: The origin of the fundamental behavioral differences between humans and our closest living relatives is one of the central issues of evolutionary anthropology. The prominent, chimpanzee-based referential model of early hominin behavior has recently been challenged on the basis of broad multispecies comparisons and newly discovered fossil evidence. Here, we argue that while behavioral data on extant great apes are extremely relevant for reconstruction of ancestral behaviors, these behaviors should be reconstructed trait by trait using formal phylogenetic methods. Using the widely accepted hominoid phylogenetic tree, we perform a series of character optimization analyses using 65 selected life-history and behavioral characters for all extant hominid species. This analysis allows us to reconstruct the character states of the last common ancestors of Hominoidea, Hominidae, and the chimpanzee-human last common ancestor. Our analyses demonstrate that many fundamental behavioral and life-history attributes of hominids (including humans) are evidently ancient and likely inherited from the common ancestor of all hominids. However, numerous behaviors present in extant great apes represent their own terminal autapomorphies (both uniquely derived and homoplastic). Any evolutionary model that uses a single extant species to explain behavioral evolution of early hominins is therefore of limited use. In contrast, phylogenetic reconstruction of ancestral states is able to provide a detailed suite of behavioral, ecological and life-history characters for each hypothetical ancestor. The living great apes therefore play an important role for the confident identification of the traits found in the chimpanzee-human last common ancestor, some of which are likely to represent behaviors of the fossil hominins. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: In 8 captive adult chimpanzees of various ages premedicated with oral zuclopenthixol anaesthesia was induced intramuscularly with a combination of medetomidine and ketamine (40 or 50 μg/kg and 5 mg/ kg, IM, respectively), with and without midazolam (0.05 mg/kg), and maintained with isoflurane in oxygen. At the end of the procedure, sedation was reversed with atipamezole (0.25 mg/kg, IM) and sarmazenil (0.005 mg/kg, IM) when midazolam had been administered. Oral zuclopenthixol resulted in tranquillization of the whole group and only one animal required a second dart injection to achieve adequately deep anaesthesia. Effective and reliable anaesthesia was achieved in all apes; the depth of hypnosis was stable and sudden arousal did not occur. Physiological parameters remained within normal ranges in the majority of the animals; however, manageable anaesthesia-related complications, namely apnoea after darting, hypotension, hypoventilation, hypoxemia and prolonged recovery, occurred in 6 out of 8 animals. The use of monitoring devices was essential to guarantee adequate management of these complications. © 2013 Verlag Hans Huber, Hogrefe AG, Bern.

ABSTRACT: The hindlimbs of two orangutans and four chimpanzees were dissected, and muscle parameters (mass, fascicle length, and physiological cross-sectional area: PCSA) were determined to explore possible interspecies variation in muscle dimensions. Muscle mass and PCSA were divided by the total mass and total PCSA of the entire foot muscles for normalization. The results indicate that the pedal interosseous and the intrinsic pedal digital extensor muscles in the orangutans probably have higher capacity for force production due to their relatively larger PCSAs than in chimpanzees. Moreover, the medial components of the intrinsic muscles exhibited relatively larger mass and PCSA ratios in orangutans. The mass and PCSA ratios of the hallucal muscles were larger in chimpanzees. These differences in foot muscle dimensions of the two species suggest that the orangutan is more specialized for hook-like digital gripping without involvement of the rudimentary hallux, while the chimpanzee is adapted to hallux-assisted power gripping in arboreal locomotion. © 2012 Anatomical Society.

ABSTRACT: Fear and anxiety have been studied extensively in humans and other animals. However, far less attention has been focused on the clinical and ethical implications of nonhuman animals' susceptibility to psychological disorders. Behavioral signs of psychopathology in nonhuman animals, including our closest phylogenetic relatives, are rarely described as clinical syndromes. In this study, we drew on approaches described in child psychiatry, veterinary medicine, and primatology, to identify behavioral clusters in chimpanzees comparable with human anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. In phase 1 of this study, we accessed published case reports of 20 chimpanzees subjected to maternal separation, social isolation, experimentation, or similar experiences. We tested the inter-rater reliability of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fourth edition; DSM-IV) criteria for generalized anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder when applied to chimpanzees in these case studies. Additionally, based on the DSM-IV, veterinary approaches, and ethograms, we defined behaviorally anchored alternative criteria, which proved more reliable than the DSM-IV criteria in phase 1. In phase 2, the new behaviorally anchored criteria were applied to chimpanzees living in wild sites in Africa (n = 196) and those with previous histories of experimentation, orphanage, illegal seizure, or violent human conflict (n = 168) living in sanctuaries. In phase 2, 18% of chimpanzees living in sanctuaries met the set of behaviorally anchored criteria for generalized anxiety disorder, compared with 0.5% of those in the wild (P = 0.036), and 19% of chimpanzees in sanctuaries met the set of behaviorally anchored criteria for obsessive-compulsive disorder, compared with 0% of those in the wild (P = 0.071).Chimpanzees display behavioral clusters similar to anxiety disorders described in humans, underscoring the importance of ethical considerations regarding their use in experimentation and other captive settings. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Studies about parasitization by Cryptosporidium in great apes have been scarce and mostly conducted in captivity. The present study reports the presence of Cryptosporidium sp. in wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) from Ugalla, western Tanzania. Ugalla is one of the driest, most open, and seasonal habitats inhabited by chimpanzees. Cryptosporidium sp. was found in 8.9 % of the samples. The presence of the parasite was determined by preserving fecal samples in chemical conventional fixatives (MIF and alcohol absolute) staining them using a modified Zielh-Neelsen technique, and examining them with a light microscope. The number of fecal samples positive for Cryptosporidium was significantly higher during the rainy than during the dry season (p < 0.005). The results showed that feces collected in the rainy season were almost three times more likely to be positive for Cryptosporidium than those collected in the dry season (OR = 2.81). Cryptosporidium detection was significantly negatively affected by highest temperatures (>28.7 C, p < 0.001). Cryptosporidiosis can cause serious health problems in humans and its potential effect on Ugalla chimpanzees is discussed. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: The nightly construction of an arboreal sleeping platform (SP) has been observed among every chimpanzee's population studied to date. Here, we report on bioclimatic aspects of SP site choice among dry-habitat chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) at the Toro-Semliki Wildlife Reserve, Uganda. We placed a portable weather monitor within 1 m of chimpanzee SPs and compared the microenvironment of this site with terrestrial monitors placed 10 cm above the ground directly underneath the simultaneously studied SP. We calculated physical "comfort levels" of monitored sites using the RayMan thermophysiological model that we modified to take ape body proportions into account. The RayMan tool gauges energy balance using wind speed, temperature, relative humidity, and heat index in conjunction with the study subject's mass and stature to determine whether the individual is in energy balance or homeostasis. We found that (1) terrestrial microclimates have greater homeostatic potential than arboreal microclimates, and (2) there is a significant positive linear relationship between wind speed and height of SP in the forest canopy. Advantages of terrestrial sites are that they require lesser energetic expenditure to stabilize the body when the SP is under construction and perhaps during use as well. We found that terrestrial sites also had better homeostatic potentials. This combination of advantages explains why SPs are so often sited terrestrially in habitats where predation risk is low. Early hominins must have had technological or social measures to avoid or deter predators that were significantly advanced over those found among chimpanzees before they began sleeping on the ground. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: DNA methylation is a pervasive epigenetic DNA modification that strongly affects chromatin regulation and gene expression. To date, it remains largely unknown how patterns of DNA methylation differ between closely related species and whether such differences contribute to species-specific phenotypes. To investigate these questions, we generated nucleotide-resolution whole-genome methylation maps of the prefrontal cortex of multiple humans and chimpanzees. Levels and patterns of DNA methylation vary across individuals within species according to the age and the sex of the individuals. We also found extensive species-level divergence in patterns of DNA methylation and that hundreds of genes exhibit significantly lower levels of promoter methylation in the human brain than in the chimpanzee brain. Furthermore, we investigated the functional consequences of methylation differences in humans and chimpanzees by integrating data on gene expression generated with next-generation sequencing methods, and we found a strong relationship between differential methylation and gene expression. Finally, we found that differentially methylated genes are strikingly enriched with loci associated with neurological disorders, psychological disorders, and cancers. Our results demonstrate that differential DNA methylation might be an important molecular mechanism driving gene-expression divergence between human and chimpanzee brains and might potentially contribute to the evolution of disease vulnerabilities. Thus, comparative studies of humans and chimpanzees stand to identify key epigenomic modifications underlying the evolution of human-specific traits. © 2012 The American Society of Human Genetics.

ABSTRACT: Many models from foraging theory and movement ecology assume that resources are encountered randomly. If food locations, types and values are retained in memory, however, search time could be significantly reduced, with concurrent effects on biological fitness. Despite this, little is known about what specific characteristics of foods, particularly those relevant to profitability, nonhuman animals can remember. Building upon previous observations, we hypothesized that chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, after observing foods being hidden in a large wooded test area they could not enter, and after long delays, would direct (through gesture and vocalization) experimentally naïve humans to the reward locations in an order that could be predicted beforehand by the spatial and physical characteristics of those items. In the main experiment, various quantities of almonds, both in and out of shells and sealed in transparent bags, were hidden in the test area. The chimpanzees later directed searchers to those items in a nonrandom order related to quantity, shell presence/absence, and the distance they were hidden from the subject. The recovery sequences were closely related to the actual e/. h (energy/handling time) profitability of the foods. Predicted recovery orders, based on the energetic value of almonds and independently measured, individual-specific expected pursuit and processing times, were closely related to observed recovery orders. We argue that the information nonhuman animals possess regarding their environment can be extensive, and that further comparative study is vital for incorporating realistic cognitive variables into models of foraging and movement. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: Primates are known for their use of the hand in many activities including food grasping. Yet, most studies concentrate on the type of grip used. Moreover, kinematic studies remain limited to a few investigations of the distal elements in constrained conditions in humans and macaques. In order to improve ourunderstanding of the prehension movement in primates, we analyse here the behavioural strategies (e.g., types of grip, body postures) as well as the 3D kinematics of the whole forelimb and the trunk during the prehension of small static food items in five primate species in unconstrained conditions. All species preferred the quadrupedal posture except lemurs, which used a typical crouched posture. Grasp type differed among species, with smaller animals (capuchins and lemurs) using a whole-hand grip and larger animals (humans, gorillas, chimpanzees) using predominantly a precision grip. Larger animals had lower relative wrist velocities and spent a larger proportion of the movement decelerating. Humans grasped food items with planar motions involving small joint rotations, more similar to the smaller animals than to gorillas and chimpanzees, which used greater rotations of both the shoulder and forearm. In conclusion, the features characterising human food prehension are present in other primates, yet differences exist in joint motions. These results provide a good basis to suggest hypotheses concerning the factors involved in driving the evolution of grasping abilities in primates. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Microbes inhabiting the human gastrointestinal tract tend to adopt one of three characteristic community structures, called 'enterotypes', each of which is overrepresented by a distinct set of bacterial genera. Here we report that the gut microbiotae of chimpanzees also assort into enterotypes and that these chimpanzee enterotypes are compositionally analogous to those of humans. Through the analysis of longitudinal samples, we show that the microbial signatures of the enterotypes are stable over time, but that individual hosts switch between enterotypes over periods longer than a year. These results support the hypothesis that enterotypic variation was present in populations of great apes before the divergence of humans and chimpanzees. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

ABSTRACT: Many primates share food, but the motives behind this food sharing are mostly not known. We investigated individuals' preference to feed either alone or together with a tolerant partner. Subjects (chimpanzees who are highly competitive around food, bonobos who are more tolerant around food and common marmosets who are cooperative breeders and share food actively with some partners) were tested with a door-opening paradigm. In a 2 × 2 design with the factors 'food' and 'partner', subjects had the opportunity to eat piles of sharable food, if present, and/or to open the door, thereby allowing the partner, if present, to join the subject. While food had a main effect on the subject's behaviour, the presence of the partner did not. Individuals of all species opened the door much more often if there was no food available. These results suggest that regardless of their differing social organizations, chimpanzees, bonobos and marmosets do not voluntarily co-feed, but do not mind having company if there is no food present. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: Human and chimpanzee CD4+ T cells differ markedly in expression of the inhibitory receptor Siglec-5, which contributes towards differential responses to activating stimuli. While CD4+ T cells from both species are equally susceptible to HIV-1 infection, chimpanzee cells survive better, suggesting a cell-intrinsic difference. We hypothesized that Siglec-5 expression protects T cells from activation-induced and HIV-1-induced cell death. Transduction of human CEM T cells with Siglec-5 decreased cell responses to stimulation. Following HIV-1 infection, a higher percentage of Siglec-5-positive cells survived, suggesting relative resistance to virus-induced cell death. Consistent with this, we observed an increase in percentage of Siglec-5-positive cells surviving in mixed infected cultures. Siglec-5-transduced cells also showed decreased expression of apoptosis-related proteins following infection and reduced susceptibility to Fas-mediated cell death. Similar Siglec-5-dependent differences were seen when comparing infection outcomes in primary CD4+ T cells from humans and chimpanzees. A protective effect of Siglec-5 was further supported by observing greater proportions of circulating CD4+ T cells expressing Siglec-5 in acutely infected HIV-1 patients, compared to controls. Taken together, our results suggest that Siglec-5 expression protects T cells from HIV-1- and apoptosis-induced cell death and contributes to the different outcomes of HIV-1 infection in humans and chimpanzees. © 2012 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The influence of ecology on the development of behavioral traditions in animals is controversial, particularly for chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), for which it is difficult to rule out environmental influences as a cause of widely observed community-specific behavioral differences. Here, we investigated 3 potential scenarios that could explain the natural variation in a key extractive tool behavior, "fluid-dip," among several communities of chimpanzees of the Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii subspecies in Uganda. We compared data from previous behavioral ecological studies, field experiments, and long-term records of chimpanzee tool-using behavior. We focused on the quality of the available food, dietary preferences, and tool sets of 5 different communities, and carried out a standardized field experiment to test systematically for the presence of fluid-dip in 4 of these communities. Our results revealed major differences in habitat, available diet, and tool use behavior between geographically close communities. However, these differences in ecology and feeding behavior failed to explain the differences in tool use across communities. We conclude that ecological variables may lead both to innovation and loss of behavioral traditions, while contributing little to their transmission within the community. Instead, as soon as a behavioral tradition is established, sociocognitive factors likely play a key maintenance role as long as the ecological conditions do not change sufficiently for the tradition to be abandoned. © 2012 American Psychological Association.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees are highly territorial and have the potential to be extremely aggressive toward unfamiliar individuals. In the wild, transfer between groups is almost exclusively completed by nulliparous females, yet in captivity there is often a need to introduce and integrate a range of individuals, including adult males. We describe the process of successfully integrating two groups of chimpanzees, each containing 11 individuals, in the Budongo Trail facility at the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland's Edinburgh Zoo. We use social network analysis to document changes in group dynamics within this population over the 16 months following integration. Aggression rates were low overall and members of the two original groups engaged in significantly fewer aggressive interactions over time. Association and grooming data indicate that relationships between members of the original groups became stronger and more affiliative with time. Despite these positive indicators the association data revealed the continued existence of two distinct subgroups, a year after integration. Our data show that when given complex space and freedom to exhibit natural fission-fusion groupings, in which the chimpanzees choose whom they wish to associate and interact with, the building of strong affiliative relationships with unfamiliar individuals is a very gradual process. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees in west central Africa (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) are endemically infected with simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVcpzPtt) that have crossed the species barrier to humans and gorillas on at least five occasions, generating pandemic and nonpandemic forms of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) as well as gorilla SIV (SIVgor). Chimpanzees in east Africa (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) are also infected with SIVcpz; however, their viruses (SIVcpzPts) have never been found in humans. To examine whether this is due to a paucity of natural infections, we used noninvasive methods to screen wild-living eastern chimpanzees in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Uganda, and Rwanda. We also screened bonobos (Pan paniscus) in the DRC, a species not previously tested for SIV in the wild. Fecal samples (n=3,108) were collected at 50 field sites, tested for species and subspecies origin, and screened for SIVcpz antibodies and nucleic acids. Of 2,565 samples from eastern chimpanzees, 323 were antibody positive and 92 contained viral RNA. The antibody-positive samples represented 76 individuals from 19 field sites, all sampled north of the Congo River in an area spanning 250,000 km2. In this region, SIVcpzPts was common and widespread, with seven field sites exhibiting infection rates of 30% or greater. The overall prevalence of SIVcpzPts infection was 13.4% (95% confidence interval, 10.7% to 16.5%). In contrast, none of the 543 bonobo samples from six sites was antibody positive. All newly identified SIVcpzPts strains clustered in strict accordance to their subspecies origin; however, they exhibited considerable genetic diversity, especially in protein domains known to be under strong host selection pressure. Thus, the absence of SIVcpzPts zoonoses cannot be explained by an insufficient primate reservoir. Instead, greater adaptive hurdles may have prevented the successful colonization of humans by P. t. schweinfurthii viruses. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.

ABSTRACT: Many historical and contemporary theorists have proposed that population-level behavioral and brain asymmetries are unique to humans and evolved as a consequence of human-specific adaptations such as language, tool manufacture and use, and bipedalism. Recent studies in nonhuman animals, notably primates, have begun to challenge this view. Here, I summarize comparative data on neuroanatomical asymmetries in the planum temporale (PT) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) of humans and chimpanzees, regions considered the morphological equivalents to Broca's and Wernicke's areas. I also review evidence of population-level handedness in captive and wild chimpanzees. When similar methods and landmarks are used to define the PT and IFG, humans and chimpanzees show similar patterns of asymmetry in both cortical regions, though humans show more pronounced directional biases. Similarly, there is good evidence that chimpanzees show population-level handedness, though, again, the expression of handedness is less robust compared to humans. These results stand in contrast to reported claims of significant differences in the distribution of handedness in humans and chimpanzees, and I discuss some possible explanations for the discrepancies in the neuroanatomical and behavioral data. © 2013 New York Academy of Sciences.

ABSTRACT: Great ape gestural communication is considered important in understanding the evolution of human language as these share important features, namely, flexible and intentional signal use. Although gestural repertoires have been compiled for captive and wild primates, reports are largely qualitative. We quantify the morphological structure and variation of gestural signals identified in the repertoire of a community of wild chimpanzees. Gestures were classified on the basis of 29 morphological features, such as trajectory and orientation during the preparatory and stroke phases of a gesture. Hierarchical cluster and discriminant function analyses identified 30 morphologically distinct manual gesture types; the majority was subsequently correctly classified using a cross-validation technique, with incorrect classifications for rare gesture types only. Comparisons of this statistically determined repertoire with previous repertoires did not identify systematic variation between captive and wild chimpanzees. Moreover, consensus was not greater within studies of the same populations, highlighting the importance of systematic and well-documented inventories. Our morphologically based analyses indicate that manual gestures are best considered as graded rather than discrete communication signals, similar to some vocalisation systems. We discuss these findings in light of current theories of human language evolution. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Many species can choose between two visual sets of stimuli on the basis of quantity. This is true when sets are both visible, or are presented one set at a time or even one item at a time. However, we know comparatively little about how well nonhuman animals can compare auditory quantities. Here, three chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) chose between two sets of food items when they only heard each item fall into different containers rather than seeing those items. This method prevented the chimpanzees from summing the amount of visible food they saw because there were no visual cues. Chimpanzees performed well, and their performance matched that of previous experiments with regard to obeying Weber's law. They also performed well with comparisons between a sequentially presented auditory set and a fully visible set, demonstrating that duration of presentation was not being used as a cue. In addition, they accommodated empty sets into these judgments, although not perfectly. Thus, chimpanzees can judge auditory quantities in flexible ways that show many similarities to how they compare visual quantities. © 2011 American Psychological Association.

ABSTRACT: Geographical variation in behaviour may be best explained in terms of culture if ecological and genetic explanations can be excluded. However, ecological conditions and genetic predispositions may in turn also affect cultural processes. We examined the influence of environmental factors on foraging tool use among chimpanzees at the Seringbara study site in the Nimba Mountains, Guinea, where nut cracking and termite fishing are absent, but ant dipping is present. We tested two ecological hypotheses to explain foraging tool use prevalence. The opportunity hypothesis states that encounter rates with nuts, insects or tools explain tool use patterns. We measured the density and distribution of nut trees, nuts, army ants, termites and potential tools in relation to the chimpanzees' ranging patterns. The necessity hypothesis states that tool use is a response to scarcity of preferred foods (i.e. ripe fruit). We measured the temporal availability of nuts, army ants and termites in relation to preferred food sources. Our findings support the opportunity hypothesis: nut trees and Macrotermes mounds were rare and peripheral to the chimpanzees' range, whereas army ants were abundant and widespread. The necessity hypothesis did not explain tool-assisted insectivory, as both army ants and termites were available during ripe fruit scarcity, yet neither ant dipping nor termite fishing functioned as fallback strategies. Nuts were absent at times of fruit scarcity and were not available as fallback foods. Our findings highlight the importance of considering environmental conditions in explaining foraging tool use by wild chimpanzees and emphasize the interplay between environment and culture. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: Developmental prolongation is thought to contribute to the remarkable brain enlargement observed in modern humans (Homo sapiens). However, the developmental trajectories of cerebral tissues have not been explored in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), even though they are our closest living relatives. To address this lack of information, the development of cerebral tissues was tracked in growing chimpanzees during infancy and the juvenile stage, using three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging and compared with that of humans and rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Overall, cerebral development in chimpanzees demonstrated less maturity and a more protracted course during prepuberty, as observed in humans but not in macaques. However, the rapid increase in cerebral total volume and proportional dynamic change in the cerebral tissue in humans during early infancy, when white matter volume increases dramatically, did not occur in chimpanzees. A dynamic reorganization of cerebral tissues of the brain during early infancy, driven mainly by enhancement of neuronal connectivity, is likely to have emerged in the human lineage after the split between humans and chimpanzees and to have promoted the increase in brain volume in humans. Our findings may lead to powerful insights into the ontogenetic mechanism underlying human brain enlargement. © 2012 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Context can have a powerful influence on decision-making strategies in humans. In particular, people sometimes shift their economic preferences depending on the broader social context, such as the presence of potential competitors or mating partners. Despite the important role of competition in primate conspecific interactions, as well as evidence that competitive social contexts impact primates' social cognitive skills, there has been little study of how social context influences the strategies that nonhumans show when making decisions about the value of resources. Here we investigate the impact of social context on preferences for risk (variability in payoffs) in our two closest phylogenetic relatives, chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, and bonobos, Pan paniscus. In a first study, we examine the impact of competition on patterns of risky choice. In a second study, we examine whether a positive play context affects risky choices. We find that (1) apes are more likely to choose the risky option when making decisions in a competitive context; and (2) the play context did not influence their risk preferences. Overall these results suggest that some types of social contexts can shift patterns of decision making in nonhuman apes, much like in humans. Comparative studies of chimpanzees and bonobos can therefore help illuminate the evolutionary processes shaping human economic behaviour. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: In several areas of Africa, great apes experience increasing predation pressure as a result of human activities. In this study, terrestrial and arboreal nest construction among chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes ellioti) populations was investigated in the Lebialem-Mone Forest Landscape (LMFL), Southwest Region, Cameroon, to examine the anthropogenic effects on nest location. Data on the height, distribution and approximate age of chimpanzee night nests were collected during two 4-week primate field surveys (July to August 2010; July 2011) at two field sites (Bechati and Andu) within the LMFL. Data were collected using the line transect method. Chimpanzee night nests were categorized by their location: arboreal versus terrestrial. During the two field surveys, arboreal night nests were the most frequently constructed nest type at both sites, and the only type of night nest constructed at Bechati. Terrestrial night nests were also constructed at Andu. The main difference between these two sites is the level of human predation and agricultural development. At Bechati chimpanzees inhabit forest regions around dense, expanding villages and are regularly hunted by humans. However, at Andu the chimpanzee populations are not under the same threat. Therefore, terrestrial night nest construction in the LMFL appears to be a behavior exhibited where there is less human presence. Copyright © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.

ABSTRACT: The extent to which tool-using animals take into account relevant task parameters is poorly understood. Nut cracking is one of the most complex forms of tool use, the choice of an adequate hammer being a critical aspect in success. Several properties make a hammer suitable for nut cracking, with weight being a key factor in determining the impact of a strike; in general, the greater the weight the fewer strikes required. This study experimentally investigated whether chimpanzees are able to encode the relevance of weight as a property of hammers to crack open nuts. By presenting chimpanzees with three hammers that differed solely in weight, we assessed their ability to relate the weight of the different tools with their effectiveness and thus select the most effective one(s). Our results show that chimpanzees use weight alone in selecting tools to crack open nuts and that experience clearly affects the subjects' attentiveness to the tool properties that are relevant for the task at hand. Chimpanzees can encode the requirements that a nut-cracking tool should meet (in terms of weight) to be effective. © 2012 Schrauf et al.

ABSTRACT: Capuchin monkeys have been tested for the capacity to delay gratification for accumulating rewards in recent studies and have exhibited variable results. Meanwhile, chimpanzees have consistently excelled at this task. However, neither species have ever been tested at accumulating symbolic tokens instead of food items, even though previous reports indicate that tokens sometimes facilitate performance in other self-control tasks. Thus, in the present study, we tested capuchin monkeys and chimpanzees for their capacity to delay gratification in a delay maintenance task, in which an experimenter presented items, one at a time, to within reach of an animal for as long as the animal refrained from taking them. In Experiment 1, we assessed how long capuchin monkeys could accumulate items in the delay maintenance task when items were food rewards or tokens exchangeable for food rewards. Monkeys accumulated more food rewards than they did tokens. In Experiment 2, we tested capuchin monkeys and chimpanzees in a similar accumulation test. Whereas capuchins again accumulated more food than tokens, all chimpanzees but one showed no difference in performance in the two conditions. These findings provide additional evidence that chimpanzees exhibit greater self-control capacity in this task than do capuchin monkeys and indicate that symbolic stimuli fail to facilitate delay maintenance when they do not abstract away from the quantitative dimension of the task. This is consistent with previous findings on the effects of symbols on self-control and illuminates what makes accumulation a particularly challenging task. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: Video displays for behavioral research lend themselves particularly well to studies with chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), as their vision is comparable to humans', yet there has been no formal test of the efficacy of video displays as a form of social information for chimpanzees. To address this, we compared the learning success of chimpanzees shown video footage of a conspecific compared to chimpanzees shown a live conspecific performing the same novel task. Footage of an unfamiliar chimpanzee operating a bidirectional apparatus was presented to 24 chimpanzees (12 males, 12 females), and their responses were compared to those of a further 12 chimpanzees given the same task but with no form of information. Secondly, we also compared the responses of the chimpanzees in the video display condition to responses of eight chimpanzees from a previously published study of ours, in which chimpanzees observed live models. Chimpanzees shown a video display were more successful than those in the control condition and showed comparable success to those that saw a live model. Regarding fine-grained copying (i.e. the direction that the door was pushed), only chimpanzees that observed a live model showed significant matching to the model's methods with their first response. Yet, when all the responses made by the chimpanzees were considered, comparable levels of matching were shown by chimpanzees in both the live and video conditions. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Interactions between wildlife species are numerous and diverse, ranging from commensalism to predation. Information on cross-species interactions in anthropogenic habitats are rare but can serve to improve our understanding of animal behavioural and ecological flexibility in response to human-induced changes. Here we report direct observations of interactions between chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) and wild and domesticated species in a forest-farm mosaic at Bossou, Guinea, recorded between 1997 and 2009. The low diversity and abundance of wildlife, in particular typical chimpanzee prey species, are reflected in both the low interaction rates (one interaction per 400 observation hours) and the low number of species with which chimpanzees interacted (nine species, mostly mammals, but also birds and reptiles). Chimpanzees generally chose either to make direct physical contact with a species or not; interactions that involved direct contact lasted longer than noncontacts. Interactions with mammals showed the greatest diversity in nature and duration. Adults most often consumed a captured animal, while immatures most often engaged in playful behaviours with other species. Immatures also exhibited distinctive accompanying behaviours whereas adults rarely did so. Species-specific behaviours that depend on the age-class of the interactant are consistent with the idea that chimpanzees categorise different animals. We anticipate that chimpanzee interactions with sympatric species inhabiting humanised habitats will change over time to include more domesticated species. Conservation management strategies should anticipate behavioural flexibility in response to changing landscapes. © 2012 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees routinely follow the gaze of humans to outside targets. However, in most studies using object choice they fail to use communicative gestures (e.g. pointing) to find hidden food. Chimpanzees' failure to do this may be due to several difficulties with this paradigm. They may, for example, misinterpret the gesture as referring to the opaque cup instead of the hidden food. Or perhaps they do not understand informative communicative intentions. In contrast, dogs seem to be skilful in using human communicative cues in the context of finding food, but as of yet there is not much data showing whether they also use pointing in the context of finding non-food objects. Here we directly compare chimpanzees' (N = 20) and dogs' (N = 32) skills in using a communicative gesture directed at a visible object out of reach of the human but within reach of the subject. Pairs of objects were placed in view of and behind the subjects. The task was to retrieve the object the experimenter wanted. To indicate which one she desired, the experimenter pointed imperatively to it and directly rewarded the subject for handing over the correct one. While dogs performed well on this task, chimpanzees failed to identify the referent. Implications for great apes' and dogs' understanding of human communicative intentions are discussed. © 2012 Kirchhofer et al.

ABSTRACT: The majority of evidence for cultural behavior in animals has come from comparisons between populations separated by large geographical distances that often inhabit different environments [1-6]. The difficulty of excluding ecological and genetic variation as potential explanations for observed behaviors has led some researchers to challenge the idea of animal culture [7-9]. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) in the Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire, crack Coula edulis nuts using stone and wooden hammers and tree root anvils [10-12]. In this study, we compare for the first time hammer selection for nut cracking across three neighboring chimpanzee communities that live in the same forest habitat, which reduces the likelihood of ecological variation. Furthermore, the study communities experience frequent dispersal of females at maturity, which eliminates significant genetic variation [13, 14]. We compared key ecological factors, such as hammer availability and nut hardness, between the three neighboring communities and found striking differences in group-specific hammer selection among communities despite similar ecological conditions. Differences were found in the selection of hammer material and hammer size in response to changes in nut resistance over time. Our findings highlight the subtleties of cultural differences in wild chimpanzees and illustrate how cultural knowledge is able to shape behavior, creating differences among neighboring social groups. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Little is known as to the influence of captivity and stressful events on sleep patterns in primates. We investigated the sleep patterns of 19 male chimpanzees living under similar conditions at the Chimpanzee Sanctuary Uto (CSU) in Kumamoto, Japan, using a behavioral sleep index. We conducted nighttime observations of all subjects during a stable period and then observed three subjects after relocation to an unfamiliar facility at CSU. We estimated length of sleep and nonsleep periods over 13-h video recordings using instantaneous sampling at 1-min intervals to record sleep, which we defined operationally as an inactive posture with the body lying down with the head on the floor or on nesting materials. The 19 subjects slept for a mean ± SEM of 11. 3 ± 0. 26 h during the stable period, and sleep patterns varied significantly among the subjects. The three relocated subjects all showed temporarily decreased sleep duration in the post-move period but subsequently recovered to the levels observed during the stable period when habituated to the new living quarters. These results suggest that a stressful event may induce temporary sleep shortage lasting for >1 wk in captive chimpanzees. Sleep patterns may serve as a useful behavioral index of the stress response, as it is less confounded by other behaviors and the actions of human caretakers than other indices. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

ABSTRACT: The current aging population of captive chimpanzees is expected to develop age-related diseases and present new challenges to providing their veterinary care. Spontaneous heart disease and sudden cardiac death are the main causes of death in chimpanzees (especially of male animals), but little is known about the relative frequency of other chronic diseases. Furthermore, female chimpanzees appear to outlive the males and scant literature addresses clinical conditions that affect female chimpanzees. Here we characterize the types and prevalence of chronic disease seen in geriatric (older than 35 y) female chimpanzees in the colony at Alamogordo Primate Facility. Of the 16 female chimpanzees that fit the age category, 87.5% had some form of chronic age-related disease. Cardiovascular-related disease was the most common (81.25%) followed by metabolic syndrome (43.75%) and renal disease (31.25%). These data show the incidence of disease in geriatric female chimpanzees and predict likely medical management challenges associated with maintaining an aging chimpanzee population.

ABSTRACT: Contemporary research hypothesizes that biological inheritance and ontogenetic factors shape the development of gestural communication in nonhuman great apes. However, little is known about the specific role that mothers play in the acquisition of their infants' gestures. We observed 6 bonobo (Pan paniscus) and 4 chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) mother-infant dyads and recorded their gesture types and frequency. We analyzed all behavioral contexts in which gestures occurred as well as the play context alone. Infants of both species were unlikely to share gestures with their mother or unrelated adult females. However, gestural sharing was prevalent within age groups. Within and across species, infant-infant and mother-mother groups were homogeneous regarding the types of gestures they shared, although there was individual variation in the frequency of gesture use. Our findings provide limited evidence that infants learned their gestures by imitating their mothers. Phylogenetic influences seem to be vital in gestural acquisition but, we suggest, repertoire development cannot be disentangled from individual social encounters during life. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

ABSTRACT: Whether lateralization of communicative signalling in non-human primates might constitute prerequisites of hemispheric specialization for language is unclear. In the present study, we examined (i) hand preference for a communicative gesture (clapping in 94 captive chimpanzees from two research facilities) and (ii) the in vivo magnetic resonance imaging brain scans of 40 of these individuals. The preferred hand for clapping was defined as the one in the upper position when the two hands came together. Using computer manual tracing of regions of interest, we measured the neuroanatomical asymmetries for the homologues of key language areas, including the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and planum temporale (PT). When considering the entire sample, there was a predominance of right-handedness for clapping and the distribution of right- and left-handed individuals did not differ between the two facilities. The direction of hand preference (right- versus left-handed subjects) for clapping explained a significant portion of variability in asymmetries of the PTand IFG. The results are consistent with the view that gestural communication in the common ancestor may have been a precursor of language and its cerebral substrates in modern humans. © 2011 The Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Background: Social learning research in apes has focused on social learning in the technical (problem solving) domain - an approach that confounds action and physical information. Successful subjects in such studies may have been able to perform target actions not as a result of imitation learning but because they had learnt some technical aspect, for example, copying the movements of an apparatus (i.e., different forms of emulation learning). Methods: Here we present data on action copying by non-enculturated and untrained chimpanzees when physical information is removed from demonstrations. To date, only one such study (on gesture copying in a begging context) has been conducted - with negative results. Here we have improved this methodology and have also added non-begging test situations (a possible confound of the earlier study). Both familiar and novel actions were used as targets. Prior to testing, a trained conspecific demonstrator was rewarded for performing target actions in view of observers. All but one of the tested chimpanzees already failed to copy familiar actions. When retested with a novel target action, also the previously successful subject failed to copy - and he did so across several contexts. Conclusion: Chimpanzees do not seem to copy novel actions, and only some ever copy familiar ones. Due to our having tested only non-enculturated and untrained chimpanzees, the performance of our test subjects speak more than most other studies of the general (dis-)ability of chimpanzees to copy actions, and especially novel actions. © 2012 Tennie et al.

ABSTRACT: Cognitive and behavioral biases, which are widespread among humans, have recently been demonstrated in other primates, suggesting a common origin. Here we examine whether the expression of one shared bias, the endowment effect, varies as a function of context. We tested whether objects lacking inherent value elicited a stronger endowment effect (or preference for keeping the object) in a context in which the objects had immediate instrumental value for obtaining valuable resources (food). Chimpanzee subjects had opportunities to trade tools when food was not present, visible but unobtainable, and obtainable using the tools. We found that the endowment effect for these tools existed only when they were immediately useful, showing that the effect varies as a function of context-specific utility. Such context-specific variation suggests that the variation seen in some human biases may trace predictably to behaviors that evolved to maximize gains in specific circumstances. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: In spite of its evolutionary significance and conservation importance, the population structure of the common chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes, is still poorly understood. An issue of particular controversy is whether the proposed fourth subspecies of chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes ellioti, from parts of Nigeria and Cameroon, is genetically distinct. Although modern high-throughput SNP genotyping has had a major impact on our understanding of human population structure and demographic history, its application to ecological, demographic, or conservation questions in non-human species has been extremely limited. Here we apply these tools to chimpanzee population structure, using ~700 autosomal SNPs derived from chimpanzee genomic data and a further ~100 SNPs from targeted re-sequencing. We demonstrate conclusively the existence of P. t. ellioti as a genetically distinct subgroup. We show that there is clear differentiation between the verus, troglodytes, and ellioti populations at the SNP and haplotype level, on a scale that is greater than that separating continental human populations. Further, we show that only a small set of SNPs (10-20) is needed to successfully assign individuals to these populations. Tellingly, use of only mitochondrial DNA variation to classify individuals is erroneous in 4 of 54 cases, reinforcing the dangers of basing demographic inference on a single locus and implying that the demographic history of the species is more complicated than that suggested analyses based solely on mtDNA. In this study we demonstrate the feasibility of developing economical and robust tests of individual chimpanzee origin as well as in-depth studies of population structure. These findings have important implications for conservation strategies and our understanding of the evolution of chimpanzees. They also act as a proof-of-principle for the use of cheap high-throughput genomic methods for ecological questions. © 2012 Bowden et al.

ABSTRACT: Long-term data are crucial for addressing questions about the behavior and ecology of chimpanzees because of their slow life histories. Despite the long history of field research on chimpanzees, the number of sites that have provided long-term data on multiple communities in the same population is still small. Long-term data on two habituated chimpanzee communities in Kibale National Park, Uganda, have provided important insights into variation in chimpanzee behavioral ecology and life-history strategies. Long-term data on diet, phenology, and forest composition indicate that Ngogo is better habitat for chimpanzees; this helps explain why chimpanzee population density is three times higher there than at Kanyawara, why the Ngogo community is three times as large as that at Kanyawara, and why female gregariousness is higher at Ngogo. Both sites have provided important data on sex differences in gregariousness and in space use, on long-term social bonds, on hunting, on intergroup aggression, and on other important topics in behavioral ecology. The large size of the Ngogo community offers valuable insights into demographic influences on behavior and on male reproductive success and into chimpanzee-red colobus predator-prey dynamics. In this chapter, I summarize some of the major findings of this research and compare Kibale data to those from other long-term chimpanzee research sites. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

ABSTRACT: Because conflicts among social group members are inevitable, their management is crucial for group stability. The rarest and most interesting form of conflict management is policing, i.e., impartial interventions by bystanders, which is of considerable interest due to its potentially moral nature. Here, we provide descriptive and quantitative data on policing in captive chimpanzees. First, we report on a high rate of policing in one captive group characterized by recently introduced females and a rank reversal between two males. We explored the influence of various factors on the occurrence of policing. The results show that only the alpha and beta males acted as arbitrators using manifold tactics to control conflicts, and that their interventions strongly depended on conflict complexity. Secondly, we compared the policing patterns in three other captive chimpanzee groups. We found that although rare, policing was more prevalent at times of increased social instability, both high-ranking males and females performed policing, and conflicts of all sex-dyad combinations were policed. These results suggest that the primary function of policing is to increase group stability. It may thus reflect prosocial behaviour based upon "community concern." However, policing remains a rare behaviour and more data are needed to test the generality of this hypothesis. © 2012 von Rohr et al.

ABSTRACT: Objective To determine if a combination of detomidine and ketamine can be used for effective chemical immobilization of chimpanzees. Study design Observational study. Animals Twenty-one adult captive chimpanzees (12 males, nine females), age 8-46years, weighing 40.4-68.4kg. Methods The chimpanzees were immobilized with intramuscular (IM) detomidine and ketamine by a darting system. Based on estimated weights, doses administered were 50μgkg-1 detomidine and 4mgkg-1 ketamine in groups 1 and 2, and 60μgkg-1 and 5mgkg-1 respectively in group 3. Eight minutes in group 1 and 15minutes in groups 2 and 3 were allowed from the time of apparent immobilization before removing the animals from their enclosures. Body temperature, arterial haemoglobin saturation and pulse rate were measured. The time from injection to induction (recumbency and absence of voluntary movement), total anaesthetic and recovery times (with or without atipamezole) were recorded. Results Immobilization occurred within 5minutes after darting in most animals. Early handling of the chimpanzees often resulted in arousal and required further doses of ketamine IM. Most animals were hypoxaemic and hypothermic. Occasionally, bradycardia was observed. Atipamezole resulted in an acceptable quality of recovery 10minutes after IM injection. The duration of immobilization varied widely when no antagonist was administered. Conclusions and clinical relevance The combination detomidine (60μgkg-1) and ketamine (5-6mgkg-1) can be used for the immobilization of chimpanzees for non- to minimally invasive procedures. A period of 15minutes should be allowed before handling to avoid unwanted arousal. Oxygen administration is recommended to reduce hypoxaemia. Administration of atipamezole is justified to hasten recovery. © 2012 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The ability to recognize other individuals' mental states - their knowledge and beliefs, for example - is a fundamental part of human cognition and may be unique to our species. Tests of a "theory of mind" in animals have yielded conflicting results [1-3]. Some nonhuman primates can read others' intentions and know what others see, but they may not understand that, in others, perception can lead to knowledge [1-3]. Using an alarm-call-based field experiment, we show that chimpanzees were more likely to alarm call in response to a snake in the presence of unaware group members than in the presence of aware group members, suggesting that they recognize knowledge and ignorance in others. We monitored the behavior of 33 individuals to a model viper placed on their projected travel path. Alarm calls were significantly more common if the caller was with group members who had either not seen the snake or had not been present when alarm calls were emitted. Other factors, such as own arousal, perceived risk, or risk to receivers, did not significantly explain the likelihood of calling, although they did affect the call rates. Our results suggest that chimpanzees monitor the information available to other chimpanzees and control vocal production to selectively inform them. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Much attention has been paid to geographic variation in chimpanzee behavior, but few studies have applied quantitative techniques to explain this variation. Here, we apply methods typically utilized in macroecology to explain variation in the putative cultural traits of chimpanzees. We analyzed published data containing 39 behavioral traits from nine chimpanzee communities. We used a canonical correspondence analysis to examine the relative importance of environmental characteristics and geography, which may be a proxy for inter-community gene flow and/or social transmission, for explaining geographic variation in chimpanzee behavior. We found that geography, and longitude in particular, was the best predictor of behavioral variation. Chimpanzee communities in close longitudinal proximity to each other exhibit similar behavioral repertoires, independent of local ecological factors. No ecological variables were significantly related to behavioral variation. These results support the idea that inter-community dispersal patterns have played a major role in structuring behavioral variation. We cannot be certain whether behavioral variation has a genetic basis, is the result of innovation and diffusion, or a combination of the two. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: We examined whether eight capuchins and eight chimpanzees were able to retrieve a reward placed inside a tube, of varying length, by selecting the correct stick from different sets of three sticks differing in length (functional feature) and handle (non-functional feature). Moreover, to investigate whether seeing the stick inside the tube (visual feedback) improves performance, half of the subjects were tested with a transparent apparatus and the other half with an opaque apparatus. Phase 1 included (a) Training 1 in which each stick had a different handle and (b) Transfer 1 in which the handles were switched among sticks, so that the functional tool had the same length but a different handle than before. The seven chimpanzees and one capuchin that passed Transfer 1 received Transfer 2. The other subjects received (a) Training 2, which used the same sticks from Phase 1 with handles switched in every trial, and (b) Transfer 2 in which the tube was longer, all sticks had the same new handle, and the formerly longest tool became intermediate in length. Eight chimpanzees and three capuchins passed Transfer 2. Results showed that (1) chimpanzees applied relational structures in tool using tasks more quickly than capuchins and (2) capuchins required more varied experience to attend to the functional feature of the tool. Interestingly, visual feedback did not improve performance in either species. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: Oligoadenylate synthetases (OAS) are interferon-induced enzymes that participate in the first line of defense against a wide range of viral infection in animals. Upon activation by viral double-stranded RNA, OAS synthesizes (2-5) oligoadenylates, which activate RNase L, leading to the nonspecific degradation of cellular and viral RNA. Some association studies in humans suggest that variation at one of the OAS genes, OAS1, could be influencing host susceptibility to viral infection. We assessed the diversity of OAS1 in hominoid primates with a focus on chimpanzees. We found that the OAS1 gene is extremely polymorphic in Central African chimpanzee and exhibits levels of silent and replacement diversity much higher than neutral regions of the chimpanzee genome. This level of variation strongly suggests that balancing selection is acting on OAS1, and indeed, this conclusion was validated by several tests of neutrality. We further demonstrated that balancing selection has been acting at this locus since the split between chimpanzees, humans, and gorillas (∼8.6 Ma) and caused the persistence of two deeply divergent allelic lineages in Central African chimpanzees. These two groups of OAS1 alleles differ by a large number of amino acids (a.a.), including several a.a. putatively involved in RNA binding. It is therefore very likely that variation at the OAS1 locus affects the innate immune response of individuals to specific viral infection. Our data strongly suggest that interactions between viral RNA and OAS1 are responsible for the maintenance of ancestral polymorphisms at this locus for at least 13.2 My. © 2011 The Author.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzee and hunter-gatherer intergroup aggression differ in important ways, including humans having the ability to form peaceful relationships and alliances among groups. This paper nevertheless evaluates the hypothesis that intergroup aggression evolved according to the same functional principles in the two species-selection favoring a tendency to kill members of neighboring groups when killing could be carried out safely. According to this idea chimpanzees and humans are equally risk-averse when fighting. When self-sacrificial war practices are found in humans, therefore, they result from cultural systems of reward, punishment, and coercion rather than evolved adaptations to greater risk-taking. To test this "chimpanzee model," we review intergroup fighting in chimpanzees and nomadic hunter-gatherers living with other nomadic hunter-gatherers as neighbors. Whether humans have evolved specific psychological adaptations for war is unknown, but current evidence suggests that the chimpanzee model is an appropriate starting point for analyzing the biological and cultural evolution of warfare. © 2012 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.

ABSTRACT: In most mammals the growth hormone (GH) locus comprises a single gene expressed primarily in the anterior pituitary gland. However, in higher primates multiple duplications of the GH gene gave rise to a complex locus containing several genes. In man this locus comprises five genes, including GH-N (expressed in pituitary) and four genes expressed in the placenta, but in other species the number and organization of these genes vary. The situation in chimpanzee has been unclear, with suggestions of up to seven GH-like genes. We have re-examined the GH locus in chimpanzee and have deduced the complete sequence. The locus includes five genes apparently organized in a fashion similar to that in human, with two of these genes encoding GH-like proteins, and three encoding chorionic somatomammotropins/placental lactogens (CSHs/PLs). There are notable differences between the human and chimpanzee loci with regard to the expressed proteins, gene regulation, and gene conversion events. In particular, one human gene (hCSH-L) has changed substantially since the chimpanzee/human split, potentially becoming a pseudogene, while the corresponding chimpanzee gene (CSH-A1) has been conserved, giving a product almost identical to the adjacent CSH-A2. Chimpanzee appears to produce two CSHs, with potentially differing biological properties, whereas human produces a single CSH. The pattern of gene conversion in human has been quite different from that in chimpanzee. The region around the GH-N gene in chimpanzee is remarkably polymorphic, unlike the corresponding region in human. The results shed new light on the complex evolution of the GH locus in higher primates. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

ABSTRACT: In social animals an individual's fitness depends partly on the quality of relationships with others. Qualitative variation in relationships has been conceptualized according to a three-dimensional structure, consisting of relationship value, compatibility, and security. However, the determinants of the components and their temporal stability are not well understood. We studied relationship quality in a newly formed group of 20 captive chimpanzees made up of several previously existing social groups. We assessed dyadic relationship quality 2 yr and again 7 yr after grouping. We confirmed the existence and stability of three relationship components and labeled them value, compatibility, and approach symmetry. Previously familiar dyads had a higher value than unfamiliar dyads, especially when they were maternally or paternally related. Compatibility was higher in dyads with only females than in dyads containing a male, but familiarity did not influence compatibility. Approach symmetry was initially higher, but later lower, in familiar than unfamiliar dyads, indicating that approach symmetry of familiar dyads decreased over time. Dyadic value and compatibility were highly stable over time, which is similar to the long relationship duration found in wild chimpanzees. In sum, relationships formed earlier in life became more valuable than those formed in later adulthood, whereas nonaggressive, compatible relationships could be formed throughout life. This suggests that for immigrating individuals, high-value relationships may be relatively difficult to establish, partly explaining why wild female chimpanzees have relatively few high-quality relationships with other females. Our study supports the multicomponent structure and durability of relationships in social species. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzee research in the Mahale Mountains, on the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika, Tanzania, began in 1965. Although the Mahale Mountains did not initially have official protected status, researchers' conservation efforts and the financial support of the Japanese government led to the designation of Mahale as a national park in 1985. The Mahale project is the second-longest continuous field study of chimpanzees. Long-term demographic data show that the habituated chimpanzee group has decreased in size, largely due to disease outbreaks. Recent research has focused on variation in the behavioral repertoire of chimpanzees, producing a detailed audio-visual ethogram as well as evidence of social customs, some of which are candidates for cultural variation. Many primatologists are beginning to accept the notion that some behavioral elements of nonhuman animals are socially shaped. Our long-term studies of chimpanzee behavioral variation will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of the ways in which human and nonhuman primate behavior is shaped by the interaction between genes and culture. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

ABSTRACT: Differences between individuals are the raw material from which theories of the evolution and ontogeny of cognition are built. For example, when 4-year-old children pass a test requiring them to communicate the content of another's falsely held belief, while 3-year-olds fail, we know that something must change over the course of the third year of life. In the search for what develops or evolves, the typical route is to probe the extents and limits of successful individuals' ability. Another is to focus on those that failed, and find out what difference or lack prevented them from passing the task. Recent research in developmental psychology has harnessed individual differences to illuminate the cognitive mechanisms that emerge to enable success. We apply this approach to explaining some of the failures made by chimpanzees when using tools to solve problems. Twelve of 16 chimpanzees failed to discriminate between a complete and a broken tool when, after being set down, the ends of the broken one were aligned in front of them. There was a correlation between performance on this aligned task and another in which after being set down, the centre of both tools was covered, suggesting that the limiting factor was not the representation of connection, but memory or attention. Some chimpanzees that passed the aligned task passed a task in which the location of the broken tool was never visible but had to be inferred.

ABSTRACT: Climate and weather conditions, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation, precipitation and temperature influence the birth sex ratio (BSR) of various higher latitude species, including deer, elephant seals or northern human populations. Although, tropical regions show only little variation in temperature, climate and weather conditions can fluctuate with consequences for phenology and food resource availability. Here, we evaluate, whether the BSR of chimpanzees, inhabiting African tropical forests, is affected by climate fluctuations as well. Additionally, we evaluate, if variation in consumption of a key food resource with high nutritional value, Coula edulis nuts, is linked to both climate fluctuations and variation in BSR. We use long-term data from two study groups located in Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire to assess the influence of local weather conditions and the global climate driver El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on offspring sex. Côte d'Ivoire has experienced considerable climate variation over the last decades, with increasing temperature and declining precipitation. For both groups we find very similar time windows around the month of conception, in which offspring sex is well predicted by ENSO, with more males following low ENSO values, corresponding to periods of high rainfall. Furthermore, we find that the time spent cracking and feeding on Coula nuts is strongly influenced by climate conditions. Although, some of our analysis suggest that a higher proportion of males is born after periods with higher nut consumption frequency, we cannot conclude decisively at this point that nut consumption may influence shifts in BSR. All results combined suggest that also chimpanzees may experience climate related shifts in offspring sex ratios as response to climate fluctuation. © 2012 Kühl et al.

ABSTRACT: Self-medication by great apes to control intestinal parasite infections has been documented at sites across Africa. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) swallow the leaves of certain plant species whole, without chewing. Previous studies demonstrated a relationship between chimpanzee leaf swallowing and expulsion of nematode worms (Oesophagostomum sp.) and tapeworms (Bertiella sp.) in dung. We investigated the relationship between leaf swallowing and parasite expulsion in chimpanzees inhabiting a fragmented forest-farm mosaic at Bulindi, Uganda. During 13 months whole undigested leaves occurred in chimpanzee dung at a considerably higher frequency (10.4% of dungs) than at other sites (0.4-4.0%). Leaf swallowing occurred year-round and showed no pronounced seasonality. Chimpanzees egested adults of multiple species of Oesophagostomum (including O. stephanostomum) and proglottids of two tapeworms-Bertiella sp. and probably Raillietina sp. The latter may not be a true infection, but the byproduct of predation on domestic fowl. Compared to previous studies, the co-occurrence of whole leaves and parasites in chimpanzee dung was low. Whereas the presence of leaves in dung increased the probability of adult nematode expulsion, no association between leaf swallowing and the shedding of tapeworm proglottids was apparent. Anthropogenic habitat changes have been linked to alterations in host-parasite interactions. At Bulindi, deforestation for agriculture has increased contact between apes and people. Elevated levels of leaf swallowing could indicate these chimpanzees are especially vulnerable to parasite infections, possibly due to environmental changes and/or increased stress levels arising from a high frequency of contact with humans. Frequent self-medication by chimpanzees in a high-risk environment could be a generalized adaptation to multiple parasite infections that respond differently to the behavior. Future parasitological surveys of apes and humans at Bulindi are needed for chimpanzee health monitoring and management, and to investigate the potential for disease transmission among apes, people, and domestic animals. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The importance of gene regulation in animal evolution is a matter of long-standing interest, but measuring the impact of selection on gene expression has proven a challenge. Here, we propose a selection index of gene expression as a straightforward method for assessing the mode and strength of selection operating on gene expression levels. The index is based on the widely used McDonald-Kreitman test and requires the estimation of four quantities: the within-species and between-species expression variances as well as the sequence heterozygosity and divergence of neutrally evolving sequences. We apply the method to data from human and chimpanzee lymphoblastoid cell lines and show that gene expression is in general under strong stabilizing selection. We also demonstrate how the same framework can be used to estimate the proportion of adaptive gene expression evolution. © 2012 Warnefors, Eyre-Walker.

ABSTRACT: This paper aims at quantifying ontogenetic differences between bonobo (Pan paniscus) and chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) endocrania, using dental development as a timeline. We utilize a methodology based on smooth and invertible deformations combined with a metric of " currents" that defines a distance between endocranial surfaces and does not rely on correspondence between landmarks. This allows us to perform a temporal surface regression that estimates typical endocranial ontogenetic trajectories separately for bonobos and chimpanzees. We highlight non-linear patterns of endocranial ontogenetic change and significant differences between species at local anatomical levels rather than considering the endocranium as a uniform entity. A spatiotemporal registration permits the quantification of inter-species differences decomposed into a morphological deformation (accounting for size and shape differences independently of age) and a time warp (accounting for changes in the dynamics of development). Our statistical simulations suggest that patterns of endocranial volume (EV) increase may differ significantly between bonobos and chimpanzees, with an earlier phase of a relatively rapid increase (preferentially at some endocranial subdivisions) in the former and a much later phase of relatively rapid increase in the latter. As a consequence, the chimpanzee endocranium appears to reach its adult size later. Moreover, the time warp indicates that juvenile bonobos develop much slower than juvenile chimpanzees, suggesting that inter-specific ontogenetic shifts do not only concern EV increase, but also the rate of shape changes over time. Our method provides, for the first time, a quantitative estimation of inter-specific ontogenetic shifts that appear to differentiate non-linearly. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: It has been established that various species exhibit personality, defined as intra-individual consistency and inter-individual variation in behavioural phenotypes. For example, certain individuals may demonstrate consistently greater behavioural reactions and elevated stress responses. We conducted playback experiments and hormonal analyses on male chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in captivity to investigate the patterns and proximate mediators of individual variations in behavioural reactions. We found intra-individual consistency and inter-individual variation in behavioural reactions (intensive vigilance towards the direction of speakers) to vocalisations by unfamiliar chimpanzees. This behavioural reaction was positively correlated with changes in salivary cortisol concentration, suggesting that stress is a proximate factor mediating the variation in behavioural reactions. The males who were highly responsive to the conspecific vocalisation also exhibited high behavioural reactions towards the neutral broadcast stimulus (the jungle crow's Corvus macrorhynchos 'ka' vocalisation). This observation is consistent with the notion that male chimpanzees vary in intrinsic behavioural tendency to different stimuli. © 2011 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

ABSTRACT: The ability to adjust one's ongoing actions in the anticipation of forthcoming task demands is considered as strong evidence for the existence of internal action representations. Studies of action selection in tool use reveal that the behaviours that we choose in the present moment differ depending on what we intend to do next. Further, they point to a specialized role for mechanisms within the human cerebellum and dominant left cerebral hemisphere in representing the likely sensory costs of intended future actions. Recently, the question of whether similar mechanisms exist in other primates has received growing, but still limited, attention. Here, we present data that bear on this issue from a species that is a natural user of tools, our nearest living relative, the chimpanzee. In experiment 1, a subset of chimpanzees showed a non-significant tendency for their grip preferences to be affected by anticipation of the demands associated with bringing a tool's baited end to their mouths. In experiment 2, chimpanzees' initial grip preferences were consistently affected by anticipation of the forthcoming movements in a task that involves using a tool to extract a food reward. The partial discrepancy between the results of these two studies is attributed to the ability to accurately represent differences between the motor costs associated with executing the two response alternatives available within each task. These findings suggest that chimpanzees are capable of accurately representing the costs of intended future actions, and using those predictions to select movements in the present even in the context of externally directed tool use. © 2011 The Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: The acquisition of linguistic competency from more experienced social partners is a fundamental aspect of human language. However, there is little evidence that non-human primates learn to use their vocalizations from social partners. Captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) produce idiosyncratic vocal signals that are used intentionally to capture the attention of a human experimenter. Interestingly, not all apes produce these sounds, and it is unclear what factors explain this difference. We tested the hypothesis that these attention-getting (AG) sounds are socially learned via transmission between mothers and their offspring. We assessed 158 chimpanzees to determine if they produced AG sounds. A significant association was found between mother and offspring sound production. This association was attributable to individuals who were raised by their biological mother-as opposed to those raised by humans in a nursery environment. These data support the hypothesis that social learning plays a role in the acquisition and use of communicative vocal signals in chimpanzees. This journal is © 2012 The Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: The study of chimpanzees at Gombe National Park, which has continued for over 50 years, has yielded many discoveries that would have been impossible without long-term data. The basic data collection procedure has remained constant since the early 1970s, with a team of Tanzanian field assistants conducting all-day focal follows of individual chimpanzees in the Kasekela (1974-present) and Mitumba (1994-present) communities. Field assistants record map location and party composition at 15-min intervals and keep a continuous record of the focal subject's feeding behavior and narrative notes on behavior, including mating, agonistic interactions, tool use, hunting, boundary patrols, and intergroup interactions. Field assistants have also monitored the unhabituated Kalande community since 1999. A relational database developed from these data provides a powerful tool for analyzing long-term patterns. Studies using this database in combination with new technologies have deepened our understanding of chimpanzee pathogens, genetics, hormones, tool use, hunting, meat sharing, social relationships, habitat use, dispersal, life histories, and demography. This chapter focuses on life histories and demography, followed by a section that highlights findings on two topics for which long-term data have proven especially informative: intergroup aggression and disease ecology. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

ABSTRACT: Human-wildlife conflict is a growing conservation threat, and is increasingly of importance to primate conservationists. Despite this, relatively little work has been done to date on the drivers of human-primate conflict, especially compared to other conflict-causing taxa such as large carnivores. However, the drivers of conflict are often very similar across species, so conflict researchers can learn important lessons from work conducted on other taxa. This paper discusses 8 key factors which are likely to affect how hostile people are towards wildlife and any damage they cause-6 of these are common to both carnivores and primates, while one is much more applicable to carnivores and the other is specific to primates. These conflict drivers involve numerous social and cultural factors, and highlight the importance of truly understanding the local drivers of conflict in order to develop effective mitigation strategies. © 2013 S.

ABSTRACT: The palindrome is one class of symmetrical duplications with reverse complementary characters, which is widely distributed in many organisms. Graphical representation of DNA sequence provides a simple way of viewing and comparing various genomic structures. Through 3-D DNA walk analysis, the similarity and differences in nucleotide composition, as well as the evolutionary relationship between human and chimpanzee MAGE/CSAG-palindromes, can be clearly revealed. Further wavelet analysis indicated that duplicated segments have irregular patterns compared to their surrounding sequences. However, sequence similarity analysis suggests that there is possible common ancestor between human and chimpanzee MAGE/CSAG-palindromes. Based on the specific distribution and orientation of the repeated sequences, a simple possible evolutionary model of the palindromes is suggested, which may help us to better understand the evolutionary course of the genes and the symmetrical sequences. © 2012.

ABSTRACT: Evolutionary questions require specialized approaches, part of which are comparisons between close relatives. However, to understand the origins of human tool behavior, comparisons with solely chimpanzees are insufficient, lacking the power to identify derived traits. Moreover, tool use is unlikely a unitary phenomenon. Large-scale comparative analyses provide an alternative and suggest that tool use co-evolves with a suite of cognitive traits.

ABSTRACT: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of liver transplantation and there is an urgent need to develop therapies to reduce rates of HCV infection of transplanted livers. Approved therapeutics for HCV are poorly tolerated and are of limited efficacy in this patient population. Human monoclonal antibody HCV1 recognizes a highly-conserved linear epitope of the HCV E2 envelope glycoprotein (amino acids 412-423) and neutralizes a broad range of HCV genotypes. In a chimpanzee model, a single dose of 250 mg/kg HCV1 delivered 30 minutes prior to infusion with genotype 1a H77 HCV provided complete protection from HCV infection, whereas a dose of 50 mg/kg HCV1 did not protect. In addition, an acutely-infected chimpanzee given 250 mg/kg HCV1 42 days following exposure to virus had a rapid reduction in viral load to below the limit of detection before rebounding 14 days later. The emergent virus displayed an E2 mutation (N415K/D) conferring resistance to HCV1 neutralization. Finally, three chronically HCV-infected chimpanzees were treated with a single dose of 40 mg/kg HCV1 and viral load was reduced to below the limit of detection for 21 days in one chimpanzee with rebounding virus displaying a resistance mutation (N417S). The other two chimpanzees had 0.5-1.0 log10 reductions in viral load without evidence of viral resistance to HCV1. In vitro testing using HCV pseudovirus (HCVpp) demonstrated that the sera from the poorly-responding chimpanzees inhibited the ability of HCV1 to neutralize HCVpp. Measurement of antibody responses in the chronically-infected chimpanzees implicated endogenous antibody to E2 and interference with HCV1 neutralization although other factors may also be responsible. These data suggest that human monoclonal antibody HCV1 may be an effective therapeutic for the prevention of graft infection in HCV-infected patients undergoing liver transplantation.

ABSTRACT: Ratings of chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes, and orang-utan, Pongo pygmaeus and Pongo abelii, personality reveal dimensions resembling those found in humans. Critics have argued that this similarity derives from anthropomorphic projection or other rater-based effects. We developed two forms of data reduction analyses to determine whether these dimensions can best be explained by the inherent tendencies of the animals (e.g. orang-utans that are curious are playful) or anthropomorphic projections of raters (e.g. believing that orang-utans that are curious should be playful). We found that personality dimensions derived after differences between rater means and rater*item interactions had been removed from ratings replicated the previously discovered dimensions. Conversely, we found a different set of dimensions when analysing items from which differences between animal means and animal*item interactions had been removed. Finally, we used multilevel factor analysis to examine whether the published structure was replicated when we extracted factors based on the within-level animal differences in item scores effects while allowing between-rater differences to covary freely. Again, the personality dimensions were similar to those described in previous studies. These analyses can be used in combination with interrater reliability, temporal stability, and correlations between personality and other external variables to validate animal personality ratings. These analyses confirmed that personality similarities between humans and great apes are best explained by genetic and phylogenetic affinity and not by anthropomorphic artefacts. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: We examined lateral biases in the asymmetrical gallop gaits of wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) approaching trees to drum in Gombe National Park, Tanzania. This is the first study of chimpanzee fast gaits under natural conditions. Analyzing digital video recordings collected over a 12-year period, we were able to determine lateral bias in 153 gallop bouts for the eight most frequently sampled males. For 89 of these bouts, symmetry and duty factor measurements were also possible for at least one stride cycle. Seven of eight males were lateralized, and the eighth was ambi-preferent. The degree of lateralization was comparable to that reported for chimpanzee hand preference during complex, bi-manual object manipulation, and similar to that reported for galloping in domestic horses. No group-level directional bias was found. Although little is known about lateral biases in the asymmetrical gaits of mammals in the wild, we speculate that predator-prey dynamics would select against group-level lateral biases but for the ability to switch leads. The absence of lead switching by chimpanzees in this study may reflect selection for maximum speed to reach arboreal escape routes. We discuss the possibility that locomotor lateralization could constrain the emergence of group-level biases in hand preference in chimpanzees, and could be implicated in the development of limb long bone asymmetries. © 2011 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.

ABSTRACT: Serial plasma aliquots (50 mL) obtained from 10 commercial donors who converted from hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA negative to positive were transfused into 2 chimpanzees to assess infectivity during early HCV infection. Plasma, obtained 4 days before HCV RNA detectability by licensed assays, transmitted HCV infection to chimpanzee X355. The infectious PCR-negative plasma was subsequently shown to be positive in 2 of 23 replicates using a sensitive transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) assay, and estimated to contain 1.2 HCV RNA copies/mL (60 copies/50 mL transfused). Plasma units obtained up to 8 weeks earlier were not infectious in a second susceptible chimp, even when from donors with lowlevel, intermittent HCV RNA detection. Chimp x355 developed acute viremia with subsequent seroconversion, but cleared both virus and Ab in 17 weeks. When rechallenged 38 months later with 6000 RNA copies/mL from the same donor, X355 was transiently reinfected and again rapidly lost allHCVmarkers.We conclude that: (1) transfusions can transmit HCV infection before RNA detection, but the interval of test-negative infectivity is very brief; (2) early "blips" of HCV RNA appear noninfectious and can be ignored when calculating residual transfusion risk; and (3) markers of HCV infection can be lost rapidly after exposure to low-dose inocula.

ABSTRACT: Flexibility is considered a defining feature of great ape gestural communication. Previous research has suggested that there is a 'means-ends' dissociation between gesture type and context, whereby one signal may be used across contexts and several signals used within the same context. Such flexibility in signal production demands contextual comprehension, whereby recipients may perceive the context-free message of a given manual gesture, but also decide how to respond by inferring the signaller's goals from the accompanying context. We conducted naturalistic observations of wild East African chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, manual gestures, focusing on recipient perspective- during communicative interactions. Our results indicate that chimpanzees recognize the context-free meanings of gestures and they are also able to respond flexibly by inferring the meaning from the combination of gesture and context, including relative rank. When analysed at the level of gesture type, some gestures were tightly associated with dominant responses and outcomes. Chimpanzee manual gestures are primarily used for directing a recipient's movement or attention but the motivation underlying these gestural requests is inferred by the recipient from the context. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: Over the course of ontogenesis, the human brain and human cognitive abilities develop in parallel, resulting in a phenotype strikingly distinct from that of other primates. Here, we used microarrays and RNA-sequencing to examine human-specific gene expression changes taking place during postnatal brain development in the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum of humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus macaques. We show that the most prominent human-specific expression change affects genes associated with synaptic functions and represents an extreme shift in the timing of synaptic development in the prefrontal cortex, but not the cerebellum. Consequently, peak expression of synaptic genes in the prefrontal cortex is shifted from <1 yr in chimpanzees and macaques to 5 yr in humans. This result was supported by protein expression profiles of synaptic density markers and by direct observation of synaptic density by electron microscopy. Mechanistically, the human-specific change in timing of synaptic development involves the MEF2A-mediated activity-dependent regulatory pathway. Evolutionarily, this change may have taken place after the split of the human and the Neanderthal lineages. © 2012 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

ABSTRACT: We describe the first observation of a predation attempt by Nigerian-Cameroon chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes ellioti) on Preuss's red colobus (Procolobus preussi) in the Ebo forest, Cameroon. The activity, which was observed for 15 min, primarily involved 1 chimpanzee and 1 red colobus individual, with a further 2 chimpanzees observing the event. Although the behaviour was interrupted when we were detected by the chimpanzees, we believe that this is the first recorded observation of hunting behaviour in Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzees. © 2013 S.

ABSTRACT: Ciliates are some of the most abundant gut fauna in wild chimpanzees. However, their presence in captive populations is usually low presumably due to anti-helmintic prophylaxis or feeding on low fibre diet. We studied a semi-captive colony of chimpanzees at the Sweetwaters Sanctuary in Kenya subject to routine prophylactic dose of albendazole to clear chimpanzees of parasitic helminths. Fresh faecal samples from known individuals were collected before and subsequently after prophylaxis. The samples were fixed in 10% formalin and examined by the sedimentation method. Troglodytella abrassarti had 42.5% prevalence whereas other ciliates had 65% prevalence. The prevalence of the T. abrassarti and other ciliates significantly declined immediately after prophylaxis and then rose slowly thereafter. Our results suggest that ciliates are susceptible to anti-helmintic prophylaxis and that treatment may eliminate ciliates or inhibit their proliferation within the host subsequently lowering their prevalence in the population. Variation in prevalence was not influenced by the age of the host. However, a steady recovery of ciliate prevalence was lower for male compared to female hosts. Our results imply that the intervals between prophylactic regimes could be prolonged differently for males and females to increase the prevalence of ciliates in captive populations. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Vasopressin is a neuropeptide that has been strongly implicated in the development and evolution of complex social relations and cognition in mammals. Recent studies in voles have shown that polymorphic variation in the promoter region of the arginine vasopressin V1a receptor gene (avpr1a) is associated with different dimensions of sociality. In humans, variation in a repetitive sequence element in the 5′ flanking region of the AVPR1A, known as RS3, have also been associated with variation in AVPR1a gene expression, brain activity and social behavior. Here, we examined the association of polymorphic variation in this same 5′ flanking region of the AVPR1A on subjective ratings of personality in a sample of 83 chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Initial analyses indicated that 34 females and 19 males were homozygous for the short allele, which lacks RS3 (DupB-/-), while 18 females and 12 males were heterozygous and thus had one copy of the long allele containing RS3 (DupB+/-), yielding overall allelic frequencies of 0.82 for the DupB- allele and 0.18 for the DupB+ allele. DupB+/+ chimpanzees were excluded from the analysis because of the limited number of individuals. Results indicated no significant sex difference in personality between chimpanzees homozygous for the deletion of the RS3-containing DupB region (DupB-/-); however, among chimpanzees carrying one allele with the DupB present (DupB+/-), males had significantly higher dominance and lower conscientiousness scores than females. These findings are the first evidence showing that the AVPR1A gene plays a role in different aspects of personality in male and female chimpanzees. © 2012 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Many primate populations currently live in forest fragments. These populations are often unhabituated, elusive, and contain few individuals, making them difficult to study through direct observation. Noninvasive genetic methods are useful for surveying these unhabituated populations to infer the number and sex of individuals and the genetic diversity of the population. We conducted genetic analysis on 70 fecal samples from eastern chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) in Gishwati Forest Reserve, a forest fragment in western Rwanda. We genotyped all but two of these samples using 12 autosomal and 13 Y-chromosome microsatellite markers previously used in analyses of other chimpanzee populations. The genetic data show that these samples represent a minimum of 19 individuals (7 females, 12 males). However, because we may not have sampled all individuals in the population, we also performed mark-recapture analysis with the genetic data and found that the entire population likely numbers between 19 and 29 individuals. These results are consistent with opportunistic observations of at least 19 individual chimpanzees. Levels of variation at the Y-chromosome microsatellites were similar to those observed in other chimpanzee communities, suggesting that the chimpanzees in this forest are members of a single community. These results provide a baseline count of the number of male and female chimpanzees in the Gishwati Forest Reserve, and the data provide the potential for follow-up studies aimed at tracking individuals over time, thus aiding conservation management of this unhabituated population. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

ABSTRACT: Background Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infects both humans and non-human primates, in experimentally infected chimpanzees is typically milder than in humans. In 1982, Abe and Shikata reported a first case of a chimpanzee with fulminant hepatitis caused by spontaneous HAV infection, and the underlying mechanisms of the disease remain unknown. Methods To characterize denoted CFH-HAV, we conducted cloning and near full-length sequence analysis. Results Phylogenetic analyses of VP1-2A and complete sequence comparison between various genotypes and the sample sequence showed clustering in genotype IB. Based on BLAST analysis, the sequence was most closely related to the wild-type (HM175/WT) isolate. Amino acid and nucleic acid similarities were 99.8% and 94.41%, respectively. Conclusions The chimpanzee may have been infected with human HAV genotype IB. The substitutions in VP2, VP4, 2B, 2C, and 3D, which may enhance virus proliferation, contributed to disease severity culminating in fulminant hepatic failure. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

ABSTRACT: For many years, experiments using chimpanzees have been instrumental in advancing scientific knowledge and have led to new medicines to prevent life-threatening and debilitating diseases. However, recent advances in alternate research tools have rendered chimpanzees largely unnecessary as research subjects. The Institute of Medicine, in collaboration with the National Research Council, conducted an in-depth analysis of the scientific necessity for chimpanzees in NIH-funded biomedical and behavioral research. The committee concludes that while the chimpanzee has been a valuable animal model in the past, most current biomedical research use of chimpanzees is not necessary, though noted that it is impossible to predict whether research on emerging or new diseases may necessitate chimpanzees in the future. © 2011 by the National Academy of Sciences.

ABSTRACT: Cultural transmission is a key component of human evolution. Two of humans' closest living relatives, chimpanzees and orangutans, have also been argued to transmit behavioral traditions across generations culturally [1-3], but how much the process might resemble the human process is still in large part unknown. One key phenomenon of human cultural transmission is majority-biased transmission: the increased likelihood for learners to end up not with the most frequent behavior but rather with the behavior demonstrated by most individuals. Here we show that chimpanzees and human children as young as 2 years of age, but not orangutans, are more likely to copy an action performed by three individuals, once each, than an action performed by one individual three times. The tendency to acquire the behaviors of the majority has been posited as key to the transmission of relatively safe, reliable, and productive behavioral strategies [4-7] but has not previously been demonstrated in primates. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: As a result of environmental variability, animals may be confronted with uncertainty surrounding the presence of, or accessibility to, food resources at a given location or time. While individuals can rely on personal experience to manage this variability, the behavior of members of an individual's social group can also provide information regarding the availability or location of a food resource. The purpose of the present study was to measure how captive chimpanzees individually and collectively adjust their foraging strategies at an artificial termite mound, as the availability of resources provided by the mound varied over a number of weeks. As predicted, fishing activity at the mound was related to resource availability. However, chimpanzees continued to fish at unbaited locations on the days and weeks after a location had last contained food. Consistent with previous studies, our findings show that chimpanzees do not completely abandon previously learned habits despite learning individually and/or socially that the habit is no longer effective. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: We investigated the acquisition of plant materials from which Nigerian chimpanzees manufacture wooden tools to harvest insects and honey from nests of army ants, honey bees and stingless bees. Slender trunks of juvenile trees and branches are most commonly used, and bendable vines rarely, probably reflecting the need to work with relatively sturdy tools to extract resources. While several tools are sometimes sourced from the same plant, there is also evidence for a depletion effect, as multiple tool sources at the same site are often spaced several metres apart. Identified tool sources belong to 27 species of at least 13 families. Honey-gathering implements are often chewed upon by chimpanzees. Interestingly, twigs of the most commonly used honey-gathering species possess antibacterial propensities and are favoured by Nigerians as chewing sticks. This suggests that extractive tools might possess associated medicinal or stimulatory properties. We do not know if chimpanzees actively select specific plant parts or species as we cannot compare observed with expected frequencies. Nevertheless, about three quarters of tools are picked from plants more than 6 m away from the extraction site, potentially indicating some degree of forward planning. Copyright © 2012 S.

ABSTRACT: We presented small groups of chimpanzees with two collective action situations, in which action was necessary for reward but there was a disincentive for individuals to act owing to the possibility of freeriding on the efforts of others. We found that in simpler scenarios (experiment 1) in which group size was small, there was a positive relationship between rank and action with more dominant individuals volunteering to act more often, particularly when the reward was less dispersed. Social tolerance also seemed to mediate action whereby higher tolerance levels within a group resulted in individuals of lower ranks sometimes acting and appropriating more of the reward. In more complex scenarios, when group size was larger and cooperation was necessary (experiment 2), overcoming the problem was more challenging. There was highly significant variability in the action rates of different individuals as well as between dyads, suggesting success was more greatly influenced by the individual personalities and personal relationships present in the group. © 2012 The Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: There have been conflicting arguments as to what happened in the human-chimpanzee speciation event. Patterson et al. (2006, Genetic evidence for complex speciation of humans and chimpanzees. Nature 441:1103-1108) proposed a hypothesis that the human-chimpanzee speciation event involved a complicated demographic process: that is, the ancestral lineages of humans and chimpanzees experienced temporal isolation followed by a hybridization event. This hypothesis stemmed from twomajor observations: a wide range of human-chimpanzee nucleotide divergence across the autosomal genome and very low divergence in the X chromosome. In contrast, Innan andWatanabe (2006, The effect of gene flow on the coalescent time in the human-chimpanzee ancestral population. Mol Biol Evol. 23:1040-1047) demonstrated that the null model of instantaneous speciation fits the genome-wide divergence data for the two species better than alternativemodels involving partial isolation andmigration. To reconcile these two conflicting reports, we first reexamined the analysis of autosomal data by Patterson et al. (2006). By providing a theoretical framework for their analysis, we demonstrated that their observation is what is theoretically expected under the nullmodel of instantaneous speciationwith a large ancestral population.Our analysis indicated that the observed wide range of autosomal divergence is simply due to the coalescent process in the large ancestral population of the two species. To further verify this, we developed a maximum likelihood function to detect evidence of hybridization in genome-wide divergence data. Again, the null model with no hybridization best fits the data. We conclude that the simplest speciationmodel with instantaneous split adequately describes the human-chimpanzee speciation event, and there is no strong reason to involve complicated factors in explaining the autosomal data. © The Author 2011.

ABSTRACT: Male chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, defend group territories, and sometimes injure or kill members of other groups. To test which factors best predict the occurrence and outcomes of intergroup encounters, we analysed 15. years of data on intergroup encounters, party composition, ranging and feeding behaviour in the Kanyawara community of chimpanzees, Kibale National Park, Uganda. During this time, researchers observed 120 intergroup encounters, most of which (85%) involved only acoustic contact. The majority of encounters (63%) occurred in the southeast quadrant of the range. Multiple logistic regression found that intergroup encounters occurred more often when chimpanzees were far from the centre of their range, especially in the south, and when eating foods that were most abundant in the south. Multiple linear regression found that chimpanzees travelled further from the centre of their range, and further south, when eating a few key foods, especially fruits of Uvariopsis congensis, and when in parties with more males. Upon hearing calls from foreign chimpanzees, Kanyawara chimpanzees were more likely to vocalize in response, and to travel towards the foreign chimpanzees, when they had more males in their party. Measures of two resource values, food and mates, were negatively correlated with the probability of vocalizing and approaching intruders, respectively. These findings indicate that, in this population, resources affect the timing of intergroup encounters, but the decision to escalate a contest depends mainly on numerical strength, rather than the value of resources being contested. © 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: Manipulations of the environments of captive nonhuman primates often have welfare consequences to the animals, including behavioral effects, and for certain manipulations, physiological effects as well. The processes of transporting, relocating, and acclimatizing nonhuman primates across facilities represent manipulations that are likely to have welfare, behavioral, and physiological consequences to the relocated animals. Seventy-two chimpanzees were relocated from the Primate Foundation of Arizona (PFA) in Arizona to the Keeling Center (KCCMR) in Texas. Animals were transported for approximately 21. h in single cages in a USDA-approved, climate-controlled trailer. Chimpanzees were weighed, anesthetized, and blood samples were collected (1) immediately prior to departure from PFA, (2) immediately upon arrival at the KCCMR, and (3) at additional time point(s) between 3 and 12 weeks after arrival at the KCCMR. Chimpanzees were quarantined in familiar pairs or social groups for 60-90 days at the KCCMR. Blood samples were analyzed for hematological and clinical chemistry parameters and compared across time points. In addition, samples from a subset of animals were assayed for cell-mediated immune parameters. Comparisons of the data obtained just prior to transport, to the data obtained immediately upon arrival, revealed numerous statistically significant differences in hematological, clinical chemistry, and immunological parameters. Some of these were indicative of stress, and thus, changes in welfare state, although many remained within the published normal ranges for chimpanzees. Additional analyses showed that many of the clinical chemistry values collected 3-12 weeks after arrival at the KCCMR had returned to pre-transport values. In contrast, of the cell-mediated immune parameters that were affected by transport and relocation, few had returned to pre-transport levels 8 weeks after transport, and three of the four hematology variables analyzed had not returned to pre-transport levels 12 weeks after transport. Comparisons of body weights before and immediately after transport revealed that animals lost an average of 2.5. kg during the 21-h transport, a statistically significant reduction that some animals never regained. These results demonstrate that transport and relocation affect a variety of physiological parameters with potential welfare implications and that some of these effects last as long as 3 months. These findings have important implications for the welfare and use of recently transported nonhuman primates, especially chimpanzees, in biomedical research. In order to allow animals to adapt to their new surroundings and to prevent unwanted confounds from influencing experiments, sufficient time must be provided after transport for chimpanzees to acclimatize. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Background: The PRDM9 locus in mammals has increasingly attracted research attention due to its role in mediating chromosomal recombination and possible involvement in hybrid sterility and hence speciation processes. The aim of this study was to characterize sequence variation at the PRDM9 locus in a sample of our closest living relatives, the chimpanzees and bonobos. Methodology/Principal Findings: PRDM9 contains a highly variable and repetitive zinc finger array. We amplified this domain using long-range PCR and determined the DNA sequences using conventional Sanger sequencing. From 17 chimpanzees representing three subspecies and five bonobos we obtained a total of 12 alleles differing at the nucleotide level. Based on a data set consisting of our data and recently published Pan PRDM9 sequences, we found that at the subspecies level, diversity levels did not differ among chimpanzee subspecies or between chimpanzee subspecies and bonobos. In contrast, the sample of chimpanzees harbors significantly more diversity at PRDM9 than samples of humans. Pan PRDM9 shows signs of rapid evolution including no alleles or ZnFs in common with humans as well as signals of positive selection in the residues responsible for DNA binding. Conclusions and Significance: The high number of alleles specific to the genus Pan, signs of positive selection in the DNA binding residues, and reported lack of conservation of recombination hotspots between chimpanzees and humans suggest that PRDM9 could be active in hotspot recruitment in the genus Pan. Chimpanzees and bonobos are considered separate species and do not have overlapping ranges in the wild, making the presence of shared alleles at the amino acid level between the chimpanzee and bonobo species interesting in view of the hypothesis that PRDM9 plays a universal role in interspecific hybrid sterility. © 2012 Groeneveld et al.

ABSTRACT: A major challenge for ancient DNA (aDNA) studies using museum specimens is that sampling procedures usually involve at least the partial destruction of each specimen used, such as the removal of skin, pieces of bone, or a tooth. Recently, a nondestructive DNA extraction method was developed for the extraction of amplifiable DNA fragments from museum specimens without appreciable damage to the specimen. Here, we examine the utility of this method by attempting DNA extractions from historic (older than 70 years) chimpanzee specimens. Using this method, we PCR-amplified part of the mitochondrial HVR-I region from 65% (56/86) of the specimens from which we attempted DNA extraction. However, we found a high incidence of multiple sequences in individual samples, suggesting substantial cross-contamination among samples, most likely originating from storage and handling in the museums. Consequently, reproducible sequences could be reconstructed from only 79% (44/56) of the successfully extracted samples, even after multiple extractions and amplifications. This resulted in an overall success rate of just over half (44/86 of samples, or 51% success), from which 39 distinct HVR-I haplotypes were recovered. We found a high incidence of C to T changes, arguing for both low concentrations of and substantial damage to the endogenous DNA. This chapter highlights both the potential and the limitations of nondestructive DNA extraction from museum specimens. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

ABSTRACT: Background: Malaria parasites (Plasmodium sp.), including new species, have recently been discovered as low grade mixed infections in three wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) sampled randomly in Kibale National Park, Uganda. This suggested a high prevalence of malaria infection in this community. The clinical course of malaria in chimpanzees and the species of the vectors that transmit their parasites are not known. The fact that these apes display a specific behaviour in which they consume plant parts of low nutritional value but that contain compounds with anti-malarial properties suggests that the apes health might be affected by the parasite. The avoidance of the night-biting anopheline mosquitoes is another potential behavioural adaptation that would lead to a decrease in the number of infectious bites and consequently malaria. Methods. Mosquitoes were collected over two years using suction-light traps and yeast-generated CO2 traps at the nesting and the feeding sites of two chimpanzee communities in Kibale National Park. The species of the female Anopheles caught were then determined and the presence of Plasmodium was sought in these insects by PCR amplification. Results: The mosquito catches yielded a total of 309 female Anopheles specimens, the only known vectors of malaria parasites of mammalians. These specimens belonged to 10 species, of which Anopheles implexus, Anopheles vinckei and Anopheles demeilloni dominated. Sensitive DNA amplification techniques failed to detect any Plasmodium-positive Anopheles specimens. Humidity and trap height influenced the Anopheles capture success, and there was a negative correlation between nest numbers and mosquito abundance. The anopheline mosquitoes were also less diverse and numerous in sites where chimpanzees were nesting as compared to those where they were feeding. Conclusions: These observations suggest that the sites where chimpanzees build their nests every night might be selected, at least in part, in order to minimize contact with anopheline mosquitoes, which might lead to a reduced risk in acquiring malaria infections. © 2012 Krief et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Background: The ability to invent means to deceive others, where the deception lies in the perceptually or contextually detached future, appears to require the coordination of sophisticated cognitive skills toward a single goal. Meanwhile innovation for a current situation has been observed in a wide range of species. Planning, on the one hand, and the social cognition required for deception on the other, have been linked to one another, both from a co-evolutionary and a neuroanatomical perspective. Innovation and deception have also been suggested to be connected in their nature of relying on novelty. Methodology/Principal Findings: We report on systematic observations suggesting innovation for future deception by a captive male chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes). As an extension of previously described behaviour - caching projectiles for later throwing at zoo visitors - the chimpanzee, again in advance, manufactured concealments from hay, as well as used naturally occurring concealments. All were placed near the visitors' observation area, allowing the chimpanzee to make throws before the crowd could back off. We observed what was likely the first instance of this innovation. Further observations showed that the creation of future-oriented concealments became the significantly preferred strategy. What is more, the chimpanzee appeared consistently to combine two deceptive strategies: hiding projectiles and inhibiting dominance display behaviour. Conclusions/Significance: The findings suggest that chimpanzees can represent the future behaviours of others while those others are not present, as well as take actions in the current situation towards such potential future behaviours. Importantly, the behaviour of the chimpanzee produced a future event, rather than merely prepared for an event that had been reliably re-occurring in the past. These findings might indicate that the chimpanzee recombined episodic memories in perceptual simulations. © 2012 Osvath, Karvonen.

ABSTRACT: During a population decline or disease outbreak, the true risk of specific diseases to a wild population is often difficult to determine because of a lack of baseline disease information. To better understand the risk of disease in an endangered and scientifically important population of chimpanzees (Pan trogylodytes schweinfurthii), a health monitoring program was initiated in Gombe National Park, Tanzania. As part of this health monitoring program, comprehensive necropsies with histopathology were conducted on chimpanzees (n = 11; 5 male, 6 female), ranging in age from fetal to 44 yr, that were found dead between August 2004 and January 2010. In contrast to previous reports, respiratory disease was not noted as a cause of morbidity or mortality. Trauma was the most common cause of death in these 11 chimpanzees. All of the chimpanzees greater than 1 yr of age had intestinal and mesenteric parasitic granulomas associated with true strongyles consistent with Oesophagostomum spp. The relative numbers of granulomas increased with age and, in some cases, may have been a cause of weight loss and diarrhea. Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)cpz infection was documented in four deceased apes, all of whom exhibited varying amounts of lymphoid depletion including two females with marked CD4+ T cell loss consistent with end-stage SIVmac or human immunodeficiency virus infections. Myocardial megalokaryosis was common in chimpanzees greater than 1 mo of age; yet myocardial interstitial fibrosis, a common lesion in captive chimpanzees, was uncommon and only noted in two aged chimpanzees. These findings provide important information on causes of morbidity and mortality in wild chimpanzees, information that can be used to interpret findings during population declines and lead to better management of this population in the context of disease risk.

ABSTRACT: Trophozoites of Troglocorys cava were detected in all but one of the wild chimpanzee populations from Rubondo Island (Tanzania), with a prevalence ranging between 20% and 78%. However, the ciliate was absent in all captive groups. Prevalence appeared to increase with the number of sequential samples taken from a particular individual and reached 95.5% in wild individuals sampled at least 4 times. © 2011 International Society of Protistologists.

ABSTRACT: The corpus callosum (CC) is the largest commissural white matter tract in mammalian brains, connecting homotopic and heterotopic regions of the cerebral cortex. Knowledge of the distribution of callosal fibers projecting into specific cortical regions has important implications for understanding the evolution of lateralized structures and functions of the cerebral cortex. No comparisons of CC topography in humans and great apes have yet been conducted. We investigated the topography of the CC in 21 chimpanzees using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Tractography was conducted based on fiber assignment by continuous tracking (FACT) algorithm. We expected chimpanzees to display topographical organization similar to humans, especially concerning projections into the frontal cortical regions. Similar to recent studies in humans, tractography identified five clusters of CC fibers projecting into defined cortical regions: prefrontal; premotor and supplementary motor; motor; sensory; parietal, temporal and occipital. Significant differences in fractional anisotropy (FA) were found in callosal regions, with highest FA values in regions projecting to higher-association areas of posterior cortical (including parietal, temporal and occipital cortices) and prefrontal cortical regions (p&0.001). The lowest FA values were seen in regions projecting into motor and sensory cortical areas. Our results indicate chimpanzees display similar topography of the CC as humans, in terms of distribution of callosal projections and microstructure of fibers as determined by anisotropy measures. © 2012 Phillips, Hopkins.

ABSTRACT: Grooming handclasp (GHC) behaviour was originally advocated as the first evidence of social culture in chimpanzees owing to the finding that some populations engaged in the behaviour and others do not. To date, however, the validity of this claim and the extent to which this social behaviour varies between groups is unclear. Here, we measured (i) variation, (ii) durability and (iii) expansion of the GHC behaviour in four chimpanzee communities that do not systematically differ in their genetic backgrounds and live in similar ecological environments. Ninety chimpanzees were studied for a total of 1029 h; 1394 GHC bouts were observed between 2010 and 2012. Critically, GHC style (defined by points of bodily contact) could be systematically linked to the chimpanzee's group identity, showed temporal consistency both within and between groups, and could not be accounted for by the arm-length differential between partners. GHC has been part of the behavioural repertoire of the chimpanzees under study for more than 9 years (surpassing durability criterion) and spread across generations (surpassing expansion criterion). These results strongly indicate that chimpanzees' social behaviour is not only motivated by innate predispositions and individual inclinations, but may also be partly cultural in nature. © 2012 The Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: To speculate how the extrinsic cardiac nerve plexus (ECNP) evolves phyletically and ontogenetically within the primate lineage, we conducted a comparative anatomical study of the ECNP, including an imaging examination in the great apes using 20 sides from 11 bodies from three species and a range of postnatal stages from newborns to mature adults. Although the position of the middle cervical ganglion (MG) in the great apes tended to be relatively lower than that in humans, the morphology of the ECNP in adult great apes was almost consistent with that in adult humans but essentially different from that in the lesser apes or gibbons. Therefore, the well-argued anatomical question of when did the MG acquire communicating branches with the spinal cervical nerves and appear constantly in all sympathetic cardiac nerves during primate evolution is clearly considered to be after the great apes and gibbons split. Moreover, a horizontal four-chambered heart and a lifted cardiac apex with a relatively large volume in newborn great apes rapidly changed its position downward, as seen in humans during postnatal growth and was associated with a reduction in the hepatic volume by imaging diagnosis and gross anatomy. In addition, our observation using a range of postnatal stages exhibits that two sympathetic ganglia, the middle cervical and cervicothoracic ganglia, differed between the early and later postnatal stages. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: In primates, specific facial displays (PF, play face; FPF, full play face) often accompany play bouts and are considered an integral part of play development. In humans, laughter, a universal expression of joy, seems to derive from non-human primate play faces and pant-like vocalizations. Playful facial displays may represent honest signals that express the non-agonistic intent of players in order to maintain the session at a later time. Here, we examine the possible roles of facial displays during play sessions of immature chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Infants and juveniles performed PF and FPF with comparable frequency to maintain the playful mood. However, the use of playful expressions was fine-tuned in relation to the asymmetry of the session and of the receiver's identity. In infants, whose play sessions were the most unbalanced, we found a positive correlation between the play face frequency and the asymmetry degree that characterizes each single session. On the other hand, in juveniles, we found that the most of the facial signals was directed towards peers. This result is not surprising also considering the high complexity and competition levels characterizing juvenile play in chimpanzees. Probably, when play becomes more competitive, as it occurs in juvenile chimpanzees and adolescent humans, clear and fair signals are essential to maintain the session and to avoid it turning into aggression. Therefore, like human laughter, playful expressions do not give simple information, but positively influence the receiver's reaction. Independently of the playmate age, in chimpanzees, play facial signals, may have a role in advertising cooperative dispositions and intentions thus increasing the likelihood of engaging in honest social relationships. In social play, there are codes of conduct that regulate what is permissible and what is not. The existence of shared codes in immature individuals might contribute in developing some traits of social morality in adults. © 2012, Societa Toscana di Scienze Naturali. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The increased number of primates living in fragmented habitats necessitates greater knowledge of how they cope with large-scale changes to their environment. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are exceptionally vulnerable to forest fragmentation; however, little is known about chimpanzee feeding ecology in fragments. Although chimpanzees have been shown to prefer fruit when it is available and fall back on more abundant lower quality foods during periods of fruit scarcity, our understanding of how chimpanzees use fallback foods in forest fragments is poor. We examined how chimpanzees cope with periods of fruit scarcity in Gishwati Forest Reserve, a disturbed montane rain forest fragment in Rwanda. We assessed seasonal changes in chimpanzee diet and the use of preferred and fallback foods through fecal and food site analysis. We also examined seasonal variation in nest group size and habitat use through marked nest censuses. We found that chimpanzees experienced a seasonal reduction in preferred fruit availability, which led to a seasonal diet shift to more fibrous foods, including several that functioned as fallback foods. Our results suggest that during periods of fruit scarcity the chimpanzees also reduced nest group size. However, we found that the chimpanzees did not alter their habitat use between high- and low-fruit seasons, which suggests that the small size of the forest limits their ability to change their seasonal habitat use. Consequently, fallback foods appear to be particularly important in small food-impoverished habitats with limited ranging options. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

ABSTRACT: Highly frugivorous primates like chimpanzees (Pan trogolodytes) must contend with temporal variation in food abundance and quality by tracking fruit crops and relying more on alternative foods, some of them fallbacks, when fruit is scarce. We used behavioral data from 122 months between 1995 and 2009 plus 12 years of phenology records to investigate temporal dietary variation and use of fallback foods by chimpanzees at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda. Fruit, including figs, comprised most of the diet. Fruit and fig availability varied seasonally, but the exact timing of fruit production and the amount of fruit produced varied extensively from year to year, both overall and within and among species. Feeding time devoted to all major fruit and fig species was positively associated with availability, reinforcing the argument that chimpanzees are ripe fruit specialists. Feeding time devoted to figs-particularly Ficus mucuso (the top food)-varied inversely with the abundance of nonfig fruits and with foraging effort devoted to such fruit. However, figs contributed much of the diet for most of the year and are best seen as staples available most of the time and eaten in proportion to availability. Leaves also contributed much of the diet and served as fallbacks when nonfig fruits were scarce. In contrast to the nearby Kanywara study site in Kibale, pith and stems contributed little of the diet and were not fallbacks. Fruit seasons (periods of at least 2 months when nonfig fruits account for at least 40% of feeding time; Gilby & Wrangham., Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology 61:1771-1779, 2007) were more common at Ngogo than Kanyawara, consistent with an earlier report that fruit availability varies less at Ngogo [Chapman et al., African Journal of Ecology 35:287-302, 1997]. F. mucuso is absent at Kanyawara; its high density at Ngogo, combined with lower variation in fruit availability, probably helps to explain why chimpanzee population density is much higher at Ngogo. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Ngamba Island Chimpanzee Sanctuary (NICS) in Lake Victoria, Uganda is currently home to 44 wild-borne, semi-captive chimpanzees. Despite regular veterinary health checks, it only came to light recently that many animals, and sanctuary staff, were naturally infected with Schistosoma mansoni. Indeed, local schistosome transmission appears firmly engrained for intermediate snail hosts can be found along almost the entirety of Ngamba's shoreline. Here, the epidemiology of infection is a dynamic interplay between human and chimpanzee populations, as revealed by genetic analyses of S. mansoni. In this review, our present understanding of this complex and evolving situation is discussed, alongside general disease control activities in Uganda, to highlight future interventions towards stopping schistosome morbidity and transmission within this conservation sanctuary setting. © 2012.

ABSTRACT: It has been speculated that cage mesh exerts a shaping influence on reaching behavior by captive apes, which is then misconstrued as pointing by human observers. Although this notion is clearly falsified by the pointing of captive language-trained apes-who point in the absence of intervening cage mesh-nevertheless, the degree to which cage mesh might influence pointing hand shapes by captive great apes in other housing environments remains relatively unexplored. We examined 259 pointing gestures displayed in archival footage from over 18 h of observation by three nonlanguage-trained chimpanzees housed at a biomedical research center. We coded points in relation to how close to the boundaries of the diamond-shaped cage mesh their points were displayed. We found that points with the whole hand were significantly more likely to be displayed away from the mesh boundaries, relative to points with the index finger or other single-digit points. However, points of each hand shape were displayed at each location, demonstrating that these physical parameters do not fully account for the number of fingers extended while pointing by chimpanzees. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: Humans comprehend the actions of others by making inferences about intentional mental states of another. However, little is known about how this capacity develops and whether this is shared with other animals. Here we show the ontogenetic and evolutionary foundations of this ability by comparing the eye movements of 8-and 12-month-old human infants, adults and chimpanzees as they watched videos presenting goal-directed and non-goal-directed actions by an actor. We find that chimpanzees anticipate action goals in the same way as do human adults. Humans and chimpanzees, however, scan goal-directed actions differently. Humans, particularly infants, refer to actors' faces significantly more than do chimpanzees. In human adults, attentional allocation to an actor's face changes as the goal-directed actions proceed. In the case of non-goal-directed actions, human adults attend less often to faces relative to goal-directed actions. These findings indicate that humans have a predisposition to observe goal-directed actions by integrating information from the actor. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Modification of natural areas by human activities mostly has a negative impact on wildlife by increasing the geographical and ecological overlap between people and animals. This can result in escalating levels of competition and conflict between humans and wildlife, for example over crops. However, data on specific crops and crop parts that are unattractive to wildlife yet important for human livelihoods are surprisingly scarce, especially considering their potential application to reducing crop damage by wildlife. Here we examine the co-utilization of a nationally important and spatially abundant cash crop, cashew Anacardium occidentalis, by people and chimpanzees Pan troglodytes verus inhabiting a forested-agricultural matrix in Cantanhez National Park in Guinea-Bissau. In this Park people predominantly harvest the marketable cashew nut and discard the unprofitable fruit whereas chimpanzees only consume the fruit. Local farmers generally perceive a benefit of raiding by chimpanzees as they reportedly pile the nuts, making harvesting easier. By ensuring that conflict levels over crops, especially those with high economic importance, remain low, the costs of living in proximity to wildlife can potentially be reduced. Despite high levels of deforestation associated with cashew farming, these findings point to the importance of cashew as a low-conflict crop in this area. © 2012 Fauna & Flora International.

ABSTRACT: Despite the spread of human-impacted wildlife habitats, few studies have examined how animals adapt their socioecology in agricultural-forest ecotones. Anthropogenic processes such as agricultural development directly affect the ecological challenges that species face. In agricultural-forest ecotones cultivated foods that are palatable, energy-rich, easily digestible, and that often occur as large, clumped and spatially abundant orchards or fields may offer foraging advantages over natural foods. However, crop raiding can be risky: harassment, injury or even death may arise from confrontations with people. The factors that affect grouping decisions and activity budgets within anthropogenic environments are unknown. Twelve months of focal data were collected from direct observations of one chimpanzee community inhabiting a forest-farm mosaic at Bossou, Guinea. Wild fruit abundance did not directly influence daily party size. Instead, cultivated resource consumption, in combination with other social factors, provided chimpanzees with an alternative to fissioning. Chimpanzee party size did not differ between crop raids and wild feeds, but party cohesiveness did increase during raids. Furthermore, males and females adapted their activity budgets in different ways to integrate cultivated resources into their broader ecological strategy. As species are increasingly forced into anthropogenically impacted habitats, models of fission-fusion dynamics and other socioecological adaptations need to take into account exploitation of cultivated, energy-rich crops. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: Background Air sacculitis is an important clinical condition in non-human primates. Methods We evaluated 37 baboons and seven chimpanzees with spontaneous air sacculitis submitted to pathology over a 20-year period. Results Air sacculitis was observed almost exclusively in males. Common reported signs were halitosis, coughing, nasal discharges, depression, anorexia, and weight loss. Gross lesions included thickened air sacs and suppurative exudate lining the walls. Microscopic lesions included marked epithelial hyperplasia or hypertrophy, necrosis, fibrosis, cellular infiltrates, and bacterial colonies. Mixed bacterial infections were more common than infections by single species of bacteria. Streptococcus sp. was the most frequent bacteria isolated in both baboons and chimpanzees. Conclusions This is the first report describing the gross and microscopic lesions of air sacculitis in chimpanzees. The preponderance of males suggests a male sex predilection in baboons. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

ABSTRACT: Long-term human-wildlife sympatry depends on the willingness and capacity of local people to coexist with wild animals. With human population growth and deforestation for agriculture, farmers increasingly live in proximity to wildlife, including large mammals of conservation concern. Understanding local perspectives and concerns regarding wildlife is essential for informing appropriate management strategies that reduce conflicts and promote sustainable coexistence. Social science approaches therefore have a critical role in integrated conservation programmes. We undertook an attitude survey to understand residents' perspectives about sharing a landscape with chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in an unprotected forest-agriculture mosaic in Uganda. Interviews (n=134) in 12 villages demonstrate residents' ambivalence towards living alongside these protected yet potentially troublesome mammals. Chimpanzee behaviour is reported to have undergone recent changes. Residents claim apes increasingly enter villages for food, threaten people, and pose a particular threat to children's safety. Chimpanzee numbers are believed to have increased locally. Most interviewees fear chimpanzees, considering them dangerous. Crop losses to chimpanzees were widely reported. Farmers tolerate raiding of domestic fruits, but not cash-crops. Results demonstrate that attitudes towards wildlife are not fixed. Reported changes to chimpanzee behaviour are challenging villagers' traditionally benign attitude towards them. Even so, residents acknowledge benefits to chimpanzees because they reportedly displace other crop-raiding wildlife which, unlike chimpanzees, damage important staple food crops. Survey findings are contextualised with respect to recent, major land-use changes in Uganda (clearance of unprotected forest for timber and agriculture) that have precipitated a sharp rise in farmer-chimpanzee interactions. We discuss the study's broader implications for protected mammal management and conflict mitigation in human-dominated landscapes, and ask whether it is appropriate to expect impoverished rural farmers to accommodate large-bodied mammals that pose a potential threat to their safety and livelihoods. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

ABSTRACT: Conversational interactions depend on partners making contingent responses. This experiment examined the responses of five chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), Washoe, Moja, Tatu, Dar and Loulis, to four conversational conditions. Following the chimpanzee's request, a human interlocutor either: (1) complied with the request, (2) provided an unrequested item or activity, (3) refused to comply or (4) did not respond to the request. The chimpanzees' responses were contingent on the conversational input of the interlocutor. When their requests were satisfied, the chimpanzees most often ceased signing. However, when their requests were misunderstood, refused or not acknowledged, the chimpanzees repeated and revised. This pattern of responses is comparable to patterns of conversational responses in human children. © 2012 John Benjamins Publishing Company.

ABSTRACT: We examined the ability of bonobos, Pan paniscus (N= 39), and chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes (N= 74), to infer the target of an experimenter's visual attention in a series of three experiments. In each experiment subjects were first introduced to a novel object while an experimenter's (E1) visual access to this object was manipulated by (1) having E1 orient towards or away from the object, (2) positioning a visual occluder that did or did not block E1's view of the object, or (3) substituting a different experimenter for E1 during the introduction phase of the trial. After subjects were introduced to the objects in one of these ways, E1 vocalized excitedly while gazing ambiguously towards the previously introduced target object and a second location on the same visual plane. In each experiment we measured whether subjects looked at the object or the alternative target of the E1's gaze. We predicted that if subjects recognized when E1 was previously familiar with the object, they would search for an alternative target of his attention more frequently in these trials. In all three contexts, chimpanzees, and in one context, bonobos, behaved consistently with this prediction. These results are not easily explained by learning or behaviour-reading hypotheses because responses were never rewarded, few trials were conducted per subject, and the experimenter's behaviour was the same across experimental conditions at the moment subjects were required to respond. Therefore, similar to human infants, subjects most likely remembered what the experimenter had or had not seen in the past, allowing them to infer the target of his attention in the present. © 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: The construction of nests (or beds) for sleeping is a chimpanzee universal, yet little is known about the adaptive function of nest-building. We present an in-depth study of nest-building by unhabituated chimpanzees at the Seringbara study site in the Nimba Mountains, Guinea, West Africa. We recorded 1520 chimpanzee nests over 28 mo during three study periods between 2003 and 2008. We investigated where chimpanzees built their nests, both across the home range and in nest trees, and assessed how altitude and habitat type affected nest site selectivity. We examined whether or not chimpanzees were selective in nest tree choice regarding physical tree characteristics and tree species and assessed plant species preference for both tree- and ground-nesting. We tested three, nonmutually exclusive, hypotheses for the function of arboreal nest-building. We assessed whether selectivity for nest tree characteristics reflected an antipredator strategy, examined whether nesting patterns (both arboreal and terrestrial) and nesting height were influenced by variation in climatic conditions (temperature, humidity, wind), and measured mosquito densities at ground level and in trees at 10 m and related mosquito densities to nesting patterns. Chimpanzees preferred to nest above 1000 m and nested mainly in primary forest. They preferred relatively large trees with a low first branch, dense canopy, and small leaves and showed preference for particular tree species, which was stable across years, whereas plant choice for ground-nesting was largely based on plant availability. We found no support for the antipredation hypothesis, nor did mosquito densities explain arboreal nest-building. The thermoregulation hypothesis was supported, as both nesting patterns and nest-height variation across seasons reflected a humidity-avoidance strategy. Chimpanzees nested higher in trees and at higher altitudes in the wet season. In sum, chimpanzees were selective in their choice of nest sites, locations, and materials, and tree-nesting patterns at Seringbara were best explained by a thermoregulation strategy of humidity avoidance. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

ABSTRACT: Transferring food is considered a defining characteristic of humans, as such behavior is relatively uncommon in other animal species save for kin-based transfer. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are one exception, as they commonly transfer meat among nonrelatives but rarely transfer other resources. New observations at Fongoli, Senegal, show habitual transfer of wild-plant foods and other non-meat resources among community members beyond transfers from mother to offspring. We explore various explanations for these behaviors with a focus on age- and sex-class patterns in transfer events. In a total of 27 of 41 cases, male chimpanzees at Fongoli transferred wild-plant foods or tools to females. Most other cases involved transfer among males or males taking food from females. In light of male-female transfer patterns at Fongoli, we examine four hypotheses that have been applied to food transfer in apes: (1) testing for male-coercive tendency (van Noordwijk and van Schaik, Behav Ecol Sociobiol 63:883-890, 2009), (2) costly signaling (Hockings et al. PLoS ONE 2:e886, 2007), (3) food-for-sex (Gomes and Boesch, PLoS ONE 4:5116, 2009), and (4) sharing-under-pressure (Gilby, Anim Behav 71:953-963, 2006). We also consider hypotheses posed to explain transfer among callitrichids, where such behavior is more common (Ruiz-Miranda et al. Am J Primatol 48:305-320, 1999). Finally, we examine variables such as patch and food size and food transport. We discuss our findings relative to general patterns of non-meat transfer in Pan and examine them in the context of chimpanzee sociality in particular. We then contrast chimpanzee species and subspecies in terms of non-meat food and tool transfer and address the possibility that a savanna environment contributes to the unusual pattern observed at Fongoli. © 2011 Japan Monkey Centre and Springer.

ABSTRACT: Clear hand laterality patterns in humans are widely accepted. However, humans only elicit a significant hand laterality pattern when performing complementary role differentiation (CRD) tasks. Meanwhile, hand laterality in chimpanzees is weaker and controversial. Here we have reevaluated our results on hand laterality in chimpanzees housed in naturalistic environments at Fundaci Mona (Spain) and Chimfunshi Wild Orphanage (Zambia). Our results show that the difference between hand laterality in humans and chimpanzees is not as great as once thought. Furthermore, we found a link between hand laterality and task complexity and also an even more interesting connection: CRD tasks elicited not only the hand laterality but also the use of tools. This paper aims to turn attention to the importance of this threefold connection in human evolution: the link between CRD tasks, hand laterality, and tool use, which has important evolutionary implications that may explain the development of complex behaviour in early hominins.

ABSTRACT: It has been hypothesized that neurological adaptations associated with evolutionary selection for throwing may have served as a precursor for the emergence of language and speech in early hominins. Although there are reports of individual differences in aimed throwing in wild and captive apes, to date there has not been a single study that has examined the potential neuroanatomical correlates of this very unique tool-use behaviour in non-human primates. In this study, we examined whether differences in the ratio of white (WM) to grey matter (GM) were evident in the homologue to Broca's area as well as the motor-hand area of the precentral gyrus (termed the KNOB) in chimpanzees that reliably throw compared with those that do not. We found that the proportion of WM in Broca's homologue and the KNOB was significantly higher in subjects that reliably throw compared with those that do not. We further found that asymmetries in WM within both brain regions were larger in the hemisphere contralateral to the chimpanzee's preferred throwing hand. We also found that chimpanzees that reliably throw show significantly better communication abilities than chimpanzees that do not. These results suggest that chimpanzees that have learned to throw have developed greater cortical connectivity between primary motor cortex and the Broca's area homologue. It is suggested that during hominin evolution, after the split between the lines leading to chimpanzees and humans, there was intense selection on increased motor skills associated with throwing and that this potentially formed the foundation for left hemisphere specialization associated with language and speech found in modern humans. © 2011 The Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Troglodytella abrassarti is an intestinal entodiniomorphid ciliate commonly diagnosed in the feces of wild and captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Entodiniomorphids could be considered to have a mutualistic relationship with the great apes, in that the ciliates benefit from the intestinal ecosystem of the host, while also contributing to the fiber fermentation process. We examined the effect of diet on the infection intensities of T. abrassarti in two captive chimpanzees in the Liberec Zoo, Czech Republic. The chimpanzees were fed a low-fiber diet (LFD) with 14% neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and a high-fiber diet (HFD; 26% NDF) for 10 days with one transition, and two 10-day adaptation periods. Fecal samples were examined coproscopically with the merthiolate-iodine-formaldehyde concentration (MIFC) technique, in order to quantify the number of ciliates per gram of feces. A significant trend of increasing T. abrassarti numbers was observed when the animals were fed the LFD, compared to when they were fed the HFD. Our results suggest, however, that infection intensities of T. abrassarti in captive chimpanzees are not influenced primarily by the amount of fiber in the diet, but rather by the dietary starch concentration (HFD: 1%; LFD: 8%). © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: In order to assess the impact of human activities on chimpanzee behavior, we compared reactions to humans of Eastern chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) living in proximity to and at a distance from roads and settlements in the Bili-Uele landscape in Northern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). We found that chimpanzees in the remote Gangu Forest were more likely to show curious or neutral reactions to us and were less likely to flee than those living closer to roads. In addition, arboreal contact durations with Gangu chimpanzees lasted significantly longer than elsewhere. The most likely explanation for this phenomenon is that with increasing distance from roads, chimpanzees have in the recent past had fewer negative encounters with humans, and thus never learned to fear them. The discovery of this population of "naïve chimpanzees" presents us with an important research and conservation opportunity that may result in the installation of a long-term research site and increased protection of the population. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzee responses to the death of a group member have rarely been observed in the wild and most instances involve infant deaths. One of the very few detailed accounts of a group's response to the death of an adult community member is from Gombe National Park, Tanzania, where Teleki [Folia Primatologica 20:81-94, 1973] observed the responses of 16 chimpanzees to an accidental death, none of whom touched the body. Now, almost 40 years later, we report on the behaviors of 16 (different) Gombe individuals to the recently dead body of an adult female community member. In stark contrast to Teleki's account, we observed individual chimpanzees' responses to range from curious observation and passive investigation (e.g. smelling and grooming) to the shaking, dragging, and frustrated beating of the body. Variation across demographic groups is described and may reflect individuals' past experience with death. The implications of our observations are discussed in the context of core morbidity traits shared between humans and chimpanzees. Am. J. Primatol. 74:1-7, 2012. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Background: Although humans and chimpanzees have accumulated significant differences in a number of phenotypic traits since diverging from a common ancestor about six million years ago, their genomes are more than 98.5% identical at protein-coding loci. This modest degree of nucleotide divergence is not sufficient to explain the extensive phenotypic differences between the two species. It has been hypothesized that the genetic basis of the phenotypic differences lies at the level of gene regulation and is associated with the extensive insertion and deletion (INDEL) variation between the two species. To test the hypothesis that large INDELs (80 to 12,000 bp) may have contributed significantly to differences in gene regulation between the two species, we categorized human-chimpanzee INDEL variation mapping in or around genes and determined whether this variation is significantly correlated with previously determined differences in gene expression. Results: Extensive, large INDEL variation exists between the human and chimpanzee genomes. This variation is primarily attributable to retrotransposon insertions within the human lineage. There is a significant correlation between differences in gene expression and large human-chimpanzee INDEL variation mapping in genes or in proximity to them. Conclusions: The results presented herein are consistent with the hypothesis that large INDELs, particularly those associated with retrotransposons, have played a significant role in human-chimpanzee regulatory evolution. © 2011 Polavarapu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Over a 5-y period, 3 chimpanzees at our institution experienced cerebrovascular accidents (strokes). In light of the increasing population of aged captive chimpanzees and lack of literature documenting the prevalence and effectiveness of various treatments for stroke in chimpanzees, we performed a retrospective review of the medical records and necropsy reports from our institution. A survey was sent to other facilities housing chimpanzees that participate in the Chimpanzee Species Survival Plan to inquire about their experience with diagnosing and treating stroke. This case report describes the presentation, clinical signs, and diagnosis of stroke in 3 recent cases and in historical cases at our institution.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are ecologically flexible omnivores with broad diets comprising many plant and animal foods, although they mostly eat fruit (including figs). Like other ecologically flexible nonhuman primates (e.g., baboons, Papio spp.) with broad diets, their diets vary across habitats. Much data on diets come from short studies that may not capture the range of variation, however, and data are scant on variation within habitats and populations. We present data on diet composition and diversity for chimpanzees at Ngogo, in Kibale National Park, Uganda, collected over a 15-year period, with a focus on the plant components of the diet. We compare Ngogo data to those on chimpanzees at the nearby Kibale site of Kanyawara, on other chimpanzee populations, and on some other frugivorous-omnivorous primates. Results support the argument that chimpanzees are ripe fruit specialists: Ngogo chimpanzees ate a broad, mostly fruit-based diet, feeding time devoted to fruit varied positively with fruit availability, and diet diversity varied inversely with fruit availability. Comparison of Ngogo and Kanyawara shows much similarity, but also pronounced within-population dietary variation. Chimpanzees fed much more on leaves, and much less on pith and stems, at Ngogo. Figs accounted for somewhat less feeding time at Ngogo, but those of Ficus mucuso were quantitatively the most important food. This species is essentially absent at Kanayawara; its abundance and high productivity at Ngogo, along with much higher abundance of several other important food species, help explain why chimpanzee community size and population density are over three times higher at Ngogo. High inter-annual variation at Ngogo highlights the value of long-term data for documenting the extent of ecological variation among chimpanzee populations and understanding how such variation might affect population biology and social dynamics. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

ABSTRACT: It is considered of significant importance to provide wild animals in captivity with environmental enrichment elements to improve their psychological and physiological well being, stimulating a higher activity and behavioral variety. This study evaluated the effect of different enrichment elements (explorative/ manipulative, physical and feeding enrichment devices) on the behavior and physiology of two groups of great apes, gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) at the Zoo-Aquarium of Madrid. The proposed prediction was that there would be a reduction of inactivity, anomalous and nondesired behavior, also on cortisol levels, as a result of the stimular improvements. The behaviors and cortisol faecal levels were compared between two different conditions: 1. previous phase without enrichment, 2. enrichment phase. The data analysis allowed measuring the efficiency of the enrichment, revealing that the frequency of inactivity and anomalous behaviors was significantly reduced in the enrichment phase. On the other hand, the frequency of exploratory-manipulative behavior increased in both species, whereas locomotors and feeding behaviors were reduced in gorillas but increased in chimpanzees. Also, the preferences of chimpanzees and gorillas for the diverse enrichments elements were different. In relation to the levels of cortisol, the results do not support the proposal for the initial hypothesis, both in the case of chimpanzees as in the case of gorillas, it had increased to such levels in the enrichment phase, the increase being significant just in the gorillas. The results on the behavioral parameters are consistent with the hypothesis because there is improvement induced by environmental enrichment.

ABSTRACT: Bacterial airsacculitis has been reported in a variety of nonhuman primates, and is widely treated using a combination of surgery and oral antibiotics. This case study details an alternative method of administering antibiotics (via the use of a nebulizer) when the chimpanzee subject developed resistance to all available oral preparations. Training the chimpanzee to use the nebulizer was performed using positive reinforcement techniques (PRT). It took a total of 89 sessions (<7hr 25min) to train the chimpanzee to use the nebulizer. The airsacculitis infection was treated using colistin in the nebulizer twice a day for 9 days. Out of 18 potential treatment sessions, full doses were administered on 13 occasions. The final dose of colistin was given via slow brachial intravenous injection under general anesthesia. The infection was successfully treated with colistin. Although there was a training time investment involved, it was felt to be outweighed by the success of the treatment. Also in the likelihood of the infection re-occurring at a later date, the now learnt behavior of using a nebulizer means that future treatment should now be considerably quicker. This is another example of how PRT is a useful tool in the successful welfare and management of captive animals. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Socioecological theory suggests that feeding competition shapes female social relationships. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) live in fission-fusion societies that allow them to react flexibly to increased feeding competition by forming smaller foraging parties when food is scarce. In chimpanzees at Gombe and Kibale, female dominance rank can crucially influence feeding competition and reproductive success as high-ranking females monopolize core areas of relatively high quality, are more gregarious, and have higher body mass and reproductive success than low-ranking females. Chimpanzee females in Taï National Park do not monopolize core areas; they use the entire territory as do the males of their community and are highly gregarious. Although female chimpanzees in Taï generally exhibit a linear dominance hierarchy benefits of high rank are currently not well understood. We used a multivariate analysis of long-term data from two Taï chimpanzee communities to test whether high-ranking females (1) increase gregariousness and (2) minimize their travel costs. We found that high-ranking females were more gregarious than low-rankers only when food was scarce. During periods of food scarcity, high rank allowed females to enjoy benefits of gregariousness, while low-ranking females strongly decreased their gregariousness. High-ranking females traveled more than low-ranking females, suggesting that low-rankers might follow a strategy to minimize energy expenditure. Our results suggest that, in contrast to other chimpanzee populations and depending on the prevailing ecological conditions, female chimpanzees at Taï respond differently to varying levels of feeding competition. Care needs to be taken before generalizing results found in any one chimpanzee population to the species level. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Locating activity hotspots - areas of higher density, more intense use, or distinct social units - is a prerequisite for answering many questions in animal ecology. However, for many species, carrying out such research from direct observations in tropical habitat is time-consuming and unrealistic for non-habituated animals. This study aimed to locate chimpanzee home ranges from transect nest counts. For validation purposes, 233 line transects were sampled within the home ranges of four habituated social groups of chimpanzees in Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire. In total, 373 km of transects were surveyed over 188 days and 683 nests of chimpanzee were recorded. First, we characterized heterogeneity of nest distribution patterns, including variation in density and group size within the area. Second, we used scan statistics, a likelihood-based cluster technique to locate chimpanzee social groups and compared them with the known home range boundaries. Chimpanzee nest distribution was characterized by a positive density and group-size gradient away from the range periphery. Furthermore, nest distribution clusters corresponding to the four groups could be successfully identified, although additional clusters for, for example, low-density areas between social groups seem to be an unavoidable by-product. The approach taken can be extended to a wide spectrum of data stemming from direct observations, camera traps, acoustic or genetic sampling to derive information about structure and patchiness of wild animal populations. © Cambridge University Press 2011.

ABSTRACT: A long-standing debate concerns whether humans are specialized for speech perception [1-7], which some researchers argue is demonstrated by the ability to understand synthetic speech with significantly reduced acoustic cues to phonetic content [2-4, 7]. We tested a chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) that recognizes 128 spoken words [8, 9], asking whether she could understand such speech. Three experiments presented 48 individual words, with the animal selecting a corresponding visuographic symbol from among four alternatives. Experiment 1 tested spectrally reduced, noise-vocoded (NV) synthesis, originally developed to simulate input received by human cochlear-implant users [10]. Experiment 2 tested "impossibly unspeechlike" [3] sine-wave (SW) synthesis, which reduces speech to just three moving tones [11]. Although receiving only intermittent and noncontingent reward, the chimpanzee performed well above chance level, including when hearing synthetic versions for the first time. Recognition of SW words was least accurate but improved in experiment 3 when natural words in the same session were rewarded. The chimpanzee was more accurate with NV than SW versions, as were 32 human participants hearing these items. The chimpanzee's ability to spontaneously recognize acoustically reduced synthetic words suggests that experience rather than specialization is critical for speech-perception capabilities that some have suggested are uniquely human [12-14]. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The transmission of simian immunodeficiency and Ebola viruses to humans in recent years has heightened awareness of the public health significance of zoonotic diseases of primate origin, particularly from chimpanzees. In this study, we analyzed 71 fecal samples collected from 2 different wild chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) populations with different histories in relation to their proximity to humans. Campylobacter spp. were detected by culture in 19/56 (34%) group 1 (human habituated for research and tourism purposes at Mahale Mountains National Park) and 0/15 (0%) group 2 (not human habituated but propagated from an introduced population released from captivity over 30 years ago at Rubondo Island National Park) chimpanzees, respectively. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, all isolates were virtually identical (at most a single base difference), and the chimpanzee isolates were most closely related to Campylobacter helveticus and Campylobacter upsaliensis (94.7% and 95.9% similarity, respectively). Wholecell protein profiling, amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis of genomic DNA, hsp60 sequence analysis, and determination of the mol% G+C content revealed two subgroups among the chimpanzee isolates. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments confirmed that both subgroups represented distinct genomic species. In the absence of differential biochemical characteristics and morphology and identical 16S rRNA gene sequences, we propose to classify all isolates into a single novel nomenspecies, Campylobacter troglodytis, with strain MIT 05-9149 as the type strain; strain MIT 05-9157 is suggested as the reference strain for the second C. troglodytis genomovar. Further studies are required to determine whether the organism is pathogenic to chimpanzees and whether this novel Campylobacter colonizes humans and causes enteric disease. © 2011, American Society for Microbiology.

ABSTRACT: Function of non-B DNA structures are poorly understood though several bioinformatics studies predict role of the G-quadruplex DNA structure in transcription. Earlier, using transcriptome profiling we found evidence of widespread G-quadruplex-mediated gene regulation. Herein, we asked whether potential G-quadruplex (PG4) motifs associate with transcription factors (TF). This was analyzed using 220 position weight matrices [designated as transcription factor binding sites (TFBS)], representing 187 unique TF, in >75000 genes in human, chimpanzee, mouse and rat. Results show binding sites of nine TFs, including that of AP-2, SP1, MAZ and VDR, occurred significantly within 100 bases of the PG4 motif (P<1.24E-10). PG4-TFBS combinations were conserved in 'orthologously' related promoters across all four organisms and were associated with >850 genes in each genome. Remarkably, seven of the nine TFs were zinc-finger binding proteins indicating a novel characteristic of PG4 motifs. To test these findings, transcriptome profiles from human cell lines treated with G-quadruplex-specific molecules were used; 66 genes were significantly differentially expressed across both cell-types, which also harbored conserved PG4 motifs along with one/more of the nine TFBS. In addition, genes regulated by PG4-TFBS combinations were found to be co-regulated in human tissues, further emphasizing the regulatory significance of the associations. © 2011 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Animals of many species show consistency in behaviour across time and contexts that differs from other individuals' behaviour in the same population. Such 'personality' affects fitness and has therefore become an increasingly relevant research topic in biology. However, consistent variation in social behaviour is understudied. In socially living species, behaviour occurs in a social environment and social interactions have a significant influence on individual fitness. This study addressed personality in social behaviour of 75 captive chimpanzees in three zoos by coding observed behaviour. Fifteen behavioural variables were significantly repeatable (range 0. 21-0. 93) in at least two of the three zoos. The behaviours showed considerable long-term stability across 3 years, which did not differ from the short-term repeatability. The repeatable behaviours were then analysed with factor analyses. They formed five independent factors, three of which consisted of social traits and were labelled 'sociability', 'positive affect' and 'equitability'. The two non-social behaviour factors were labelled 'anxiety' and 'activity'. The factor scores were analysed for sex and population differences. Males had higher factor scores in all traits except 'sociability'. The factor scores differed also between the zoos, implying considerable external effects in trait expression. The results show that chimpanzees show personality in a broad range of social and non-social behaviours. The study highlights the importance of assessing personality in the social behaviour, especially in cohesive social species, as only then can we understand the consequences of personality in socially living species. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: Group-living animals frequently face situations in which they must coordinate individual and sometimes conflicting goals. We assessed chimpanzees' ability to coordinate in a Stag Hunt game. Dyads were confronted with a situation in which each individual was already foraging on a low-value food (hare) when a high-value food (stag) appeared that required collaboration for retrieval, with a solo attempt to get the stag resulting in a loss of both options. In one condition visibility between partners was open whereas in the other it was blocked by a barrier. Regardless of condition, dyads almost always (91%) coordinated to choose the higher valued collaborative option. Intentional communication or monitoring of the partner's behavior before decision making-characteristic of much human coordination-were limited. Instead, all dyads adopted a leader-follower strategy in which one partner took the risk of going first, presumably predicting that this would induce the other to join in (sometimes communicating if she was slow to do so). These results show that humans' closest primate relatives do not use complex communication to coordinate but most often use a less cognitively complex strategy that achieves the same end. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

ABSTRACT: Many aspects of personality are honestly signaled on the human face, as shown by accurate identification of personality traits from static images of unknown faces with neutral expressions. Here, we examined the evolutionary history of this signal system. In four studies, we found that untrained human observers reliably discriminated characteristics related to extraversion solely from nonexpressive facial images of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). In chimpanzees, as in humans, there is therefore information in the static, nonexpressive face that signals aspects of an individual's personality. We suggest that this performance is best explained by shared personality structure and signaling in the two species. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in chimpanzees, but its etiology and clinical presentations remain poorly understood. The disease in chimpanzees differs sufficiently from that in humans that simple extrapolation from human findings are inadequate to guide clinical diagnoses. Nevertheless, the burden of disease posed by CVD made it important to attempt to identify specific chimpanzees at risk of developing CVD to allow clinical intervention prior to clinical presentation of advanced disease. We screened 4 CVD biomarkers used in human and veterinary medicine to identify markers with prognostic value in chimpanzees. Biomarkers included complete lipid panel, C-reactive protein, brain-type natriuretic protein, and cardiac troponin I. Serum levels of brain-type natriuretic protein differed between chimpanzees with CVD and heart-healthy controls. Cardiac troponin I gave mixed results. C-reactive protein and lipid panel values were not informative for cardiovascular disease, although total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides increased significantly with decade of life. Values of brain-type natriuretic protein exceeding 163 mg/mL had a specificity of 90.5% for CVD, whereas levels of cardiac troponin I above the threshold of detection (0.20 ng/mL) appeared to be clinically relevant. More extensive clinical studies are recommended to validate these specific values. We conclude that brain-type natriuretic protein and possibly cardiac troponin I are useful diagnostic biomarkers for incipient CVD processes in chimpanzees.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees engage in a number of group activities, but it is still unclear to what extent they prefer mutualistic collaborative strategies over individual strategies to achieve their goals. In one experiment, we gave chimpanzees the choice between pulling a platform to within reach either individually or collaboratively with a tolerant partner, both strategies having equivalent payoffs. Overall, chimpanzees preferred the individual option, and this preference was independent of the type of reward for which they were working (food or tool). In a second experiment, chimpanzees switched to the collaboration option as soon as the payoff was increased for this option. These results suggest that chimpanzees prefer to work alone in foraging-like situations and choose collaboration only if it maximizes their reward. These results thus make a strong case for the hypothesis that differences between humans' and chimpanzees' collaboration are to a great extent due to motivational differences. © 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: Motivation: There have been several studies on the micro-inversions between human and chimpanzee, but there are large discrepancies among their results. Furthermore, all of them rely on alignment procedures or existing alignment results to identify inversions. However, the core alignment procedures do not take very small inversions into consideration. Therefore, their analyses cannot find inversions that are too small to be detected by a classic aligner. We call such inversions pico-inversions.Results: We re-analyzed human-chimpanzee alignment from the UCSC Genome Browser for micro-inplace-inversions and screened for pico-inplace-inversions using a likelihood ratio test. We report that the quantity of inplace-inversions between human and chimpanzee is substantially greater than what had previously been discovered. We also present the software tool PicoInversionMiner to detect pico-inplace-inversions between closely related species. © The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Genetic factors such as the MHC influence the immunocompetence of an individual. MHC genes are the most polymorphic genes in primates, which is often interpreted as an adaptation to establish good T cell responses to a wide range of (evolving) pathogens. ChimpanzeeMHC(Patr) genes are less polymorphic than humanMHC(HLA) genes, which is surprising because chimpanzee is the older species of the two and is therefore expected to display more variation. To quantify the effect of the reduced polymorphism, we compared the peptide binding repertoire of human and chimpanzee MHC molecules. Using a peptide-MHC binding predictor and proteomes of >900 mammalian viruses, we show that, at the population level, the total peptide binding repertoire of Patr-A molecules is ∼36% lower than that of their human counterparts, whereas the reduction of the peptide binding repertoire of the Patr-B locus is only 15%. In line with these results, different Patr-A molecules turn out to have largely overlapping peptide binding repertoires, whereas the Patr-B molecules are more distinct from each other. This difference is somewhat less apparent at the individual level, where we found that only 25% of the viruses are significantly better presented by "simulated" humans with heterozygous HLA-A and -B loci. Taken together, our results indicate that the Patr-B molecules recovered more after the selective sweep, whereas the Patr-A locus shows the most signs of the selective sweep with regard to its peptide binding repertoire.

ABSTRACT: Social network analysis (SNA) is rapidly gaining popularity in primatology, but its application to the management of zoo-housed primates has been largely overlooked. Here I use SNA techniques to explore the social structure of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) housed in the new "Budongo Trail" exhibit at Edinburgh Zoo, UK. Given that individuals have extensive space (2332m2), and access to several interconnected exhibit sections, I test the hypothesis that individuals are able to choose to interact with specific social partners. Spatial association and social interaction data were recorded from 400 focal watches on 11 individuals, and association, affiliative, and agonistic networks were constructed. Matrix correlations showed that individuals who spent time in close proximity were likely to affiliate with one another, but spatial association did not predict the frequency of agonistic encounters. Cluster analysis revealed significantly distinct sub-groups in the affiliative network (but not association or agonistic networks) in line with maternal kinship. Overall my findings support the hypothesis that the Budongo Trail exhibit facilitates the expression of social preferences, and suggests that SNA can be a useful tool to study zoo primates when proximity between individuals is not forced (i.e. in large, modern exhibits). Now that I have validated a set of SNA methods for this community, they can be used to trace changes in social dynamics over a longer time period, and ultimately assist zoo staff in their management decisions. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The Apobec3 family of cytidine deaminases can inhibit the replication of retroviruses and retrotransposons. Human and chimpanzee genomes encode seven Apobec3 paralogs; of these, Apobec3DE has the greatest sequence divergence between humans and chimpanzees. Here we show that even though human and chimpanzee Apobec3DEs are very divergent, the two orthologs similarly restrict long terminal repeat (LTR) and non-LTR retrotransposons (MusD and Alu, respectively). However, chimpanzee Apobec3DE also potently restricts two lentiviruses, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) that infects African green monkeys (SIVagmTAN), unlike human Apobec3DE, which has poor antiviral activity against these same viruses. This difference between human and chimpanzee Apobec3DE in the ability to restrict retroviruses is not due to different levels of Apobec3DE protein incorporation into virions but rather to the ability of Apobec3DE to deaminate the viral genome in target cells. We further show that Apobec3DE rapidly evolved in chimpanzee ancestors approximately 2 to 6 million years ago and that this evolution drove the increased breadth of chimpanzee Apobec3DE antiviral activity to its current high activity against some lentiviruses. Despite a difference in target specificities between human and chimpanzee Apobec3DE, Apobec3DE is likely to currently play a role in host defense against retroelements in both species. © 2011, American Society for Microbiology.

ABSTRACT: Background Lengthy social separation and prolonged fasting time contribute to increased risks associated with anesthesia in captive primates. This study is an initial attempt to identify a safe pre-anesthetic fasting procedure by identifying gastric emptying time (GET) and gastrointestinal transit time (GTT) of captive chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes. Methods Seven adult chimpanzees at the North Carolina Zoo immobilized for annual physical examinations were fed barium-impregnated polyethylene spheres to measure GET. Eleven animals were individually fed a color dye marker and fecal passage was observed to determine GTT. Results Gastric emptying time (GET) was approximated to be >3hours but <16hours. The mean GTT was 16.5hours. Conclusions This study indicates that a fasting time of 3hours would allow for complete gastric emptying and could potentially replace the current overnight fast (≥16hour) to help minimize complications associated with pre-anesthetic fasting in captive primates. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

ABSTRACT: A comparison of developmental patterns of white matter (WM) within the prefrontal region between humans and nonhuman primates is key to understanding human brain evolution. WM mediates complex cognitive processes and has reciprocal connections with posterior processing regions [1, 2]. Although the developmental pattern of prefrontal WM in macaques differs markedly from that in humans [3], this has not been explored in our closest evolutionary relative, the chimpanzee. The present longitudinal study of magnetic resonance imaging scans demonstrated that the prefrontal WM volume in chimpanzees was immature and had not reached the adult value during prepuberty, as observed in humans but not in macaques. However, the rate of prefrontal WM volume increase during infancy was slower in chimpanzees than in humans. These results suggest that a less mature and more protracted elaboration of neuronal connections in the prefrontal portion of the developing brain existed in the last common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans, and that this served to enhance the impact of postnatal experiences on neuronal connectivity. Furthermore, the rapid development of the human prefrontal WM during infancy may help the development of complex social interactions, as well as the acquisition of experience-dependent knowledge and skills to shape neuronal connectivity. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Dietary overlap of sympatric apes is complex and understudied, but its examination is essential to further our understanding of species distribution, abundance, and community ecology. Over 3 yr we studied food availability and dietary composition of central chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in Loango National Park, Gabon. We predicted that living in a habitat dominated by mature forest with sparse terrestrial herbaceous vegetation would lead to an increase in frugivory by gorillas, resulting in increased dietary overlap between the 2 ape species vs. other sites, but that chimpanzees would remain more frugivorous than gorillas. Through fecal analysis we measured overlap in fruit consumption between the 2 species on a bimonthly basis using the Renkonens method. Mean overlap was 27.5% but varied greatly seasonally, ranging between 0.3% and 69%, indicating that when examined on a finer scale, the degree of overlap appears much lower than at other study sites. In contrast to studies elsewhere, there was not a positive correlation between rainfall and fruit availability in Loango, and the long dry season was a period of high fruit production. As observed elsewhere, we found a positive correlation between fruit consumption and fruit availability for both chimpanzees and gorillas and we found that chimpanzees were more frugivorous than gorillas. A very low availability of herbs did not lead to increased frugivory by gorillas nor increased overlap between the 2 ape species vs. other field sites. We conclude that forest composition, fruit availability, and dietary variability of sympatric species can vary greatly between locations, and that chimpanzees and gorillas can adapt to primary forest with little undergrowth, where they concentrate their diet on fruit and leaves. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzee tool behaviours vary dramatically in their complexity and extent of geographical distribution. The use of tool sets with specific design features to gather termites extends across a large portion of central Africa. Detailed examination of the composition and uniformity of such complex tool tasks has the potential to advance our understanding of the cognitive capabilities of tool users and processes underlying the maintenance of technological skills. In this study, we examined variation in chimpanzee tool use in termite gathering from video-recorded sequences that were scored to the level of functionally distinct behavioural elements. Overall, we found a high degree of similarity in toolusing techniques exhibited by individuals in this population. The number of elements in each individual's repertoire often exceeded that necessary to accomplish the task, with consistent differences in repertoire sizes between age classes. Adults and subadults had the largest repertoires and more consistently exhibited element strings than younger individuals. Larger repertoires were typically associated with incorporation of rare variants, some of which indicate flexibility and intelligence. These tool using apes aid us in understanding the evolution of technology, including that of our human ancestors, which showed a high degree of uniformity over large spatial scales. © 2011 The Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Long bone shafts (diaphyses) serve as load-bearing structures during locomotion, implying a close relationship between diaphyseal form and its locomotor function. Diaphyseal form-function relationships, however, are complex, as they are mediated by various factors such as developmental programs, evolutionary adaptation, and functional adaptation through bone remodeling during an individual's lifetime. The effects of the latter process ("Wolff's Law") are best assessed by comparing diaphyseal morphologies of conspecific individuals under different locomotor regimes. Here we use morphometric mapping (MM) to analyze the morphology of entire femoral diaphyses in an ontogenetic series of wild and captive common chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes). MM reveals patterns of variation of diaphyseal structural and functional properties, which cannot be recognized with conventional cross-sectional analysis and/or geometric morphometric methods. Our data show that diaphyseal shape, cortical bone distribution and inferred cross-sectional biomechanical properties vary both along ontogenetic trajectories and independent of ontogeny. Mean ontogenetic trajectories of wild and captive chimpanzees, however, were found to be statistically identical. This indicates that the basic developmental program of the diaphysis is not altered by different loading conditions. Significant differences in diaphyseal shape between groups could only be identified in the distal diaphysis, where wild chimpanzees exhibit higher mediolateral relative to anteroposterior cortical bone thickness. Overall, thus, the hypothesis that Wolff's Law predominantly governs long bone diaphyseal morphology is rejected. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Studies of causal understanding of tool relationships in captive chimpanzees have yielded disparate findings, particularly those reported by Povinelli & colleagues (2000) for tool tasks by laboratory chimpanzees. The present set of experiments tested nine enculturated chimpanzees on three versions of a support task, as described by Povinelli (2000), during which food rewards were presented in different experimental configurations. In Experiment 1, stimulus pairs included a choice between a cloth with a reward on the upper right corner or with a second reward off the cloth, adjacent to a corner, with the second pair comprised of a cloth with food on the upper right corner, and a second cloth with the reward on the substrate, partially covered. All subjects were successful with both test conditions in Experiment 1. In a second study, the experimental choices included one of two possible correct options, paired with one of three incorrect options, with the three incorrect choices all involving varying degrees of perceptual containment. All nine chimpanzees scored significantly above chance across all six conditions. In Experiment 3, four unique conditions were presented, combining one of two possible correct choices with one of two incorrect choices. Six of the subjects scored significantly above chance across the four conditions, and group performance on individual conditions was also significant. Superior performance was demonstrated by female subjects in Experiment 3, similar to sex differences in tool use previously reported for wild chimpanzees and some tool tasks in captive chimpanzees. The present results for Experiments 2 & 3 were significantly differed from those reported by Povinelli et al. (2000) for laboratory-born, peer-reared chimpanzees. One contribution towards the dramatic differences between the two study populations may be the significant rearing and housing differences of the chimpanzee groups. One explanation is that under conditions of enculturation, rich social interactions with humans and conspecifics, as well as active exploration of artifacts, materials, and other aspects of their physical environment had a significant impact on the animals' ability to recognize the support relationships among the stimulus choices. Overall, the present findings provide strong support for the hypothesis that our chimpanzee subjects based their responses on an understanding of functional support which represented one facet of their folk physics repertoire. © 2011 Current Zoology.

ABSTRACT: Infectious disease and other health hazards have been hypothesized to pose serious threats to the persistence of wild ape populations. Respiratory disease outbreaks have been shown to be of particular concern for several wild chimpanzee study sites, leading managers, and researchers to hypothesize that diseases originating from and/or spread by humans pose a substantial risk to the long-term survival of chimpanzee populations. The total chimpanzee population in Gombe National Park, Tanzania, has declined from 120-150 in the 1960s to about 100 by the end of 2007, with death associated with observable signs of disease as the leading cause of mortality. We used a historical data set collected from 1979 to 1987 to investigate the baseline rates of respiratory illness in chimpanzees at Gombe National Park, Tanzania, and to analyze the impact of human-related factors (e.g., banana feeding, visits to staff quarters) and non-human-related factors (e.g., sociality, season) on chimpanzee respiratory illness rates. We found that season and banana feeding were the most significant predictors of respiratory health clinical signs during this time period. We discuss these results in the context of management options for the reduction of disease risk and the importance of long-term observational data for conservation. © 2011 International Association for Ecology and Health.

ABSTRACT: We presented four chimpanzees with a series of tasks that involved comparing two token sets or comparing a token set to a quantity of food. Selected tokens could be exchanged for food items on a one-to-one basis. Chimpanzees successfully selected the larger numerical set for comparisons of 1 to 5 items when both sets were visible and when sets were presented through one-by-one addition of tokens into two opaque containers. Two of four chimpanzees used the number of tokens and food items to guide responding in all conditions, rather than relying on token color, size, total amount, or duration of set presentation. These results demonstrate that judgments of simultaneous and sequential sets of stimuli are made by some chimpanzees on the basis of the numerousness of sets rather than other non-numerical dimensions. The tokens were treated as equivalent to food items on the basis of their numerousness, and the chimpanzees maximized reward by choosing the larger number of items in all situations. © 2011 American Psychological Association.

ABSTRACT: In a unique case where a chimpanzee infant captured by human poachers was returned by researchers to her natal group, an adolescent male helped the injured mother carry her infant on each of 2 days following the return. I explore various hypotheses to explain this behavior and suggest that the apparent recognition of both the infant's and mother's needs by the male supports the consideration of empathy in this case. As data accumulate, questions regarding empathy in non-humans should focus on more intricate levels as suggested by DeWaal (Annu Rev Psych 59: 279-300, 2008), rather than adhering to the assertion that empathy is uniquely human. © 2010 Japan Ethological Society and Springer.

ABSTRACT: Infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) persisted for longer than 29 weeks in 2 chimpanzees after they had been inoculated with it experimentally. One of them (C-210) received short-term subcutaneous interferon-α (IFN-α) 6 million units (MU) daily for 7 days at week 29. He cleared HCV RNA from the serum and remained negative for it during 25 weeks after the withdrawal of IFN. The other (C-224) did not respond to 2 courses of a short-term IFN monotherapy at weeks 20 and 23. Twelve weeks thereafter, he received IFN-α 3 MU daily for 2 weeks and then 3 times a week for 14 weeks combined with oral ribavirin 600 mg daily during 16 weeks. HCV RNA disappeared from the serum and stayed negative until the last follow-up 24 weeks after the completion of combination therapy. Copyright © 2011 S. Karger AG.

ABSTRACT: Much attention has been devoted to identifying genomic patterns underlying the evolution of the human brain and its emergent advanced cognitive capabilities, which lie at the heart of differences distinguishing humans from chimpanzees, our closest living relatives. Here, we identify two particular intragene repeat structures of noncoding human DNA, spanning as much as a hundred kilobases, that are present in human genome but are absent from the chimpanzee genome and other nonhuman primates. Using our novel computational method Global Repeat Map, we examine tandem repeat structure in human and chimpanzee chromosome 1. In human chromosome 1, we find three higher order repeats (HORs), two of them novel, not reported previously, whereas in chimpanzee chromosome 1, we find only one HOR, a 2mer alphoid HOR instead of human alphoid 11mer HOR. In human chromosome 1, we identify an HOR based on 39-bp primary repeat unit, with secondary, tertiary, and quartic repeat units, fully embedded in human hornerin gene, related to regenerating and psoriatric skin. Such an HOR is not found in chimpanzee chromosome 1. We find a remarkable human 3mer HOR organization based on the ∼1.6-kb primary repeat unit, fully embedded within the neuroblastoma breakpoint family genes, which is related to the function of the human brain. Such HORs are not present in chimpanzees. In general, we find that human-chimpanzee differences are much larger for tandem repeats, in particularly for HORs, than for gene sequences. This may be of great significance in light of recent studies that are beginning to reveal the large-scale regulatory architecture of the human genome, in particular the role of noncoding sequences. We hypothesize about the possible importance of human accelerated HOR patterns as components in the gene expression multilayered regulatory network. © The Author 2011.

ABSTRACT: The mother-offspring bond is one of the strongest and most essential social bonds. Following is a detailed behavioral report of a female chimpanzee 2 days after her 16-month-old infant died, on the first day that the mother is observed to create distance between her and the corpse. A series of repeated approaches and retreats to and from the body are documented, along with detailed accounts of behaviors directed toward the dead infant by the mother and other group members. The behavior of the mother toward her dead infant not only highlights the maternal contribution to the mother-infant relationship but also elucidates the opportunities chimpanzees have to learn about the sensory cues associated with death, and the implications of death for the social environment. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

ABSTRACT: A comprehensive analysis of transcriptional structures of chimpanzee sperm development-associated genes is of significant interest for deeply understanding sperm development and male reproductive process. In this study, we sequenced 7,680 clones from a chimpanzee testis full-length cDNA library and obtained 1,933 nonredundant high-quality full-length cDNA sequences. Comparative analysis between human and chimpanzee showed that 78 sperm developmentassociated genes, most of which were yet uncharacterized, had undergone severe structural changes (mutations at the start/stop codons, INDELs, alternative splicing variations and fusion forms) on genomic and transcript levels throughout chimpanzee evolution. Specifically, among the 78 sperm development-associated genes, 39 including ODF2, UBC, and CD59 showed markedly chimpanzee-specific structural changes. Through dN/dS analysis, we found that 56 transcripts (including seven sperm development-associated genes) had values of greater than one when comparing human and chimpanzee DNA sequences, whereas the values were less than one when comparing humans and orangutans. Gene ontology annotation and expression profiling showed that the chimpanzee testis transcriptome was enriched with genes that are associated with chimpanzee male germ cell development. Taken together, our study provides the first comprehensive molecular evidence that many chimpanzee sperm development-associated genes had experienced severe structural changes over the course of evolution on genomic and transcript levels. © Springer-Verlag 2011.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees at Budongo, Uganda, regularly gesture in series, including 'bouts' of gesturing that include response waiting and 'sequences' of rapid-fire gesturing without pauses. We examined the distribution and correlates of 723 sequences and 504 bouts for clues to the function of multigesture series. Gesturing by older chimpanzees was more likely to be successful, but the success rate of any particular gesture did not vary with signaller age. Rather, older individuals were more likely to choose successful gestures, and these highly successful gestures were more often used singly. These patterns explain why bouts were recorded most in younger animals, whereas older chimpanzees relied more on single gestures: bouts are best interpreted as a consequence of persistence in the face of failure. When at least one gesture of a successful type occurred in a sequence, that sequence was more likely to be successful; overall, however, sequences were less successful than single gestures. We suggest that young chimpanzees use sequences as a 'fail-safe' strategy: because they have the innate potential to produce a large and redundant repertoire of gestures but lack knowledge of which of them would be most efficient. Using sequences increases the chance of giving one effective gesture and also allows users to learn the most effective types. As they do so, they need to use sequences less; sequences may remain important for subtle interpersonal adjustment, especially in play. This 'Repertoire Tuning' hypothesis explains a number of results previously reported from chimpanzee gesturing. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: Motivation: Phosphorylation modifications of specific protein residues are involved in a wide range of biological processes such as modulation of intracellular signal networks. Here, we present the development and application of a bioinformatics procedure for systematic identification of human-specific phosphorylation sites in proteins that may have occurred after the human-chimpanzee divergence. Results: We collected annotated human phosphorylation sites and compared each site to orthologous mammalian proteins across taxa including chimpanzee, orangutan, rhesus macaque, marmoset, mouse, dog, cow, elephant, opossum and platypus. We identified 37 human-specific gains of annotated phosphorylation sites in 35 proteins: 22 serines, 12 threonines and 3 tyrosines. The novel phosphorylation sites are situated in highly conserved segments of the protein. Proteins with novel phosphorylation sites are involved in crucial biological processes such as cell division (AURKB, CASC5, MKI67 and PDCD4) and chromatin remodeling (HIRA, HIRIP3, HIST1H1T, NAP1L4 and LRWD1). Modified phosphorylatable residues produce novel target sites for protein kinases such as cyclin-dependent kinases and casein kinases, possibly resulting in rewiring and fine-tuning of phosphorylation regulatory networks. The potential human-specific phosphorylation sites identified in this study are useful as candidates for functional analysis to identify novel phenotypes in humans. © The Author 2011.

ABSTRACT: How do humans and their closest relatives, chimpanzees, differ in their fundamental abilities for seeing the visual world? In this study, we directly compared the gaze movements of humans and the closest species, chimpanzees, using an eye-tracking system. During free viewing of a naturalistic scene, chimpanzees made more fixations per second (up to four) than did humans (up to three). This species difference was independent of the semantic variability of the presented scenes. The gap-overlap paradigm revealed that, rather than resulting from the sensitivity to the peripherally presented stimuli per se, the species difference reflected the particular strategy each species employed to solve the rivalry between central (fixated) and peripheral stimuli in their visual fields. Finally, when presented with a movie in which small images successively appeared/disappeared at random positions at the chosen presentation rate, chimpanzees tracked those images at the point of fixation for a longer time than did humans, outperforming humans in their speed of scanning. Our results suggest that chimpanzees and humans differ quantitatively in their visual strategies involving the timing of gaze movement. We discuss the functional reasons for each species' employing such specific strategies. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: Obesity is a risk factor for several diseases including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to compare the relationships of waist circumference and body weight with circulating markers of metabolic, cardiovascular, and hepatic function in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). After a 12-h fast, blood was collected from 39 adult captive chimpanzees for measurement of serum glucose, BUN, creatinine, albumin, cholesterol, ALT, AST, ALP, total and direct bilirubin, triglyceride, and insulin, and waist circumference and body weight were measured. Waist circumference was positively correlated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure, glucose, insulin resistance as estimated by the homeostatic model assessment method, and albumin in female chimpanzees and with triglyceride in female and male chimpanzees. Body weight was correlated significantly with systolic and diastolic blood pressure in female chimpanzees and triglyceride in male chimpanzees. Male chimpanzees were heavier and had lower diastolic blood pressure, greater creatinine, albumin, AST, ALP, total bilirubin, and direct bilirubin values than did female chimpanzees. The relationships between waist circumference and blood pressure and triglyceride are consistent with those reported in humans and other primate species. In conclusion, our study is the first work to demonstrate a relationship between waist circumference and metabolic risk factors in chimpanzees. Results demonstrated that waist circumference was associated with more metabolic risk factors than was body weight, particularly in female chimpanzees.

ABSTRACT: Great ape gestural communication is known to be intentional, elaborate and flexible; yet there is controversy over the best interpretation of the system and how gestures are acquired, perhaps because most studies have been made in restricted, captive settings. Here, we report the first systematic analysis of gesture in a population of wild chimpanzees. Over 266 days of observation, we recorded 4,397 cases of intentional gesture use in the Sonso community, Budongo, Uganda. We describe 66 distinct gesture types: this estimate appears close to asymptote, and the Sonso repertoire includes most gestures described informally at other sites. Differences in repertoire were noted between individuals and age classes, but in both cases, the measured repertoire size was predicted by the time subjects were observed gesturing. No idiosyncratic usages were found, i. e. no gesture type was used only by one individual. No support was found for the idea that gestures are acquired by 'ontogenetic ritualization' from originally effective actions; moreover, in detailed analyses of two gestures, action elements composing the gestures did not closely match those of the presumed original actions. Rather, chimpanzee gestures are species-typical; indeed, many are 'family-typical', because gesture types recorded in gorillas, orangutans and chimpanzee overlap extensively, with 24 gestures recorded in all three genera. Nevertheless, chimpanzee gestures are used flexibly across a range of contexts and show clear adjustment to audience (e.g. silent gestures for attentive targets, contact gestures for inattentive ones). Such highly intentional use of a species-typical repertoire raises intriguing questions for the evolution of advanced communication. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: More studies have focused on aspects of chimpanzee behaviour and cognition relevant to the evolution of culture than on any other species except our own. Accordingly, analysis of the features shared by chimpanzees and humans is here used to infer the scope of cultural phenomena in our last common ancestor, at the same time clarifying the nature of the special characteristics that advanced further in the hominin line. To do this, culture is broken down into three major aspects: the large scale, population-level patterning of traditions; social learning mechanisms; and the behavioural and cognitive contents of culture. Each of these is further dissected into subcomponents. Shared features, as well as differences, are identified in as many as a dozen of these, offering a case study for the comparative analysis of culture across animal taxa and a deeper understanding of the roots of our own cultural capacities. © 2011 The Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: We presented a quantity judgment task that involved comparing two sequentially presented sets of items to preschoolers and chimpanzees using nearly identical procedures that excluded verbal instructions to children. Trial difficulty in this task reflected the ratio difference between sets of discrete items where larger ratios (e.g., 0.80 as from comparing 4 to 5) were more difficult than smaller ones (e.g., 0.50 as from comparing 4 to 8). Children also completed verbal-based tasks probing the relationship between counting proficiency and performance on the quantity judgment task of sequentially presented identical sized items. Both species' performance was best when ratios between comparison sets were small regardless of set size in all types of tasks. Generally, chimpanzees and older children performed better than younger children except at larger ratios. Children's counting proficiency was not related to success in choosing the larger of two quantities of identical-sized items. These results indicate that chimpanzees and children share an approximate number sense that is reflected through analog magnitude estimation when comparing quantities. © 2011 Current Zoology.

ABSTRACT: Blood groups of humans and great apes have long been considered similar, although they are not interchangeable between species. In this study, human monoclonal antibody technology was used to assign human ABO blood groups to whole blood samples from great apes housed in North American and European zoos and in situ managed populations, as a practical means to assist blood transfusion situations for these species. From a subset of each of the species (bonobo, common chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutans), DNA sequence analysis was performed to determine blood group genotype. Bonobo and common chimpanzee populations were predominantly group A, which concurred with historic literature and was confirmed by genotyping. In agreement with historic literature, a smaller number of the common chimpanzees sampled were group O, although this O blood group was more often present in wild-origin animals as compared with zoo-born animals. Gorilla blood groups were inconclusive by monoclonal antibody techniques, and genetic studies were inconsistent with any known human blood group. As the genus and, specifically, the Bornean species, orangutans were identified with all human blood groups, including O, which had not been reported previously. Following this study, it was concluded that blood groups of bonobo, common chimpanzees, and some orangutans can be reliably assessed by human monoclonal antibody technology. However, this technique was not reliable for gorilla or orangutans other than those with blood group A. Even in those species with reliable blood group detection, blood transfusion preparation must include cross-matching to minimize adverse reactions for the patient. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc..

ABSTRACT: Social network analysis offers new tools to study the social structure of primate groups. We used social network analysis to investigate the cohesiveness of a grooming network in a captive chimpanzee group (N = 17) and the role that individuals may play in it. Using data from a year-long observation, we constructed an unweighted social network of preferred grooming interactions by retaining only those dyads that groomed above the group mean. This choice of criterion was validated by the finding that the properties of the unweighted network correlated with the properties of a weighted network (i.e. a network representing the frequency of grooming interactions) constructed from the same data. To investigate group cohesion, we tested the resilience of the unweighted grooming network to the removal of central individuals (i.e. individuals with high betweenness centrality). The network fragmented more after the removal of individuals with high betweenness centrality than after the removal of random individuals. Central individuals played a pivotal role in maintaining the network's cohesiveness, and we suggest that this may be a typical property of affiliative networks like grooming networks. We found that the grooming network correlated with kinship and age, and that individuals with higher social status occupied more central positions in the network. Overall, the grooming network showed a heterogeneous structure, yet did not exhibit scale-free properties similar to many other primate networks. We discuss our results in light of recent findings on animal social networks and chimpanzee grooming. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Monitoring concentrations of stress hormones is an important tool for behavioral research and conservation for animals both in the wild and captivity. Glucocorticoids can be measured in mammals as an indicator of stress by analyzing blood, feces, urine, hair, feathers, or saliva. The advantages of using saliva for measuring cortisol concentrations are three-fold: it is minimally invasive, multiple samples can be collected from the same individual in a short timeframe, and cortisol has a relatively short response time in saliva as compared with other materials. The purpose of this study was to: (1) conduct an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenge as a physiological validation for an enzyme immunoassay to measure salivary cortisol in chimpanzees and (2) characterize the circadian rhythm of salivary cortisol in chimpanzees. We determined that salivary cortisol concentrations peaked 45min following the ACTH challenge, which is similar to humans. Also, salivary cortisol concentrations peaked early in the morning and decreased throughout the day. We recommend that saliva collection may be the most effective method of measuring stress reactivity and has the potential to complement behavioral, cognitive, physiological, and welfare studies. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc..

ABSTRACT: Researchers have argued that the process of human birth is unique among primates and mammals in that the infant emerges with its face oriented in the opposite direction from its mother (occiput anterior) and head rotation occurs in the birth canal. However, this notion of human uniqueness has not been substantiated, because there are few comparative studies of birth in non-human primates. This paper reports the mechanism of birth in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) based on the first clear, close-up video recordings of three chimpanzee births in captivity. In all three cases, the foetus emerged with an occiput anterior orientation, and the head and body rotated after the head had emerged. Therefore, these characteristics are not uniquely human. Furthermore, in two of the three cases, the chimpanzee newborns landed on the ground without being guided from the birth canal by the mother. The fact that the human newborn emerges with an occiput anterior orientation has thus far been taken as evidence for the necessity of midwifery in modern humans, but this view also needs revision. Our observations raise the need to reconsider the evolutionary scenario of human birth. © 2011 The Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Six poliovirus-neutralizing Fabs were recovered from a combinatorial Fab phage display library constructed from bone marrow-derived lymphocytes of immunized chimpanzees. The chimeric chimpanzee-human full-length IgGs (hereinafter called monoclonal antibodies [MAbs]) were generated by combining a chimpanzee IgG light chain and a variable domain of heavy chain with a human constant Fc region. The six MAbs neutralized vaccine strains and virulent strains of poliovirus. Five MAbs were serotype specific, while one MAb cross-neutralized serotypes 1 and 2. Epitope mapping performed by selecting and sequencing antibody-resistant viral variants indicated that the cross-neutralizing MAb bound between antigenic sites 1 and 2, thereby covering the canyon region containing the receptor-binding site. Another serotype 1-specific MAb recognized a region located between antigenic sites 2 and 3 that included parts of capsid proteins VP1 and VP3. Both serotype 2-specific antibodies recognized antigenic site 1. No escape mutants to serotype 3-specific MAbs could be generated. The administration of a serotype 1-specific MAb to transgenic mice susceptible to poliovirus at a dose of 5 μg/mouse completely protected them from paralysis after challenge with a lethal dose of wild-type poliovirus. Moreover, MAb injection 6 or 12 h after virus infection provided significant protection. The MAbs described here could be tested in clinical trials to determine whether they might be useful for treatment of immunocompromised chronic virus excretors and for emergency protection of contacts of a paralytic poliomyelitis case. © 2011, American Society for Microbiology.

ABSTRACT: Honey-gathering from bee nests has been recorded at chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) study sites across tropical Africa. Different populations employ different strategies, ranging from simple 'smash-and grab' raids to use of sophisticated tool-sets, i. e., two or more types of tool used sequentially in a single task. In this paper I present evidence of tool-use, and the probable use of a tool-set, for honey-gathering by unhabituated chimpanzees at Bulindi, a forest-farm mosaic south of the Budongo Forest in Uganda. Between June and December 2007, 44 stick tools were found in association with 16 holes dug in the ground, corresponding to the period when stingless bees (Meliponula sp.) appeared in chimpanzee dung. In 11 cases the confirmed target was a Meliponula ground nest. Two potential tool types were distinguished: digging sticks encrusted with soil, and more slender and/or flexible sticks largely devoid of soil that may have functioned to probe the bees' narrow entry tubes. Reports of chimpanzees using tools to dig for honey have been largely confined to Central Africa. Honey-digging has not previously been reported for Ugandan chimpanzees. Similarly, use of a tool-set to obtain honey has thus far been described for wild chimpanzee populations only in Central Africa. Evidence strongly suggests that Bulindi chimpanzees also use sticks in predation on carpenter bee (Xylocopa sp.) nests, perhaps as probes to locate honey or to disable adult bees. These preliminary findings from Bulindi add to our understanding of chimpanzee technological and cultural variation. However, unprotected forests at Bulindi and elsewhere in the region are currently severely threatened by commercial logging and clearance for farming. Populations with potentially unique behavioral and technological repertoires are being lost. © 2011 Japan Monkey Centre and Springer.

ABSTRACT: Human societies are built on collaborative activities. Already from early childhood, human children are skillful and proficient collaborators. They recognize when they need help in solving a problem and actively recruit collaborators [1, 2]. The societies of other primates are also to some degree cooperative. Chimpanzees, for example, engage in a variety of cooperative activities such as border patrols, group hunting, and intra- and intergroup coalitionary behavior [3-5]. Recent studies have shown that chimpanzees possess many of the cognitive prerequisites necessary for human-like collaboration. Chimpanzees have been shown to recognize when they need help in solving a problem and to actively recruit good over bad collaborators [6, 7]. However, cognitive abilities might not be all that differs between chimpanzees and humans when it comes to cooperation. Another factor might be the motivation to engage in a cooperative activity. Here, we hypothesized that a key difference between human and chimpanzee collaboration - and so potentially a key mechanism in the evolution of human cooperation - is a simple preference for collaborating (versus acting alone) to obtain food. Our results supported this hypothesis, finding that whereas children strongly prefer to work together with another to obtain food, chimpanzees show no such preference. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Enteroviruses (EVs), members of the family Picornaviridae, are a genetically and antigenically diverse range of viruses causing acute infections in humans and several Old World monkey (OWM) species. Despite their known wide distribution in primates, nothing is currently known about the occurrence, frequency, and genetic diversity of enteroviruses infecting apes. To investigate this, 27 chimpanzee and 27 gorilla fecal samples collected from undisturbed jungle areas with minimal human contact in Cameroon were screened for EVs. Four chimpanzee samples were positive, but none of the gorilla samples were positive. Genetic characterization of the VP1, VP4, and partial VP2 genes, the 5' untranslated region, and partial 3Dpol sequences enabled chimpanzee-derived EVs to be identified as (i) the species A type, EV76, (ii) a new species D type assigned as EV111, along with a human isolate from the Democratic Republic of Congo previously described by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses, and (iii) a new species B type (assigned as EV110) most closely related to, although a distinct type from, the SA5 isolate recovered from a vervet monkey. The identification of EVs infecting chimpanzees related to those circulating in human and OWM populations provides evidence for cross-species transmission of EVs between primates. However, the direction of transfer and the existence of primate sources of zoonotic enterovirus infections in humans require further investigation of population exposure and more extensive characterization of EVs circulating in wild ape populations. © 2011, American Society for Microbiology.

ABSTRACT: Background: Preterm birth is a leading cause of perinatal mortality, yet the evolutionary history of this obstetrical syndrome is largely unknown in nonhuman primate species. Methodology/Principal Findings: We examined the length of gestation during pregnancies that occurred in a captive chimpanzee colony by inspecting veterinary and behavioral records spanning a total of thirty years. Upon examination of these records we were able to confidently estimate gestation length for 93 of the 97 (96%) pregnancies recorded at the colony. In total, 78 singleton gestations resulted in live birth, and from these pregnancies we estimated the mean gestation length of normal chimpanzee pregnancies to be 228 days, a finding consistent with other published reports. We also calculated that the range of gestation in normal chimpanzee pregnancies is approximately forty days. Of the remaining fifteen pregnancies, only one of the offspring survived, suggesting viability for chimpanzees requires a gestation of approximately 200 days. These fifteen pregnancies constitute spontaneous abortions and preterm deliveries, for which the upper gestational age limit was defined as 2 SD from the mean length of gestation (208 days). Conclusions/Significance: The present study documents that preterm birth occurred within our study population of captive chimpanzees. As in humans, pregnancy loss is not uncommon in chimpanzees, In addition, our findings indicate that both humans and chimpanzees show a similar range of normal variation in gestation length, suggesting this was the case at the time of their last common ancestor (LCA). Nevertheless, our data suggest that whereas chimpanzees' normal gestation length is ~20-30 days after reaching viability, humans' normal gestation length is approximately 50 days beyond the estimated date of viability without medical intervention. Future research using a comparative evolutionary framework should help to clarify the extent to which mechanisms at work in normal and preterm parturition are shared in these species. © 2011 Wildman et al.

ABSTRACT: Background: Chromosomal inversion is one of the most important mechanisms of evolution. Recent studies of comparative genomics have revealed that chromosomal inversions are abundant in the human genome. While such previously characterized inversions are large enough to be identified as a single alignment or a string of local alignments, the impact of ultramicro inversions, which are such short that the local alignments completely cover them, on evolution is still uncertain. Results: In this study, we developed a method for identifying ultramicro inversions by scanning of local alignments. This technique achieved a high sensitivity and a very low rate of false positives. We identified 2,377 ultramicro inversions ranging from five to 125 bp within the orthologous alignments between the human and chimpanzee genomes. The false positive rate was estimated to be around 4%. Based on phylogenetic profiles using the primate outgroups, 479 ultramicro inversions were inferred to have specifically inverted in the human lineage. Ultramicro inversions exclusively involving adenine and thymine were the most frequent; 461 inversions (19.4%) of the total. Furthermore, the density of ultramicro inversions in chromosome Y and the neighborhoods of transposable elements was higher than average. Sixty-five ultramicro inversions were identified within the exons of human protein-coding genes. Conclusions: We defined ultramicro inversions as the inverted regions equal to or smaller than 125 bp buried within local alignments. Our observations suggest that ultramicro inversions are abundant among the human and chimpanzee genomes, and that location of the inversions correlated with the genome structural instability. Some of the ultramicro inversions may contribute to gene evolution. Our inversion-identification method is also applicable in the fine-tuning of genome alignments by distinguishing ultramicro inversions from nucleotide substitutions and indels. © 2011 Hara and Imanishi; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

ABSTRACT: This report addresses phylogenetic variation in a spatial skill that underlies tool use: aligning objects to a feature of a surface. Fragaszy and Cummins-Sebree's [Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience Reviews 4:282-306, 2005] model of relational spatial reasoning and Skill Development and Perception-Action theories guided the design of the study. We examined how capuchins and chimpanzees place stick objects of varying shapes into matching grooves on a flat surface. Although most individuals aligned the long axis of the object with the matching groove more often than expected by chance, all typically did so with poor precision. Some individuals managed to align a second feature, and only one (a capuchin monkey) achieved above-chance success at aligning three features with matching grooves. Our findings suggest that capuchins and chimpanzees do not reliably align objects along even one axis, and that neither species can reliably or easily master object placement tasks that require managing two or more spatial relations concurrently. Moreover, they did not systematically vary their behavior in a manner that would aid discovery of the affordances of the stick-surface combination beyond sliding the stick along the surface (which may have provided haptic information about the location of the groove). These limitations have profound consequences for the forms of tool use we can expect these individuals to master. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Humans favor others seen as similar to themselves (ingroup) over people seen as different (outgroup), even without explicitly stated bias. Ingroup-outgroup bias extends to involuntary responses, such as empathy for pain. However, empathy biases have not been tested in our close primate relatives. Contagious yawning has been theoretically and empirically linked to empathy. If empathy underlies contagious yawning, we predict that subjects should show an ingroup-outgroup bias by yawning more in response to watching ingroup members yawn than outgroup. Twenty-three chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) from two separate groups watched videos of familiar and unfamiliar individuals yawning or at rest (control). The chimpanzees yawned more when watching the familiar yawns than the familiar control or the unfamiliar yawns, demonstrating an ingroup-outgroup bias in contagious yawning. These results provide further empirical support that contagious yawning is a measure of empathy, which may be useful for evolutionary biology and mental health. © 2011 Campbell, de Waal.

ABSTRACT: It has been proposed that human cooperation is unique among animals for its scale and complexity, itsaltruistic nature and its occurrence among large groups of individuals that are not closely related or areeven strangers. One potential solution to this puzzle is that the unique aspects of human cooperationevolved as a result of high levels of lethal competition (i.e. warfare) between genetically differentiatedgroups. Although between-group migration would seem to make this scenario unlikely, the plausibilityof the between-group competition model has recently been supported by analyses using estimates of geneticdifferentiation derived from contemporary human groups hypothesized to be representative of thosethat existed during the time period when human cooperation evolved. Here, we examine levels ofbetween-group genetic differentiation in a large sample of contemporary human groups selected to overcomesome of the problems with earlier estimates, and compare them with those of chimpanzees. We findthat our estimates of between-group genetic differentiation in contemporary humans are lower than thoseused in previous tests, and not higher than those of chimpanzees. Because levels of between-group competitionin contemporary humans and chimpanzees are also similar, these findings suggest that theidentification of other factors that differ between chimpanzees and humans may be needed to providea compelling explanation of why humans, but not chimpanzees, display the unique features of humancooperation. © 2011 The Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Wildlife sanctuaries rescue, rehabilitate, reintroduce, and provide life-long care for orphaned and injured animals. Understanding a sanctuary's patterns in arrival, mortality, and projected changes in population size can help managers plan carefully for future needs, as well as illuminate patterns in source populations of wildlife. We studied these dynamics for chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in 11 sanctuaries of the Pan African Sanctuary Alliance (PASA). We analyzed historic demographic patterns and projected future population dynamics using an individual-based demographic model. From 2000 to 2006, the population in these sanctuaries has been growing at a rate of 15% per year. This growth is driven by arrivals of new individuals, with an average of 56 arrivals per year. The median age of the 760 chimpanzees living in these sanctuaries as of 2007 was 9 yr, with 76% of the population <15 yr. We found no significant difference in survivorship to age 20 between these chimpanzees and those maintained in North American accredited zoos. The size of the population in 20 yr is projected to be between 550 and 1800, depending on different assumptions about arrival and reintroduction rates. Projected shifts in age structure, including increases in the proportions of adolescent (9-19 yr of age) and older (35+) chimpanzees, may necessitate adjustments to management, veterinary care, and housing. This research illustrates how data on historic population dynamics can be modeled to inform future sanctuary capacity and management needs, allowing sanctuaries to plan better for their populations' long-term care. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

ABSTRACT: The isolation effect (or von Restorff effect) occurs when one item in a to-be-remembered list is distinctive from all remaining items, and memory for that item is enhanced. Four chimpanzees were presented with a serial list of four photographs. In the homogeneous condition, all list items were from the same semantic category (e.g., four fruits). In the isolate condition, three items were from the same category, but the fourth item (the isolate) was from a different category (e.g., three fruits and one toy). Then, two photographs were presented, and the chimpanzees had to select the one that was from the list. Two of four chimpanzees were significantly more likely to select a correct isolate item than an item from the same list position in the homogeneous condition for at least some list positions. This facilitation in performance was for isolate items only, as presenting an isolate item in a list did not facilitate greater recognition of other list items compared to the homogeneous condition. These results indicated that some chimpanzees perceived the semantic categories of the photographs, and categorization of photographs led to the isolation effect. Thus, chimpanzees may share with humans some aspects of memory organization that involve spontaneously categorizing visual stimuli and recognizing categorically unique stimuli. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) have been known to exhibit rudimentary abilities in analogical reasoning (Flemming, Beran, Thompson, Kleider, & Washburn, 2008; Gillian, Premack, & Woodruff, 1981; Haun & Call, 2009; Thompson & Oden, 2000; Thompson, Oden, & Boysen, 1997). With a wide array of individual differences, little can be concluded about the species' capacity for analogies, much less their strategies employed for solving such problems. In this study, we examined analogical strategies in 3 chimpanzees using a 3-dimensional search task (e.g., Kennedy & Fragaszy, 2008). Food items were hidden under 1 of 2 or 3 plastic cups of varying sizes. Subsequently, chimpanzees searched for food under the cup of the same relative size in their own set of cups-reasoning by analogy. Two chimpanzees initially appeared to fail the first relational phase of the task. Meta-analyses revealed, however, that they were instead using a secondary strategy not rewarded by the contingencies of the task-choosing on the basis of the same relative position in the sample. Although this was not the intended strategy of the task, it was nonetheless analogical. In subsequent phases of the task, chimpanzees eventually learned to shift their analogical reasoning strategy to match the reward contingencies of the task and successfully choose on the basis of relative size. This evidence not only provides support for the analogical ape hypothesis (Thompson & Oden, 2000), but also exemplifies how foundational conceptually mediated analogical behavior may be for the chimpanzee. © 2011 American Psychological Association.

ABSTRACT: Copulation calls are a relatively common feature of female primate behavior thought to function in the advertisement of female receptivity and subsequent incitation of male-male competition. To date, the majority of work on copulation calling behavior has focused on various monkey species, with little empirical evidence from the great apes. Previous research on wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) has suggested that estrous females produce copulation calls to avoid monopolization by single males and to minimize competition from other females. We here extended these findings by investigating to what degree these social demands were reflected in the calls' acoustic structure. We recorded and acoustically analyzed 71 copulation call bouts from 6 adult female chimpanzees in the Budongo Forest, Uganda. We did not find any acoustic differences in calls given by females in fertile and nonfertile periods, as assessed by their hormonal profiles. However, the calls' acoustic structure did reliably encode identity cues of the calling female. We propose that, in chimpanzees, the use and morphology of copulation calls have jointly been shaped by the selective advantage of concealing fertility. Owing to the low visibility conditions associated with chimpanzees' natural forest habitat and their dispersed social system, providing identity cues may be of particular biological relevance for these nonhuman primates. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

ABSTRACT: The release of wild or captive-bred mammals within their historical ranges typically aims to reestablish populations in areas where they have become extinct or extirpated, to reinforce natural populations, or to resolve human-wildlife conflicts. Such programs, which also typically in parallel help foster the protection of the release site, concern a wide range of endangered mammalian species, including our closest living relatives: chimpanzees. In June 2008, the Chimpanzee Conservation Center (CCC), which is located in the High Niger National Park (HNNP) in Guinea, released a group of 12 chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) comprised of 6 females and 6 males (8-20 yr old). The selected release site lies 32 km from the sanctuary in the Mafou, a core area of HNNP where wild chimpanzees are also known to occur. The purpose of this release was therefore to reinforce the natural chimpanzee population within the Mafou core area and to promote the protection of the HNNP. Nearly 2 yr postrelease, 9 chimpanzees still remain free-living. Two thirds of the release chimpanzees were equipped with VHF-GPS store-on-board tracking collars. We used data from retrieved collars to explore the release chimpanzees' habitat use, individual day range, and core area use (50% and 80%) during the first year of the release. Males traveled significantly further than females. Although minimum day range did not differ between the sexes or vary seasonally, some release males were active for longer during the day than the females. Males also ranged over larger areas and used a wider network of core areas than the females. Habitat use was similar to that recorded in wild chimpanzees in the HNNP. As of September 2010, 2 males and 3 females form a group at the release site. Two of these females gave birth to healthy offspring respectively 16 and 20 mo postrelease. Another female successfully immigrated into a wild chimpanzee community. We suggest that the success of this chimpanzee release can be attributed to the CCC's lengthy rehabilitation process and the savanna-mosaic habitat of the HNNP. This release demonstrates that under special socioecological circumstances, the release of wild-born adult chimpanzees of both sexes is a viable strategy, which can also function as an effective conservation tool. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

ABSTRACT: Entodiniomorphid ciliates are intestinal protists inhabiting the colons of African great apes. The participation of intestinal entodiniomorphid ciliates in ape hindgut digestion has been proposed, but little data have been available to support the hypothesis. We measured the specific activities of carboxymethyl cellulase, xylanase, inulinase, and α-amylase against different polysaccharides in the feces of captive chimpanzees and evaluated the participation of the entodiniomorphid ciliate, Troglodytella abrassarti, in these activities. T. abrassarti contributed to the total fecal hydrolytic activities of CM-cellulase by 16.2%, α-amylase by 5.95%, and xylanase by 0.66%. Inulinase activity in T. abrassarti samples was not measurable at reaction conditions used. The ciliates, T. abrassarti, actively participate in the chimpanzee hindgut fermentation of fiber and starch. © 2011 Institute of Microbiology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, v.v.i.

ABSTRACT: Previous studies comparing eye movements between humans and their closest relatives, chimpanzees, have revealed similarities and differences between the species in terms of where individuals fixate their gaze during free viewing of a naturalistic scene, including social stimuli (e. g. body and face). However, those results were somewhat confounded by the fact that gaze behavior is influenced by low-level stimulus properties (e. g., color and form) and by high-level processes such as social sensitivity and knowledge about the scene. Given the known perceptual and cognitive similarities between chimpanzees and humans, it is expected that such low-level effects do not play a critical role in explaining the high-level similarities and differences between the species. However, there is no quantitative evidence to support this assumption. To estimate the effect of local stimulus saliency on such eye-movement patterns, this study used a well-established bottom-up saliency model. In addition, to elucidate the cues that the viewers use to guide their gaze, we presented scenes in which we had manipulated various stimulus properties. As expected, the saliency model did not fully predict the fixation patterns actually observed in chimpanzees and humans. In addition, both species used multiple cues to fixate socially significant areas such as the face. There was no evidence suggesting any differences between chimpanzees and humans in their responses to low-level saliency. Therefore, this study found a substantial amount of similarity in the perceptual mechanisms underlying gaze guidance in chimpanzees and humans and thereby offers a foundation for direct comparisons between them. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: Bonobos have been observed to use socio-sexual behavior at higher frequency than chimpanzees. Little is known about the developmental influences that shape this behavior in bonobos. We compared the social sexual behavior of wild-born bonobo (n = 8) and chimpanzee (n = 16) infants in an experimental feeding test. Subjects of both species were orphans of the bushmeat trade living at sanctuaries in peer groups. During the experiment, chimpanzee infants never had socio-sexual interactions with one another. In contrast, bonobo infants had socio-sexual interactions significantly more than the chimpanzee infants and more often when food was presented. During these socio-sexual interactions, bonobo infants did not show a preference for heterosexual partners or genital-genital positioning that is reproductive in adults (e. g. a dorso-ventral posture). These findings suggest that the socio-sexual behavior previously observed in various captive and wild bonobos is species-typical. Wild-born bonobos originating from a large geographical range develop this behavior long before puberty and without the need for adults initiating such behavior or acting as models for observational learning. Meanwhile, chimpanzee infants of the same age with similar rearing history show no signs of the same socio-sexual behavior. Results are interpreted regarding hypotheses for the evolution of bonobo psychology. © 2010 Japan Monkey Centre and Springer.

ABSTRACT: Grooming was observed in 11 wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) in Mahale, Tanzania, and the number of removal and stroke movements and grooming duration were recorded. Removal movements were more frequent during social grooming than during self-grooming. Chimpanzees used one or both hands for grooming, and grooming using both hands was more efficient for removing small objects. Due to physical constraints, self-grooming of the arms was almost always done using only one hand. The removal movement frequency during arm grooming was lower when self-grooming than when grooming another. They were more likely to use both hands during grooming another than during self-grooming, and fewer physical constraints during social grooming enabled a higher level of hygienic grooming. © 2011 Japan Monkey Centre and Springer.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are often used in movies, commercials and print advertisements with the intention of eliciting a humorous response from audiences. The portrayal of chimpanzees in unnatural, human-like situations may have a negative effect on the public's understanding of their endangered status in the wild while making them appear as suitable pets. Alternatively, media content that elicits a positive emotional response toward chimpanzees may increase the public's commitment to chimpanzee conservation. To test these competing hypotheses, participants (n = 165) watched a series of commercials in an experiment framed as a marketing study. Imbedded within the same series of commercials was one of three chimpanzee videos. Participants either watched 1) a chimpanzee conservation commercial, 2) commercials containing "entertainment" chimpanzees or 3) control footage of the natural behavior of wild chimpanzees. Results from a post-viewing questionnaire reveal that participants who watched the conservation message understood that chimpanzees were endangered and unsuitable as pets at higher levels than those viewing the control footage. Meanwhile participants watching commercials with entertainment chimpanzees showed a decrease in understanding relative to those watching the control footage. In addition, when participants were given the opportunity to donate part of their earnings from the experiment to a conservation charity, donations were least frequent in the group watching commercials with entertainment chimpanzees. Control questions show that participants did not detect the purpose of the study. These results firmly support the hypothesis that use of entertainment chimpanzees in the popular media negatively distorts the public's perception and hinders chimpanzee conservation efforts. © 2011 Schroepfer et al.

ABSTRACT: A comprehensive representation of the gene content of the long arm of human chromosome 21 (Hsa21q) remains of interest for the study of Down syndrome, its associated phenotypic features, and mouse models. Here we compare transcript catalogs for Hsa21q, chimpanzee chromosome 21 (Ptr21q), and orthologous regions of mouse chromosomes 16, 17, and 10 for open reading frame (ORF) characteristics and conservation. The Hsa21q and mouse catalogs contain 552 and 444 gene models, respectively, of which only 162 are highly conserved. Hsa21q transcripts were used to identify orthologous exons in Ptr21q and assemble 533 putative transcripts. Transcript catalogs for all three organisms are searchable for nucleotide and amino acid sequence features of ORF length, repeat content, experimental support, gene structure, and conservation. For human and mouse comparisons, three additional summaries are provided: (1) the chromosomal distribution of novel ORF transcripts versus zpotential functional RNAs, (2) the distribution of speciesspecific transcripts within Hsa21q and mouse models of Down syndrome, and (3) the organization of sense-antisense and putative sense-antisense structures defining potential regulatory mechanisms. Catalogs, summaries, and nucleotide and amino acid sequences of all composite transcripts are available and searchable at http://gfuncpathdb. ucdenver.edu/iddrc/chr21/ home.php. These data sets provide comprehensive information useful for evaluation of candidate genes and mouse models of Down syndrome and for identification of potential functional RNA genes and novel regulatory mechanisms involving Hsa21q genes. These catalogs and search tools complement and extend information available from other gene annotation projects. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.

ABSTRACT: Humans are able to benefit from a causally structured problem-solving context rather than arbitrarily structured situations. In order to better understand nonhuman causal cognition, it is therefore important to isolate crucial factors that might differentiate between events that follow a purely spatial and temporal contingency and those that hold a "true" causal relationship. In the first of two experiments, chimpanzee subjects were required to detect a bottle containing juice from five opaque bottles of equal shape and size. In the causal condition, the juice bottle looked identical to the other four bottles, only it was much heavier than the others. In the arbitrary condition, the weight of all five bottles was identical, but the juice bottle was color-marked differently. Since bottle opening was made difficult (and therefore costly), the question was whether subject's manipulative behavior would be random or somehow influenced by the nature of the provided information. Our results show that subjects detected and opened the juice bottle significantly faster when weight was the discriminating feature (causal condition) compared to situations in which the discrimination was necessarily based on a color-cue (arbitrary condition). Experiment 2 ruled out the possibility of a general learning bias toward tactile rather than visual information in chimpanzees. When tested in a simple exchange paradigm that prevented any use of causal information, no predominance of a tactile cue (weight) over a visual cue (color) could be found. Furthermore-and in contrast to the causal condition in Experiment 1-no learning occurred during the course of Experiment 2, neither in the weight nor in the color condition. We therefore conclude that chimpanzees can more easily determine the content of an object based on its causal properties compared to situations in which the only available information is a pure arbitrary regularity. This supports the view that chimpanzees' causal cognition does not rely on mere perceptual information but also on structural abstraction about their physical environment. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: Uterine leiomyomata are common, affecting 70-80% of women between 30 and 50 years of age. Leiomyomata have been reported for a variety of primate species, although prevalence rates and treatments have not been widely reported. The prevalence, diagnosis, and treatment of uterine leiomyomata in the Alamogordo Primate Facility and the Keeling Center for Comparative Medicine and Research were examined. Uterine leiomyomata were diagnosed in 28.4% of chimpanzees with an average age at diagnosis of 30.4±8.0 years. Advanced age (>30 years) was related to an increase in leiomyomata and use of hormonal contraception was related to a decrease in leiomyomata. As the captive chimpanzee population ages, the incidence of leiomyomata among female chimpanzees will likely increase. The introduction of progesterone-based contraception for nonbreeding research and zoological chimpanzees may reduce the development of leiomyomata. Finally, all chimpanzee facilities should institute aggressive screening programs and carefully consider treatment plans. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Leprosy is a chronic infectious disorder caused by Mycobacterium leprae, which mainly affects skin and peripheral nerves. It is classified as either paucibacillary or multibacillary based upon clinical manifestations and slit-skin smear results. It is speculated that leprosy develops after a long latency period following M. leprae infection. However, the actual time of infection and the duration of latency have never been proven in human patients. To date, four cases of spontaneous leprosy have been reported in chimpanzees who were caught in West Africa in infancy and used for medical research in the USA and Japan. One of these chimpanzees was extensively studied in Japan, and single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis for the M. leprae genome was conducted. This analysis revealed that the chimpanzee was infected with M. leprae during infancy in West Africa and the pathognomonic signs of leprosy appeared after at least 30 years of incubation. Analysis of leprosy in chimpanzees can contribute not only to medical research but also to the understanding of the pathoetiology of leprosy. © 2011 Future Medicine Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Degenerative joint disease (DJD), also known as osteoarthritis, has been well documented in aging populations of captive and free-ranging macaques; however, successful treatments for DJD in nonhuman primates have not been published. Published data on chimpanzees show little to no DJD present in the wild, and there are no published reports of DJD in captive chimpanzees. We report here the first documented case of DJD of both the right and left femorotibial joints in a captive male chimpanzee. Progression from minimal to moderate to severe osteoarthritis occurred in this animal over the course of 1 y. Treatment with chondroprotective supplements (that is, glucosamine chondroitin, polysulfated glycosaminoglycan) and intraarticular corticosteroid injections (that is, methylprednisolone, ketorolac), together with pain management (that is, celecoxib, tramadol, carprofen), resulted in increased activity levels and decreased clinical signs of disease. DJD has a considerable negative effect on quality of life among the human geriatric population and therefore is likely to be one of the most significant diseases that will affect the increasingly aged captive chimpanzee population. As this case study demonstrates, appropriate treatment can improve and extend quality of life dramatically in these animals. However, in cases of severe osteoarthritis cases, medication alone may be insufficient to increase stability, and surgical options should be explored.

ABSTRACT: Background: Facilities across Africa care for apes orphaned by the trade for "bushmeat." These facilities, called sanctuaries, provide housing for apes such as bonobos (Pan paniscus) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) who have been illegally taken from the wild and sold as pets. Although these circumstances are undoubtedly stressful for the apes, most individuals arrive at the sanctuaries as infants and are subsequently provided with rich physical and social environments that can facilitate the expression of species-typical behaviors. Methods and Findings: We tested whether bonobo and chimpanzee orphans living in sanctuaries show any behavioral, physiological, or cognitive abnormalities relative to other individuals in captivity as a result of the early-life stress they experience. Orphans showed lower levels of aberrant behaviors, similar levels of average cortisol, and highly similar performances on a broad battery of cognitive tests in comparisons with individuals of the same species who were either living at a zoo or were reared by their mothers at the sanctuaries. Conclusion: Taken together, these results support the rehabilitation strategy used by sanctuaries in the Pan-African Sanctuary Alliance (PASA) and suggest that the orphans we examined did not show long-term signs of stress as a result of their capture. Our findings also show that sanctuary apes are as psychologically healthy as apes in other captive settings and thus represent a valuable resource for non-invasive research. © 2011 Wobber, Hare.

ABSTRACT: The extent to which active female mating preferences influence male reproductive success in mammals is unclear, particularly for promiscuously breeding species like chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Previous studies from multiple long-term study sites have shown that female chimpanzees mate more restrictively around ovulation, and this has been taken as evidence for female choice. However, none of these studies rigorously evaluated the alternative hypothesis that restrictive mating results not from unconstrained choice, but in response to coercive mate guarding, in which males use punishment and intimidation to reduce female promiscuity and promote their own mating interests. Nor did they consider evidence for the potential genetic or phenotypic benefits that females might be choosing. Using 11 years of data from the Kanyawara community in Kibale National Park, Uganda, we previously demonstrated that males achieve elevated mating success with those females toward whom they direct high levels of aggression. Here we extend those findings to show that even female copulatory approaches, which have previously been attributed to female choice, are correlated with male aggression. Specifically, individual females at our site initiated periovulatory copulations most frequently with the males who were most aggressive toward them throughout their cycles. Those males showed high rates of aggression toward females throughout estrus, despite achieving high copulation rates, demonstrating a continuing conflict of interest over the exclusivity of mating access. Because sexual coercion is potentially widespread in primates and other mammals, our results stress the importance of considering the influence of male aggression in studies of female choice. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: Background Cardiovascular disease is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality among captive chimpanzees. But there are no clinical definitions of normotension or hypertension in chimpanzees. Methods We analyzed 1year of blood pressure (BP) data from a population of 261 healthy captive adult chimpanzees using a consistent set of criteria to ascertain health. Results Systolic BP varied by body weight. Diastolic BP varied by age. Median normotension was 126/63mmHg, with an upper limit of 147/84mmHg. We defined categories of pre-hypertension (148/85-153/88mmHg) and hypertension (≥154/89mmHg). The prevalence of elevated BP was 15%. The relative risk of mortality was 2.60, compared to normotensive animals. Conclusions We used contemporary methods from human laboratory medicine to define reliable reference intervals for chimpanzee BP. Results allow accurate diagnosis of hypertension and pre-hypertension, and demonstrate an effect of elevated BP on mortality. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

ABSTRACT: We performed histological analyses for comparing testicular microstructure between the gorilla, chimpanzee, and orangutan. Testicular samples were obtained by autopsy or biopsy from 10 gorillas, 11 chimpanzees, and 7 orangutans from several zoos and institutes. The seminiferous epithelia were thick in the chimpanzee and orangutan but thin in the gorilla. Leydig cells in the interstitial tissue were abundant in the gorilla. The acrosomic system was extremely well developed in the orangutans. Our study reveals that the cycle of seminiferous epithelium in orangutan testis can be divided into ten stages, whereas that in human, chimpanzee, and gorilla testes can be divided into only six stages. Phylogenetic analyses of the number of divisions may indicate that the seminiferous epithelium of our common ancestor has changed since the orangutan diverged from it. Furthermore, we performed comparative analyses of testicular microstructure to estimate relative sperm production among these three animals, and proposed a new indicator (namely the spermatogenic index, SI) closely related to sperm production. The SI indicated that a chimpanzee usually produces about 223 times more sperm than a gorilla and about 14 times more than an orangutan. Our data demonstrate the significance of the SI for estimating sperm production, thus aiding our understanding of the reproductive strategy as well as testis weight and relative testis size in investigated primates. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Social play, a widespread phenomenon in mammals, is a multifunctional behavior, which can have many different roles according to species, sex, age, relationship quality between playmates, group membership, context, and habitat. Play joins and cuts across a variety of disciplines leading directly to inquiries relating to individual developmental changes and species adaptation, thus the importance of comparative studies appears evident. Here, we aim at proposing a possible ontogenetic pathway of chimpanzee play (Pan troglodytes) and contrast our data with those of human play. Chimpanzee play shows a number of changes from infancy to juvenility. Particularly, solitary and social play follows different developmental trajectories. While solitary play peaks in infancy, social play does not show any quantitative variation between infancy and juvenility but shows a strong qualitative variation in complexity, asymmetry, and playmate choice. Like laughter in humans, the playful expressions in chimpanzees (at the different age phases) seem to have a role in advertising cooperative dispositions and intentions thus increasing the likelihood of engaging in solid social relationships. In conclusion, in chimpanzees, as in humans, both play behavior and the signals that accompany play serve multiple functions according to the different age phases. © 2011 Cordoni, Palagi.

ABSTRACT: The initial goal of this study was to evaluate proteinuria by using the protein to creatinine (UPC) ratio of urine obtained by cystocentesis of healthy adult captive chimpanzees. Urine samples were collected by using ultrasound-guided cystocentesis from 125 (80 male, 45 female) captive chimpanzees. All samples were collected over a 17-mo time period (August 2008 to January 2010) during the animal's annual physical examination. Samples were assayed at a veterinary diagnostic laboratory. Results indicated that both age and blood contamination affect the UPC ratio and therefore alter the diagnostic utility of the UPC ratio in chimpanzees. In addition, this research establishes reference ranges by age for the UPC ratio in healthy adult chimpanzees. Chimps younger than the median age of 24.6 y have a median UPC ratio of 0.098 (range, 0 to 1.76), whereas older animals have a median UPC of 0.288 (range, 0 to 2.44). Our results likely will enable veterinarians working with chimpanzees to better evaluate their renal function. Copyright 2011 by the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees remain fixed on a single strategy, even if a novel, more efficient, strategy is introduced. Previous studies reporting such findings have incorporated paradigms in which chimpanzees learn one behavioural method and then are shown a new one that the chimpanzees invariably do not adopt. This study provides the first evidence that chimpanzees show such conservatism even when the new method employs the identical required behaviour as the first, but for a different reward. Groups of chimpanzees could choose to exchange one of two types of inedible tokens, with each token type being associated with a different food reward: one type was rewarded with a highly preferred food (grape) and the other type was rewarded with a less preferred food (carrot). Individuals first observed a model chimpanzee from their social group trained to choose one of the two types of tokens. In one group, this token earned a carrot, while in the other, control, group the token earned a grape. In both groups, chimpanzees conformed to the trained model's choice. This was especially striking for those gaining the pieces of carrot, the less favoured reward. This resulted in a population-level trend of food choices, even when counter to their original, individual, preferences. Moreover, the chimpanzees' food preferences did not change over time, demonstrating that these results were not due to a simple shift in preferences. We discuss social factors apparent in the interactions and suggest that, despite seeming to be inefficient, in chimpanzees, conformity may benefit them, possibly by assisting with the maintenance of group relations. © 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: Coprophagy is common in captive primates but has also been reported in the wild. For example, wild apes extract and reingest items from faeces. We term this behavior seed reingestion because the dung matrix is not consumed. We assessed the importance of seed reingestion in a population of savannah chimpanzees at Fongoli, southeastern Senegal, one of the hottest and driest areas of the species' range, where chimpanzees have a relatively narrow dietary repertoire. We observed habituated chimpanzees on 122 d during 8 mo in 2005 and 2006, employing both focal subject and scan sampling of identified individuals for 1278 h of data collection. Chimpanzees reingested seeds of 2 species: Parkia biglobosa and Adansonia digitata. Both seed species have a hard protective shell, and the embryos are rich in proteins and lipids. Chimpanzees initially ate the fruit matrix pulp and swallowed intact seeds before reingesting and chewing/destroying seeds. Seed reingestion accounted for almost 2% of feeding time. We suggest that at Fongoli this behavior may be an adaptive strategy to maximize food intake, by softening the seed's shell and making the seed's content more accessible. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

ABSTRACT: Precise identification of NK-cell populations in humans and nonhuman primates has been confounded by imprecise phenotypic definitions. A common definition used in nonhuman primates, including chimpanzees, is CD3-CD8α+CD16+, and this is the dominant NK-cell phenotype in peripheral blood. However, recent data suggest that in chimpanzees a rare CD8α-CD16+ population also exists. Herein, we present evidence validating the existence of this rare subset in chimpanzee peripheral blood, but also demonstrating that gating on CD3-CD8α-CD16+ cells can inadvertently include a large number of CD16+ myeloid DCs (mDCs). We confirmed the inclusion of mDCs in CD3-CD8α-CD16+ gated cells by demonstrating high expression of CD11c, BDCA-1 and HLA-DR, and by the lack of expression of NKp46 and intracellular perforin. We also functionally validated the CD8α- NK-cell and mDC populations by mutually exclusive responsiveness to a classical NK-cell stimulus, MHC class I-deficient cells, and a prototypic mDC stimulus, poly I:C, respectively. Overall, these data demonstrate common problems with gating of NK cells that can lead to erroneous conclusions and highlight a critical need for consensus protocols for NK-cell phenotyping. © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

ABSTRACT: Deep trophoblast invasion is usually considered to be a unique feature of human placentation as compared to other primates. Because of the occasional occurrence of preeclampsia in great apes, which in the human is associated with impaired deep invasion, this uniqueness may be questioned. The availability of two well-documented pregnant chimpanzee uteri in the Hubrecht Collection (Museum für Naturkunde, Berlin) allowed us to evaluate the extent of trophoblast invasion in this species. By adjusting currently used protocols, we obtained successful immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratin and α-actin, as well as Ulex europaeus agglutinin 1 (UEA1) lectin staining, in this archival material. In both specimens interstitial trophoblast invasion had occurred in both decidua and myometrium. Because of a lack of published data on fetal growth for this species, fetal sizes (7 cm and 13 cm) could not be strictly related to gestational ages and thus be compared with the time-course of human trophoblast invasion. However, since the earlier specimen did not show any endovascular trophoblast invasion in spiral arteries - in contrast to pregnant human uteri with equivalent fetal sizes - endovascular migration seems to begin at a different gestational age in the chimpanzee. In the later specimen endovascular trophoblast was associated with spiral artery remodelling in the inner myometrium, and this invasion was extended to include a radial artery, which at that stage still showed relatively intact vascular smooth muscle and elastic lamina. We conclude that invasion depth and spiral artery remodelling are basically similar in chimpanzees and humans, although the seemingly different time of onset may have implications for uteroplacental oxygen supply and fetal development. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Osteon morphotype scores (MTSs) allow for quantification of mechanically important collagen/lamellar variations between secondary osteons when viewed in circularly polarized ight (CPL). We recently modified the 6-point MTS method of Martin et al. (Martin RB, Gibson VA, Stover SM, Gibeling JC, Griffin LV (1996a) Osteonal structure in the equine third metacarpus. 19, 165-71) and reported superiority of this modified method in correlating with 'tension' and 'compression' cortices of both chimpanzee proximal femoral diaphyses and diaphyses of other non-anthropoid bones that are loaded in habitual bending (Skedros et al. 2009, 2011). In these studies, the 'tension' and 'compression' cortices differed significantly in predominant collagen fiber orientation (CFO) based on weighted-mean gray levels (CFO/WMGLs) in CPL images. In chimpanzee femora, however, some osteons were difficult to score with the 6-point method; namely, 'hybrids' with peripherally bright 'hoops' and variability in alternating rings within the osteon wall. We hypothesized that some of these hybrids would be more prevalent in regions subject to torsion than bending. In this perspective the present study was aimed at expanding our 6-point scoring method (S-6-MTS) into two 12-point methods with six additional morphotypes that considered these hybrids. Three- and 4-point methods were also evaluated. We hypothesized that at least one of these other methods would out-perform the S-6-MTS in terms of accuracy, reliability, and interpreting torsion vs. bending load histories. Osteon morphotypes were quantified in CPL images from transverse sections of eight adult chimpanzee femora (neck, proximal diaphysis, mid-diaphysis), where the mid-diaphysis and base- and mid-neck locations have relatively more complex loading (e.g. torsion+bending) than the proximal diaphysis, where bending predominates. Correlation coefficients between CFO/WMGL and MTSs showed that the S-6-MTS method was either stronger or equivalent to the 12-point methods, and typically stronger than the 3- and 4-point methods for all load environments. In nearly all instances the S-6-MTS is more reliable and accurate when it is applied to cases where interpreting load history requires distinguishing habitual bending from torsion. Consequently, in studies of osteonal adaptations for these load histories the 3- and 4-point methods are not stronger correlates, and the extra time required to assign additional scores in the 12-point methods is both unnecessary and can be highly unreliable. © 2011 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Pasteurella multocida can cause a variety of diseases in various species of mammals and birds throughout the world but nothing is known about its importance for wild great apes. In this study we isolated P. multocida from wild living, habituated chimpanzees from Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire. Isolates originated from two chimpanzees that died during a respiratory disease outbreak in 2004 as well as from one individual that developed chronic air-sacculitis following this outbreak. Four isolates were subjected to a full phenotypic and molecular characterisation. Two different clones were identified using pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) enabled the identification of previous unknown alleles and two new sequence types, ST68 and ST69, were assigned. Phylogenetic analysis of the superoxide dismutase (sodA) gene and concatenated sequences from seven MLST-housekeeping genes showed close clustering within known P. multocida isolated from various hosts and geographic locations. Due to the clinical relevance of the strains described here, these results make an important contribution to our knowledge of pathogens involved in lethal disease outbreaks among endangered great apes. © 2011 Köndgen et al.

ABSTRACT: Structural variation has played an important role in the evolutionary restructuring of human and great ape genomes. Recent analyses have suggested that the genomes of chimpanzee and human have been particularly enriched for this form of genetic variation. Here, we set out to assess the extent of structural variation in the gorilla lineage by generating 10-fold genomic sequence coverage from a western lowland gorilla and integrating these data into a physical and cytogenetic framework of structural variation. We discovered and validated over 7665 structural changes within the gorilla lineage, including sequence resolution of inversions, deletions, duplications, and mobile element insertions. A comparison with human and other ape genomes shows that the gorilla genome has been subjected to the highest rate of segmental duplication. We show that both the gorilla and chimpanzee genomes have experienced independent yet convergent patterns of structural mutation that have not occurred in humans, including the formation of subtelomeric heterochromatic caps, the hyperexpansion of segmental duplications, and bursts of retroviral integrations. Our analysis suggests that the chimpanzee and gorilla genomes are structurally more derived than either orangutan or human genomes. © 2011 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

ABSTRACT: We investigated the hypothesis that patterns of chimpanzee food sharing are influenced by whether individuals contributed to its acquisition collaboratively. In two experiments we exposed pairs of captive chimpanzees to food acquisition/sharing situations in which we manipulated (1) whether or not the two individuals had worked together collaboratively to retrieve the food and (2) the proximity of the individuals to the food at the moment of retrieval. The first experiment resembled a scramble competition scenario, with nonmonopolizable food. Proximity of individuals to the food when it arrived was the major variable affecting amount obtained by subordinates. Whether or not the food was obtained via collaboration had no effect. The second experiment resembled a contest competition scenario, as the food was a single large piece of fruit that could be more readily monopolized. In this scenario, dominants obtained more food than subordinates, the amount of food obtained by 'noncaptors' was affected by their proximity to the food when it arrived, and again previous collaboration had no effect. These results suggest that in many food acquisition situations first-arriver and first-possessor chimpanzees, as well as dominants in general, have a significant advantage in food acquisition, but being a collaborator brings no extra benefits. © 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to provide basic data on ant-fishing behavior among the M group chimpanzees at the Mahale Mountains National Park, Tanzania. Ant-fishing is a type of tool-using behavior that has been exhibited by Mahale chimpanzees when feeding upon arboreal carpenter ants (Camponotus spp.) since the 1970s, and is now regarded as a candidate of wild chimpanzee culture. Herein, I describe in detail the features of ant-fishing shown by the Mahale M group chimpanzees: (1) 2 species of Camponotus ants (Camponotus sp. (chrysurus-complex) [C. sp. 1] and C. brutus) were identified as the target species of ant-fishing, and C. sp. 1 was selected intensively as the main target; (2) 24 species (92 individuals) of trees were identified as ant-fishing sites-these were widely distributed throughout the western/lowland region of the M group's home range, and the top 5 species were used more frequently; (3) the efficiency of ant-fishing was influenced not only by the site choice or the skillfulness of the chimpanzees, but inevitably by the condition of the ants; (4) the estimated nutritional intake from ant-fishing was apparently negligible; (5) most of the M group members (50/60 individuals) older than 3 years of age successfully used tools to fish for ants; and (6) female chimpanzees engaged in ant-fishing more frequently and for longer periods than males did. Further, I compared the features of ant-fishing exhibited by the Mahale M group chimpanzees with those exhibited by the former K group at Mahale and by other populations of wild chimpanzees. © 2011 Japan Monkey Centre and Springer.

ABSTRACT: Although chimpanzees have been reported to understand to some extent others' visual perception, previous studies using food requesting tasks are divided on whether or not chimpanzees understand the role of eye gaze. One plausible reason for this discrepancy may be the familiarity of the testing situation. Previous food requesting tasks with negative results used an unfamiliar situation that may be difficult for some chimpanzees to recognize as a requesting situation, whereas those with positive results used a familiar situation. The present study tested chimpanzees' understanding of others' attentional states by comparing two requesting situations: an unfamiliar situation in which food was put on a table, and a familiar situation in which chimpanzees requested food held by an experimenter. Chimpanzees showed evidence of understanding the experimenter's attentional variations and the role of eye gaze only in the latter task. This suggests that an unfamiliar requesting situation may keep subjects from expressing their understanding of others' attentional states even though they are sensitive to them. © 2011 John Benjamins Publishing Company.

ABSTRACT: The first model for co-management between local communities and government towards the sustainable utilization of forested regions in Republic of Guinea was established in the Nialama Classified Forest in 1999. Technical and financial support was provided by USAID to develop local natural resource management capacity. Long-term local chimpanzee monitoring provided the basis for delimiting the boundaries of core areas for strict protection which continue to provide refuge to the resident chimpanzee population. Using satellite imagery, we reviewed the impacts of co-management on key chimpanzee habitat between 1986 and 2009. Degradation statistics show that land cover change within areas delimited as critical chimpanzee habitat inside of the Classified Forest was far less compared to the Classified Forest as a whole, or within a 5 km buffer zone. Comparatively, critical chimpanzee habitat located outside of the Nialama Classified Forest suffered the most degradation. Here we discuss the impacts of co-management on chimpanzee habitat and causal factors surrounding the continued survival of chimpanzees in Nialama. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

ABSTRACT: Among other factors, changes in gene expression on the human evolutionary lineage have been suggested to play an important role in the establishment of human-specific phenotypes. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these expression changes are largely unknown. Here, we have explored the role of microRNA (miRNA) in the regulation of gene expression divergence among adult humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus macaques, in two brain regions: prefrontal cortex and cerebellum. Using a combination of high-throughput sequencing, miRNA microarrays, and Q-PCR, we have shown that up to 11% of the 325 expressed miRNA diverged significantly between humans and chimpanzees and up to 31% between humans and macaques. Measuring mRNA and protein expression in human and chimpanzee brains, we found a significant inverse relationship between the miRNA and the target genes expression divergence, explaining 2%-4% of mRNA and 4%-6% of protein expression differences. Notably, miRNA showing human-specific expression localize in neurons and target genes that are involved in neural functions. Enrichment in neural functions, as well as miRNA-driven regulation on the human evolutionary lineage, was further confirmed by experimental validation of predicted miRNA targets in two neuroblastoma cell lines. Finally, we identified a signature of positive selection in the upstream region of one of the five miRNA with human-specific expression, miR-34c-5p. This suggests that miR-34c-5p expression change took place after the split of the human and the Neanderthal lineages and had adaptive significance. Taken together these results indicate that changes in miRNA expression might have contributed to evolution of human cognitive functions. © 2011 Hu et al.

ABSTRACT: Copulation preferences in our closest living relative, the chimpanzee, suggest that males prefer older females who have had previous offspring. However, this finding is counter to some behavioral models, which predict that chimpanzee males, as promiscuous breeders with minimal costs to mating, should show little or no preference when choosing mating partners (e.g. should mate indiscriminately). To determine if the preferences indicated by copulations appear in other contexts as well as how they interact, we examined how male chimpanzees' grooming patterns varied amongst females. We found that males' preferences were based on interactions among females' fertility status, age, and parity. First, grooming increased with increasing female parity. We further found an effect of the estrous cycle on grooming; when females were at the lowest point of their cycle, males preferentially groomed parous females at peak reproductive age, but during maximal tumescence, males preferred the oldest multiparous females. Nulliparous females received relatively little grooming regardless of age or fertility. Thus, male chimpanzees apparently chose grooming partners based on both female's experience and fertility, possibly indicating a two-pronged social investment strategy. Male selectivity seems to have evolved to effectively distribute costly social resources in a pattern which may increase their overall reproductive success. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Different locomotor and postural demands are met partly due to the varying properties and proportions of the muscle fibre types within the skeletal muscles. Such data are therefore important in understanding the subtle relationships between morphology, function and behaviour. The triceps surae muscle group is of particular interest when studying our closest living relatives, the non-human great apes, as they lack a significant external Achilles tendon, crucial to running locomotion in humans and other cursorial species. The aim of this study, therefore, was to determine the proportions of type I (slow) and type II (fast) fibres throughout these muscles in chimpanzees and orangutans using immunohistochemistry. The orangutan had a higher proportion of type I fibres in all muscles compared with the chimpanzees, related to their slower, more controlled movements in their arboreal habitat. The higher proportion of type II fibres in the chimpanzees likely reflects a compromise between their need for controlled mobility when arboreal, and greater speed and power when terrestrial. Overall, the proportion of slow fibres was greater in the soleus muscle compared with the gastrocnemius muscles, and there was some evidence of proximal to distal and medial to lateral variations within some muscles. This study has shown that not only do orangutans and chimpanzees have very different muscle fibre populations that reflect their locomotor repertoires, but it also shows how the proportion of fibre types provides an additional mechanism by which the performance of a muscle can be modulated to suit the needs of a species. © 2011 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Postconflict management strategies have been defined as any postconflict interaction that mitigates the negative consequences of the preceding agonistic conflict. Although most studies have investigated postconflict interactions between former opponents or between victims and uninvolved bystanders, interactions between aggressors and bystanders have received much less attention. In this study, we examined a database of 1,102 agonistic interactions and their corresponding postconflict periods in two outdoor-housed groups of captive chimpanzees in order to test the occurrence of postconflict third-party affiliation of aggressors. Our results confirmed the occurrence of appeasement, i.e. postconflict affiliation by a bystander toward an aggressor, but failed to detect the occurrence of postconflict affiliation directed from aggressors toward bystanders. Appeasement rates did not differ according to the sex of the involved individuals. In addition, appeasement occurred more often in the absence of reconciliation than after its occurrence suggesting that appeasement may act as an alternative to reconciliation when the latter fails to occur. Both study groups showed behavioral specificity for appeasement, i.e. context-specific use of certain behaviors, supporting the view that chimpanzees exhibit highly visible explicit postconflict affiliation. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Why do animals help other individuals and provide benefits to the recipient, sometimes at personal cost? In this study, we aim to determine if some of the helpful behaviors observed in a group of wild chimpanzees (Taï chimpanzee group, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa) are exchanged among individuals resulting in a net benefit for both participants. We adopted an inclusive view of exchanges by considering that all commodities (i. e., social behaviors as grooming, sex, support, as well as resources, such as meat) can be exchanged. This would result in "market" type social interactions in which debts of one commodity can be met by giving the same or other commodities. We investigated whether both in-kind exchanges and trades of commodities occurred. The Taï chimpanzees reciprocated the amount of grooming they received and were more likely to give support in agonistic conflicts to those who also supported them. In addition, they traded support for meat and meat for sex. Both male and female chimpanzees exchanged many different commodities, which seemed to result in long-term balanced relationships. Our results suggest that wild chimpanzees rely on other group members to obtain many of the important commodities they need. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: The composition of Ficus sp. and Musanga leo-errerae in Chimpanzees' diet was investigated by faecal analysis and direct observation in the medium altitude forest of Kalinzu, along the albertine rift, south-western Uganda. The fruit availability of Ficus species showed significant variations while that of Musanga leo-errerae was consistent and significantly higher than that of Ficus (P=0.053; t=-2.034) all year round. Their consumption was not opportunistic as no correlation existed between their fruit abundance and their occurrence in chimpanzee faecal samples/diet (Musanga leo-errerae: r=0.153, P=0.456; Ficus sp.: r=0.039, P=0.848). Results showed that Musanga leo-errerae and Ficus species seeds occurred in 80.2% and 67.2% respectively of the total 2635 chimpanzee faecal samples analyzed. Although there was no significant difference between chimpanzees party size that fed on Musanga leo-errerae and Ficus tree species, the rate of consumption was significantly different in the low (t=3.835; P=0.031) than the high fruiting season (t=2.379; P=0.063). Ficus sp. and Musanga leo-errerae genera function as coexistent keystone fruits for chimpanzees because they perfectly complement each other in terms of chimpanzees' sustenance. This information has significant implications in the management of tropical forests like Kibale, Budongo, Bwindi Impenetrable, Gombe and Mahale inhabited by primate populations especially the endangered ones like the chimpanzee. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: We investigated the effects of cognitive experiments by direct comparison of activity budgets between wild and captive chimpanzees. One goal of captive management is to ensure that the activity budgets of captive animals are as similar as possible to those of their wild counterparts. However, such similarity has rarely been achieved. We compared the activity budget among three groups of chimpanzees: wild chimpanzees in Bossou (Guinea, n = 10), and captive chimpanzees who participated in cognitive experiments (experimental chimpanzees, n = 6) or did not participate in the experiments (nonexperimental chimpanzees, n = 6) at the Primate Research Institute (Japan). The experimental chimpanzees voluntarily participated in computer-controlled cognitive tasks and small pieces of fruits were provided as rewards. The data from captivity were obtained on the experimental days (weekdays) and nonexperimental days (weekends). In both study sites, we followed each chimpanzee from about 7 a.m. until the time when chimpanzees started to rest in the evening. The behaviors were recorded every 1min. The results showed that on weekdays, feeding time and resting time of the experimental chimpanzees were almost the same as those of wild chimpanzees. However, for the nonexperimental chimpanzees, feeding time was significantly shorter and resting time was longer than those of the wild chimpanzees. In contrast, no difference was found in feeding time or resting time of the two groups of captive chimpanzees on weekends. The results suggested that the cognitive experiments worked as an efficient method for food-based enrichment. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Humans readily group component elements into a coherent perceptual whole and perceive the global form of visual patterns in priority over local features, which stands in contrast to at least some data from the animal literature, suggesting possible species differences in perceptual processes. In this study, chimpanzees and baboons were required to match intact and partially contour-deleted line-drawings in a computerized task in order to further explore the ability of nonhuman primates to group component elements into a coherent perceptual whole and to determine to what extent they use the global form or the local features. Experiment 1 showed that the baboons and chimpanzees matched intact continuous line-drawings (intact-intact) more easily than partially contour-deleted line-drawings (deleted-deleted). Both species could also match partially deleted line-drawings with their intact version (deleted-intact), but at a lower performance level. Experiment 2 further showed that subjects from the two species could match partially deleted coherent line-drawings (deleted-deleted) more easily than their scrambled incoherent versions (scrambled-scrambled). They could however match the coherent deleted forms with their scrambled version (deleted-scrambled). It is suggested that solutions of these tasks rely on the processing of both global and local cues, with no clear-cut species difference in that ability. Overall, the results show that contour completion of line-drawings was not easy. Implications on the processing of human-made two-dimensional representations such as line-drawings are discussed. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: Social animals have much to gain from observing and responding appropriately to the actions of their conspecific group members. This can in turn lead to the learning of novel behavior patterns (social learning) or to foraging, ranging, or social behavioral choices copied from fellow group members, which do not necessarily result in long-term learning, but at the time represent adaptive responses to environmental cues (public information use). In the current study, we developed a novel system for the study of public information use under fully automated conditions. We modified a classic single-subject laboratory paradigm-matching-to-sample (MTS)-and examined chimpanzees' ability to interpret and utilize cues provided by the behavior of a conspecific to solve the task. In Experiment 1, two subjects took turns on an identity MTS task, with one subject (the model) performing the first half of the trial and the other subject (the observer) completing the trial using the model's actions as discriminative cues. Both subjects performed above chance from the first session onwards. In Experiment 2, the subjects were tested on a symbolic version of the same MTS task, with one subject showing spontaneous transfer. Our study establishes a novel method for examining public information use within a highly controlled and automated setting. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: Several recent studies have documented considerable intraspecific and intrapopulation ecological variation in primates. However, we generally lack an understanding of how such variability may be linked to concomitant demographic variation among groups or populations of the same species, particularly in regard to large-bodied and wide-ranging species with high ecological flexibility, such as chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). We compared the feeding ecology of chimpanzees inhabiting 2 sites in Kibale National Park, Uganda that differ 3-fold in chimpanzee density and support notably different plant communities. Chimpanzees at Ngogo, a site with the largest known chimpanzee community and unusually high chimpanzee density, spent a significantly lower percentage of time resting (and pregnant and lactating females spent more time feeding), incorporated higher percentages of ripe fruit in their diet, had lower dietary diversity values, and had shorter and less variable average patch residency times than did their counterparts at the nearby Kanyawara site, which supports a relatively low density of chimpanzees. In addition, feeding party size was significantly and positively related to feeding patch size at Ngogo, but not at Kanyawara. Together these findings aid in explaining the noted disparity in chimpanzee community size and density between Ngogo and Kanyawara by suggesting that the diet of Ngogo chimpanzees is of higher overall quality than that of Kanyawara chimpanzees. They also highlight the potentially profound influence of even small-scale habitat heterogeneity on the ecology of primates. Researchers must take such influences into account when attempting to draw conclusions about species- or population-level characteristics. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

ABSTRACT: We identified significantly higher expression of the genes glycogen debranching enzyme 6 (AGL), enolase 1 (ENOSF1), ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase 2 (ENPP2_1), glutathione S-transferase 3 (GSTM3_3) and mannosidase (MAN2B2) from human left cerebrums versus chimpanzees. Yet the distinct low- and high-expression AGL, ENOSF1, ENPP2_1, GSTM3_3 and MAN2B2 metabolism networks between chimpanzee and human left cerebrum remain to be elucidated. Here, we constructed low- and high-expression activated and inhibited upstream and downstream AGL, ENOSF1, ENPP2_1, GSTM3_3 and MAN2B2 metabolism network between chimpanzee and human left cerebrum in GEO data set by gene regulatory network inference method based on linear programming and decomposition procedure, under covering AGL, ENOSF1, ENPP2_1, GSTM3_3 and MAN2B2 pathway and matching metabolism enrichment analysis by CapitalBio MAS 3. 0 integration of public databases, including Gene Ontology, KEGG, BioCarta, GenMapp, Intact, UniGene, OMIM, etc. Our results show that the AGL, ENOSF1, ENPP2_1, GSTM3_3 and MAN2B2 metabolism network has more activated and less inhibited molecules in chimpanzee, but less activated and more inhibited in the human left cerebrum. We inferred stronger carbohydrate, glutathione and proteoglycan metabolism, ATPase activity, but weaker base excision repair, arachidonic acid and drug metabolism as a result of inducing cell growth in low-expression AGL, ENOSF1, ENPP2_1, GSTM3_3 and MAN2B2 metabolism network of chimpanzee left cerebrum; whereas stronger lipid metabolism, amino acid catabolism, DNA repair but weaker inflammatory response, cell proliferation, glutathione and carbohydrate metabolism as a result of inducing cell differentiation in high-expression AGL, ENOSF1, ENPP2_1, GSTM3_3 and MAN2B2 metabolism network of human left cerebrum. Our inferences are consistent with recent reports and computational activation and inhibition gene number patterns, respectively. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

ABSTRACT: Comparison of the early development of the mandibular symphysis between primates and modern humans is of particular interest in human palaeontology. Using geometric morphometric methods, we explored and compared the ontogenetic shape changes of 14 chimpanzee mandibles (Pan troglodytes) against 66 human CT-scanned mandibles over the age range from fetal life to the complete emergence of the deciduous dentition in a visualization incorporating the deciduous tooth arrangement. The results reveal that the symphysis is anteriorly inclined in the youngest chimpanzee fetuses but develops an increasingly vertical orientation up until birth. At the same time, the anterior teeth reorient before a vertical emergence, and a symphyseal tuber appears on the labial side. When the deciduous canine emerges, the symphysis inclines anteriorly again, exhibiting the adult characteristic slope. These two phases are characterized by a repositioning of the simian shelf. Unlike chimpanzees, the human symphysis remains vertical throughout fetal development. However, the combination of morphological changes observed in chimpanzee fetuses is similar to that of modern humans after birth, as the mental region projects forward. By elongating the alveolar process, the inclination of the chimpanzee symphysis could be a key event for emergence of the deciduous canine, as space is lacking at the alveolar ridge in a vertical symphysis once the deciduous incisors and molars have emerged. The repositioning of the simian shelf suggests that the suprahyoid muscles have a significant influence on the anterior growth of the symphysis. The anteroposterior positioning of the basal symphysis in both species may be related to hyoid bone position during ontogeny. © 2010 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Although recent research has investigated animal decision-making under risk, little is known about how animals choose under conditions of ambiguity when they lack information about the available alternatives. Many models of choice behaviour assume that ambiguity does not impact decision-makers, but studies of humans suggest that people tend to be more averse to choosing ambiguous options than risky options with known probabilities. To illuminate the evolutionary roots of human economic behaviour, we examined whether our closest living relatives, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (Pan paniscus), share this bias against ambiguity. Apes chose between a certain option that reliably provided an intermediately preferred food type, and a variable option that could vary in the probability that it provided a highly preferred food type. To examine the impact of ambiguity on ape decision-making, we interspersed trials in which chimpanzees and bonobos had no knowledge about the probabilities. Both species avoided the ambiguous option compared with their choices for a risky option, indicating that ambiguity aversion is shared by humans, bonobos and chimpanzees.

ABSTRACT: We performed 796 dip-stick tests on urine from 100 wild West African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) from 4 habituated groups in the tropical rain forest of Taï National Park, Cote d'Ivoire, to establish reference values for health monitoring. Specific gravity was also measured on 359 urine samples from 62 chimpanzees. The effect of age, sex, group, month, estrus, pregnancy, meat consumption, and acute respiratory disease on pH, leucocytes, protein, blood, hemoglobin, and glucose was examined using ordinal logistic regression. The presence of nitrite, ketones, bilirubin, and urobilinogen in urine was also recorded. Outbreak of acute respiratory disease did not influence any of the urinary parameters. Thirty-seven percent of the samples had a pH <7 and the whole range of pH was found through the year, in all age groups, and in both sexes. Meat consumption lowered the urinary pH. Our results show that all pH levels must be considered normal for the West African chimpanzee subspecies P. troglodytes verus living in the rainforest. We also found a cluster of glucose-positive samples at a specific point in time which was not attributed to diabetes mellitus. These findings highlight that there are differences in normal physiological parameters among wild chimpanzees living in different habitats. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The question of whether animals possess 'cultures' or 'traditions' continues to generate widespread theoretical and empirical interest. Studies of wild chimpanzees have featured prominently in this discussion, as the dominant approach used to identify culture in wild animals was first applied to them. This procedure, the 'method of exclusion,' begins by documenting behavioural differences between groups and then infers the existence of culture by eliminating ecological explanations for their occurrence. The validity of this approach has been questioned because genetic differences between groups have not explicitly been ruled out as a factor contributing to between-group differences in behaviour. Here we investigate this issue directly by analysing genetic and behavioural data from nine groups of wild chimpanzees. We find that the overall levels of genetic and behavioural dissimilarity between groups are highly and statistically significantly correlated. Additional analyses show that only a very small number of behaviours vary between genetically similar groups, and that there is no obvious pattern as to which classes of behaviours (e.g. tool-use versus communicative) have a distribution that matches patterns of betweengroup genetic dissimilarity. These results indicate that genetic dissimilarity cannot be eliminated as playing a major role in generating group differences in chimpanzee behaviour. © 2010 The Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Moral behaviour, based on social norms, is commonly regarded as a hallmark of humans. Hitherto, humans are perceived to be the only species possessing social norms and to engage in moral behaviour. There is anecdotal evidence suggesting their presence in chimpanzees, but systematic studies are lacking. Here, we examine the evolution of human social norms and their underlying psychological mechanisms. For this, we distinguish between conventions, cultural social norms and universal social norms. We aim at exploring whether chimpanzees possess evolutionary precursors of universal social norms seen in humans. Chimpanzees exhibit important preconditions for their presence and enforcement: tolerant societies, well-developed social-cognitive skills and empathetic competence. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for recognizing different functional levels of social norms and distinguish them from mere statistical behavioural regularities. Quasi social norms are found where animals behave functionally moral without having moral emotions. In proto social norms, moral emotions might be present but cannot be collectivized due to the absence of a uniquely human psychological trait, i. e. shared intentionality. Human social norms, whether they are universal or cultural, involve moral emotions and are collectivized. We will discuss behaviours in chimpanzees that represent potential evolutionary precursors of human universal social norms, with special focus on social interactions involving infants. We argue that chimpanzee infants occupy a special status within their communities and propose that tolerance towards them might represent a proto social norm. Finally, we discuss possible ways to test this theoretical framework. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

ABSTRACT: This article specifically examines several aspects of the human-captive chimpanzee bond and the effort to create the first chimpanzee sanctuary in Japan. We discuss our ethical responsibility for captive chimpanzees that have been used in biomedical research. On April 1, 2007, the Chimpanzee Sanctuary Uto (CSU) was established as the first sanctuary for retired laboratory chimpanzees in Japan. This initiative was the result of the continuous efforts by members of Support for African/Asian Great Apes (SAGA), and the Great Ape Information Network to provide a solution to the large chimpanzee colony held in biomedical facilities. However, the cessation of invasive biomedical studies using chimpanzees has created a new set of challenges because Japan lacks registration and laws banning invasive ape experiments and lacks a national policy for the life-long care of retired laboratory chimpanzees. Therefore, CSU has initiated a relocation program in which 79 retired laboratory chimpanzees will be sent to domestic zoos and receive life-long care. By the end of 2009, the number of chimpanzees living at CSU had decreased from 79 to 59 individuals. A nationwide network of care facilities and CSU to provide life-long care of retired laboratory chimpanzees is growing across Japan. This will result in humane treatment of these research animals. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

ABSTRACT: In mammals, bitter taste is mediated by T2R genes, which belong to the large family of seven transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors. Because T2Rs are directly involved in the interaction between mammals and their dietary sources, it is likely that these genes evolved to reflect species' specific diets during mammalian evolution. Here, we investigated the sequences of all 28 putative functional chimpanzee T2R genes (cT2Rs) in 46 western chimpanzees to compare the intraspecies variations in chimpanzees to those already known for all 25 human functional T2R genes (hT2Rs). The numbers of functional genes varied among individuals in western chimpanzees, and most chimpanzees had two or three more functional genes than humans. Similarly to hT2Rs, cT2Rs showed high nucleotide diversity along with a large number of amino acid substitutions. Comparison of the nucleotide substitution patterns in cT2Rs with those in five cT2R pseudogenes and 14 autosomal intergenic noncoding regions among the same individuals revealed that the evolution of cT2R genes was almost identical to that of putative neutral regions with slight but significantly positive Tajima's D values, suggesting that selective constraint on these genes was relaxed with weak balancing selection. These trends have resulted in the occurrence of various divergent alleles of T2Rs within the western chimpanzee populations and in heterozygous individuals who might have the ability to taste a broader range of substances. © 2010 The Author.

ABSTRACT: Stress hormone measurements can reinforce and refine hypotheses about the costs of particular contexts or behaviors in wild animals. For social species, this is complicated because potential stressors may come from the physical environment, social environment, or some combination of both, while the stress response itself is generalized. Here, we present a multivariate examination of urinary cortisol dynamics over 6. years in the lives of wild female chimpanzees in the Kanyawara community of Kibale National Park, Uganda. We hypothesized that chimpanzee socioecology provides strong indications of both energetic and social stress to females, but that the salience of these stressors might vary over a female's life history in accordance with their changing reproductive costs and social interactions. Using linear mixed models, we found that urinary cortisol levels increased significantly with age but were also elevated in young immigrants to the community. Across reproductive states, cycling, non-estrous females had relatively low cortisol compared to lactating, estrous, or pregnant females. Aggression from males led to higher cortisol levels among estrous females, frequent targets of aggressive sexual coercion. In contrast, energetic stress was most salient to lactating females, who experienced higher cortisol during months of low fruit consumption. Low dominance rank was associated with increased cortisol, particularly during the energetically demanding period of lactation. The effects of female conflict were felt widely, even among those who were the primary aggressors, providing further evidence that long-term resource competition, while apparently muted, exerts a far-reaching impact on the lives of chimpanzee females. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Fertility is an important fitness component, but is difficult to measure in slowly reproducing, long-lived animals such as chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). We measured fertility and the effect of measured covariates on fertility in a 43-year sample of birth intervals of chimpanzees from the Gombe National Park, Tanzania using Cox proportional hazards regression with individual-level random effects. The birth hazard declined with mothers' age at a rate of 0.84 per year following age at first reproduction. This value is somewhat stronger than previous estimates. Loss of the infant that opened the birth interval increased the birth hazard 134-fold. Birth intervals following the first complete birth interval were shorter than this first interval, while sex of the previous infant had no significant effect. Maternal dominance rank was significant at the P < 0.1 level when coded as high/middle/low but was highly significant when we simply considered high rank vs. others. Individual heterogeneity had a substantial impact on birth interval duration. We interpret this individual effect as a measure of phenotypic quality, controlling for the measured covariates such as dominance rank. This interpretation is supported by the correlation of individual heterogeneity scores with similar independent measures of body mass. © 2010 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees acquire nut-cracking skills by observation and trial and error. Studies of captive chimpanzees have shown the effectiveness of a skilled demonstrator. We examined the effectiveness of 3 live demonstration forms from which subjects could learn nut-cracking skills: a video of proficient conspecifics, human demonstration and the presence of a skilled conspecific performing the task. A male subject did not learn to crack open nuts after viewing a video of proficient conspecifics but quickly learned the skill following a demonstration by a human facilitator. Subsequently, 4 female chimpanzees were given the opportunity to learn the skill from the now proficient male, as well as from a video and human demonstration, but failed to do so.

ABSTRACT: Background: Data on the evolution of natural SIV infection in chimpanzees (SIVcpz) and on the impact of SIV on local ape populations are only available for Eastern African chimpanzee subspecies (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii), and no data exist for Central chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes), the natural reservoir of the ancestors of HIV-1 in humans. Here, we report a case of naturally-acquired SIVcpz infection in a P.t.troglodytes chimpanzee with clinical and biological data and analysis of viral evolution over the course of infection.Results: A male chimpanzee (Cam155), 1.5 years, was seized in southern Cameroon in November 2003 and screened SIV positive during quarantine. Clinical follow-up and biological analyses have been performed for 7 years and showed a significant decline of CD4 counts (1,380 cells/mm3 in 2004 vs 287 in 2009), a severe thrombocytopenia (130,000 cells/mm3 in 2004 vs 5,000 cells/mm3 in 2009), a weight loss of 21.8% from August 2009 to January 2010 (16 to 12.5 kg) and frequent periods of infections with diverse pathogens.DNA from PBMC, leftover from clinical follow-up samples collected in 2004 and 2009, was used to amplify overlapping fragments and sequence two full-length SIVcpzPtt-Cam155 genomes. SIVcpzPtt-Cam155 was phylogenetically related to other SIVcpzPtt from Cameroon (SIVcpzPtt-Cam13) and Gabon (SIVcpzPtt-Gab1). Ten molecular clones 5 years apart, spanning the V1V4 gp120 env region (1,100 bp), were obtained. Analyses of the env region showed positive selection (dN-dS >0), intra-host length variation and extensive amino acid diversity between clones, greater in 2009. Over 5 years, N-glycosylation site frequency significantly increased (p < 0.0001).Conclusions: Here, we describe for the first time the clinical history and viral evolution of a naturally SIV infected P.t.troglodytes chimpanzee. The findings show an increasing viral diversity over time and suggest clinical progression to an AIDS-like disease, showing that SIVcpz can be pathogenic in its host, as previously described in P.t.schweinfurthii. Although studying the impact of SIV infection in wild apes is difficult, efforts should be made to better characterize the pathogenicity of the ancestors of HIV-1 in their natural host and to find out whether SIV infection also plays a role in ape population decline. © 2011 Etienne et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Extensive research on human subjects has tried to investigate whether there is a correlation between cognitive performance and the menstrual cycle. Less is known about the relationship between the menstrual cycle and task performance in other cognitive animals. We test whether the secretion of a sex hormone [luteinizing hormone(LH)] influences the performance of cognitive tasks by a female chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) who is part of a long-term cognition research program. We focus on two cognitive tasks: an "easy task," which consists of simple numerical ordering, and a "difficult task," which combines numerical ordering with memorizing the numerals' spatial location. Data on the performance of these cognitive tasks, urine samples, and sexual swelling over six menstrual cycles showed that the chimpanzee's performance accuracy decreased and that the intertrial interval was longer during the LH-surge of the menstrual cycle, but only for the performance of the difficult task. These performance attributes seem to reflect a decrease in attention or motivation during ovulation. In summary, the cognitive performance of a chimpanzee was disturbed by hormonal changes despite her long-term experience in the tasks. © 2011 American Psychological Association.

ABSTRACT: Focal sampling is the most accurate method for measuring primate activity budgets but is sometimes impractical. An alternative is scan sampling, in which the behaviour of the group is recorded at regular intervals. The simplest technique is to record whether at least 1 animal is engaged in the behaviour of interest. By direct comparison with focal data collected simultaneously on the same population, we assess the validity of this simple group level sampling method for studying chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) feeding behaviour. In a 13-month study at Kanyawara, Kibale National Park, Uganda, group level scan sampling provided statistically similar measures of broad diet composition to those produced by focal data, despite considerable seasonal variation. Monthly means of the percentage of time spent consuming non-fig fruit calculated from group level scan sampling were highly correlated with those from focal sampling. This validates previous methodology used to identify periods of high energy availability. However, group level scans tended to overestimate the percentage of observation time spent feeding, particularly for adult males. We conclude that this method of group level scan sampling provides valuable data for characterizing broad diet choice in chimpanzees and other species, but may be of limited use for estimating individual feeding time.

ABSTRACT: Background: A 24-year-old, male chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) developed acute tetraparesis. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a diffuse T2-weighted hyperintensive lesion, indicating inflammation at the C1-2 level. All infective, autoimmune, and vascular investigations were unremarkable. Results and Conclusions: The chimpanzee's condition most resembled acute transverse myelitis (ATM) in humans. The chimpanzee was in severe incapacitated neurological condition with bedridden status and required 24-hour attention for 2 months followed by special care for over a year. Initially, corticosteroid therapy was performed, and his neurological symptoms improved to some extent; however, the general condition of the chimpanzee deteriorated in the first 6 months after onset. Pressure ulcers had developed at various areas on the animal's body, as the bedridden status was protracted. Supportive therapy was continued, and the general condition, appetite, mobility, and pressure ulcers have slowly but synergistically recovered over the course of 2 years. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

ABSTRACT: Previous research has suggested that chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) display higher levels of aggression in captivity than in the wild. One of the challenges of captive management, therefore, is to balance the chimpanzees' need for social interaction with managements' desire to minimize wounding and aggression. Various captive studies have examined the effects of individual and social variables on the frequency of wounding aggression, but none have examined these variables simultaneously. We collected retrospective wounding data for severe wounds from 83 captive chimpanzees (36 males, 47 females) from January 1993 to December 2003. The context of the wounding event, including individual age and sex, group age and sex composition, group duration, and portion of the week (weekday vs. weekend) were collected. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine which variables had a significant effect on the probability of a severe wounding event. The sex and age composition of the group, group duration, and portion of the week had a statistically significant association with wounding. Allmale groups (Odds Ratio (OR)56.738) had the highest risk of wounding aggression, with uni-male groups (OR53.311) having the next largest. Compared to individuals in all sub-adult groups, individuals in either all-adult (OR54.516) or mixed-age (OR53.587) groups had a higher risk of wounding. There was an inverse association between group duration and wounding (OR50.821). Finally, there was an increased risk of wounding during the work week (OR51.653). These results suggest that captive management should pay close attention to group composition, as well as levels of human activity, when devising strategies to reduce captive chimpanzee aggression. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

ABSTRACT: All primates can recognize faces and do so by analyzing the subtle variation that exists between faces. Through a series of three experiments, we attempted to clarify the nature of second-order information processing in nonhuman primates. Experiment one showed that both chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) tolerate geometric distortions along the vertical axis, suggesting that information about absolute position of features does not contribute to accurate face recognition. Chimpanzees differed from monkeys, however, in that they were more sensitive to distortions along the horizontal axis, suggesting that when building a global representation of facial identity, horizontal relations between features are more diagnostic of identity than vertical relations. Two further experiments were performed to determine whether the monkeys were simply less sensitive to horizontal relations compared to chimpanzees or were instead relying on local features. The results of these experiments confirm that monkeys can utilize a holistic strategy when discriminating between faces regardless of familiarity. In contrast, our data show that chimpanzees, like humans, use a combination of holistic and local features when the faces are unfamiliar, but primarily holistic information when the faces become familiar. We argue that our comparative approach to the study of face recognition reveals the impact that individual experience and social organization has on visual cognition. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: Nine male chimpanzees originally reared in solitary cages were set up to form a group. Plasma viral load of the lymphocryptovirus (LCV) of chimpanzee [Epstein-Barr virus chimpanzee (EBVcmp)] was measured by real-time PCR. In the group formation (Form) period, the firstranking male showed an imminent increase in plasma EBVcmp load compared with 1 week before (pre-Form) and 3 months after (post-Form) group formation. Other upper-ranking males such as the second-, third- and fourth-male also showed the highest level of viral load in the Form period. The kinetics of EBVcmp load in the Form period were statistically different from other periods (against pre-Form, t=-4.878, P<0.001; against post-Form, t=6.434, P<0.001). The effect of the male dominance rank did not differ between the pre-Form and post-Form periods (t=-1.557, P=0.12). Reactivation of LCV (EBV) as an immunological stress marker for humans might also be applied to chimpanzees. © 2010 SGM.

ABSTRACT: The relationships between captive primates and their caregivers are critical ones and can affect animal welfare. This study tested the effect of caregivers using chimpanzee behaviors or not, in daily interactions with captive chimpanzees. In the Chimpanzee Behavior (CB) condition the caregiver presented chimpanzee behaviors. In the Human Behavior (HB) condition the caregiver avoided using chimpanzee behaviors. The chimpanzees had individual patterns of response and had significant differences in their responses to each condition. These data are compared to a similar study conducted at Te Zoo Northwest Florida (ZNWF). Both groups of chimpanzees were sensitive and responsive to the differences in conditions. Tese data suggest ways to improve animal welfare. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees and humans are genetically very similar, with the striking exception of their Y chromosomes, which have diverged tremendously. The male-specific region (MSY), representing the greater part of the Y chromosome, is inherited from father to son in a clonal fashion, with natural selection acting on the MSY as a unit. Positive selection might involve the performance of the MSY in spermatogenesis. Chimpanzees have a highly polygamous mating behavior, so that sperm competition is thought to provide a strong selective force acting on the Y chromosome in the chimpanzee lineage. In consequence of evolution of the heterologous sex chromosomes in mammals, meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) results in a transcriptionally silenced XY body in male meiotic prophase, and subsequently also in postmeiotic repression of the sex chromosomes in haploid spermatids. This has evolved to a situation where MSCI has become a prerequisite for spermatogenesis. Here, by analysis of microarray testicular expression data representing a small number of male chimpanzees and men, we obtained information indicating that meiotic and postmeiotic X chromosome silencing might be more effective in chimpanzee than in human spermatogenesis. From this, we suggest that the remarkable reorganization of the chimpanzee Y chromosome, compared to the human Y chromosome, might have an impact on its meiotic interactions with the X chromosome and thereby on X chromosome silencing in spermatogenesis. Further studies will be required to address comparative functional aspects of MSCI in chimpanzee, human, and other placental mammals. © 2010 Mulugeta Achame et al.

ABSTRACT: The complete nucleotide sequences of three chimpanzee polyomavirus genetic variants were determined. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the viruses form two different genotypes of ChPyV. Comparison with other primate polyomaviruses revealed a putative agnogene, and an unusually long VP1 open reading frame. The transcriptional control regions (TCR) of the viruses were extremely short (155 nucleotides), and highly conserved amongst the genotypes. Analysis of the TCR from different chimpanzee subspecies, and from a series of tissues from five individuals confirmed its genetic stability, and also indicates that double-infections with different genotypes can occur. © 2010 Deuzing et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Humans follow the example of prestigious, high-status individuals much more readily than that of others, such as when we copy the behavior of village elders, community leaders, or celebrities. This tendency has been declared uniquely human, yet remains untested in other species. Experimental studies of animal learning have typically focused on the learning mechanism rather than on social issues, such as who learns from whom. The latter, however, is essential to understanding how habits spread. Here we report that when given opportunities to watch alternative solutions to a foraging problem performed by two different models of their own species, chimpanzees preferentially copy the method shown by the older, higher-ranking individual with a prior track-record of success. Since both solutions were equally difficult, shown an equal number of times by each model and resulted in equal rewards, we interpret this outcome as evidence that the preferred model in each of the two groups tested enjoyed a significant degree of prestige in terms of whose example other chimpanzees chose to follow. Such prestige-based cultural transmission is a phenomenon shared with our own species. If similar biases operate in wild animal populations, the adoption of culturally transmitted innovations may be significantly shaped by the characteristics of performers. © 2010 Horner et al.

ABSTRACT: Understanding the relationship between physical environments and nonhuman primate behavior is a key element for effective care and management in a range of settings. The physical features of the captive environment, including not only gross useable space but also environmental complexity, can have a significant influence on primate behavior and ultimately, animal welfare. But despite this connection, there remains relatively little conclusive data on how captive primates, especially great apes, use the spaces provided to them, especially in modern, indoor-outdoor enclosures that have become more prevalent in recent years. In this study, we used four years of detailed data on where 23 great apes (chimpanzees and gorillas) positioned themselves within a modern, indoor-outdoor zoo enclosure to determine not only how the apes utilized their space but also how access to outdoor areas affected their spatial selectivity. We found that both species used relatively little of their available space: chimpanzees and gorillas spent half their time in only 3.2 and 1.5% of their useable three- dimensional space, respectively. Chimpanzees utilized the outdoor space more than gorillas, but access to the outdoors did not affect space selectivity in the indoor area for either species. Although both species of ape were highly selective in their space use, consideration should be given to the importance of providing the choice to locate in a variety of spaces, including outdoor areas. These data represent an extremely detailed account of space selectivity by great apes in an indoor-outdoor environment and have substantial implications for future facility design and captive primate management. © 2010 Wiley- Liss, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Henrich et al. convincingly caution against the overgeneralization of findings from particular human populations, but fail to apply their own compelling reasoning to our nearest living relatives, the great apes. Here we argue that rearing history is every bit as important for understanding cognition in other species as it is in humans. Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2010.

ABSTRACT: Cardiovascular disease in general, and cardiac arrhythmias specifically, is common in great apes. However, the clinical significance of arrhythmias detected on short-duration electrocardiograms is often unclear. Here we describe the use of an implantable loop recorder to evaluate cardiac rhythms in 4 unanesthetized adult chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), 1 with a history of possible syncope and 3 with the diagnosis of multiform ventricular ectopy (ventricular premature complexes) and cardiomyopathy. The clinical significance of ventricular ectopy was defined further by using the implantable loop recorder. Arrhythmia was ruled out as a cause of collapse in the chimpanzee that presented with possible syncope because the implantable loop recorder demonstrated normal sinus rhythm during a so-called syncopal event. This description is the first report of the use of an implantable loop recorder to diagnose cardiac arrhythmias in an unanesthetized great ape species.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzee polyomavirus (ChPyV) was originally detected in the faeces of a captive chimpanzee by random screening using broad-spectrum PCR. Its pathogenicity and the distribution among chimpanzees are unknown so far. Here, the major capsid protein VP1 of ChPyV was expressed in yeast cells. Virus-like particles (VLPs) with a diameter of approximately 45. nm were demonstrated although the efficiency of VLP formation was low as compared to monkey polyomavirus SV40-VLPs. The ChPyV-VLP preparation did not agglutinate human erythrocytes. Low cross-reactions between ChPyV- and SV40-VLP-specific sera were detected by immunoblotting, but not by ELISA. Testing of 163 sera derived from captive and wild-caught healthy chimpanzees using an ELISA based on the ChPyV-VLPs resulted in 11.7% positive results, ranging from 0% to 56% in different groups. The VLPs may be used in future to assess the distribution of ChPyV infections among other animal species and humans. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The recent publication of the draft genome sequences of the Neanderthal and a ∼50,000-year-old archaic hominin from Denisova Cave in southern Siberia has ushered in a new age in molecular archaeology. We previously cross-compared the human, chimpanzee and Neanderthal genome sequences with respect to a set of disease-causing/disease-associated missense and regulatory mutations (Human Gene Mutation Database) and succeeded in identifying genetic variants which, although apparently pathogenic in humans, may represent a 'compensated' wild-type state in at least one of the other two species. Here, in an attempt to identify further 'potentially compensated mutations' (PCMs) of interest, we have compared our dataset of disease-causing/disease-associated mutations with their corresponding nucleotide positions in the Denisovan hominin, Neanderthal and chimpanzee genomes. Of the 15 human putatively disease-causing mutations that were found to be compensated in chimpanzee, Denisovan or Neanderthal, only a solitary F5 variant (Val1736Met) was specific to the Denisovan. In humans, this missense mutation is associated with activated protein C resistance and an increased risk of thromboembolism and recurrent miscarriage. It is unclear at this juncture whether this variant was indeed a PCM in the Denisovan or whether it could instead have been associated with disease in this ancient hominin. © HENRY STEWART PUBLICATIONS.

ABSTRACT: Claims of culture in chimpanzees appeared soon after the launch of the first field studies in Africa. 1 The notion of chimpanzee 'material cultures' was coined, 2 and this was followed by a first formal comparison, which revealed an astonishing degree of behavioral diversity between the different study communities, mainly in terms of tool use. 3 Although this behavioral diversity is still undisputed, the question of chimpanzee cultures has remained controversial. 4-6 The debate has less to do with the definition of culture (most animal behavior researchers accept the notion for behavior that is 'transmitted repeatedly through social or observational learning to become a population-level characteristic' 3), but more with whether some key criteria are met. © 2010 Landes Bioscience.

ABSTRACT: Savanna chimpanzees are known to re-use areas of the landscape for sleep, and patterns of chimpanzee sleeping site re-use are proposed as a referential model for early hominin archaeological site formation. We recorded the prevalence of deformed but healed branches and remnants of dead branches found around fresh nests at the savanna site of Issa in Ugalla, Tanzania. These old nest scars were found in 79% of 112 beds. We also randomly selected potential nesting locations for a subset of 32 beds within the same trees, and found nest scars in only 19% of these " control" locations. We then monitored 275 nests for up to 19 months for decay, regeneration of new branches, and re-use. Of these 275 nest locations, 24% were re-used within the first nine months of monitoring, and most re-use occurred when the nest had already decayed and was not easily visible from the ground. After 18 months, the proportion of specific nest positions re-used increased to 48%. This fidelity is likely a result of the creation of ideally-shaped support structures and supple new growth for mattress material with successive use of nest locations. We propose that specific nest site re-use may not be a direct product of environmental determination, but a result of " niche construction" through formation of good building sites within trees. Environmental modification through construction behaviour may have influenced both chimpanzee and early hominin ranging, and thus leaves behind recognisable patterns of artefact deposition across the landscape. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The forests surrounding Bossou, Guinea, are home to a small, semi-isolated chimpanzee community studied for over three decades [1]. In 1992, Matsuzawa [2] reported the death of a 2.5-year-old chimpanzee (Jokro) at Bossou from a respiratory illness. The infant's mother (Jire) carried the corpse, mummified in the weeks following death, for at least 27 days. She exhibited extensive care of the body, grooming it regularly, sharing her day- and night-nests with it, and showing distress whenever they became separated. The carrying of infants' corpses has been reported from a number of primate species, both in captivity and the wild [3-7] - albeit usually lasting a few days only - suggesting a phylogenetic continuity for a behavior that is poignant testament to the close mother-infant bond which extends across different primate taxa. In this report we recount two further infant deaths at Bossou, observed over a decade after the original episode but with striking similarities. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Patr-AL is an expressed, non-polymorphic MHC class I gene carried by ∼50% of chimpanzee MHC haplotypes. Comparing Patr-AL+ and Patr-AL- haplotypes showed Patr-AL defines a unique 125-kb genomic block flanked by blocks containing classical Patr-A and pseudogene Patr-H. Orthologous to Patr-AL are polymorphic orangutan Popy-A and the 5′ part of human pseudogene HLA-Y, carried by ∼10% of HLA haplotypes. Thus, the AL gene alternatively evolved in these closely related species to become classical, nonclassical, and nonfunctional. Although differing by 30 aa substitutions in the peptide-binding α1 and α2 domains, Patr-AL and HLA-A*0201 bind overlapping repertoires of peptides; the overlap being comparable with that between the A*0201 and A*0207 subtypes differing by one substitution. Patr-AL thus has the A02 supertypic peptide-binding specificity. Patr-AL and HLA-A*0201 have similar three-dimensional structures, binding peptides in similar conformation. Although comparable in size and shape, the B and F specificity pockets of Patr-AL and HLA-A*0201 differ in both their constituent residues and contacts with peptide anchors. Uniquely shared by Patr-AL, HLA-A*0201, and other members of the A02 supertype are the absence of serine at position 9 in the B pocket and the presence of tyrosine at position 116 in the F pocket. Distinguishing Patr-AL from HLA-A*02 is an unusually electropositive upper face on the α2 helix. Stimulating PBMCs from Patr-AL- chimpanzees with B cells expressing Patr-AL produced potent alloreactive CD8 T cells with specificity for Patr-AL and no cross-reactivity toward other MHC class I molecules, including HLA-A*02. In contrast, PBMCs from Patr-AL+ chimpanzees are tolerant of Patr-AL. Copyright © 2011 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Previous studies have shown that a variety of animals including humans are sensitive to social cues from others and shift their attention to the same objects attended to by others. However, little is known about how animals process conspe-cifics' and another species' actions, although primates recognize conspecific faces better than those of another species. In this study, using unrestrained eye-tracking techniques, we first demonstrated that conspecific social cues modulated looking behaviours of chimPanzees more than human cues, whereas human observers were equally sensitive to both species. Additionally, first pass gaze duration at the face indicates that chimPanzees looked at the chimPanzees' face longer than the human face, suggesting that chimPanzees might extract more referential information from a conspecific face. These results also imply that a unique ability for extracting referential information from a variety of social objects has emerged during human evolution. © 2010 The Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Functional imaging studies in humans have localized the motor-hand region to a neuroanatomical landmark call the KNOB within the precentral gyrus. It has also been reported that the KNOB is larger in the hemisphere contralateral to an individual's preferred hand, and therefore may represent the neural substrate for handedness. The KNOB has also been neuronatomically described in chimpanzees and other great apes and is similarly associated with handedness. However, whether the chimpanzee KNOB represents the hand region is unclear from the extant literature. Here, we used PET to quantify neural metabolic activity in chimpanzees when engaged in unilateral reach-and-grasping responses and found significantly lateralized activation of the KNOB region in the hemisphere contralateral to the hand used by the chimpanzees. We subsequently constructed a probabilistic map of the KNOB region in chimpanzees in order to assess the overlap in consistency in the anatomical landmarks of the KNOB with the functional maps generated from the PET analysis. We found significant overlap in the anatomical and functional voxels comprising the KNOB region, suggesting that the KNOB does correspond to the hand region in chimpanzees. Lastly, from the probabilistic maps, we compared right- and left-handed chimpanzees on lateralization in grey and white matter within the KNOB region and found that asymmetries in white matter of the KNOB region were larger in the hemisphere contralateral to the preferred hand. These results suggest that neuroanatomical asymmetries in the KNOB likely reflect changes in connectivity in primary motor cortex that are experience dependent in chimpanzees and possibly humans. © 2010 Hopkins et al.

ABSTRACT: Tooth crown morphology is of primary importance in fossil primate systematics and understanding the developmental basis of its variation facilitates phenotypic analyses of fossil teeth. Lower molars of species in the chimp/human clade (including fossil hominins) possess between four and seven cusps and this variability has been implicated in alpha taxonomy and phylogenetic systematics. What is known about the developmental basis of variation in cusp number - based primarily on experimental studies of rodent molars - suggests that cusps form under a morphodynamic, patterning cascade model involving the iterative formation of enamel knots. In this study we test whether variation in cusp 6 (C6) presence in common chimpanzee and bonobo lower molars (n = 55) is consistent with predictions derived from the patterning cascade model. Using microcomputed tomography we imaged the enamel-dentine junction of lower molars and used geometric morphometrics to examine shape variation in the molar crown correlated with variation in C6 presence (in particular the size and spacing of the dentine horns). Results indicate that C6 presence is consistent with predictions of a patterning cascade model, with larger molars exhibiting a higher frequency of C6 and with the location and size of later-forming cusps correlated with C6 variation. These results demonstrate that a patterning cascade model is appropriate for interpreting cusp variation in Pan and have implications for cusp nomenclature and the use of accessory cusp morphology in primate systematics. © 2010 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Infections with human parvoviruses B19 and recently discovered human bocaviruses (HBoVs) are widespread, while PARV4 infections are transmitted parenterally and prevalent specifically in injecting drug users and hemophiliacs. To investigate the exposure and circulation of parvoviruses related to B19 virus, PARV4, and HBoV in nonhuman primates, plasma samples collected from 73 Cameroonian wild-caught chimpanzees and gorillas and 91 Old World monkey (OWM) species were screened for antibodies to recombinant B19 virus, PARV4, and HBoV VP2 antigens by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Moderate to high frequencies of seroreactivity to PARV4 (63% and 18% in chimpanzees and gorillas, respectively), HBoV (73% and 36%), and B19 virus (8% and 27%) were recorded for apes, while OWMs were uniformly negative (for PARV4 and B19 virus) or infrequently reactive (3% for HBoV). For genetic characterization, plasma samples and 54 fecal samples from chimpanzees and gorillas collected from Cameroonian forest floors were screened by PCR with primers conserved within Erythrovirus, Bocavirus, and PARV4 genera. Two plasma samples (chimpanzee and baboon) were positive for PARV4, while four fecal samples were positive for HBoV-like viruses. The chimpanzee PARV4 variant showed 18% and 15% nucleotide sequence divergence in NS and VP1/2, respectively, from human variants (9% and 7% amino acid, respectively), while the baboon variant was substantially more divergent, mirroring host phylogeny. Ape HBoV variants showed complex sequence relationships with human viruses, comprising separate divergent homologues of HBoV1 and the recombinant HBoV3 species in chimpanzees and a novel recombinant species in gorillas. This study provides the first evidence for widespread circulation of parvoviruses in primates and enables future investigations of their epidemiology, host specificity, and (co)evolutionary histories.

ABSTRACT: Modelling the behaviour of extinct hominins is essential in order to devise useful hypotheses of our species' evolutionary origins for testing in the palaeontological and archaeological records. One approach is to model the last common ancestor (LCA) of living apes and humans, based on current ethological and ecological knowledge of our closest living relations. Such referential modelling is based on rigorous, ongoing field studies of the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and the bonobo (Pan paniscus). This paper reviews recent findings from nature, focusing on those with direct implications for hominin evolution, e.g. apes, using elementary technology to access basic resources such as food and water, or sheltering in caves or bathing as thermoregulatory adaptations. I give preference to studies that directly address key issues, such as whether stone artefacts are detectible before the Oldowan, based on the percussive technology of hammer and anvil use by living apes. Detailed comparative studies of chimpanzees living in varied habitats, from rainforest to savannah, reveal that some behavioural patterns are universal (e.g. shelter construction), while others show marked (e.g. extractive foraging) or nuanced (e.g. courtship) cross-populational variation. These findings allow us to distinguish between retained, primitive traits of the LCA versus derived ones in the human lineage.

ABSTRACT: The exponential decline of great apes over the past 50 years has resulted in an urgent need for data to inform population viability assessment and conservation strategies. Health monitoring of remaining ape populations is an important component of this process. In support of this effort, we examined endoparasitic and commensal prevalence and richness as proxies of population health for western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) and sympatric guinea baboons (Papio hamadryas papio) at Fongoli, Senegal, a site dominated by woodland-savanna at the northwestern extent of chimpanzees' geographic range. The small population size and extreme environmental pressures experienced by Fongoli chimpanzees make them particularly sensitive to the potential impact of pathogens. One hundred thirty-two chimpanzee and seventeen baboon fecal samples were processed using sodium nitrate floatation and fecal sedimentation to isolate helminth eggs, larvae, and protozoal cysts. Six nematodes (Physaloptera sp., Ascaris sp., Stronglyloides fuelleborni, Trichuris sp., an unidentified hookworm, and an unidentified larvated nematode), one cestode (Bertiella sp.), and five protozoans (Iodamoeba buetschlii, Entamoeba coli, Troglodytella abrassarti, Troglocorys cava, and an unidentified ciliate) were detected in chimpanzee fecal samples. Four nematodes (Necator sp., S. fuelleborni, Trichuris sp., and an unidentified hookworm sp.), two trematodes (Shistosoma mansoni and an unidentified fluke), and six protozoans (Entamoeba histolytica/dispar, E. coli, Chilomastix mesnili, Balantidium coli, T. abrassarti, and T. cava) were detected in baboon fecal samples. The low prevalence of pathogenic parasite species and high prevalence of symbiotic protozoa in Fongoli chimpanzees are indicative of good overall population health. However, the high prevalence of pathogenic parasites in baboons, who may serve as transport hosts, highlight the need for ongoing pathogen surveillance of the Fongoli chimpanzee population and point to the need for further research into the epidemiology and cross-species transmission ecology of zoonotic pathogens at this site. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) sometimes help both humans and conspecifics in experimental situations in which immediate selfish benefits can be ruled out. However, in several experiments, chimpanzees have not provided food to a conspecific even when it would cost them nothing, leading to the hypothesis that prosociality in the food-provisioning context is a derived trait in humans. Here, we show that chimpanzees help conspecifics obtain both food and non-food items-given that the donor cannot get the food herself. Furthermore, we show that the key factor eliciting chimpanzees' targeted helping is the recipients' attempts to either get the food or get the attention of the potential donor. The current findings add to the accumulating body of evidence that humans and chimpanzees share the motivation and skills necessary to help others in situations in which they cannot selfishly benefit. Humans, however, show prosocial motives more readily and in a wider range of contexts. © 2010 The Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Snare injuries to chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) have been reported at many study sites across Africa, and in some cases cause the death of the ensnared animal. However, very few snare injuries have been reported concerning the chimpanzees of Bossou, Guinea. The rarity of snare injuries in this study group warrants further consideration, given the exceptionally close proximity of the Bossou chimpanzees to human settlements and the widespread practice of snare hunting in the area. Herein we report a total of six observations of chimpanzees attempting to break and deactivate snares, successfully doing so on two of these occasions. We observed the behavior in 5 males, ranging in age from juveniles to adults. We argue that such active responses to snares must be contributing to the rarity of injuries in this group. Based on our observations, we suggest that the behavior has transmitted down the group. Our research team at Bossou continues to remove snares from the forest, but the threat of ensnarement still remains. We discuss potential ways to achieve a good balance between human subsistence activities and the conservation of chimpanzees at Bossou, which will increasingly be an area of great concern in the future. © 2010 Japan Monkey Centre and Springer.

ABSTRACT: Due to an almost complete absence of fossil record, the evolutionary history of chimpanzees has only been studied recently on the basis of genetic data. Although the general topology of the chimpanzee phylogeny is well established, uncertainties remain concerning the size of current and past populations, the occurrence of bottlenecks or population expansions, or about divergence times and migrations rates between subspecies. Here, we present a novel attempt at globally inferring the detailed evolution of the Pan genus based on approximate Bayesian computation, an approach preferentially applied to complex models where the likelihood cannot be computed analytically. Based on two microsatellite and DNA sequence data sets and adjusting simulated data for local levels of inbreeding and patterns of missing data, we find support for several new features of chimpanzee evolution as compared with previous studies based on smaller data sets and simpler evolutionary models. We find that the central chimpanzees are certainly the oldest population of all P. troglodytes subspecies and that the other two P. t. subspecies diverged from the central chimpanzees by founder events. We also find an older divergence time (1.6 million years [My]) between common chimpanzee and Bonobos than previous studies (0.9-1.3 My), but this divergence appears to have been very progressive with the maintenance of relatively high levels of gene flow between the ancestral chimpanzee population and the Bonobos. Finally, we could also confirm the existence of strong unidirectional gene flow from the western into the central chimpanzee. These results show that interesting and innovative features of chimpanzee history emerge when considering their whole evolutionary history in a single analysis, rather than relying on simpler models involving several comparisons of pairs of populations. © The Author 2010.

ABSTRACT: HIV-1 infection in humans results in an early and progressive NK cell dysfunction and an accumulation of an "anergic" CD56- CD16+ NK subset, which is characterised by low natural cytotoxicity receptor expression and low cytokine producing capacity. In contrast to humans, chimpanzee NK cells do not display a distinguishable CD56bright and CD56dim subset but, as shown here, could be subdivided into functionally different CD8+ and CD8- subsets. The CD8 + NK cells expressed significantly higher levels of triggering receptors including NKp46 and, upon in vitro activation, produced more IFN-γ, TNF-α and CD107 than their CD8- counterparts. In addition, chimpanzee CD8- NK cells had relatively high levels of HLA-DR expression, suggestive of an activated state. Killing inhibitory receptors were expressed only at low levels; however, upon in vitro stimulation, they were up-regulated in CD8+ but not in CD8- NK cells and were functionally capable of inhibiting NKp30-triggered killing. In contrast to HIV-1-infected humans, infected chimpanzees maintained their dominant CD8+ NK cell population, with high expression of natural cytotoxicity receptors. © 2010 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

ABSTRACT: Investigations into the evolutionary history of the common chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes, have produced inconsistent results due to differences in the types of molecular data considered, the model assumptions employed, and the quantity and geographical range of samples used. We amplified and sequenced 24 complete P. troglodytes mitochondrial genomes from fecal samples collected at multiple study sites throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Using a "relaxed molecular clock," fossil calibrations, and 12 additional complete primate mitochondrial genomes, we analyzed the pattern and timing of primate diversification in a Bayesian framework. Our results support the recognition of four chimpanzee subspecies. Within P. troglodytes, we report a mean (95% highest posterior density [HPD]) time since most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 1.026 (0.811-1.263) Ma for the four proposed subspecies, with two major lineages. One of these lineages (tMRCA = 0.510 [0.387-0.650] Ma) contains P. t. verus (tMRCA = 0.155 [0.101-0.213] Ma) and P. t. ellioti (formerly P. t. vellerosus; tMRCA = 0.157 [0.102-0.215] Ma), both of which are monophyletic. The other major lineage contains P. t. schweinfurthii (tMRCA = 0.111 [0.077-0.146] Ma), a monophyletic clade nested within the P. t. troglodytes lineage (tMRCA = 0.380 [0.296-0.476] Ma). We utilized two analysis techniques that may be of widespread interest. First, we implemented a Yule speciation prior across the entire primate tree with separate coalescent priors on each of the chimpanzee subspecies. The validity of this approach was confirmed by estimates based on more traditional techniques. We also suggest that accurate tMRCA estimates from large computationally difficult sequence alignments may be obtained by implementing our novel method of bootstrapping smaller randomly subsampled alignments. © 2010 The Author.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, are the most sophisticated tool-users among all nonhuman primates. From an evolutionary perspective, it is therefore puzzling that the tool use behaviour of their closest living primate relative, the bonobo, Pan paniscus, has been described as particularly poor. However, only a small number of bonobo groups have been studied in the wild and only over comparably short periods. Here, we show that captive bonobos and chimpanzees are equally diverse tool-users in most contexts. Our observations illustrate that tool use in bonobos can be highly complex and no different from what has been described for chimpanzees. The only major difference in the chimpanzee and bonobo data was that bonobos of all age-sex classes used tools in a play context, a possible manifestation of their neotenous nature. We also found that female bonobos displayed a larger range of tool use behaviours than males, a pattern previously described for chimpanzees but not for other great apes. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the female-biased tool use evolved prior to the split between bonobos and chimpanzees. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: Background: Leptin is a hormone secreted primarily by adipocytes, a lipostatic signal to the hypothalamus, and is often correlated with adiposity. Associations between leptin, age, and development are unknown in human's closest evolutionary relative, the common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes). Methods: Serum leptin was assessed cross sectionally in association with age, weight, and sex in healthy captive chimpanzee males (n = 47) and females (n = 49) to test hypotheses related to predicted differences in leptin levels with body mass, development, and sexual dimorphism. Results: Leptin increased with age and weight among females, but not in males. Leptin was overall higher in females compared to males. Conclusions: Sex differences in leptin were most evident during adolescence and adulthood, despite similar increases in weight in both sexes indicating that sexual maturation is a key divergence point for differential somatic investment in adiposity and leptin levels between male and female chimpanzees. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

ABSTRACT: The brain activity of a fully awake chimpanzee being presented with her name was investigated. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were measured for each of the following auditory stimuli: the vocal sound of the subject's own name (SON), the vocal sound of a familiar name of another group member, the vocal sound of an unfamiliar name and a non-vocal sound. Some differences in ERP waveforms were detected between kinds of stimuli at latencies at which P3 and Nc components are typically observed in humans. Following stimulus onset, an Nc-like negative shift at approximately 500 ms latency was observed, particularly in response to SON. Such specific ERP patterns suggest that the chimpanzee processes her name differently from other sounds. © 2009 The Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Entodiniomorphid ciliates occur in the hindgut of both captive and wild African great apes. These ciliates do not form cysts, and therefore they are more susceptible for degradation. This present study focused on the survival, quantification, and decomposition processes of Troglodytella abrassarti trophozoites in the feces of captive chimpanzees. Fecal samples were examined using wet mounts and the merthiolate-iodine-formaldehyde concentration method, and the number of ciliates was expressed as ciliates per gram, which did not differ when examined from three different samples of the same feces. Trophozoites of T. abrassarti survived 5-15 hr after defecation at 25°C under aerobic conditions. Decomposition of trophozoites began immediately after defecation; however, most of the trophozoites had a compact shape and visible cilia. Trophozoites, although without cilia, can be detected in the feces 55-65 hr after defecation, although most of the trophozoites were fragmented. The total number of ciliates in the sample started to decrease 35-55 hr after defecation. The absence of entodiniomorphid ciliates in fecal samples could not be caused by delayed feces fixation; instead, the absence was due to low sensitivity of coproscopic techniques. However, because of quick morphologic changes of trophozoites, accurate identification of ciliates in older samples may be difficult or even impossible. © 2011 American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees are humanity's closest living relations and are of enduring interest to a range of sciences, from anthropology to zoology. In the West, many know of the pioneering work of Jane Goodall, whose studies of these apes at Gombe in Tanzania are justly famous. Less well-known, but equally important, are the studies carried out by Toshisada Nishida on the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika. Comparison between the two sites yields both notable similarities and startling contrasts. Nishida has written a comprehensive synthesis of his work on the behavior and ecology of the chimpanzees of the Mahale Mountains. With topics ranging from individual development to population-specific behavioral patterns, it reveals the complexity of social life, from male struggles for dominant status to female travails in raising offspring. Richly illustrated, the author blends anecdotes with powerful data to explore the fascinating world of the chimpanzees of the lakeshore. © The Estate of Toshisada Nishida 2012.

ABSTRACT: In the first paper to present formal theory explaining that senescence is a consequence of natural selection, W. D. Hamilton concluded that human postmenopausal longevity results from the contributions of ancestral grandmothers to the reproduction of their relatives. A grandmother hypothesis, subsequently elaborated with additional lines of evidence, helps explain both exceptional longevity and additional features of life history that distinguish humans from the other great apes. However, some of the variation observed in aging rates seems inconsistent with the tradeoffs between current and future reproduction identified by theory. In humans and chimpanzees, our nearest living relatives, individuals who bear offspring at faster rates do not cease bearing sooner. They continue to be fertile longer instead. Furthermore, within both species, groups with lower overall mortality rates have faster rates of increase in death risk with advancing age. These apparent contradictions to the expected life history tradeoffs likely result from heterogeneity in frailty among individuals. Whereas robust and frail alike must allocate investments between current and future reproduction, the more robust can afford more of both. This heterogeneity, combined with evolutionary tradeoffs and the key role of ancestral grandmothers they identify, helps explain aspects of human aging that increasingly concern us all. © 2010 by the National Academy of Sciences.

ABSTRACT: Phylogenetic analyses of the mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb), apicoplast caseinolytic protease C (clpC), and 18S rRNA sequences of Plasmodium isolates from chimpanzees along with those of the virulent human malaria parasite P. falciparum showed that the common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) malaria parasites, assigned by Rich et al. (2009) to P. reichenowi, constitute a paraphyletic assemblage. The assumption that P. falciparum diverged from P. reichenowi as recently as 5000-50,000years ago would require a rate of synonymous substitution/site/year in cytb and clpC on the order of 10-5-10-6, several orders of magnitude higher than any known from eukaryotic organelle genomes, and would imply an unrealistically recent timing of the most recent common ancestor of P. falciparum mitochondrial genomes. The available data are thus most consistent with the hypothesis that P. reichenowi (in the strict sense) and P. falciparum co-speciated with their hosts about 5-7 million years ago. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Demonstrating the ability to 'copy' the behavior of others is an important aspect in determining whether social learning occurs and whether group level differences in a given behavior represent cultural differences or not. Understanding the occurrence of this process in its natural context is essential, but can be a daunting task in the wild. In order to test the social learning hypothesis for the acquisition of leaf swallowing (LS), a self-medicative behavior associated with the expulsion of parasites, we conducted semi-naturalistic experiments on two captive groups of parasite-free, naïve chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Individuals in the group were systematically provided appropriate stimuli (rough hispid leaves) identical to those used by chimpanzees in the wild. Individuals initially responded in a variety of ways, ranging from total aversion to normal chewing and swallowing. Over time, however, the two groups adopted different variants for inserting and folding the leaves in the mouth prior to swallowing them (complete and partial LS), following the specific method spontaneously displayed by the first and primary LS models in their respective groups. These variants were similar to LS displayed by chimpanzees in the wild. Using the option-bias method, we found evidence for social learning leading to group-level biased transmission and group-level stabilization of these two variants. This is the first report on two distinct cultural variants innovated in response to the introduction of natural stimuli that emerged and spread spontaneously and concurrently within two adjacent groups of socially housed primates. These observations support the assertion that LS may reflect a generalized propensity for ingesting rough hispid leaves, which can be socially induced and transmitted within a group. Ingesting an adequate number of these leaves induces increased gut motility, which is responsible for the subsequent expulsion of particular parasite species in the wild. Cultural transmission and maintenance of LS within a group and associative learning by the individual of the positive consequences of this otherwise non-nutritive mode of ingestion is proposed to be the pivotal link between this feeding propensity and its maintenance as a self-medicative behavior by great apes in the wild. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: Triangulation of the human, chimpanzee, and Neanderthal genome sequences with respect to 44,348 disease-causing or disease-associated missense mutations and 1,712 putative regulatory mutations listed in the Human Gene Mutation Database was employed to identify genetic variants that are apparently pathogenic in humans but which may represent a "compensated" wild-type state in at least one of the other two species. Of 122 such "potentially compensated mutations" (PCMs) identified, 88 were deemed "ancestral" on the basis that the reported wild-type Neanderthal nucleotide was identical to that of the chimpanzee. Another 33 PCMs were deemed to be "derived" in that the Neanderthal wild-type nucleotide matched the human but not the chimpanzee wild-type. For the remaining PCM, all three wild-type states were found to differ. Whereas a derived PCM would require compensation only in the chimpanzee, ancestral PCMs are useful as a means to identify sites of possible adaptive differences between modern humans on the one hand, and Neanderthals and chimpanzees on the other. Ancestral PCMs considered to be disease-causing in humans were identified in two Neanderthal genes (DUOX2, MAMLD1). Because the underlying mutations are known to give rise to recessive conditions in human, it is possible that they may also have been of pathological significance in Neanderthals. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Little is known about Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infections in chimpanzees. Therefore, we investigated the prevalence of chimpanzee HBV (chHBV) infections in captive, wild born chimpanzees in the sanctuary on Ngamba Island, Uganda and one sample from a wild free ranging chimpanzee. In one third of the plasma samples (32.4%; 12/37) we detected antibodies to Hepatitis B (core) antigen. Amongst those individuals HBV DNA was detected in one captive wild born and the wild chimpanzee. In contrast to the only available earlier described HBV sequence from the subspecies Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, there was no evidence of recombination with human HBV. Our sequences therefore are likely to present the " original" chHBV from P. t. schweinfurthii. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Recently, many studies have been conducted on manual laterality in chimpanzees. Nevertheless, whether nonhuman primates exhibit population-level handedness remains a topic of considerable debate. One of the behaviors studied has been bimanual coordinated actions. Although recent studies have highlighted that captive chimpanzees show handedness at population level for these tasks, some authors have questioned the validity and consistency of these results. The first reason has been the humanization of the samples. The second one has been that the results refer to animals in American biomedical centers and the studies were conducted by the same team [WD Hopkins et al.]. This article aims to assess the laterality in bimanual coordination (tube task) activities in animals housed in an intermediate environment (Chimfunshi, Zambia). This has been conducted by replicating previous studies on similar samples (Mona Foundation, Spain), and then by extending the results to chimpanzees housed in intermediate settings. Individuals were evaluated through four experimental sessions (tests). Results indicated that 86% of the Chimfunshi sample was lateralized (48% RH, 38% LH). Furthermore, the sample showed population-level right-handedness in the mean handedness index, in Test 1, Test 2, and the first half of the study (Test 1+2). Rearing experience did not have an influence on hand preference. Taken together, the two sample (intermediate settings: Chimfunshi and Mona) results indicate a clear right-handedness. In conclusion, this replication and extension shows that (1) the Mona and Chimfunshi chimpanzees are right-handed in certain conditions, (2) the results are consistent with those obtained by Hopkins in captive settings, (3) the humanization of the samples does not affect manual laterality, (4) females are right-handed at population-level, but not males, and (5) these results reinforce the fact that the complexity of the task plays a dominant role in the expression of hand laterality among chimpanzees. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Natural killer (NK) cells serve essential functions in immunity and reproduction. Diversifying these functions within individuals and populations are rapidly-evolving interactions between highly polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I ligands and variable NK cell receptors. Specific to simian primates is the family of Killer cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptors (KIR), which recognize MHC class I and associate with a range of human diseases. Because KIR have considerable species-specificity and are lacking from common animal models, we performed extensive comparison of the systems of KIR and MHC class I interaction in humans and chimpanzees. Although of similar complexity, they differ in genomic organization, gene content, and diversification mechanisms, mainly because of human-specific specialization in the KIR that recognizes the C1 and C2 epitopes of MHC-B and -C. Humans uniquely focused KIR recognition on MHC-C, while losing C1-bearing MHC-B. Reversing this trend, C1-bearing HLA-B46 was recently driven to unprecedented high frequency in Southeast Asia. Chimpanzees have a variety of ancient, avid, and predominantly inhibitory receptors, whereas human receptors are fewer, recently evolved, and combine avid inhibitory receptors with attenuated activating receptors. These differences accompany human-specific evolution of the A and B haplotypes that are under balancing selection and differentially function in defense and reproduction. Our study shows how the qualitative differences that distinguish the human and chimpanzee systems of KIR and MHC class I predominantly derive from adaptations on the human line in response to selective pressures placed on human NK cells by the competing needs of defense and reproduction. © 2010 Abi-Rached et al.

ABSTRACT: While bonobos and chimpanzees are both genetically and behaviorally very similar, they also differ in significant ways. Bonobos are more cautious and socially tolerant while chimpanzees are more dependent on extractive foraging, which requires tools. The similarities suggest the two species should be cognitively similar while the behavioral differences predict where the two species should differ cognitively. We compared both species on a wide range of cognitive problems testing their understanding of the physical and social world. Bonobos were more skilled at solving tasks related to theory of mind or an understanding of social causality, while chimpanzees were more skilled at tasks requiring the use of tools and an understanding of physical causality. These species differences support the role of ecological and socio-ecological pressures in shaping cognitive skills over relatively short periods of evolutionary time.© 2010 Herrmann et al.

ABSTRACT: We have previously shown that there is an excess of sites that are polymorphic at orthologous positions in humans and chimpanzees and that this is most likely due to cryptic variation in the mutation rate. We showed that this might be a consequence of complex context effects since we found significant heterogeneity in triplet frequencies around coincident single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites. Here, we show that the heterogeneity in triplet frequencies is not specifically associated with coincident SNPs but is instead driven by base composition bias around CpG dinucleotides. As a result, we suggest that cryptic variation in the mutation rate is truly cryptic, in the sense that the mutation rate does not appear to depend on any specific primary sequence context. Furthermore, we propose that the patterns around CpG dinucleotides are driven by the mutability of CpG dinucleotides in different DNA contexts. We also show that the genomic distribution of coincident SNPs is nonuniform and that there are some subtle differences between the distributions of single and coincident SNPs. Furthermore, we identify regions that contain high numbers of coincident SNPs and suggest that one in particular, a region containing the gene PRIM2, may be under balancing selection. © The Author(s) 2010.

ABSTRACT: Background: It is still unclear which observational learning mechanisms underlie the transmission of difficult problemsolving skills in chimpanzees. In particular, two different mechanisms have been proposed: imitation and emulation. Previous studies have largely failed to control for social factors when these mechanisms were targeted. Methods: In an attempt to resolve the existing discrepancies, we adopted the 'floating peanut task', in which subjects need to spit water into a tube until it is sufficiently full for floating peanuts to be grasped. In a previous study only a few chimpanzees were able to invent the necessary solution (and they either did so in their first trials or never). Here we compared success levels in baseline tests with two experimental conditions that followed: 1) A full model condition to test whether social demonstrations would be effective, and 2) A social emulation control condition, in which a human experimenter poured water from a bottle into the tube, to test whether results information alone (present in both experimental conditions) would also induce successes. Crucially, we controlled for social factors in both experimental conditions. Both types of demonstrations significantly increased successful spitting, with no differences between demonstration types. We also found that younger subjects were more likely to succeed than older ones. Our analysis showed that mere order effects could not explain our results. Conclusion: The full demonstration condition (which potentially offers additional information to observers, in the form of actions), induced no more successes than the emulation condition. Hence, emulation learning could explain the success in both conditions. This finding has broad implications for the interpretation of chimpanzee traditions, for which emulation learning may perhaps suffice. © 2010 Tennie et al.

ABSTRACT: Background: Simian Immunodeficiency Viruses (SIVs) are the precursors of Human Immunodeficiency Viruses (HIVs) which have lead to the worldwide HIV/AIDS pandemic. By studying SIVs in wild primates we can better understand the circulation of these viruses in their natural hosts and habitat, and perhaps identify factors that influence susceptibility and transmission within and between various host species. We investigated the SIV status of wild West African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) which frequently hunt and consume the western red colobus monkey (Piliocolobus badius badius), a species known to be infected to a high percentage with its specific SIV strain (SIVwrc). Results: Blood and plasma samples from 32 wild chimpanzees were tested with INNO-LIA HIV I/II Score kit to detect cross-reactive antibodies to HIV antigens. Twenty-three of the samples were also tested for antibodies to 43 specific SIV and HIV lineages, including SIVwrc. Tissue samples from all but two chimpanzees were tested for SIV by PCRs using generic SIV primers that detect all known primate lentiviruses as well as primers designed to specifically detect SIVwrc. Seventeen of the chimpanzees showed varying degrees of cross-reactivity to the HIV specific antigens in the INNO-LIA test; however no sample had antibodies to SIV or HIV strain - and lineage specific antigens in the Luminex test. No SIV DNA was found in any of the samples. Conclusions: We could not detect any conclusive trace of SIV infection from the red colobus monkeys in the chimpanzees, despite high exposure to this virus through frequent hunting. The results of our study raise interesting questions regarding the host-parasite relationship of SIVwrc and wild chimpanzees in their natural habitat. © 2011 Leendertz et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, are unusual among primates in that they express their social position with a unique vocal signal, the pant-grunt. The call is only produced when encountering a higher-ranking group member and has thus been interpreted as a 'greeting' signal. We monitored the calling behaviour of nine adult females in a group of free-ranging chimpanzees, the Sonso community of Budongo Forest, Uganda, when encountering higher-ranking adult males. We found that call production was by no means rigid, but that calls were given only if certain social conditions were met. Although all adult males received pant-grunts from females, the alpha male received a significantly larger proportion of calls. The number of pant-grunts given to males was not correlated with their hierarchical position or with the level of anticipated aggression. Instead, females were significantly more likely to vocalize to other males if the alpha male was absent, suggesting that their calling behaviour was moderated by social inhibition. The presence of the alpha female had a similar yet weaker inhibitory effect. Social inhibition was further increased with increasing numbers of bystanders, especially males. Our results thus demonstrate that chimpanzees use their 'greeting' signals flexibly by taking into account the social fabric of their community. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: Previous epidemiological studies have reported a high prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in chimpanzees in Gabon and Congo, Central Africa. There is no data for this species from Cameroon. To date few cases of active HBV infection have been documented in gorillas and only one complete HBV sequence has been described from a wild-caught gorilla originating from Cameroon and housed in Germany. Since gorillas are apes found in Cameroon, we thus investigated the prevalence and genetic relationships of HBV infecting apes in this area. We subjected 185 wild-caught apes' plasmas, including 159 from chimpanzees and 26 from gorillas to ELISA screening for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg). Subsequently, we detected HBV DNA, sequenced the whole HBV genome and performed phylogenetic analysis. Eleven (6.9%) chimpanzees and 3 (11.6%) gorillas plasma were found HBsAg positive, of which 8 and 3 were positive for HBV DNA, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the 3 new gorilla HBV sequences grouped together with the single available HBV sequence from gorilla. Evidence of recombination between HBV Pan troglodytes troglodytes and Pan troglodytes vellerosus was observed in two of the Cameroonian strains. Findings from our study show that HBV infection is endemic in wild-born gorillas and chimpanzees in Cameroon, and that there is evidence of recombination between HBV strains circulating in chimpanzees. We demonstrated the existence of gorillas' specific HBV strains distinct but related to those found in chimpanzees living in the same habitat in Cameroon, providing substantial evidence of species association of HBV in NHPs. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: I have studied mutation patterns around very short microsatellites, focusing mainly on sequences carrying only two repeat units. By using human-chimpanzee-orangutan alignments, inferences can be made about both the relative rates of mutations and which bases have mutated. I find remarkable non-randomness, with mutation rate depending on a base's position relative to the microsatellite, the identity of the base itself and the motif in the microsatellite. Comparing the patterns around (AC)2 with those around other four-base combinations reveals that (AC)2 does not stand out as being special in the sense that non-repetitive tetramers also generate strong mutation biases. However, comparing (AC)2 and (AC)3 with (AC)4 reveals a step change in both the rate and nature of mutations occurring, suggesting a transition state, (AC)4 exhibiting an alternating high-low mutation rate pattern consistent with the sequence patterning seen around longer microsatellites. Surprisingly, most changes in repeat number occur through base substitutions rather than slippage, and the relative probability of gaining versus losing a repeat in this way varies greatly with repeat number. Slippage mutations reveal rather similar patterns of mutability compared with point mutations, being rare at two repeats where most cause the loss of a repeat, with both mutation rate and the proportion of expansion mutations increasing up to 6-8 repeats. Inferences about longer repeat tracts are hampered by uncertainties about the proportion of multi-species alignments that fail due to multi-repeat mutations and other rearrangements. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

ABSTRACT: This paper describes, analyzes, and critiques the construction of separate "male" and "female" genomes in current human genome research. Comparative genomic work on human sex differences conceives of the sexes as like different species, with different genomes. I argue that this construct is empirically unsound, distortive to research, and ethically questionable. I propose a conceptual model of biological sex that clarifies the distinction between species and sexes as genetic classes. The dynamic interdependence of the sexes makes them "dyadic kinds" that are not like species, which are "individual kinds." The concept of sex as a "dyadic kind" may be fruitful as a remedy to the tendency to conceive of the sexes as distinct, binary classes in biological research on sex more generally. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

ABSTRACT: Commercial timber harvesting results in the loss of critical habitat for tropical forest fauna, and large-bodied frugivores (including chimpanzees and most other apes) may experience particularly detrimental effects. Few quantitative data, however, are available to evaluate the long-term impact of harvesting on chimpanzees and other apes. In particular, few data are available to compare population demographics and/or forest composition before and after timber harvesting at the same site. Utilizing detailed forestry department records of logging operations conducted in the late 1960s, present-day botanical surveys, and long-term data on the feeding ecology of chimpanzees in Kibale National Park (KNP), Uganda, I examined the impact that logging has had on KNP chimpanzee communities of known size and demography. Although some important chimpanzee food resources were harvested in high abundance during commercial logging operations, the overall impact on the most predominant dietary items (those making up roughly 75% of the chimpanzees' diet) and on presumably critical subsistence resources was limited. Furthermore, the low density of chimpanzees inhabiting the logged region of KNP is apparently not attributable to the impact of logging at the site: comparisons of resource densities at this 'low-chimpanzee-density' site with that of an unlogged and 'high-chimpanzee-density' KNP site did not differ when logging concessions at the low-chimpanzee-density site were excluded from the analysis.

ABSTRACT: The modification of DNA by methylation is an important epigenetic mechanism that affects the spatial and temporal regulation of gene expression. Methylation patterns have been described in many contexts within and across a range of species. However, the extent to which changes in methylation might underlie inter-species differences in gene regulation, in particular between humans and other primates, has not yet been studied. To this end, we studied DNA methylation patterns in livers, hearts, and kidneys from multiple humans and chimpanzees, using tissue samples for which genome-wide gene expression data were also available. Using the multi-species gene expression and methylation data for 7,723 genes, we were able to study the role of promoter DNA methylation in the evolution of gene regulation across tissues and species. We found that inter-tissue methylation patterns are often conserved between humans and chimpanzees. However, we also found a large number of gene expression differences between species that might be explained, at least in part, by corresponding differences in methylation levels. In particular, we estimate that, in the tissues we studied, inter-species differences in promoter methylation might underlie as much as 12%-18% of differences in gene expression levels between humans and chimpanzees. © 2011 Pai et al.

ABSTRACT: Although the intestinal flora of chimpanzees has not been studied, insight into this dynamic environment can be obtained through studies on their feces. We analyzed fecal samples from humanhabituated, wild chimpanzees at Mahale Mountains National Park, Tanzania, and compared microbial community profiles to determine if members of the same social group were similar. Between July and December 2007, we collected fresh fecal samples from 12 individuals: four juveniles, four adolescents, and four adults, including three parent-offspring pairs. Each sample was analyzed using Terminal-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism of amplified 16S rRNA genes. Twelve different profiles were generated, having between 1 and 15 Terminal-Restriction Fragments (T-RFs). Overall, a total of 23 different T-RFs were produced. Putative assignments of T-RFs corresponded to the phyla Firmicutes (Clostridia, Bacilli, and Lactobacilli), Bacteroidetes, Tenericutes (Mollicutes Class), Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria, as well as to uncultured or unidentified organisms. Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla and Mollicutes Class were the most commonly assigned in 11, 8, and 8 of the samples, respectively, with this being the first report of Mollicutes in wild chimpanzees. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) revealed clustering of nine samples, and 80.5% of the diversity was accounted for by three samples. Morisita indices of community similarity ranged between 0.00 and 0.89, with dissimiliarity (o0.5) between most samples when compared two at a time. Our findings suggest that, although phylotypes are common among individuals, profiles among members of the same social group are host-specific. We conclude that factors other than social group, such as kinship and age, may influence fecal bacterial profiles of wild chimpanzees, and recommend that additional studies be conducted. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzee culture has generated intense recent interest, fueled by the technical complexity of chimpanzee tool-using traditions; yet it is seriously doubted whether chimpanzees are able to learn motor procedures by imitation under natural conditions. Here we take advantage of an unusual chimpanzee population as a 'natural experiment' to identify evidence for imitative learning of this kind in wild chimpanzees. The Sonso chimpanzee community has suffered from high levels of snare injury and now has several manually disabled members. Adult male Tinka, with near-total paralysis of both hands, compensates inability to scratch his back manually by employing a distinctive technique of holding a growing liana taut while making side-to-side body movements against it. We found that seven able-bodied young chimpanzees also used this 'liana-scratch' technique, although they had no need to. The distribution of the liana-scratch technique was statistically associated with individuals' range overlap with Tinka and the extent of time they spent in parties with him, confirming that the technique is acquired by social learning. The motivation for able-bodied chimpanzees copying his variant is unknown, but the fact that they do is evidence that the imitative learning of motor procedures from others is a natural trait of wild chimpanzees. © 2010 Hobaiter, Byrne.

ABSTRACT: Human language is distinctive compared with the communication systems of other species. Yet, several questions concerning its emergence and evolution remain unresolved. As a means of evaluating the neuroanatomical changes relevant to language that accompanied divergence from the last common ancestor of chimpanzees, bonobos and humans, we defined the cytoarchitectonic boundaries of area Tpt, a component of Wernicke's area, in 12 common chimpanzee brains and used designbased stereologic methods to estimate regional volumes, total neuron number and neuron density. In addition, we created a probabilistic map of the location of area Tpt in a template chimpanzee brain coordinate space. Our results show that chimpanzees display significant population-level leftward asymmetry of area Tpt in terms of neuron number, with volume asymmetry approaching significance. Furthermore, asymmetry in the number of neurons in area Tpt was positively correlated with asymmetry of neuron numbers in Brodmann's area 45, a component of Broca's frontal language region. Our findings support the conclusion that leftward asymmetry of Wernicke's area originated prior to the appearance of modern human language and before our divergence from the last common ancestor. Moreover, this study provides the first evidence of covariance between asymmetry of anterior and posterior cortical regions that in humans are important to language and other higher order cognitive functions. © 2010 The Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: To diagnose respiratory disease among wild great apes, there is a need for noninvasive diagnostic methods. Therefore, we analyzed fecal samples from habituated chimpanzees from Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire. Samples had been collected during four distinct outbreaks: two with known aetiology (March 2004 and February 2006) and two with unknown aetiology (October 2004 and August 2005). Fecal samples were screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), two paramyxoviruses previously found in lung tissue of chimpanzees that died due to respiratory disease. In the March 2004 outbreak, 72% of the tested individuals were positive for HMPV, and during the 2006 epidemic, 25% tested HRSV-positive. In the outbreaks where no causative pathogen was previously known, fecal samples tested positive for either HRSV or HMPV, showing that reinfection occurred. Virus sequences were generated and compared with sequences previously found in tissue; nearly identical virus sequences in both tissue and fecal samples were found. These results demonstrate that fecal samples collected during outbreak times can be used for the diagnostic and phylogenetic analysis of HMPV and HRSV. Using such diagnostic tools, systematic noninvasive disease investigation of respiratory outbreaks in wild great apes becomes possible. The methods presented here may also be applied for the investigation of further acute diseases in great apes and other species. © 2010 International Association for Ecology and Health.

ABSTRACT: Three pediatric chimpanzees and one pediatric gibbon were anesthetized for routine physical examination. Anesthesia was maintained with inhalant delivered via a laryngeal mask airway (LMA). The LMA was easy to insert, provided adequate control of the airway for ventilation, and caused no tracheal stimulation. No complications were observed. As compared with a face mask, the LMA has the advantage of a more secure airway; the ability to effectively ventilate the patient; less dead space, which leads to lower rebreathing of carbon dioxide; and less exposure of personnel to waste gases. As compared with an endotracheal tube, the LMA causes less airway trauma, is easier to place, and is less stimulating to the patient. The LMA should be considered for use in fasted non-human primates presented for procedures lasting less than 60 min where high peak inspiratory pressures are not needed.

ABSTRACT: Early rearing conditions of captive chimpanzees characterize behavioral differences in tool use, response to novelty, and sexual and maternal competence later in life. Restricted rearing conditions during early life hinder the acquisition and execution of such behaviors, which characterize the daily life of animals. This study examined whether rearing conditions affect adult male chimpanzees' behavior skills used for solving a problem with acquired locomotion behavior. Subjects were 13 male residents of the Chimpanzee Sanctuary Uto: 5 wild-born and 8 captive-born. A pretest assessed bed building and tool use abilities to verify behavioral differences between wild- and captive-born subjects, as earlier reports have described. Second, a banana-access test was conducted to investigate the problem-solving ability of climbing a bamboo pillar for accessing a banana, which might be the most efficient food access strategy for this setting. The test was repeated in a social setting. Results show that wild-born subjects were better able than captive-born subjects to use the provided materials for bed building and tool use. Results of the banana-access test show that wild-born subjects more frequently used a bamboo pillar for obtaining a banana with an efficient strategy than captive-born subjects did. Of the eight captive-born subjects, six avoided the bamboo pillars to get a banana and instead used, sometimes in a roundabout way, an iron pillar or fence. Results consistently underscored the adaptive and sophisticated skills of wild-born male chimpanzees in problem-solving tasks. The rearing conditions affected both the behavior acquisition and the execution of behaviors that had already been acquired. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

ABSTRACT: We describe the behavior of a previously unstudied community of wild chimpanzees during opportunistic encounters with researchers in an unprotected forest-farm mosaic at Bulindi, Uganda. Data were collected during 115 encounters between May 2006 and January 2008. Individual responses were recorded during the first minute of visual contact. The most common responses were "ignore" for arboreal chimpanzees and "monitor" for terrestrial individuals. Chimpanzees rarely responded with "flight". Adult males were seen disproportionately often relative to adult females, and accounted for 90% of individual responses recorded for terrestrial animals. Entire encounters were also categorized based on the predominant response of the chimpanzee party to researcher proximity. The most frequent encounter type was "ignore" (36%), followed by "monitor" (21%), "intimidation" (18%) and "stealthy retreat" (18%). "Intimidation" encounters occurred when chimpanzees were contacted in dense forest where visibility was low, provoking intense alarm and agitation. Adult males occasionally acted together to repel researchers through aggressive mobbing and pursuit. Chimpanzee behavior during encounters reflects the familiar yet frequently agonistic relationship between apes and local people at Bulindi. The chimpanzees are not hunted but experience high levels of harassment from villagers. Human-directed aggression by chimpanzees may represent a strategy to accommodate regular disruptions to foraging effort arising from competitive encounters with people both in and outside forest. Average encounter duration and proportion of encounters categorized as "ignore" increased over time, whereas "intimidation" encounters decreased, indicating some habituation occurred during the study. Ecotourism aimed at promoting tolerance of wildlife through local revenue generation is one possible strategy for conserving great apes on public or private land. However, the data imply that habituating chimpanzees for viewing-based ecotourism in heavily human-dominated landscapes, such as Bulindi, is ill-advised since a loss of fear of humans could lead to increased negative interactions with local people. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Cantanhez National Park in southern Guinea-Bissau is a mosaic of forest, mangrove, savanna, and agricultural fields, with a high prevalence of oil-palm trees (Elaeis guineensis). It hosts many different animal species, including the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus). Very little is known about the ecology of chimpanzees inhabiting this area. The main aims of this study were to evaluate chimpanzee nesting behavior, define trends of habitat use, and estimate chimpanzee density in four separate forests by applying the marked nest counts methodology. From the 287 new nests counted, 92% were built in oil-palm trees with a significantly higher frequency of nests in the forest edge than in forest cores. Differences in nest detection rates were observed in the four monitored forests, with two forests being more important for chimpanzee's nesting demands. The number of nests documented in the forests seemed to be correlated with the frequency of other signs of chimpanzee activity. Although chimpanzees selected nests on the forest edge, they were most frequently observed in forest core areas. Constraints associated with estimating chimpanzee density through oil-palm nest counting are discussed. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Background: We profile the chimpanzee transcriptome by using deep sequencing of cDNA from brain and liver, aiming to quantify expression of known genes and to identify novel transcribed regions.Results: Using stringent criteria for transcription, we identify 12,843 expressed genes, with a majority being found in both tissues. We further identify 9,826 novel transcribed regions that are not overlapping with annotated exons, mRNAs or ESTs. Over 80% of the novel transcribed regions map within or in the vicinity of known genes, and by combining sequencing data with de novo splice predictions we predict several of the novel transcribed regions to be new exons or 3' UTRs. For approximately 350 novel transcribed regions, the corresponding DNA sequence is absent in the human reference genome. The presence of novel transcribed regions in five genes and in one intergenic region is further validated with RT-PCR. Finally, we describe and experimentally validate a putative novel multi-exon gene that belongs to the ATP-cassette transporter gene family. This gene does not appear to be functional in human since one exon is absent from the human genome. In addition to novel exons and UTRs, novel transcribed regions may also stem from different types of noncoding transcripts. We note that expressed repeats and introns from unspliced mRNAs are especially common in our data.Conclusions: Our results extend the chimpanzee gene catalogue with a large number of novel exons and 3' UTRs and thus support the view that mammalian gene annotations are not yet complete. © 2010 Wetterbom et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Sex differences in children's toy play are robust and similar across cultures [1,2]. They include girls tending to play more with dolls and boys more with wheeled toys and pretend weaponry. This pattern is explained by socialization by elders and peers, male rejection of opposite-sex behavior and innate sex differences in activity preferences that are facilitated by specific toys [1]. Evidence for biological factors is controversial but mounting. For instance, girls who have been exposed to high fetal androgen levels are known to make relatively masculine toy choices [3]. Also, when presented with sex-stereotyped human toys, captive female monkeys play more with typically feminine toys, whereas male monkeys play more with masculine toys [1]. In human and nonhuman primates, juvenile females demonstrate a greater interest in infants, and males in rough-and-tumble play. This sex difference in activity preferences parallels adult behavior and may contribute to differences in toy play [1]. Here, we present the first evidence of sex differences in use of play objects in a wild primate, in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). We find that juveniles tend to carry sticks in a manner suggestive of rudimentary doll play and, as in children and captive monkeys, this behavior is more common in females than in males. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Simian immunodeficiency virus of chimpanzees (SIVcpz) has a significant negative impact on the health, reproduction, and life span of chimpanzees, yet the prevalence and distribution of this virus in wild-living populations are still only poorly understood. Here, we show that savanna chimpanzees, who live in ecologically marginal habitats at 10- to 50-fold lower population densities than forest chimpanzees, can be infected with SIVcpz at high prevalence rates. Fecal samples were collected from nonhabituated eastern chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) in the Issa Valley (n = 375) and Shangwa River (n = 6) areas of the Masito-Ugalla region in western Tanzania, genotyped to determine the number of sampled individuals, and tested for SIVcpz-specific antibodies and nucleic acids. None of 5 Shangwa River apes tested positive for SIVcpz; however, 21 of 67 Issa Valley chimpanzees were SIVcpz infected, indicating a prevalence rate of 31% (95% confidence interval, 21% to 44%). Two individuals became infected during the 14-month observation period, documenting continuing virus spread in this community. To characterize the newly identified SIVcpz strains, partial and full-length viral sequences were amplified from fecal RNA of 10 infected chimpanzees. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the Ugalla viruses formed a monophyletic lineage most closely related to viruses endemic in Gombe National Park, also located in Tanzania, indicating a connection between these now separated communities at some time in the past. These findings document that SIVcpz is more widespread in Tanzania than previously thought and that even very low-density chimpanzee populations can be infected with SIVcpz at high prevalence rates. Determining whether savanna chimpanzees, who face much more extreme environmental conditions than forest chimpanzees, are more susceptible to SIVcpz-associated morbidity and mortality will have important scientific and conservation implications. © 2011, American Society for Microbiology.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees in the Copenhagen Zoo frequently excrete ascarid worms onto the cage floor in spite of a regular anthelmintic treatment program. Previously it had been shown that the source of the infections was of pig origin. However, it was unknown whether the recurrence of the infection was due to reintroduction of eggs from an external source or to a sustained transmission cycle within the zoo. We found that isolated eggs were able to embryonate to the infective J3 stage and PCR-RFLP analysis on the ITS region amplified from single embryonated eggs suggest these to be Ascaris suum. In addition, sequence analysis of the cox1 gene ('barcoding') on expelled worms followed by cluster analysis revealed that the chimpanzees are infected with pig A. suum which now, in spite of control efforts, has stabilized into a permanent transmission cycle in the zoo's chimpanzee troop. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees produce acoustically distinct calls when encountering food. Previous research on a number of species has indicated that food-associated calls are relatively widespread in animal communication, and the production of these calls can be influenced by both ecological and social factors. Here, we investigate the factors influencing the production of food-associated calls in wild chimpanzees and examine whether male chimpanzees produce food-associated calls selectively in the presence of important social partners. Male chimpanzees form stable long-term social relationships with each other, and these social bonds are vital in enabling a range of cooperative activities, such as group hunting and territory defence. Our data show that males were significantly more likely to produce food-associated calls if an important social partner was nearby, regardless of the size of the audience or the presence of oestrus females. Call production was also mediated by the size of the food patch and by whether or not the food could be monopolised. The presence of important social partners explained most of the variation in male calling behaviour, indicating that food-associated calls are socially directed and serve a bonding function. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: Simian T-lymphotropic viruses type 1 (STLV-1) are regarded as a highly conserved group of viruses with genotypes clustering according to geographic regions rather than to infected species. In free living West African chimpanzees we have described a variety of STLV-1 strains and suggested that this diversity results from interspecies transmissions. Here we present new data on STLV-1 infections in these chimpanzees with the presence of two new distinct clades, proposing the establishing of two new STLV-1 subtypes. Moreover, in one of the chimpanzees, the Central African STLV-1 subtype B was detected. The STLV-1 strains detected here display a much wider diversity than heretofore reported for STLV-1 with presence of three distinct subtypes in chimpanzees from one distinct geographic region. In conclusion, the hypothesis of primate T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (PTLV-1) clustering by geography rather than host should be reconsidered, at least regarding STLV-1 infections in chimpanzees. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The ability to distinguish actions and effects caused by oneself from events occurring in the external environment is a fundamental aspect of human cognition. Underlying such distinctions, self-monitoring processes are often assumed, in which predicted events accompanied by one's own volitional action are compared with actual events observed in the external environment. Although many studies have examined the absence or presence of a certain type of self-recognition (i.e. mirror self-recognition) in non-human animals, the underlying cognitive mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we provide, to our knowledge, the first behavioural evidence that chimpanzees can perform self/other distinction for external events on the basis of self-monitoring processes. Three chimpanzees were presented with two cursors on a computer display. One cursor was manipulated by a chimpanzee using a trackball, while the other displayed motion that had been produced previously by the same chimpanzee. Chimpanzees successfully identified which cursor they were able to control. A follow-up experiment revealed that their performance could not be explained by simple associative responses. A further experiment with one chimpanzee showed that the monitoring process occurred in both temporal and spatial dimensions. These findings indicate that chimpanzees and humans share the fundamental cognitive processes underlying the sense of being an independent agent. © 2011 The Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Comparison of human and chimpanzee genomes has received much attention, because of paramount role for understanding evolutionary step distinguishing us from our closest living relative. In order to contribute to insight into Y chromosome evolutionary history, we study and compare tandems, higher order repeats (HORs), and regularly dispersed repeats in human and chimpanzee Y chromosome contigs, using robust Global Repeat Map algorithm. We find a new type of long-range acceleration, human-accelerated HOR regions. In peripheral domains of 35mer human alphoid HORs, we find riddled features with ten additional repeat monomers. In chimpanzee, we identify 30mer alphoid HOR. We construct alphoid HOR schemes showing significant human-chimpanzee difference, revealing rapid evolution after human-chimpanzee separation. We identify and analyze over 20 large repeat units, most of them reported here for the first time as: chimpanzee and human ~1.6 kb 3mer secondary repeat unit (SRU) and ~23.5 kb tertiary repeat unit (~0.55 kb primary repeat unit, PRU); human 10848, 15775, 20309, 60910, and 72140 bp PRUs; human 3mer SRU (~2.4 kb PRU); 715mer and 1123mer SRUs (5mer PRU); chimpanzee 5096, 10762, 10853, 60523 bp PRUs; and chimpanzee 64624 bp SRU (10853 bp PRU). We show that substantial human-chimpanzee differences are concentrated in large repeat structures, at the level of as much as ~70% divergence, sizably exceeding previous numerical estimates for some selected noncoding sequences. Smeared over the whole sequenced assembly (25 Mb) this gives ~14% human-chimpanzee divergence. This is significantly higher estimate of divergence between human and chimpanzee than previous estimates. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, help others in a variety of contexts. Some researchers have claimed that this only occurs when food is not involved and the recipient actively solicits help. In the current study, however, we found that chimpanzees often helped conspecifics obtain food in a pulling task with no solicitation whatsoever, in a situation in which, based on past experience, the conspecific's desire for the food was apparent. We also assessed whether the collaborative context of the situation impacted helping rates. Specifically, we compared how often both partners obtained rewards when one partner needed the help of the other, who had already received a reward for free (helping without collaboration), and when one partner needed the other's help after they had already begun collaborating (helping during collaboration). Partners provided assistance significantly more often in both of these helping conditions than in a control condition in which partners could provide unneeded help. However, unlike human children who have been tested in a similar task, chimpanzees did not help their partner more during (than without) collaboration. These results suggest that chimpanzees' helping behaviour is more robust than previously believed, but at the same time may have different evolutionary roots from the helping behaviour of humans. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: The primary male androgen testosterone (T) is often used as an endocrinological marker to investigate androgen-behaviour interactions in males. In chimpanzees and bonobos, studies investigating the relationship between T levels and dominance rank or aggressive behaviour have revealed contradictory results. The immunoassays used in these studies were originally developed for the measurement of steroids in serum. Their application to non-invasively collected samples, however, can lead to methodological problems due to cross-reacting metabolites, which might occur in urine or faeces but not in blood. The overall aim of this study, therefore, is to clarify whether a T enzyme immunoassay (EIA) is an applicable method to monitor testicular function in adult male chimpanzees. To estimate the impact of cross-reacting androgens on the used T EIA, we compared the results of an EIA measurement with a set of androgen metabolite levels measured by LC-MS. In urine from male chimpanzees, cross-reactivities appear to exist mainly with T and its exclusive metabolites, 5α-dihydrotestosterone (5α-DHT) and 5α-androstanediol (androstanediol). Both urinary and serum T levels of male chimpanzees were significantly higher than female T levels when measured with the T EIA, indicating a reliable measurement of testicular androgens and their exclusive metabolites with the used EIA. In urine from female chimpanzees, the comparison between LC-MS and T EIA results indicated a higher impact of cross-reactions with adrenal androgen metabolites. Therefore, the investigation of urinary T levels in female chimpanzees with a T EIA seems to be problematic. Overall our results show that a T EIA can be a reliable method to monitor testicular function in male chimpanzee urine and that LC-MS is a valuable tool for the validation of immunoassays. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Estrous cycle asynchrony likely functions to elevate individual females' sexual attractiveness during female mate choice. Female chimpanzees show physiological estrus as anogenital swelling. Copulations are concentrated during the period of maximal tumescence, which is called the estrous period. A group of female chimpanzees in Mahale Mountains National Park, Tanzania, was shown to display asynchrony in both maximal tumescence and periovulatory periods. We tested the hypothesis that females establish asynchronous maximal tumescence or periovulatory periods with respect to other females to increase copulation frequency and birth opportunities (Hypothesis 1). We analyzed differences in birth rates between four asynchronous years and five nonasynchronous years. Counter to Hypothesis 1, females in periovulatory periods during asynchronous years showed significantly lower birth rates than those in nonasynchronous years. In addition, periovulatory females copulated more frequently on days on which no other female in a periovulatory period was present. These results suggest that birth rates tend to decrease when females experience nonoverlapping ovulation cycles, although copulation frequency is high. Such a decrease in the birth rate may have resulted from the cost associated with multiple copulations. We tested two other hypotheses: paternity confusion (Hypothesis 2) and sperm competition (Hypothesis 3). Both of these hypotheses were partially supported. The highest-ranking male most effectively monopolized access to receptive females when relatively few other males and receptive females from the party (or subgroup) were present. The viability of Hypotheses 2 and 3 requires that dominant males are able to hinder a female from mating with other males. Given that the male-biased operational sex ratio created by female asynchrony is likely to reduce the efficiency of mate guarding by dominant males, an asynchronous female may gain a fitness benefit by increasing the probability of mating with at least one male who produces superior sperm. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Consolation, that is, postconflict affiliative contact by a bystander toward a recipient of aggression, has acquired an important role in the debate about empathy in great apes because it has been proposed that the reassuring behavior aimed at distressed parties reflects empathetic arousal. However, the function of this behavior is not fully understood. The present study tests specific predictions about the identity of bystanders on the basis of a database of 1102 agonistic interactions and their corresponding postconflict periods in two outdoor-housed groups of captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). We found that recipients of aggression were more likely to be contacted by their own " friends" than by " friends" of the aggressor and that frequent targets of aggression were not more likely to offer consolation than were nontargets of aggression. These findings support the stress reduction hypothesis rather than two proposed alternatives, that is, the opponent relationship repair hypothesis and the self-protection hypothesis. Our results provide further support for relationship quality as a fundamental underlying factor explaining variation in the occurrence of consolation. © 2010 American Psychological Association.

ABSTRACT: This study examines the behavioral ecology of a chimpanzee population on Rubondo Island in Lake Victoria, Tanzania, over 40. years after chimpanzees were first introduced to the island from captivity. Despite little pre-release habitat assessment, rehabilitation, or post-release monitoring, these chimpanzees are one of the only released populations to survive over decades without provisioning. We surveyed habitat structure and plant composition to gain insights into ecological features that have supported this self-sufficient chimpanzee population for over 40. years. We also examined possible ecological sources of chimpanzee ranging patterns on the island. We surveyed woody plant composition, and quantified densities of species producing large fleshy fruits and confirmed chimpanzee fruit foods across three chimpanzee ranging areas, each separated by several kilometers. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination to compare community-level patterns of plant composition across regions. The densities of trees and lianas producing fleshy fruits were high in comparison with similar measures at endemic chimpanzee study sites. There were major differences in the composition of tree species, including species of chimpanzee fruit foods, across the three regions. In contrast, liana species composition was similar across regions, and was characterized by a few super-abundant species, including one chimpanzee fallback food. The wide-ranging patterns of chimpanzees do not appear to be influenced by localized tree fruiting patterns, but may be facilitated by the wide-spread distribution of an important fallback food. In comparison with other endemic and release sites, the relatively low ecological population density of chimpanzees, the high density of both trees and lianas producing large fleshy fruits and the presence of a high-quality, widely-distributed fallback food are factors that likely contributed to the success of Rubondo chimpanzees in reverting to natural foraging behaviors after their release. © 2010.

ABSTRACT: We search the complete orangutan genome for regions where humans are more closely related to orangutans than to chimpanzees due to incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) in the ancestor of human and chimpanzees. The search uses our recently developed coalescent hidden Markov model (HMM) framework. We find ILS present in ∼1% of the genome, and that the ancestral species of human and chimpanzees never experienced a severe population bottleneck. The existence of ILS is validated with simulations, site pattern analysis, and analysis of rare genomic events. The existence of ILS allows us to disentangle the time of isolation of humans and orangutans (the speciation time) from the genetic divergence time, and we find speciation to be as recent as 9-13 million years ago (Mya; contingent on the calibration point). The analyses provide further support for a recent speciation of human and chimpanzee at ∼4 Mya and a diverse ancestor of human and chimpanzee with an effective population size of about 50,000 individuals. Posterior decoding infers ILS for each nucleotide in the genome, and we use this to deduce patterns of selection in the ancestral species. We demonstrate the effect of background selection in the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees. In agreement with predictions from population genetics, ILS was found to be reduced in exons and gene-dense regions when we control for confounding factors such as GC content and recombination rate. Finally, we find the broad-scale recombination rate to be conserved through the complete ape phylogeny. © 2011 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

ABSTRACT: GB virus C (GBV-C) is a common, non-pathogenic human virus that infects lymphocytes. Persistent GBV-C infection of humans with coexistent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is associated with prolonged survival, and GBV-C replication inhibits HIV replication in vitro. A GBV-C virus variant was identified in chimpanzees in 1998 and was named GBV-Ctrog or GBV-Ccpz. The prevalence and natural history of GBV-C in chimpanzees remains uncharacterized. We examined the sera from 235 captive chimpanzees for the presence of GBV-C viraemia, viral persistence and clearance, E2 antibody kinetics and RNA sequence diversity. Sequences from six isolates shared more sequence identity with GBV-Ccpz than with human GBV-C. The prevalence of GBV-Ccpz viraemia and E2 antibody in chimpanzees (2.5 and 11 %, respectively) was similar to human GBV-C prevalence in healthy human blood donors (1.8 and 9%, respectively). Persistent GBV-Ccpz infection occurred in two of the six viraemic animals and was documented for 19 years in one animal. Host subspecies troglodyte GBV-C isolates and published verus GBV-C isolates shared a high degree of sequence identity, suggesting that GBV-C in chimpanzees should be identified with a chimpanzee designation (GBV-C cpz). The prevalence and natural history of chimpanzee GBV-C variant (GBV-Ccpz) appears to be similar to human GBV-C infection. The chimpanzee could serve as an animal model to study HIV-GBV-C co-infection.

ABSTRACT: Age of tooth emergence is a useful measure of the pace of life for primate species, both living and extinct. A recent study combining wild chimpanzees of the Taï Forest, Gombe, and Bossou by Zihlman et al. (2004) suggested that wild chimpanzees erupt teeth much later than captives, bringing into question both comparisons within the hominin fossil record and assessment of chimpanzees. Here, we assess the magnitude of the "wild effect" (the mean difference between captive and wild samples expressed in standard deviation units) in these chimpanzees. Tooth emergence in these wild individuals is late, although at a more moderate level than previously recorded, with a mean delay conservatively estimated at about 1 SD compared to the captive distributions. The effect rises to 1.3 SD if we relax criteria for age estimates. We estimate that the mandibular M1 of these wild chimpanzees emerges at about 3 2/3-3 years of age. An important point, often ignored, is that these chimpanzees are largely dead of natural causes, merging the effect of living wild with the effect of early death. Evidence of mortality selection includes, specifically: younger deaths appear to have been more delayed than the older in tooth emergence, more often showed evidence of disease or debilitation, and revealed a higher occurrence of dental anomalies. Notably, delay in tooth emergence for live-captured wild baboons appears lower in magnitude (ca. 0.5 SD) and differs in pattern. Definitive ages of tooth emergence times in living wild chimpanzees must be established from the study of living animals. The fossil record, of course, consists of many dead juveniles; the present study has implications for how we evaluate them. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Adenoviral vectors have shown great promise as vaccine carriers and in gene transfer to correct underlying genetic diseases. Traditionally, cstruction of adenoviral vectors is complex and time consuming. In this paper, we provide an improved method for efficient generation of novel adenoviral vectors by using direct cloning. We introduce a feasible and detailed protocol for the development of chimpanzee adenoviruses (Ads) as molecular clones, as well as for the generation of recombinant virus from the molecular clones. Recombinant viruses are genetically stable and induce potent immune responses in animals. Generation of new Ad molecular clones or new recombinant Ad can be achieved in 2 months or 2 weeks, respectively. © 2010 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Background: Intestinal schistosomiasis, caused by Schistosoma mansoni, is endemic to Lake Victoria, with high prevalence of the disease observed in human lakeshore communities. However, nonhuman primates have recently been overlooked as potential hosts of the disease, despite known susceptibility. Methods: Using a variety of stool, urine, and serological diagnostic methods, 39 semi-captive wild-born chimpanzees and 37 staff members at Ngamba Island Chimpanzee Sanctuary, Lake Victoria, Uganda, were examined for S. mansoni infection. Miracidia recovered from stool were DNA barcoded to investigate cross-over between humans and chimpanzees. The island was also surveyed for Biomphalaria intermediate host snails, which were examined for infection with S. mansoni. Results: Chimpanzees were unequivocally shown to be infected with intestinal schistosomiasis with a seroprevalence in excess of 90%. Three egg-positive cases were detected, although the sensitivity of the diagnostic tests varied due to earlier prophylactic praziquantel treatment. Miracidia hatched from chimpanzee stool revealed three DNA haplotypes commonly found in humans living throughout Lake Victoria, including staff on Ngamba Island, as well as two novel haplotypes. At one site, a snail was observed shedding schistosome cercariae. Conclusions: The anthropozoonotic potential of intestinal schistosomiasis on Ngamba Island is greater than previously thought. Moreover, the ability of chimpanzees to void schistosome eggs capable of hatching into viable miracidia further suggests that these nonhuman primates may be capable of maintaining a local zoonotic transmission of schistosomiasis independently of humans. The implications for management of captive and wild primate populations at risk of exposure are discussed. © Copyright 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2011.

ABSTRACT: Like human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), simian immunodeficiency virus of chimpanzees (SIVcpz) can cause CD4+ T cell loss and premature death. Here, we used molecular surveillance tools and mathematical modeling to estimate the impact of SIVcpz infection on chimpanzee population dynamics. Habituated (Mitumba and Kasekela) and non-habituated (Kalande) chimpanzees were studied in Gombe National Park, Tanzania. Ape population sizes were determined from demographic records (Mitumba and Kasekela) or individual sightings and genotyping (Kalande), while SIVcpz prevalence rates were monitored using non-invasive methods. Between 2002-2009, the Mitumba and Kasekela communities experienced mean annual growth rates of 1.9% and 2.4%, respectively, while Kalande chimpanzees suffered a significant decline, with a mean growth rate of -6.5% to -7.4%, depending on population estimates. A rapid decline in Kalande was first noted in the 1990s and originally attributed to poaching and reduced food sources. However, between 2002-2009, we found a mean SIVcpz prevalence in Kalande of 46.1%, which was almost four times higher than the prevalence in Mitumba (12.7%) and Kasekela (12.1%). To explore whether SIVcpz contributed to the Kalande decline, we used empirically determined SIVcpz transmission probabilities as well as chimpanzee mortality, mating and migration data to model the effect of viral pathogenicity on chimpanzee population growth. Deterministic calculations indicated that a prevalence of greater than 3.4% would result in negative growth and eventual population extinction, even using conservative mortality estimates. However, stochastic models revealed that in representative populations, SIVcpz, and not its host species, frequently went extinct. High SIVcpz transmission probability and excess mortality reduced population persistence, while intercommunity migration often rescued infected communities, even when immigrating females had a chance of being SIVcpz infected. Together, these results suggest that the decline of the Kalande community was caused, at least in part, by high levels of SIVcpz infection. However, population extinction is not an inevitable consequence of SIVcpz infection, but depends on additional variables, such as migration, that promote survival. These findings are consistent with the uneven distribution of SIVcpz throughout central Africa and explain how chimpanzees in Gombe and elsewhere can be at equipoise with this pathogen.

ABSTRACT: Identification of different functional elements and their properties is a fundamental need in biomedical research and phylogenetic comparisons of a growing number of sequenced genomes form a solid basis for this task. Most available phylogenetic approaches are focused on searching for individual sequence alterations, responsible for the observed phenotype, or statistically evaluate observed mutations to infer general trends. However, being applied to close genomes such methods suffer from poor statistics of rare mutations and give only (at its best) coarse results concerning the potential functional importance of the nucleotide differences. However, quantifying the changes in physical properties of DNA allows to see the strength of introduced mutations and hence to classify them for further investigations.In this work we present the comparative sequence analysis of two evolutionarily close species-human and chimpanzee. In contrast to previous studies we evaluate changes in melting enthalpy of DNA rather than count nucleotide mismatches. We find that nucleotide mismatches in promoters were apparently introduced in a correlated manner during the course of evolution, so that, for example, the DNA property "melting enthalpy" was retained. Such property conservation of promoters is significantly different from nucleotide conservation, shows significant positional and functional biases, and seems to represent a novel feature of gene regulation. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Background: Little is known about salivary α-amylase expression in primates. Methods: We compared saliva of gelada and hamadryas baboons, chimpanzees and humans using SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Results and conclusions: Amylase expression was increased in hamadryas baboons (P = 0.0376) compared to humans and might indicate dietary starch use in Cercopithecines. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

ABSTRACT: DNA of two distinctive adenoviruses was detected in wild chimpanzees in western Tanzania that showed clinical signs of acute, upper respiratory disease, notably coughing. The amplified sequences from part of the capsid hexon gene suggests that one virus is a novel adenovirus serotype candidate and the other virus is a species C adenovirus most closely related to recent isolates from captive chimpanzees in the United States, Simian AdV 37 with 86% nucleic acid identity and Simian AdV 40 with 95% nucleic acid identity, respectively. The species C adenovirus sequences suggest possible recombination with a human adenovirus. The source of these viruses and disease association is not known.

ABSTRACT: The inevitable has happened: genomic technologies have been added to our noninvasive genetic sampling repertoire. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Perry (2010) demonstrate how DNA extraction from chimpanzee faeces, followed by a series of steps to enrich for target loci, can be coupled with next-generation sequencing. These authors collected sequence and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data at more than 600 genomic loci (chromosome 21 and the X) and the complete mitochondrial DNA. By design, each locus was 'deep sequenced' to enable SNP identification. To demonstrate the reliability of their data, the work included samples from six captive chimps, which allowed for a comparison between presumably genuine SNPs obtained from blood and potentially flawed SNPs deduced from faeces. Thus, with this method, anyone with the resources, skills and ambition to do genome sequencing of wild, elusive, or protected mammals can enjoy all of the benefits of noninvasive sampling. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), reaching epidemic proportions in humans, has emerged as a disease in aging captive populations of adult chimpanzees; however, little information is available regarding T2DM in chimpanzees. Our goals were to: (1) distinguish between normal, healthy chimpanzees and those with early (prediabetes) or advanced diabetes; (2) establish and compare the fasting (16 h) blood glucose reference range for chimpanzees at our facility with published reference ranges; and (3) establish hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) reference intervals for healthy, nondiabetic chimpanzees and define threshold values for prediabetes and diabetes. If reliable, our reference ranges for FBG and HbA1c could become clinical tools for screening animals at risk and for monitoring therapeutic progress. The overall incidence of T2DM in our colony of 260 chimpanzees is 0.8% but is increased to 3.7% in animals older than 30 y (geriatric). For our defined reference intervals, chimpanzees with FBG or HbA1c levels up to the 85th percentile (glucose, less than or equal to 105 mg/dL; HbA1c, less than or equal to 5.0%) were considered healthy; those whose values lay between the 86th and 95th percentiles (glucose, 106 to 119 mg/dL; HbA1c, 5.1% to 5.2%) were possibly prediabetic, and animals whose values exceeded the 95th percentile (glucose, greater than or equal to 120 mg/dL; HbA1c, greater than 5.3%) were identified as potentially having diabetes. We found that our FBG range was comparable to other published results, with a positive correlation between HbA1c and glucose. Furthermore, the negligible HbA1c response to acute stress or recent food consumption suggests that HbA1c is highly useful for evaluating glycemic control during treatment of diabetic chimpanzees and is more informative concerning overall glucose control than are FBG levels alone.

ABSTRACT: Understanding cooperation between unrelated individuals remains a central problem in animal behaviour; evolutionary mechanisms are debated, and the importance of reciprocity has been questioned. Biological market theory makes specific predictions about the occurrence of reciprocity in social groups; applied to the social grooming of mammals, it predicts reciprocity in the absence of other benefits for which grooming can be exchanged. Considerable effort has been made to test this grooming trade model in nonhuman primates; such studies show mixed results, but may be confounded by kin effects. We examined patterns of reciprocity within and across bouts, and tested predictions of the grooming trade model, among wild male chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes: a system with negligible kin effects. In accord with the model's expectations, we found that some grooming was directed by lower- to higher-ranked individuals, and that, on average, higher-ranked individuals groomed more reciprocally. We found no support, however, for a prediction that more reciprocity should occur between individuals close in rank. For most dyads, reciprocity of effort occurred through unbalanced participation in grooming bouts, but reciprocity varied considerably between dyads and only a small proportion showed strongly reciprocal grooming. Despite this, each male had at least one reciprocal grooming relationship. In bouts where both individuals groomed, effort was matched through mutual grooming, not alternating roles. Our results provide mixed support for the current grooming trade, biological market model, and suggest that it needs to incorporate risks of currency inflation and cheating for species where reciprocity can be achieved through repeated dyadic interactions. © 2010.

ABSTRACT: Real-life situations provide rich sets of cues that viewers evaluate in terms of their emotional significance. In this study, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) viewed a movie depicting naturalistic scenes involving the whole-body expressions of conspecifics to examine how nonhuman primates perceived the combination of these cues and how each cue contributed to the overall perception. Viewing time was measured while the chimpanzees watched movie clips without sound. Among scenes depicting neutrality, general excitement, agonism, and playfulness, chimpanzees looked longest at those depicting agonism. This bias toward agonistic scenes may indicate an attentional sensitivity toward threat/fear-related negative situations among chimpanzees. The effect disappeared when the images were scrambled, ruling out the possible effect of pixel-level properties on the results. In addition, the follow-up analyses revealed that the effect was independent of the presentation order and of the number of individuals in each clip. The manipulation of playback speeds had little effect on the looking times. The elimination of facial cues slightly influenced the looking times but did not change the strong bias toward agonistic scenes. This robustness of the main effect against image manipulations may indicate that the chimpanzees attended directly to the contextual information implied by the cues rather than to the cues per se (e.g., facial expressions, speed of movements). © 2010 American Psychological Association.

ABSTRACT: Testosterone regulates a wide variety of behavioral and physiological traits in male vertebrates. It influences reproductive and aggressive behaviors and is used as a marker of gonadal activity. While testosterone is the primary biologically active male gonadal steroid in the blood, it is metabolized into a variety of related steroids when excreted via urine and feces. To monitor endocrinological profiles studies on wild-living animals primarily rely on non-invasively collected samples such as urine or feces. Since a number of androgen metabolites that are found in high concentrations in these matrices do not stem exclusively from gonadal production, but are also produced by the adrenal cortex, the metabolism and excretion pattern of testosterone and its characteristic metabolites have to be investigated. Here, we compare the levels of 11 androgens and their metabolites in serum and urine (after hydrolytic/solvolytic cleavage of conjugates) from female, and intact and castrated male chimpanzees to investigate whether they were of testicular or adrenal origin. For serum, significant differences in concentrations were found only for native testosterone. For urine, testosterone concentrations showed the largest differences between intact and castrated males, and intact males and females, while no differences were seen between females and castrated males. Epitestosterone levels revealed the same pattern. These differences in urinary concentrations could also be seen for 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol (androstanediol), and less clearly for 5α-dihydrotestosterone (5α-DHT), etiocholanolone, and androsterone. In urine of males, significant correlations were found between the levels of testosterone and 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol, as well as between testosterone and epitestosterone. Therefore, the clearest urinary markers of gonadal activity in male chimpanzees seems to be testosterone itself. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The meat-for-sex hypothesis posits that male chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) trade meat with estrous females in exchange for short-term mating access. This notion is widely cited in the anthropological literature and has been used to construct scenarios about human evolution. Here we review the theoretical and empirical basis for the meat-for-sex hypothesis. We argue that chimpanzee behavioral ecology does not favor the evolution of such exchanges because 1) female chimpanzees show low mate selectivity and require little or no material incentive to mate, violating existing models of commodity exchange; and 2) meat-for-sex exchanges are unlikely to provide reproductive benefits to either partner. We also present new analyses of 28 years of data from two East African chimpanzee study sites (Gombe National Park, Tanzania; Kanyawara, Kibale National Park, Uganda) and discuss the results of previously published studies. In at least three chimpanzee communities, 1) the presence of sexually receptive females did not increase hunting probability, 2) males did not share preferentially with sexually receptive females, and 3) sharing with females did not increase a male's short-term mating success. We acknowledge that systematic meat sharing by male chimpanzees in expectation of, or in return for, immediate copulations might be discovered in future studies. However, current data indicate that such exchanges are so rare, and so different in nature from exchanges among humans, that with respect to chimpanzees, sexual bartering in humans should be regarded as a derived trait with no known antecedents in the behavior of wild chimpanzees. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: A crucially important aspect of human cooperation is the ability to negotiate to cooperative outcomes when interests over resources conflict. Although chimpanzees and other social species may negotiate conflicting interests regarding travel direction or activity timing, very little is known about their ability to negotiate conflicting preferences over food. In the current study, we presented pairs of chimpanzees with a choice between two cooperative tasks-one with equal payoffs (e.g., 5-5) and one with unequal payoffs (higher and lower than in the equal option, e.g., 10-1). This created a conflict of interests between partners with failure to work together on the same cooperative task resulting in no payoff for either partner. The chimpanzee pairs cooperated successfully in as many as 78-94% of the trials across experiments. Even though dominant chimpanzees preferred the unequal option (as they would obtain the largest payoff), subordinate chimpanzees were able to get their way (the equal option) in 22-56% of trials across conditions. Various analyses showed that subjects were both strategic and also cognizant of the strategies used by their partners. These results demonstrate that one of our two closest primate relatives, the chimpanzee, can settle conflicts of interest over resources in mutually satisfying ways-even without the social norms of equity, planned strategies of reciprocity, and the complex communication characteristic of human negotiation. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Human-wildlife interactions have existed for thousands of years, however as human populations increase and human impact on natural ecosystems becomes more intensive, both parties are increasingly being forced to compete for resources vital to both. Humans can value wildlife in many contexts promoting coexistence, while in other situations, such as crop-raiding, wildlife conflicts with the interests of people. As our closest phylogenetic relatives, chimpanzees (Pantroglodytes) in particular occupy a special importance in terms of their complex social and cultural relationship with humans. A case study is presented that focuses on the Bossou chimpanzees' (Pan troglodytes verus) perspective of their habitat in the Republic of Guinea, West Africa, by highlighting the risks and opportunities presented by a human-dominated landscape, and detailing their day-to-day coexistence with humans. Understanding how rural people perceive chimpanzees and how chimpanzees adapt to living in anthropogenic environments will enhance our understanding of how people-wildlife interactions develop into situations of conflict and therefore can generate sustainable solutions to prevent or mitigate situations of conflict. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.

ABSTRACT: Transcription is the first step connecting genetic information with an organism's phenotype. While expression of annotated genes in the human brain has been characterized extensively, our knowledge about the scope and the conservation of transcripts located outside of the known genes' boundaries is limited. Here, we use high-throughput transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) to characterize the total non-ribosomal transcriptome of human, chimpanzee, and rhesus macaque brain. In all species, only 20-28% of non-ribosomal transcripts correspond to annotated exons and 20-23% to introns. By contrast, transcripts originating within intronic and intergenic repetitive sequences constitute 40-48% of the total brain transcriptome. Notably, some repeat families show elevated transcription. In non-repetitive intergenic regions, we identify and characterize 1,093 distinct regions highly expressed in the human brain. These regions are conserved at the RNA expression level across primates studied and at the DNA sequence level across mammals. A large proportion of these transcripts (20%) represents 3′UTR extensions of known genes and may play roles in alternative microRNA-directed regulation. Finally, we show that while transcriptome divergence between species increases with evolutionary time, intergenic transcripts show more expression differences among species and exons show less. Our results show that many yet uncharacterized evolutionary conserved transcripts exist in the human brain. Some of these transcripts may play roles in transcriptional regulation and contribute to evolution of human-specific phenotypic traits. © 2010 Guohua Xu et al.

ABSTRACT: Social grooming is ubiquitous among the captive chimpanzees at Chester Zoo. Seven individuals were chosen here for a study of third-party social dynamics. The grooming decisions of five adult males were analysed, but only insofar as they directed attention to a mother-daughter pair. Uniquely, the daughter was an unpopular and physically disabled subadult whose congenital motor impairments prevented her from grooming others effectively. The impetus for this study was the observation that some males increased their grooming towards the disabled daughter during days when the mother had a tumescent anogenital swelling (sexually attractive to males) compared to days when the mother was not tumescent (less attractive). Apparently, males were grooming the daughter with no possibility of payback (because the daughter could never "return the favour"). A "grooming rate" (avg. grooming time/hour) was calculated that showed the grooming efforts of all five males towards both mother and daughter. These rates were compared on days when (1) the mother's anogenital swelling was tumescent, and (2) days when the swelling was not tumescent. Each male showed a different pattern of behaviour. Two males groomed the daughter significantly more when the mother was tumescent. Results for all males were graphed against the quality of the social relationship between each male and the mother. Apparently, only males that had a weaker relationship to the mother groomed the daughter more when the mother was tumescent. This pattern did not exist for males with a stronger relationship to the mother. Possibly, the insecure males were using the disabled daughter as a way to curry favour with the attractive mother. If this is confirmed, then this type of triadic situation is a possible setting for indirect reciprocity to occur. © Japan Monkey Centre and Springer 2009.

ABSTRACT: A large body of theoretical and empirical research suggests that kinship influences the development and maintenance of social bonds among group-living female mammals, and that human females may be unusual in the extent to which individuals form differentiated social relationships with nonrelatives. Here we combine behavioral observations of party association, spatial proximity, grooming, and space use with extensive molecular genetic analyses to determine whether female chimpanzees form strong social bonds with unrelated individuals of the same sex. We compare our results with those obtained from male chimpanzees who live in the same community and have been shown to form strong social bonds with each other. We demonstrate that party association is as good a predictor of spatial proximity and grooming in females as it is in males, that the highest party association indices are consistently found between female dyads, that the sexes do not differ in the long-term stability of their party association patterns, and that these results cannot be explained as a by-product of the tendency of females to selectively range in particular areas of the territory. We also show that close kin (i.e. mother-daughter and sibling dyads) are very rare, indicating that the vast majority of female dyads that form strong social bonds are not closely related. Additional analyses reveal that "subgroups" of females, consisting of individuals who frequently associate with one another in similar areas of the territory, do not consist of relatives. This suggests that a passive form of kin-biased dispersal, involving the differential migration of females from neighboring communities into subgroups, was also unlikely to be occurring. These results show that, as in males, kinship plays a limited role in structuring the intrasexual social relationships of female chimpanzees. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Background: To investigate whether or not the same strain of hepatitis C virus (HCV) can twice re-infect the same chimpanzee, we analyzed nucleic and amino acid sequences in HCV hypervariable region-1 (HVR1). Two chimpanzees were inoculated, three times each, with the same HCV strain during the 1983-1991. After each inoculation, chimpanzees developed acute hepatitis C, and then recovered. Methods: Using sera, HVR1 cloning and antibody to HVR1 major clone measurement were performed. Results: Clones from the first inoculum were divisible into major and minor types. Clones from the second and third inocula, as well as all post-inoculation sera, were essentially identical to the major type. Titers of antibody to HVR1 major clone were consistently low in pre- and post-inoculation sera. Conclusions: Both chimpanzees were re-infected twice with the same strain of HCV. The sequences from the second and third infections were similar to the major sequences in the first inoculum. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

ABSTRACT: Several populations of chimpanzees have been reported to prey upon Dorylus army ants. The most common tool-using technique to gather these ants is with ''dipping'' probes, which vary in length with regard to aggressiveness and lifestyle of the prey species. We report the use of a tool set in army ant predation by chimpanzees in the Goualougo Triangle, Republic of Congo. We recovered 1,060 tools used in this context and collected 25 video recordings of chimpanzee tool-using behavior at ant nests. Two different types of tools were distinguished based on their form and function. The chimpanzees use a woody sapling to perforate the ant nest, and then a herb stem as a dipping tool to harvest the ants. All of the species of ants preyed upon in Goualougo are present and consumed by chimpanzees at other sites, but there are no other reports of such a regular or widespread use of more than one type of tool to prey upon Dorylus ants. Furthermore, this tool set differs from other types of tool combinations used by chimpanzees at this site for preying upon termites or gathering honey. Therefore, we conclude that these chimpanzees have developed a specialized method for preying upon army ants, which involves the use of an additional tool for opening nests. Further research is needed to determine which specific ecological and social factors may have shaped the emergence and maintenance of this technology © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

ABSTRACT: We examined stool samples for trophozoites of the entodiniomorphid ciliate Troglodytella abrassarti Brumpt and Joyeux, 1912, from a habituated group of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) at Mahale Mountains National Park in western Tanzania. In our study, fresh fecal samples from identified individuals were collected immediately after defecation and fixed in 10 formalin. In total, 52 samples from 38 chimpanzees (61 of 62 chimpanzees in the group) were examined using a direct smear method. A stool sample from an individual collection date from an individual chimpanzee was examined up to 3 separate times before it was called negative. Forty-eight (92) of the 52 samples were positive, and stools from 37 (97) of the 38 chimpanzees were positive for trophozoites of T. abrassarti. The high prevalence of T. abrassarti in these chimpanzees is consistent with previous reports of this organism in chimpanzees. © American Society of Parasitologists 2010.

ABSTRACT: The release of any species into a novel environment can evoke transmission of parasites that do not normally parasitize the host as well as potentially introducing new parasites into the environment. Species introductions potentially incur such risks, yet little is currently known about the parasite fauna of introduced primate species over the long term. We describe the results of long-term monitoring of the intestinal parasite fauna of an unprovisioned, reproducing population of chimpanzees introduced 40 years earlier (1966-1969) onto Rubondo Island in Lake Victoria, Tanzania, a non-native habitat for chimpanzees. Two parasitological surveys (March 1997-October 1998 and October 2002-December 2005) identified Entamoeba spp. including E. coli, Iodamoeba buetschlii, Troglodytella abrassarti, Chilomastix mesnili, Trichuris sp., Anatrichosoma sp., Strongyloides spp., Strongylida fam. gen. sp., Enterobius anthropopitheci, Subulura sp., Ascarididae gen. sp., and Protospirura muricola. The parasite fauna of the Rubondo chimpanzees is similar to wild chimpanzees living in their natural habitats, but Rubondo chimpanzees have a lower prevalence of strongylids (9%, 3.8%) and a higher prevalence of E. anthropopitheci (8.6%, 17.9%) than reported elsewhere. Species prevalence was similar between our two surveys, with the exception of Strongyloides spp. being higher in the first survey. None of these species are considered to pose a serious health risk to chimpanzees, but continued monitoring of the population and surveys of the parasitic fauna of the two coinhabitant primate species and other animals, natural reservoir hosts of some of the same parasites, is important to better understand the dynamics of host-parasite ecology and potential long-term implications for chimpanzees introduced into a new habitat. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Many studies have examined the long-term effects of selective logging on the abundance and diversity of free-ranging primates. Logging is known to reduce the abundance of some primate species through associated hunting and the loss of food trees for frugivores; however, the potential role of pathogens in such primate population declines is largely unexplored. Selective logging results in a suite of alterations in host ecology and forest structure that may alter pathogen dynamics in resident wildlife populations. In addition, environmental pollution with human fecal material may present a risk for wildlife infections with zoonotic protozoa, such as Cryptosporidium and Giardia. To better understand this interplay, we compared patterns of infection with these potentially pathogenic protozoa in sympatric western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) in the undisturbed Goualougo Triangle of Nouabalé-Ndoki National Park and the adjacent previously logged Kabo Concession in northern Republic of Congo. No Cryptosporidium infections were detected in any of the apes examined and prevalence of infection with Giardia was low (3.73% overall) and did not differ between logged and undisturbed forest for chimpanzees or gorillas. These results provide a baseline for prevalence of these protozoa in forest-dwelling African apes and suggest that low-intensity logging may not result in long-term elevated prevalence of potentially pathogenic protozoa. © 2010 International Association for Ecology and Health.

ABSTRACT: There are two questions that may be answered through the study of chimpanzee cognitive development: First, ‘what are the common cognitive traits shared by humans and chimpanzees?’ and second, ‘what traits are uniquely human?’ Comparative studies have demonstrated similarities between humans and chimpanzees, and also illuminated the fundamental differences. Nonhuman primates climb trees with all four limbs and are well adapted to arboreal life. Nonhuman primate infants cling actively to their mothers; in return, they receive frequent embraces. Mother–infant relationship in these primates, especially simians, is clearly characterized by this clinging–embracing. However, human mothers and their infants are often physically separated from each other. Human infants cannot cling to their mothers. The stability of infants in the supine posture (lying on one’s back on the ground or other surface) is an important but neglected issue related to human posture. Chimpanzee and other nonhuman primate infants are not stable when they are laid on their backs. Human infants are exceptional among primates in this respect; they can assume a stable supine posture and will lie quietly on their back. The stable supine posture gives a firm foundation for face-to-face communication, vocal exchange, and also tool use. This article provides the evolutionary scenario of sociocognitive development that is unique to humans. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Animals commonly use feature and spatial strategies when remembering places of interest such as food sources or hiding places. We conducted three experiments with great apes to investigate strategy preferences and factors that may shape them. In the first experiment, we trained 17 apes to remember 12 different food locations on the floor of their sleeping room. The 12 food locations were associated with one feature cue, so that feature and spatial cues were confounded. In a single test session, we brought the cues into conflict and found that apes, irrespective of species, showed a preference for a feature strategy. In the second experiment, we used a similar procedure and trained 25 apes to remember one food location on a platform in front of them. On average, apes preferred to use a feature strategy but some individuals relied on a spatial strategy. In the final experiment, we investigated whether training might influence strategy preferences. We tested 21 apes in the platform set-up and found that apes used both, feature and spatial strategies irrespective of training. We conclude that apes can use feature and spatial strategies to remember the location of hidden food items, but that task demands (e.g. different numbers of search locations) can influence strategy preferences. We found no evidence, however, for the role of training in shaping these preferences. © The Author(s) 2009.

ABSTRACT: Because of their close evolutionary relationship to humans, chimpanzees generate considerable interest in the scientific and lay communities alike. In this contribution, I summarize the recent findings derived from long-term research on the behavior of wild chimpanzees. After outlining selected aspects of the natural history of chimpanzees, including their ecology, social organization, and life history, I review our current understanding of two major aspects of chimpanzee behavior: female competition and male cooperation. This review indicates that female chimpanzees compete for food, space, and reproduction, while male chimpanzees cooperate in several contexts, involving coalitions, meat sharing, and group territoriality. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Attacks on humans by nonhuman primates are one of the most serious causes of human-primate conflict, and strongly influence people's perceptions and tolerance of nonhuman primates. Despite their importance, systematic and extensive records of such attacks are rare. Here, we report the attacks that occurred on local persons by chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) at Bossou, Republic of Guinea, from 1995 to 2009. There have been a total of 11 attacks during this period, the majority of which were directed toward children. They varied in their severity, but all were nonfatal. Attacks took place on a road and narrow paths that bordered the forest or in cultivated fields and orchards where opportunities for human-chimpanzee contact are high. Attacks occurred between the months of March and October, coinciding with wild fruit scarcity, increased levels of crop-raiding, and periods of human cultivation with likely increased human usage of paths. Although the families of attack victims felt angry and fearful toward chimpanzees after attacks, some drew on their traditional beliefs to explain why chimpanzees were respected, protected, and could not hurt them, even when attacks occurred. We provide suggestions for reducing future nonhuman primate attacks on humans in an effort to mitigate human-primate conflict situations. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

ABSTRACT: We investigated the evolutionary origin of other-regarding preferences, one of the strong underlying motivations for altruism, in the chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes. Although altruism is expected theoretically to be kin biased and frequent in a reciprocal context, few experimental studies to date have specifically tested these hypotheses from the viewpoint of proximate mechanisms. We examined the other-regarding preferences of individuals in mother-offspring pairs and in nonkin adult pairs in both reciprocal and nonreciprocal contexts. Based on the previously established choice paradigm with mutually or selfishly beneficial options, we developed a novel task using buttons. In experiment 1, chimpanzee participants involving three mother-offspring pairs were offered two options: delivering food rewards to their partner and themselves or only to themselves. We compared their choices between partner-present and partner-absent conditions. In experiment 2, we developed a reciprocal context in which the two participants alternately chose the two options. In contrast to the theoretical predictions, the chimpanzees did not show any prosocial tendencies even between mother and offspring or in a reciprocal context. We propose that the experimental set-up which prevented direct interactions between the participants might have influenced these results. In conclusion, the present study suggests that voluntary and/or strategic other-rewarding behaviour arose in humans after divergence from the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: A grandmother hypothesis may explain why humans evolved greater longevity while continuing to end female fertility at about the same age as do the other great apes. With that grandmother hypothesis in mind, we sought to compare age-specific mortality and fertility rates between humans and chimpanzees, our closest living relatives, and found two puzzles. First, we expected that lower adult mortality in humans would be associated with slower senescence, but the rate of chimpanzee demographic aging falls within the human range. Second, we expected declines in age-specific fertility to be similar in the two species but instead of falling in the thirties as it does in women, fertility remains high into the forties in some chimpanzee populations. We report these puzzles using data from nine human populations and both wild and captive chimpanzees, and suggest that systematic differences in the heterogeneity of surviving adults may explain them. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Several species of nonhuman primates respond negatively to inequitable outcomes, a trait shared with humans. Despite previous research, questions regarding the response to inequity remain. In this study, we replicated the methodology from previous studies to address four questions related to inequity. First, we explored the impact of basic social factors. Second, we addressed whether negative responses to inequity require a task, or exist when rewards are given for 'free'. Third, we addressed whether differences in the experimental procedure or the level of effort required to obtain a reward affected responses. Finally, we explored the interaction between 'individual' expectations (based on one's own previous experience) and 'social' expectations (based on the partner's experience). These questions were investigated in 16 socially housed adult chimpanzees using eight conditions that varied across the dimensions of reward, effort and procedure. Subjects did respond to inequity, but only in the context of a task. Differences in procedure and level of effort required did not cause individuals to change their behaviour. Males were more sensitive to social than to individual expectation, while females were more sensitive to individual expectation. Finally, subjects also increased refusals when they received a better reward than their partner, which has not been documented previously. These results indicate that chimpanzees are more sensitive to reward inequity than procedures, and that there is interaction between social and individual expectations that depends upon social factors. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: Self-directed behaviours (SDBs) are said to be indicative of negative emotions. The present study focused on chimpanzees' SDBs during cognitive experiments in order to investigate how each chimpanzee reacted to his or her errors and to changes in task difficulty. We recorded and analysed the behaviour of six chimpanzees during cognitive experiments at the Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University, in Japan. We compared the rate of SDBs after correct trials versus incorrect trials, and in easy tasks versus difficult tasks. Our results suggest that the chimpanzees' reactions to making an error and the degree of difficulty of the task varied depending on the individual. Three out of the six chimpanzees exhibited higher rates of SDBs after incorrect trials than after correct trials, and in difficult tasks than in easy tasks whilst the other three did not. This finding suggests that chimpanzees may differ in the degree to which they exhibit internal conflict and we should carefully assess subjective evaluations of task situations; taking these differences into consideration when conducting experimental research in chimpanzees. © 2010 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare.

ABSTRACT: Background: Chimpanzees have been widely used in hepatitis C virus (HCV) research, but their endangered status and high financial and ethical costs have prompted a closer review. Methods: One hundred and nine articles published in 1998-2007 were analyzed for the number of chimpanzees involved, experimental procedures, objectives and other relevant issues. Results: The articles described the use of 852 chimpanzees, but accounting for likely multiple uses, the number of individual chimpanzees involved here is estimated to be approximately 500. Most articles addressed immunology and inoculation studies. A significant portion of studies lasted for several months or years. Approximately one half of the individual chimpanzees were each used in 2-10 studies. Conclusions: Significant financial and scientific resources have been expended in these chimpanzee HCV studies. Discussion addresses troublesome questions presented by some of the reviewed articles, including statistical validity, repeatability, and biological relevance of this model. These concerns merit attention as future approaches to HCV research and research priorities are considered. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

ABSTRACT: Compared to our closest living and extinct relatives, humans have a large, specialized, and complex brain embedded in a uniquely shaped braincase. Here, we quantitatively compare endocranial shape changes during ontogeny in humans and chimpanzees. Identifying shared and unique aspects in developmental patterns of these two species can help us to understand brain evolution in the hominin lineage.Using CT scans of 58 humans and 60 chimpanzees varying in age from birth to adulthood, we generated virtual endocasts to measure and analyze 29 three-dimensional endocranial landmarks and several hundred semilandmarks on curves and the endocranial surface; these data were then analyzed using geometric morphometric methods.The ontogenetic shape trajectories are nonlinear for both species, which indicates several developmental phases. Endocranial shape is already distinct at birth and there is no overlap between the two species throughout ontogeny. While some aspects of the pattern of endocranial shape change are shared between humans and chimpanzees, the shape trajectories differ substantially directly after birth until the eruption of the deciduous dentition: in humans but not in chimpanzees, the parietal and cerebellar regions expand relatively (contributing to neurocranial globularity) and the cranial base flexes within the first postnatal year when brain growth rates are high. We show that the shape changes associated with this early "globularization phase" are unique to humans and do not occur in chimpanzees before or after birth. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: It is assumed that spatial memory contributes crucially to animal cognition since animals' habitats entail a large number of dispersed and unpredictable food sources. Spatial memory has been investigated under controlled conditions, with different species showing and different conditions leading to varying performance levels. However, the number of food sources investigated is very low compared to what exists under natural conditions, where food resources are so abundant that it is difficult to precisely identify what is available. By using a detailed botanical map containing over 12,499 trees known to be used by the Taï chimpanzees, we created virtual maps of all productive fruit trees to simulate potential strategies used by wild chimpanzees to reach resources without spatial memory. First, we simulated different assumptions concerning the chimpanzees' preference for a particular tree species, and, second, we varied the detection field to control for the possible use of smell to detect fruiting trees. For all these assumptions, we compared simulated distance travelled, frequencies of trees visited, and revisit rates with what we actually observed in wild chimpanzees. Our results show that chimpanzees visit rare tree species more frequently, travel shorter distances to reach them, and revisit the same trees more often than if they had no spatial memory. In addition, we demonstrate that chimpanzees travel longer distances to reach resources where they will eat for longer periods of time, and revisit resources more frequently where they ate for a long period of time during their first visit. Therefore, this study shows that forest chimpanzees possess a precise spatial memory which allows them to remember the location of numerous resources and use this information to select the most attractive resources. ©The Author(s) 2009.

ABSTRACT: Although many studies have shown that nonhuman animals can choose the larger of two discrete quantities of items, less emphasis has been given to discrimination of continuous quantity. These studies are necessary to discern the similarities and differences in discrimination performance as a function of the type of quantities that are compared. Chimpanzees made judgments between continuous quantities (liquids) in a series of three experiments. In the first experiment, chimpanzees first chose between two clear containers holding differing amounts of juice. Next, they watched as two liquid quantities were dispensed from opaque syringes held above opaque containers. In the second experiment, one liquid amount was presented by pouring it into an opaque container from an opaque syringe, whereas the other quantity was visible the entire time in a clear container. In the third experiment, the heights at which the opaque syringes were held above opaque containers differed for each set, so that sometimes sets with smaller amounts of juice were dropped from a greater height, providing a possible visual illusion as to the total amount. Chimpanzees succeeded in all tasks and showed many similarities in their continuous quantity estimation to how they performed previously in similar tasks with discrete quantities (for example, performance was constrained by the ratio between sets). Chimpanzees could compare visible sets to nonvisible sets, and they were not distracted by perceptual illusions created through various presentation styles that were not relevant to the actual amount of juice dispensed. This performance demonstrated a similarity in the quantitative discrimination skills of chimpanzees for continuous quantities that matches that previously shown for discrete quantities. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: Population and group-specific behavioral differences have been taken as evidence for animal cultures [1-10], a notion that remains controversial. Skeptics argue that ecological or genetic factors, rather than social learning, provide a more parsimonious explanation [11-14]. Work with captive chimpanzees has addressed this criticism by showing that experimentally created traditions can be transmitted through social learning [15-17]. Recent fieldwork further suggests that ecological and genetic factors are insufficient to explain the behavioral differences seen between communities, but the data are only observational [18, 19]. Here, we present the results of a field experiment [20, 21] that compared the performance of chimpanzees (P. t. schweinfurthii) from two Ugandan communities, Kanyawara and Sonso, on an identical task in the physical domain-extracting honey from holes drilled into horizontal logs. Kanyawara chimpanzees, who occasionally use sticks to acquire honey [4], spontaneously manufactured sticks to extract the experimentally provided honey. In contrast, Sonso chimpanzees, who possess a considerable leaf technology but no food-related stick use [4, 22], relied on their fingers, but some also produced leaf sponges to access the honey. Our results indicate that, when genetic and environmental factors are controlled, wild chimpanzees rely on their cultural knowledge to solve a novel task. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: It has been proposed that exploitation of underground storage organs (USOs) played an important role in the evolution of the genus Homo, these items serving as 'fallback foods' during periods of low food availability. The use of USOs as food by wild chimpanzees is infrequent and seen mostly in populations inhabiting relatively arid environments, such as the savanna. Here, we specifically test the hypothesis that chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) inhabiting tropical wet forest at Bossou (Republic of Guinea, West Africa) exploit USOs as a fallback food during periods of fruit scarcity. Chimpanzees were never observed feeding on wild USOs, that is, those that were never cultivated, and rarely on other underground plant parts. However, direct observations revealed regular consumption of the USOs of cultivated cassava (Manihot esculenta), a spatially abundant and continuously available plant, although the chimpanzees did not use tools when acquiring and feeding on cassava. In agreement with the fallback foods hypothesis, our results show that chimpanzees exploited cassava USOs more frequently when both wild and cultivated fruits were scarce, and consumption patterns of cassava paralleled those of wild fallback foods. These seasonal extractive USO foraging strategies by chimpanzees can strengthen attempts to construct a clearer picture of the importance of USO feeding in hominoid evolution. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees are well known for their territorial behavior. Males who belong to the same community routinely patrol their territories, occasionally making deep incursions into those of their neighbors. Male chimpanzees may obtain several fitness benefits by participating in territorial boundary patrols, but patrolling is also likely to involve fitness costs. Patrollers risk injury or even death, and patrols may be energetically costly and may involve opportunity costs. Although territorial patrols have been reported at all long-term chimpanzee study sites, quantitative data on their energetic costs have not previously been available. I evaluated the energy costs of patrolling for male chimpanzees at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda during 14 months of observation. In 29 patrols and matched control periods, I recorded the distances covered and time spent traveling and feeding by chimpanzees. I found that male chimpanzees covered longer distances, spent more time traveling, and spent less time feeding during patrols than during control periods. These results support the hypothesis that chimpanzees incur energetic costs while patrolling and suggest that ecological factors may constrain the ability of chimpanzees to patrol. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Genetic variation in the human serotonin system has long-been studied because of its functional consequences and links to various behavior-related disorders and it being routinely targeted in research and development for drug therapy. However, aside from clinical studies, little is known about this genetic diversity and how it differs within and between human populations with respect to haplotype structure, which can greatly impact phenotype association studies. In addition, no evolutionary approach among humans and other primates has examined how long-and short-term selective pressures explain existing serotonin variation. Here, we examine DNA sequence variation in natural population samples of 192 human and 40 chimpanzee chromosome sequences for the most commonly implicated ∼38-kb serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) and ∼63-kb serotonin 2A receptor (HTR2A) genes. Our comparative population genetic analyses find significant linkage disequilibrium associated with functionally relevant variants in humans, as well as geographic variation for these haplotypes, at both loci. In addition, although amino acid divergence is consistent with purifying selection, promoter and untranslated regions exhibit significantly high divergence in both species lineages. These evolutionary analyses imply that the serotonin system may have accumulated significant regulatory variation over both recent and ancient periods of time in both humans and chimpanzees. We discuss the implications of this variation for disease association studies and for the evolution of behavior-related phenotypes during the divergence of humans and our closest primate relatives. © The Author 2010.

ABSTRACT: In humans, great apes, and different monkey species, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II DRB region is known to display considerable copy number variation. The microsatellite D6S2878 has been shown to be a valuable marker for haplotyping the DR region in humans and macaque species. The present report illustrates that chimpanzee haplotypes also can be discriminated with this marker. The analyses resulted in the description of nine different region configurations, of which seven are present within the West African chimpanzee population studied. The region configurations vary in gene content from two up to five DRB genes. Subsequent cDNA sequencing increased the number of known full-length Patr-DRB sequences from 3 to 32, and shows that one to three Patr-DRB genes per haplotype apparently produce functional transcripts. This is more or less comparable to humans and rhesus macaques. Moreover, microsatellite analysis in concert with full-length DRB gene sequencing showed that the Patr-DRB*W9 and -DRB3*01/02 lineages most likely arose from a common ancestral lineage: hence, the Patr-DRB*W9 lineage was renamed to Patr-DRB3*07. Overall, the data demonstrate that the D6S2878 microsatellite marker allows fast and accurate haplotyping of the Patr-DRB region. In addition, the limited amount of allelic variation observed at the various Patr-DRB genes is in agreement with the fact that chimpanzees experienced a selective sweep that may have been caused by an ancient retroviral infection. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: An adult female chimpanzee showed responding through use of exclusion in an auditory to visual matching-to-sample procedure. The chimpanzee had previously learned to associate specific visuographic symbols called lexigrams with real world referents and the spoken English words and photographs for those referents. On some trials, an unknown spoken English word was presented as the sample, and the match choices could consist of photographs or lexigrams that already were associated with known English words as well as unknown lexigrams or photos of objects without associated lexigrams. The chimpanzee reliably avoided choosing known comparisons for these unknown samples, instead relying on exclusion to choose comparisons that were of unknown lexigrams or photographs of items without associated lexigram symbols. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: To understand the mechanical effects of different modes of locomotion on the femoral neck of chimpanzees, we investigated the cross-sectional morphology of the femoral neck of 4 chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) collected from the Mahale Mountains, Tanzania. We performed serial computed tomography (CT) scans of the neck from the femoral head to the base of the neck perpendicular to the long axis of the neck. We measured the cortical thickness of the serial 5 cross sections of the neck region every 45° around the circumference, i. e., 8 points per section, and examined the cross-sectional properties of the mid-section. When we compared the superior and inferior parts of the cortical thickness of the femoral neck, the inferior part exhibited the greatest cortical thickness whereas the superior part had the smallest values in every specimen. Researchers have also observed such regional differences between superior and inferior cortical thicknesses in bipedal humans and other primates, although these differences are not as large in the chimpanzee as in bipedal hominini. The present study differed from the past study on hominini and chimpanzees in that the superior anterior (SA) part exhibited greater cortical thickness in chimpanzees. We believe these observations reflect the structural strengthening of parts of the chimpanzee femoral neck that is needed to accommodate the mechanical loads imposed by arboreal vertical climbing and terrestrial quadrupedal and bipedal locomotion. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.

ABSTRACT: Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) originated in chimpanzees; yet, several previous studies have shown that primary HIV-1 isolates replicate poorly in chimpanzee CD4+ T lymphocytes in vitro and in vivo. The reasons for this apparent restriction are not understood. Here, we describe a new activation protocol that led to a reproducible expansion and activation of chimpanzee CD4+ T lymphocytes in vitro. Using this protocol, we uncovered species-specific differences in the activation profiles of human and chimpanzee CD4+ T-cells, including HLA-DR and CD62L. Moreover, we found that improved activation facilitated the replication of both CXCR4 and CCR5-tropic HIV-1 in CD4+ T-cell cultures from over 30 different chimpanzees. Thus, the previously reported "replication block" of CCR5-tropic HIV-1 in chimpanzee lymphocytes appears to be due, at least in large part, to suboptimal T-cell activation. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Background: While wild chimpanzees are experiencing drastic population declines, their numbers at African rescue and rehabilitation projects are growing rapidly. Chimpanzees follow complex routes to these refuges; and their geographic origins are often unclear. Identifying areas where hunting occurs can help law enforcement authorities focus scarce resources for wildlife protection planning. Efficiently focusing these resources is particularly important in Cameroon because this country is a key transportation waypoint for international wildlife crime syndicates. Furthermore, Cameroon is home to two chimpanzee subspecies, which makes ascertaining the origins of these chimpanzees important for reintroduction planning and for scientific investigations involving these chimpanzees.Results: We estimated geographic origins of 46 chimpanzees from the Limbe Wildlife Centre (LWC) in Cameroon. Using Bayesian approximation methods, we determined their origins using mtDNA sequences and microsatellite (STRP) genotypes compared to a spatial map of georeferenced chimpanzee samples from 10 locations spanning Cameroon and Nigeria. The LWC chimpanzees come from multiple regions of Cameroon or forested areas straddling the Cameroon-Nigeria border. The LWC chimpanzees were partitioned further as originating from one of three biogeographically important zones occurring in Cameroon, but we were unable to refine these origin estimates to more specific areas within these three zones.Conclusions: Our findings suggest that chimpanzee hunting is widespread across Cameroon. Live animal smuggling appears to occur locally within Cameroon, despite the existence of local wildlife cartels that operate internationally. This pattern varies from the illegal wildlife trade patterns observed in other commercially valuable species, such as elephants, where specific populations are targeted for exploitation. A broader sample of rescued chimpanzees compared against a more comprehensive grid of georeferenced samples may reveal 'hotspots' of chimpanzee hunting and live animal transport routes in Cameroon. These results illustrate also that clarifying the origins of refuge chimpanzees is an important tool for designing reintroduction programs. Finally, chimpanzees at refuges are frequently used in scientific investigations, such as studies investigating the history of zoonotic diseases. Our results provide important new information for interpreting these studies within a precise geographical framework. © 2010 Ghobrial et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Many studies have shown that apes and monkeys are adept at cross-modal matching tasks requiring the subject to identify objects in one modality when information regarding those objects has been presented in a different modality. However, much less is known about non-human primates' production of multimodal signaling in communicative contexts. Here, we present evidence from a study of 110 chimpanzees demonstrating that they select the modality of communication in accordance with variations in the attentional focus of a human interactant, which is consistent with previous research. In each trial, we presented desirable food to one of two chimpanzees, turning mid-way through the trial from facing one chimpanzee to facing the other chimpanzee, and documented their communicative displays, as the experimenter turned towards or away from the subjects. These chimpanzees varied their signals within a context-appropriate modality, displaying a range of different visual signals when a human experimenter was facing them and a range of different auditory or tactile (attention-getting) signals when the human was facing away from them; this finding extends previous research on multimodal signaling in this species. Thus, in the impoverished circumstances characteristic of captivity, complex signaling tactics are nevertheless exhibited by chimpanzees, suggesting continuity in intersubjective psychological processes in humans and apes. © Springer-Verlag 2009.

ABSTRACT: Eight forelimbs of three orangutans and four chimpanzees were dissected and the muscle mass, fascicle length and physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) of all forelimb muscles were systematically recorded to explore possible interspecies variation in muscle dimensions. Muscle mass and PCSA were divided by the total mass and total PCSA of the entire forelimb muscles for normalization. The results indicate that the mass and PCSA ratios of the monoarticular elbow flexors (M. brachialis and M. brachioradialis) are significantly larger in orangutans. In contrast, the mass ratios of the biarticular muscles in the upper arm (the short head of M. biceps brachii and the long head of M. triceps brachii) are significantly larger in chimpanzees. For the rotator cuff muscles, the force-generating capacity of M. subscapularis is significantly larger in orangutans, whereas the opposite rotator cuff muscle, M. infraspinatus, is larger in chimpanzees. These differences in forelimb muscle dimensions of the two species may reflect functional specialization for their different positional and locomotor behaviors. © 2009 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The liver is the primary site of hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication. Therefore, we undertook detailed intrahepatic studies of T-cell dynamics, apoptosis, and gene expression during the acute phase of infection using liver biopsies from chimpanzees that developed persistent infection or spontaneously cleared the virus. We examined more than 40 liver biopsies histologically and quantitatively for T-cell infiltration, hepatocyte apoptosis and perforin expression. These data were correlated with outcome and viral kinetics. We observed intrahepatic T-cell infiltration in both groups of animals with CD8+ T cells representing the major population. The appearance of T cells was always associated with apoptosis and mild alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations. Apoptosis (5-20% of hepatocytes) always occurred prior to serum ALT peak. Quantification of intrahepatic ALT mRNA revealed no upregulation of gene expression confirming that serum ALT increases were due to release of this enzyme from cells. During the late acute phase, cleared animals showed an increased frequency of hepatocyte apoptosis relative to persistently infected animals (P < 0.05). This correlated with a higher intrahepatic CD8 + T-cell frequency in the cleared group (P < 0.01) with a greater proportion of lymphocytes expressing perforin compared with the persistent group (P < 0.001). All infected animals mounted intrahepatic immune responses during the acute phase, but these were not maintained in frequency or efficacy in persistent infections. There is a reduction in the numbers of intrahepatic T cells during the late acute phase in infections that become persistent with significantly fewer of these cells functional in clearing the virus by killing infected hepatocytes. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Although several animal species exhibit some form of tool use (Shumaker et al., 2011), there are relatively few animals which flexibly use a diverse repertoire of implements on a regular basis within their natural environments. As shown in this volume, hominins, chimpanzees, orangutans, some capuchins and corvids are the exceptions. Van Schaik et al. (1999) have suggested that the evolution of material culture in primates is dependent upon the intersection of four primary factors: manipulative skills, cognitive abilities, suitable ecological niches and social tolerance. Although one cannot entirely dismiss the possibility of differences in manipulative skills and cognitive abilities within species, there are intriguing differences in diversity and types of tool use among populations of wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) which are not entirely explicable by environmental circumstances, and so have been attributed to social influences (Whiten et al., 1999, 2001; Möbius et al., 2008). With the exception of a few developmental studies, the social context of tool use remains largely unexplored in these apes. Primates show differing degrees of social cohesion, and varying responses to fluctuations in the availability of resources in their environment. The abundance and distribution of important food resources dictates not only population density, but also social tolerance. Social tolerance varies across species, but may also differ within species (among populations, groups and even individuals). Resource scarcity may incite feeding competition among conspecifics, which could cause primates to avoid spending time in close proximity, whereas bountiful resources may attract conspecifics to forage at the same site. Social tolerance in gregarious foraging could enhance social learning by allowing primates to forage in close proximity to each other, providing a relaxed social atmosphere in which attention may be focused on a task, and enabling subordinate individuals to participate in close proximity foraging without risk of theft or aggression by conspecifics (van Schaik, 2003). The “opportunities for social learning hypothesis” predicts that higher degrees of social tolerance should result in a larger number of customary technical skills exhibited by primates (van Schaik, 2003). An extension of the opportunities for social learning hypothesis is that higher degrees of social tolerance could be associated with the transmission of more complex tool behaviors. Pradhan et al. (2012) have proposed that variation in sociability accounts for intraspecific and interspecific differences in the simple and cumulative technology of chimpanzees and orangutans. © Cambridge University Press 2013.

ABSTRACT: Wild chimpanzees can be dangerously violent against individuals that do not belong to their community, indicating a strong selection pressure on decision-making abilities in this context. The presence of a neighbouring male indicates a serious threat, although encountering an unfamiliar male is potentially even more dangerous because it indicates the arrival of a new group with whom the subjects have no previous history of interaction. We conducted playback experiments with members of three chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes verus, communities in the Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire, in which we simulated the unexpected presence of another chimpanzee. We tested subjects' responses to pant hoots of familiar group members, neighbouring individuals and unfamiliar strangers. We found that neighbours and strangers elicited a wider range of gestural signals than familiar group members. Vocal responses were common in all conditions. Familiar group members mainly triggered pant hoot replies, whereas neighbour and stranger trials caused screams. Across conditions, males responded more strongly than females. Male party size had an effect on subjects' vocal responses to strangers but not to neighbours, although neighbours were approached more closely. Our results show that chimpanzees are able to identify different classes of individuals by their pant hoot vocalizations, as judged by their differential responses to the calls of familiar group members, neighbours or strangers. The overall response patterns suggest that chimpanzees are aware of the different social consequences associated with encountering a neighbouring group or a group of strangers. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: In transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) pathogenesis the cellular prion protein (PrPC) is converted into its pathogenic PrPSc isoform. Prion protein gene (Prnp) deficient mice (PrP0/0) are resistant to PrPSc infection, but following reconstitution of Prnp they regain their susceptibility to infection. Therefore, it is challenging to simulate this natural situation in a cell culture model. We have previously reported the inducible stable expression of a human PrPC in murine 3T3 cells. In this study, we used murine PrP0/0 cells stably expressing exemplarily the chimpanzee Prnp under the control of inducible tetracycline (Tet) system. The Prnp was integrated using a lentiviral vector. Its expression in the engineered PrP0/0Chimp1/Tet-Off cell line was analyzed by Western blot (Wb) and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses. PrPC was partially purified by using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). Compared to all the other cell systems which possess an endogenous PrPC expression, here described cell line contains only an overexpressing species specific PrPC expression which is tightly regulated and can be turned-off at any time without showing any endogenous host PrPC expression. Consequently, a contamination of the isolated PrPC is impossible. This cell line potentially offers a new tool for simulation of mice bioassays widely used in TSE infection studies. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Two kinds of evidence suggest that female fertility may end at an earlier age in modern people than in ancestral populations or in our closest living relatives, chimpanzees. We investigate both to see whether fertility schedules or ovarian follicle counts falsify the alternative hypothesis that the age of terminal fertility changed little in the human lineage while greater longevity evolved due to grandmother effects. We use 19th century Utah women to represent non-contracepting humans, and compare their fertility by age with published records for wild chimpanzees. Then we revisit published counts of ovarian follicular stocks in both species. Results show wide individual variation in age at last birth and oocyte stocks in both humans and chimpanzees. This heterogeneity, combined with interspecific differences in adult mortality, has large and opposing effects on fertility schedules. Neither realized fertility nor rates of follicular atresia stand as evidence against the hypothesis that ages at last birth changed little while greater longevity evolved in our lineage. © 2010 New York Academy of Sciences.

ABSTRACT: It has been shown that humans prefer consonant sounds from the early stages of development. From a comparative psychological perspective, although previous studies have shown that birds and monkeys can discriminate between consonant and dissonant sounds, it remains unclear whether nonhumans have a spontaneous preference for consonant music over dissonant music as humans do. We report here that a five-month-old human-raised chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) preferred consonant music. The infant chimpanzee consistently preferred to produce, with the aid of our computerized setup, consonant versions of music for a longer duration than dissonant versions. This result suggests that the preference for consonance is not unique to humans. Further, it supports the hypothesis that one major basis of musical appreciation has some evolutionary origins. © Japan Monkey Centre and Springer 2009.

ABSTRACT: The CC is the major white matter tract connecting the cerebral hemispheres and provides for interhemispheric integration of sensory, motor and higher-order cognitive information. The midsagittal area of the CC has been frequently used as a marker of brain development in humans. We report the first investigation into the development of the corpus callosum and its regional subdivisions in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Magnetic resonance images were collected from 104 chimpanzees (female n=63, male n=41) ranging in age from 6 years (pre-pubescent period) to 54 years (old age). Sustained linear growth was observed in the area of the CC subdivision of the genu; areas of the posterior midbody and anterior midbody displayed nonlinear growth during development. After adjusting for total brain size, we observed linear growth trajectories of the total CC and CC subdivisions of the genu, posterior midbody, isthmus and splenium, and nonlinear growth trajectories of the rostral body and anterior midbody. These developmental patterns are similar to the development of the CC in humans. As the growth curves of the CC mirrors growth seen in the percentage of white matter in humans, our results suggest chimpanzees show continued white matter development in regions related to cognitive development. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The two species of Pan, bonobos and common chimpanzees, have been reported to have different social organization, cognitive and linguistic abilities and motor skill, despite their close biological relationship. Here, we examined whether bonobos and chimpanzee differ in selected brain regions that may map to these different social and cognitive abilities. Eight chimpanzees and eight bonobos matched on age, sex and rearing experiences were magnetic resonance images scanned and volumetric measures were obtained for the whole brain, cerebellum, striatum, motor-hand area, hippocampus, inferior frontal gyrus and planum temporale. Chimpanzees had significantly larger cerebellum and borderline significantly larger hippocampus and putamen, after adjusting for brain size, compared with bonobos. Bonobos showed greater leftward asymmetries in the striatum and motor-hand area compared with chimpanzees. No significant differences in either the volume or lateralization for the so-called language homologs were found between species. The results suggest that the two species of Pan are quite similar neurologically, though some volumetric and lateralized differences may reflect inherent differences in social organization, cognition and motor skills. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The degree to which non-human primate behavior is lateralized, at either individual or population levels, remains controversial. We investigated the relationship between hand preference and posture during tool use in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) during bipedal tool use. We experimentally induced tool use in a supported bipedal posture, an unsupported bipedal posture, and a seated posture. Neither bipedal tool use nor these supported conditions have been previously evaluated in apes. The hypotheses tested were 1) bipedal posture will increase the strength of hand preference, and 2) a bipedal stance, without the use of one hand for support, will elicit a right hand preference. Results supported the first, but not the second hypothesis: bipedalism induced the subjects to become more lateralized, but not in any particular direction. Instead, it appears that subtle pre-existing lateral biases, to either the right or left, were emphasized with increasing postural demands. This result has interesting implications for theories of the evolution of tool use and bipedalism, as the combination of bipedalism and tool use may have helped drive extreme lateralization in modern humans, but cannot alone account for the preponderance of right-handedness. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among captive chimpanzees. The most prevalent form of cardiovascular disease among chimpanzees is sudden cardiac death. Myocardial fibrosis was the only significant pathologic lesion observed in affected animals at necropsy. We previously showed an association between myocardial fibrosis and sudden cardiac death. The presumed pathogenesis was interstitial myocardial fibrosis that led to decreased myocardial contractility and interrupted signal propagation in the heart, leading to fibrillation and resulting in sudden cardiac death. In this pilot study, we assayed 5 biomarkers of collagen types I and HI metabolism and fibrogenesis and studied their association with CVD in chimpanzees. The biomarker MMP1 did not crossreact in chimpanzee sera and could not be studied further. Two biomarkers (TIMP1 and PINP) and their difference showed no significant association with CVD in chimpanzees. The biomarkers ICTP and PIIINP were significantly increased in cases of CVD with concurrent renal disease. Furthermore, both biomarkers showed a significant trend to increase with disease severity. We conclude that ICTP and PIIINP warrant further study for antemortem detection of renal and myocardial fibrosis in chimpanzees.

ABSTRACT: Background: Recent studies in non-human primates have led to the discovery of novel primate herpesviruses. In order to get more information on herpesvirus infections in apes, we studied wild born captive chimpanzees. Methods: Chimpanzees of the Ngamba island sanctuary, Uganda, were analyzed with pan-herpes polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the herpesvirus DNA polymerase gene and the glycoprotein B gene. The obtained sequences were connected by long-distance PCR, and analyzed phylogenetically. Results: Twenty-one of 40 individuals were infected with members of the Gammaherpesvirinae, two of them with a novel member of this subfamily. Phylogenetically, the novel virus fell into a clade of primate rhadinoviruses and the Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (human herpesvirus 8), representing a third distinct rhadinovirus in chimpanzees. Conclusion: Non-human primates harbor several herpesviruses many of which are still unknown. This has implications to management of primates in sanctuaries requiring continuous updates on the management protocols to deal with potential occupational pathogens. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees and gorillas are the closest relatives of humans living on the Earth. Due to this fact they are susceptible to most of human infectious diseases, but the outcome of infection is often very different than in humans. Chimpanzees can be infected with the HIV virus, but they never develop the actual disease. Opposite situation happens with some other human viral diseases. Common Flu, Metapneumovirus or Respiratory Syncytial Virus, which in post-infant humans are rarely considered the serious diseases, have been recorded to be fatal when transmitted to Great Apes. In various countries in Africa researchers have witnessed numerous outbreaks of infectious, mostly respiratory diseases in ape communities, which could be traced back to humans as the source. Often most of the ape group would be affected with mortality reaching over 20%. Gorillas in Rwanda are visited daily by the KARISOKE research team and by the trackers and tourists, which on average adds up to 2000 human visits to each gorilla per year. The numbers of respiratory cases monitored/treated by the Mountain Gorilla Veterinary Program team are at the very top on the list of the infectious diseases affecting gorillas in Virunga NP. According to the field experience from 3 East African countries, researchers can play positive or negative, but always significant role in following the preventive visitation rules themselves and assisting the National Park offices in doing the same for the tourist visits. © 2009 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The chimpanzee is the only animal model for investigating the pathogenesis of viral hepatitis types A through E in humans. Studies of the host response, including microarray analyses, have relied on the close relationship between these two primate species: chimpanzee samples are commonly tested with human-based reagents. In this study, the host responses to two dissimilar viruses, hepatitis E virus (HEV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), were compared in multiple experimentally infected chimpanzees. Affymetrix U133 + 2.0 human microarray chips were used to assess the entire transcriptome in serial liver biopsies obtained over the course of the infections. Respecting the limitations of microarray probes designed for human target transcripts to effectively assay chimpanzee transcripts, we conducted probe-level analysis of the microarray data in conjunction with a custom mapping of the probe sequences to the most recent human and chimpanzee genome sequences. Time points for statistical comparison were chosen based on independently measured viremia levels. Regardless of the viral infection, the alignment of differentially expressed genes to the human genome sequence resulted in a larger number of genes being identified when compared with alignment to the chimpanzee genome sequence. This probably reflects the lesser refinement of gene annotation for chimpanzees. In general, the two viruses demonstrated very distinct temporal changes in host response genes, although both RNA viruses induced genes that were involved in many of the same biological systems, including interferon-induced genes. The host response to HCV infection was more robust in the magnitude and number of differentially expressed genes compared to HEV infection. Copyright © 2010, American Society for Microbiology.

ABSTRACT: Wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are renowned for their use of tools in activities ranging from foraging to social interactions. Different populations across Africa vary in their tool use repertoires, giving rise to cultural variation. We report a new type of percussive technology in food processing by chimpanzees in the Nimba Mountains, Guinea: Treculia fracturing. Chimpanzees appear to use stone and wooden "cleavers" as tools, as well as stone outcrop "anvils" as substrate to fracture the large and fibrous fruits of Treculia africana, a rare but prized food source. This newly described form of percussive technology is distinctive, as the apparent aim is not to extract an embedded food item, as is the case in nut cracking, baobab smashing, or pestle pounding, but rather to reduce a large food item to manageably sized pieces. Furthermore, these preliminary data provide the first evidence of chimpanzees using two types of percussive technology for the same purpose. © Japan Monkey Centre and Springer 2009.

ABSTRACT: Viral particles in stool samples from wild-living chimpanzees were analysed using random PCR amplification and sequencing. Sequences encoding proteins distantly related to the replicase protein of single-stranded circular DNA viruses were identified. Inverse PCR was used to amplify and sequence multiple small circular DNA viral genomes. The viral genomes were related in size and genome organization to vertebrate circoviruses and plant geminiviruses but with a different location for the stem-loop structure involved in rolling circle DNA replication. The replicase genes of these viruses were most closely related to those of the much smaller (∼1 kb) plant nanovirus circular DNA chromosomes. Because the viruses have characteristics of both animal and plant viruses, we named them chimpanzee stool-associated circular viruses (ChiSCV). Further metagenomic studies of animal samples will greatly increase our knowledge of viral diversity and evolution. © 2010 SGM.

ABSTRACT: The historical association between Plasmodium and primates has meant that many Plasmodium species have coevolved with specific primate hosts. However, unlike humans that are infected by species such as P. falciparum that cause severe malaria, many non-human primates are infected by Plasmodium species that only cause mild disease. Here we investigate whether the genomic signatures of plasmodial infection found in humans are also present in chimpanzees. We find no evidence of the major deleterious mutations at HBB (β-globin) and G6PD in chimpanzees that confer resistance to malaria caused by P. falciparum nor evidence of long-term balancing selection at these loci. Our knowledge of malaria prevalence and pathogenesis in wild chimpanzees is severely limited, but it may be the case that β-globin and G6PD variation are not adaptive in chimpanzees because malaria is rare and/or less detrimental in this species. Alternatively, chimpanzees may utilise mechanisms that are different from those of humans to protect against malaria. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: A wide variety of organisms produce actions and signals in particular temporal sequences, including the motor actions recruited during tool-mediated foraging, the arrangement of notes in the songs of birds, whales and gibbons, and the patterning of words in human speech. To accurately reproduce such events, the elements that comprise such sequences must be memorized. Both memory and artificial language learning studies have revealed at least two mechanisms for memorizing sequences, one tracking co-occurrence statistics among items in sequences (i.e., transitional probabilities) and the other one tracking the positions of items in sequences, in particular those of items in sequence-edges. The latter mechanism seems to dominate the encoding of sequences after limited exposure, and to be recruited by a wide array of grammatical phenomena. To assess whether humans differ from other species in their reliance on one mechanism over the other after limited exposure, we presented chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and human adults with brief exposure to six items, auditory sequences. Each sequence consisted of three distinct sound types (X, A, B), arranged according to two simple temporal rules: the A item always preceded the B item, and the sequence-edges were always occupied by the X item. In line with previous results with human adults, both species primarily encoded positional information from the sequences; that is, they kept track of the items that occurred in the sequence-edges. In contrast, the sensitivity to co-occurrence statistics was much weaker. Our results suggest that a mechanism to spontaneously encode positional information from sequences is present in both chimpanzees and humans and may represent the default in the absence of training and with brief exposure. As many grammatical regularities exhibit properties of this mechanism, it may be recruited by language and constrain the form that certain grammatical regularities take. © Springer-Verlag 2009.

ABSTRACT: Troglocorys cava n. g., n. sp. is described from the feces of wild eastern chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii,in Uganda. This new species has a spherical body with a frontal lobe, a long vestibulum, a cytoproct located at the posterior dorsal side of the body, an ovoid macronucleus, a contractile vacuole near the cytoproct, and a large concavity on the left surface of the body. Buccal ciliature is non-retractable and consists of three ciliary zones: an adoral zone surrounding the vestibular opening, a dorso-adoral zone extending transversely at the basis of the frontal lobe, and a vestibular zone longitudinally extending in a gently spiral curve to line the surface of the vestibulum. Two non-retractable somatic ciliary zones comprise arches over the body surface: a short dorsal ciliary arch extending transversely at the basis of the frontal lobe and a wide C-shaped left ciliary arch in the left concavity. Because of the presence of three ciliary zones in the non-retractable buccal ciliature, the present genus might be a member of the family Blepharocorythidae, but the large left concavity and the C-shaped left ciliary arch are unique, such structures have never been described from other blepharocorythids. © 2010 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Circoviruses are known to infect birds and pigs and can cause a wide range of severe symptoms with significant economic impact. Using viral metagenomics, we identified circovirus-like DNA sequences and characterized 15 circular viral DNA genomes in stool samples from humans in Pakistan, Nigeria, Tunisia, and the United States and from wild chimpanzees. Distinct genomic features and phylogenetic analysis indicate that some viral genomes were part of a previously unrecognized genus in the Circoviridae family we tentatively named "Cyclovirus" whose genetic diversity is comparable to that of all the known species in the Circovirus genus. Circoviridae detection in the stools of U.S. adults was limited to porcine circoviruses which were also found in most U.S. pork products. To determine whether the divergent cycloviruses found in non-U.S. human stools were of dietary origin, we genetically compared them to the cycloviruses in muscle tissue samples of commonly eaten farm animals in Pakistan and Nigeria. Limited genetic overlap between cycloviruses in human stool samples and local cow, goat, sheep, camel, and chicken meat samples indicated that the majority of the 25 Cyclovirus species identified might be human viruses. We show that the genetic diversity of small circular DNA viral genomes in various mammals, including humans, is significantly larger than previously recognized, and frequent exposure through meat consumption and contact with animal or human feces provides ample opportunities for cyclovirus transmission. Determining the role of cycloviruses, found in 7 to 17% of non-U.S. human stools and 3 to 55% of non-U.S. meat samples tested, in both human and animal diseases is now facilitated by knowledge of their genomes.

ABSTRACT: Background: Assessment of cerebrospinal (CSF) monoamine metabolites 5-hydroxyindoeacetic acid (5-HIAA) and homovanillic acid (HVA), and the serotonin precursor tryptophan (TRP), in chimpanzees may help in understanding the neurobiology underlying aggressive, impulsive behavior in humans and non-human primates. Methods: Two CSF samples were obtained from 11 peripubertal chimpanzees 8 months apart and were assayed for monoamine metabolite and TRP concentrations. Results: Substantial inter-individual stability was observed for 5-HIAA (n = 11; r = 0.83, P <. 0.001) and HVA (r = 0.91, P <. 0.001). Females had significantly higher concentrations of 5-HIAA compared to males (F1,8 = 7.31; P <. 0.05). Levels of 5-HIAA (r = -0.62, P <. 0.05), HVA (r = -0.86, P <. 0.001) and TRP levels (r = -0.67; P <. 0.05) decreased with age. Conclusion: Close parallels were observed between chimpanzees and humans with respect to absolute levels, sex effects, ontogeny, and 5-HIAA-HVA correlations, supporting the potential utility of the measures in understanding relationships between monoamine functioning and behavior in chimpanzees and humans. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

ABSTRACT: Mammalian females generally carry the bulk of reproductive costs. They gestate for relatively long periods of time and provide the majority of parental care for dependent offspring. For this reason, many studies have examined how females deal with the energetic costs of reproduction. Here, we examine the influence of reproductive state on activity budgets, diet quality, and sociality in free-living female chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) at Gombe National Park, Tanzania. After controlling for dominance rank, we found that pregnant and lactating females consumed higher quality foods than nonpregnant, nonlactating females. However, pregnant females also traveled less. This result did not reflect differences in sociality, as the pregnant female group sizes included in our analyses were comparable to those in other reproductive categories.

ABSTRACT: Sexual conflict has an important selective influence on mating strategies, particularly in promiscuous species such as chimpanzees. Males may coerce females to mate and aggression may inhibit female choice. The effect of male coercion on females has rarely been examined in primates. The present study focuses on male aggression towards females and the influence of male coercion on female choice in two communities of wild chimpanzees in the Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire to determine (1) whether male-to-female aggression increases in a sexual context, (2) the frequency, context and efficacy of male-female aggression and (3) the influence of male coercion on female choice. Our results suggest that direct male coercion was relatively rare, was used by less preferred males, and did not seem to function effectively to constrain female mate preferences as neither (1) a general measure of overall male-female aggression nor (2) a specific measure of direct sexual coercion corresponded to male mating success, and (3) male aggression did not correspond to increased female proceptivity or decreased female resistance rates. Lastly, variation in male-female sexual strategies appears to be yet another important realm for behavioural diversity in chimpanzees. This detailed examination of chimpanzee male-to-female aggression emphasizes the importance of carefully distinguishing male and female influences on sexual interactions in light of their disparate reproductive interests. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: Developmental studies consistently suggest that teeth are more buffered from the environment than other skeletal elements. The surprising finding of late tooth eruption in wild chimpanzees (Zihlman et al., 2004) warrants reassessment in a broader study of crown and root formation. Here we re-examine the skeletal collection of Taï Forest juvenile chimpanzees using radiography and physical examination. Several new individuals are included, along with genetic and histological assessments of questionable identities. Only half of the Taï juveniles employed by Zihlman et al. (2004) have age of death known with accuracy sufficient for precise comparisons with captive chimpanzees. One key individual in the former study, misidentified during field recovery as Xindra (age 8.3), is re-identified as Goshu (age 6.4). For crown formation we find that onset and duration greatly overlap captive chimpanzees, whereas root development may be more susceptible to acceleration in captive individuals. Kuykendall's (1996) equation relating captive tooth formation stage to age gives reasonable estimates of young wild subjects' true ages. Direct comparisons of tooth eruption ages are limited. A key 3.76 year-old individual likely possessed an emerging mandibular M1 at death (previously estimated from the maxillary molar as occurring at 4.1 years). Wild individuals appear to fall near the middle or latter half of captive eruption ranges. While minor developmental differences are apparent in some comparisons, our reanalysis does not show an " unambiguous pattern" of slower tooth formation in this wild environment. These data do not undermine recent developmental studies of the comparative life histories of fossil hominins. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Primate yawns are usually categorized according to context (e.g. as a threat, anxious, or rest yawn), but there has been little consideration of whether these yawns are best regarded as a unitary behavior that only differs with respect to the context in which it is observed. This study examined the context and precise morphology of yawns in a group of 11 captive chimpanzees. Focal video sampling was used to describe the morphology and intensity of 124 yawns using ChimpFACS, a system for coding facial movements. Two distinct forms of yawn were identified, a full yawn and a yawn which is modified by additional actions that reduce the mouth aperture. These modified yawns may indicate some degree of voluntary control over facial movement in chimpanzees and, consequently, multiple functions of yawning according to context. To assess context effects, mean activity levels (resting, locomotion, and grooming) and scratching rates were compared one minute before and after each yawn. Locomotion was significantly increased following both types of yawn, whereas scratching rates significantly increased following modified yawns but decreased following full yawns. In terms of individual differences, males did not yawn more than females, although male yawns were of higher intensity, both in the degree of mouth opening and in the amount of associated head movement. These data indicate that yawning is associated with a change in activity levels in chimpanzees, but only modified yawns may be related to increased arousal. Different types of yawn can therefore be differentiated at the morphological level as well as context level. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

ABSTRACT: How do chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, the species with the closest evolutionary connection to humans, view faces? This study is the first to use the eye-tracking method to perform direct comparisons between humans and chimpanzees with regard to face scanning. Members of both species viewed the same sets of photographs representing conspecific and nonconspecific faces under the same experimental conditions. Chimpanzees and humans showed systematic and similar patterns of face scanning, including intensely viewing main facial features (i.e. eyes, nose and mouth) and inspecting the eyes and mouth, in that order. However, several differences between the species were also evident. For example, humans were more likely to show sequential refixations on the eye regions than were chimpanzees, whereas chimpanzees were more likely to engage in quick, vertical scanning over the eyes and mouth. Such species similarities and differences were consistent across conspecific and nonconspecific faces and were thus independent of the external morphologies of species-specific faces. Furthermore, when presented with facial expressions, chimpanzees changed their scanning patterns in response to those facial actions, whereas humans maintained intense eye viewing across the expressions. Finally, we discuss how these face-scanning patterns are related to species-specific forms of facial communication in chimpanzees and humans, and suggest that both species have unique eye movement strategies for interactions with conspecifics. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: An extensive suite of isotopic data (δ13C, δ15N, and δ18O) from enamel apatite and bone collagen of adult male and female wild chimpanzees establishes baseline values for Pan troglodytes verus in a primary rainforest setting. The Ganta chimpanzee sample derives from a restricted region in northern Liberia. Diet is examined using stable light isotopes at three life stages-infant, young juvenile, and adult-and developmental differences are investigated within and between individual males and females. The isotopic data are very homogeneous with few exceptions. Juvenile females show consistent enrichment in 13C relative to infants, while juvenile males do not. These data suggest that age at weaning may be more variable for male offspring who survive to adulthood than for female offspring. Alternatively, or additionally, the weaning diet of males and females may differ, with greater consumption of technologically extracted insects and/or nuts by young females. Metabolic differences, including growth and hormone-mediated responses, may also contribute to the observed variation. The Ganta chimpanzee data offer an independent and objective line of evidence to primatologists interested in the dietary strategies of the great apes and to paleoanthropologists seeking comparative models for reconstructing early hominin subsistence patterns. Despite the high diversity of dietary items consumed by chimpanzees, isotopic signatures of chimpanzees from a primary rainforest setting exhibit narrow ranges of variation similar to chimpanzees in more open habitats. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Are pounding tools the missing link for the origins of technology? All populations of modern humans (Homo sapiens) have repertoires of tool use and tool making (e.g., Ambrose, 2001). All well-studied extant populations of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) have repertoires of tool use and tool making (e.g., McGrew, 1992, 2010; Whiten et al., 1999; Sanz et al., 2010). No other living primate has lengthier inventories of tools than humans and chimpanzees (see van Schaik et al., 2003; Ottoni & Izar, 2008; Gumert et al., 2009 for inventories of tools in Pongo pygmaeus, Cebus spp. or Macaca fascicularis). During the Early Pleistocene, populations of hominins living in East and South Africa most likely had wider tool-use repertoires than the ones we have currently identified, which are only the non-organic, that is, non-perishable ones. Thus, archaeologists are mainly left with stone tools and fossilized bones to reconstruct the tool-use repertoire of the earliest hominins (e.g., Semaw et al., 2003; Plummer, 2004). In West Africa, for at least 4300 years, chimpanzees have been using stone tools, namely hammers and anvils, to access the kernels of hard-shelled nuts (Mercader et al., 2007). Since studies began at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, and Koobi Fora, Kenya, stone tools have played a crucial role in inferring the evolution of early hominin behavior, beginning with research on the earliest stone tool industries (Leakey, 1971; Isaac, 1984). Leakey’s typological approach to the Oldowan was based on a continuous sequence of artifacts corresponding to the succession of cultures identified through the Olduvai stratigraphy. Metrics and types were applied to categorize lithics, to provide relative timelines and to make comparisons across industries/assemblages (mainly the Oldowan from Olduvai and KBS from Koobi Fora). In the 1980s lithic studies progressed, as artifacts needed to be understood and described in contexts, as they represent only one part of the hominin activity budget (Isaac, 1981). Isaac inspired a new research direction: integration of lithic studies into a paleoecological approach. This interdisciplinary approach aimed to get closer to site-formation processes and functions, and to understand ranging patterns in hominins (Isaac & Harris, 1997). Isaac (1984, 1986) also proposed an alternative terminology to describe the earliest stone assemblages. All artifacts were placed into three main categories (flaked, detached, pounded) with the aim of finding a simple alternative to terminologies based on post hoc, function-inferred labels (Leakey, 1971). © Cambridge University Press 2013.

ABSTRACT: The divergence of bonobos and three subspecies of the common chimpanzee was examined under a multipopulation isolation-with-migration (IM) model with data from 73 loci drawn from the literature. A benefit of having a full multipopulation model, relative to conducting multiple pairwise analyses between sampled populations, is that a full model can reveal historical gene flow involving ancestral populations. An example of this was found in which gene flow is indicated between the western common chimpanzee subspecies and the ancestor of the central and the eastern common chimpanzee subspecies. The results of a full analysis on all four populations are strongly consistent with analyses on pairs of populations and generally similar to results from previous studies. The basal split between bonobos and common chimpanzees was estimated at 0.93 Ma (0.68-1.54 Ma, 95% highest posterior density interval), with the split among the ancestor of three common chimpanzee populations at 0.46 Ma (0.35-0.65), and the most recent split between central and eastern common chimpanzee populations at 0.093 Ma (0.041-0.157). Population size estimates mostly fell in the range from 5,000 to 10,000 individuals. The exceptions are the size of the ancestor of the common chimpanzee and the bonobo, at 17,000 (8,000-28,000) individuals, and the central common chimpanzee and its immediate ancestor with the eastern common chimpanzee, which have effective size estimates at 27,000 (16,000-44,000) and 32,000 (19,000-54,000) individuals, respectively. © The Author 2009.

ABSTRACT: Hand-rearing of captive great ape infants is sometimes necessary but can have negative behavioral consequences. Modern hand-rearing protocols, including early integration into a diverse group of conspecifics, appear to reduce the negative consequences of hand-rearing, but the process of integration is not well studied. We investigated six potential metrics of success during the introduction of two hand-reared chimpanzee infants into a troop of nine other chimpanzees at the Maryland Zoo in Baltimore. Little aggression was observed and the infants continue to be maintained in the troop at publication. As we predicted, during the introduction the hand-reared infants showed consistent levels of stress-related behaviors, participated in affiliative interactions with all available partners, and acted, received, and mutually engaged in these interactions. Solitary behaviors by these infants were similar to a mother-reared infant in the same group. Each infant also formed a relationship with a specific female that involved nest-sharing, carrying, retrieval, and intervening to reduce risk to the infant; these relationships could be classified as allomothering because they involved maternal behavior but occupied significantly less of the infants' time than a maternal relationship. Contrary to our prediction, the hand-reared infants therefore spent significantly less time in social behavior than a mother-reared infant of the same age. In addition, the hand-reared infants continued to show strong social preferences for each other as introductions progressed and to direct a low but consistent number of nonfeeding social behaviors to humans. The successful introduction of hand-reared infants appeared to involve adding conspecific social relationships to the infants' social repertoire, but not eliminating social interactions directed at humans. © Japan Monkey Centre and Springer 2009.

ABSTRACT: Two patterns from large-scale DNA sequence data have been put forward as evidence that speciation between humans and chimpanzees was complex, involving hybridization and strong selection. First, divergence between humans and chimpanzees varies considerably across the autosomes. Second, divergence between humans and chimpanzees (but not gorillas) is markedly lower on the X chromosome. Here, we describe how simple speciation and neutral molecular evolution explain both patterns. In particular, the wide range in autosomal divergence is consistent with stochastic variation in coalescence times in the ancestral population; and the lower human-chimpanzee divergence on the X chromosome is consistent with species differences in the strength of male-biased mutation caused by differences in mating system. We also highlight two further patterns of divergence that are problematic for the complex speciation model. Our conclusions raise doubts about complex speciation between humans and chimpanzees. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: We describe chimpanzee seed dispersal in the tropical montane forest of Nyungwe National Park (NNP), Rwanda, for a total of three years from January 1998 through May 2000 and May 2006 through March 2007. Relatively few studies have examined chimpanzee seed dispersal in montane communities where there are generally fewer fruiting tree species than in lowland forests. Such studies may reveal new insights into chimpanzee seed dispersal behaviors and the role that they play in forest regeneration processes. Chimpanzees are large-bodied, highly frugivorous, and tend to deposit the seeds of both large- and small-seeded fruits they consume in a viable state. We found that chimpanzees dispersed a total of 37 fruiting species (20 families) in their feces, 35% of which were large-seeded trees (Z0.5 cm). A single large-seeded tree, Syzygium guineense, was the only species to be dispersed in both wadges and feces. Based on phenological patterns of the top five large-seeded tree species found in chimpanzee feces, our results indicate that chimpanzees do not choose fruits based on their availability. There was, however, a positive relationship between the presence of Ekebergia capensis seeds in chimpanzee feces and S. guineense seeds in chimpanzee wadges and their respective fruit availabilities. Our data reveal that proportionately fewer chimpanzee fecal samples at NNP contained seeds than that reported in two other communities in the Albertine Rift including one at mid-elevation and one in montane forest. As in other chimpanzee communities, seeds of Ficus spp. were the most common genus in NNP chimpanzee feces. Our data do not support previous studies that describe Ficus spp. as a fallback food for chimpanzees and highlights an intriguing relationship between chimpanzees and the large-seeded tree species, S. guineense. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

ABSTRACT: This paper reports on the use of an eye-tracking technique to examine how chimpanzees look at facial photographs of conspecifics. Six chimpanzees viewed a sequence of pictures presented on a monitor while their eye movements were measured by an eye tracker. The pictures presented conspecific faces with open or closed eyes in an upright or inverted orientation in a frame. The results demonstrated that chimpanzees looked at the eyes, nose, and mouth more frequently than would be expected on the basis of random scanning of faces. More specifically, they looked at the eyes longer than they looked at the nose and mouth when photographs of upright faces with open eyes were presented, suggesting that particular attention to the eyes represents a spontaneous face-scanning strategy shared among monkeys, apes, and humans. In contrast to the results obtained for upright faces with open eyes, the viewing times for the eyes, nose, and mouth of inverted faces with open eyes did not differ from one another. The viewing times for the eyes, nose, and mouth of faces with closed eyes did not differ when faces with closed eyes were presented in either an upright or inverted orientation. These results suggest the possibility that open eyes play an important role in the configural processing of faces and that chimpanzees perceive and process open and closed eyes differently. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: Phenotypic changes between species can occur when evolution shapes development. Here, we tested whether differences in the social behavior and cognition of bonobos and chimpanzees derive from shifts in their ontogeny, looking at behaviors pertaining to feeding competition in particular. We found that as chimpanzees (n = 30) reached adulthood, they became increasingly intolerant of sharing food, whereas adult bonobos (n = 24) maintained high, juvenile levels of food-related tolerance. We also investigated the ontogeny of inhibition during tasks that simulated feeding competition. In two different tests, we found that bonobos (n = 30) exhibited developmental delays relative to chimpanzees (n = 29) in the acquisition of social inhibition, with these differences resulting in less skill among adult bonobos. The results suggest that these social and cognitive differences between two closely related species result from evolutionary changes in brain development. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Imitation in the great apes continues to be an active field of research and one that is not free of controversy. Several studies suggest that these species do not tend to match the motor movements of the model they observe, but try to achieve the same results using their own methods (emulation of results). In the studies reviewed, gestures have been used very infrequently outside an intraspecific communicative context to evaluate imitation. In fact, the imitation of gestural actions has been tested only in 4 individual great apes. This study assessed a chimpanzee's (Pan troglodytes) ability to imitate 52 actions in 4 categories. The levels of accuracy attained by the subject in her imitations exceeded those described in previous studies. Moreover, contrary to the idea defended in some articles, the subject seemed to find it easier to imitate gestures than actions with objects. © 2009 American Psychological Association.

ABSTRACT: The authors investigated choice behavior by chimpanzees in five experiments involving choices between different amounts of food. Chimpanzees did not maximize the amount of food they obtained when choosing between a single 20-g banana piece and another option containing a 20-g piece and a 5-g piece. This was true even though they successfully discriminated between 20-g and 25-g banana pieces in other trials. When items in the mixed option were stacked, however, the chimpanzees chose the larger amount. Later experiments indicated that changing the magnitude of the two amounts did not change performance if the difference in magnitude between the two options remained the same (e.g., 40 g plus 10 g vs. 40 g). However, chimpanzees did improve when the two-item option was increased in its magnitude relative to the single slice (e.g., 20 g plus 10 g vs. 20 g). These results indicated that chimpanzees undervalued the total amount of food in sets when items differed in size and did not appear to be whole. Another experiment confirmed that it was this notion of wholeness that evoked suboptimal responding because chimpanzees were successful in the same comparisons with a different type of food that appeared less fractionated when presented as two pieces. These results provide evidence of suboptimal responding in some natural choice situations that prevents chimpanzees from maximizing food intake. © 2009 American Psychological Association.

ABSTRACT: The social aspects of primate reintroduction are of primary importance to the success of release programs and need to be assessed through the study of changes in social behavior over time. This study reports on the development of social structure and organization in a community of 37 chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) released into the wild in the Conkouati Douli National Park, Republic of Congo. Analyses of post-release monitoring data collected over 10years on association patterns between individuals show that during the years following individual releases, chimpanzees exhibited changing social structure and organization until they stabilized in one community living in a fission-fusion system. Social organization development was directly affected by several factors including community size and experience in the wild, while social structure was affected by individual characteristics: gender, pre-release history, and release history. Similarities between social structure and organization observed in the released community and wild chimpanzee communities demonstrate that the release program is a success from a social point of view. © Springer-Verlag 2009.

ABSTRACT: Pre-existing immunity to human adenovirus serotype 5 (AdHu5) has been shown to suppress the immunogenicity of recombinant Ad5 (rAdHu5) vector-based vaccines for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in both preclinical studies and clinical trials. As a potential solution to this problem we developed adenovirus vaccine vectors of chimpanzee origin. In the present study we assessed the immunogenicity of various chimpanzee adenovirus vectors in a prime/boost regimen to HIV-1 envelope and SIV Gag-Pol in rhesus monkeys and their ability to protect against pathogenic viral challenge. Although rAdHu5-primed monkeys had higher magnitude T cell responses than rAdC7 or rAdC68 prior to challenge, the rAdC7-rAdC1/C5 and rAdHu5-rAdC1/C5 immunizations resulted in comparable magnitude recall cellular immune responses and comparable level of control of viremia post-challenge. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Although humans and chimpanzees share >99% identity in alignable protein sequences, they differ surprisingly in the incidence and severity of some common diseases. In general, humans infected with various viruses, such as HIV and hepatitis C virus, appear to develop stronger reactions and long-term complications. Humans also appear to suffer more from other diseases associated with over-reactivity of the adaptive immune system, such as asthma, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis. In this study, we show that human T cells are more reactive than chimpanzee T cells to a wide variety of stimuli, including anti-TCR Abs of multiple isotypes, L-phytohemagglutin, Staphylococcus aureus superantigen, a superagonist anti-CD28 Ab, and in MLRs. We also extend this observation to B cells, again showing a human propensity to react more strongly to stimuli. Finally, we show a relative increase in activation markers and cytokine production in human lymphocytes in response to uridine-rich (viral-like) ssRNA. Thus, humans manifest a generalized lymphocyte over-reactivity relative to chimpanzees, a finding that is correlated with decreased levels of inhibitory sialic acid-recognizing Ig-superfamily lectins (Siglecs; particularly Siglec-5) on human T and B cells. Furthermore, Siglec-5 levels are upregulated by activation in chimpanzee but not human lymphocytes, and human T cell reactivity can be downmodulated by forced expression of Siglec-5. Thus, a key difference in the immune reactivity of chimp and human lymphocytes appears to be related to the differential expression of Siglec-5. Taken together, these data may help explain human propensities for diseases associated with excessive activation of the adaptive immune system.

ABSTRACT: Currently, the timber company Industrie Forestiere du Batalimo is selectively logging the Ngotto Forest in the Central African Republic. The forest is home to a population of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and provides the Bofi-speaking people of Grima with food, medicine, housing material, and other commodities. Over a 7-month period, the research team conducted a line-transect survey of the great ape population in the forests to the south of Grima to document their distribution. For comparison purposes, the team also surveyed a section of adjacent forest that had already been logged. Ape nests were significantly rarer in the logged forest than in the unlogged forest, and ape nests were most common in the more pristine forests to the south. This report further discusses the effects of logging and other human activities. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

ABSTRACT: To clarify the distribution and the status of chimpanzees in Guinea-Bissau and on the border with Guinea, we conducted an interview survey with hunters in 110 and 60 villages in Guinea-Bissau and Guinea, respectively. Based on the results of the survey, the northern distribution limit of chimpanzees in Guinea-Bissau appears to be located between the Corubal river (which once was suspected to represent the distribution limit) and the Gabù-Bafata road. Chimpanzees were reported to be common in most of the surveyed area and are not a game species. Crop-raiding by chimpanzees was mentioned by most interviewees. The implementation of a land management system that maintains a mosaic of habitats is the priority for the long-term conservation of this cross-border population. © 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel.

ABSTRACT: Background: To understand immunological responses in chimpanzees vaccinated with live-attenuated vaccine (oral polio vaccine; OPV), serum neutralizing antibodies against poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 were investigated over time. Methods: The neutralizing antibody titers against poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 were determined by microneutralization test using 100 ID50 of poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 (Sabin strains). Results: Neutralizing antibodies against poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 were detected in 85.7%, 71.4%, and 65% of the serum from 42 chimpanzees tested 9 years post-vaccination. The neutralizing antibody titers in chimpanzees were similar to the documented levels in human studies as an indicator of vaccine efficacy. Conclusions: This study reveals persistence of neutralizing antibodies in chimpanzees for at least 9 years after vaccination with OPV. This first study in chimpanzees provides useful information for the evaluation of the success of vaccination with OPV in other captive apes. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

ABSTRACT: Selecting the most efficient recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) serotype for airway gene therapy has been difficult due to cross-specific differences in tropism and immune response between humans and animal models. Chimpanzeesthe closest surviving genetic relative of humansprovide a valuable opportunity to select the most effective serotypes for clinical trials in humans. However, designing informative experiments using this protected species is challenging due to limited availability and experimental regulations. We have developed a method using Renilla luciferase (RL) and firefly luciferase (FL) reporters to directly index the relative transduction and immune response of two promising rAAV serotypes following lung coinfection. Analysis of differential luciferase activity in chimpanzee airway brushings demonstrated a 20-fold higher efficiency for rAAV1 over rAAV5 at 90 days, a finding that was similar in polarized human airway epithelia. T-cell responses to AAV5 capsid were stronger than AAV1 capsid. This dual vector indexing approach may be useful in selecting lead vector serotypes for clinical gene therapy and suggests rAAV1 is preferred for cystic fibrosis. © The American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy.

ABSTRACT: People empathize with fictional displays of behaviour, including those of cartoons and computer animations, even though the stimuli are obviously artificial. However, the extent to which other animals also may respond empathetically to animations has yet to be determined. Animations provide a potentially useful tool for exploring non-human behaviour, cognition and empathy because computer-generated stimuli offer complete control over variables and the ability to program stimuli that could not be captured on video. Establishing computer animations as a viable tool requires that non-human subjects identify with and respond to animations in a way similar to the way they do to images of actual conspecifics. Contagious yawning has been linked to empathy and poses a good test of involuntary identification and motor mimicry. We presented 24 chimpanzees with three-dimensional computer-animated chimpanzees yawning or displaying control mouth movements. The apes yawned significantly more in response to the yawn animations than to the controls, implying identification with the animations. These results support the phenomenon of contagious yawning in chimpanzees and suggest an empathic response to animations. Understanding how chimpanzees connect with animations, to both empathize and imitate, may help us to understand how humans do the same. © 2009 The Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: The beta hemoglobin protein is identical in humans and chimpanzees. In this tutorial, students see that even though the proteins are identical, the genes that code for them are not. There are many more differences in the introns than in the exons, which indicates that coding regions of DNA are more highly conserved than non-coding regions.

ABSTRACT: Introduction To a cognitive psychologist, chimpanzee tool use is exciting because of the opportunity it brings to examine how apes deal with a range of challenging situations that in humans would invoke planning. By planning it is meant a special kind of problem solving in which an appropriate course of action for the immediate or distant future is worked out by means of mental computation with brain representations of past or present situations (Miller et al., 1960). These include: a working representation of the current situation that presents a problem; episodic memories of specific past instances and events; and semantic knowledge about how things work or how people behave. Because a tool is not itself a goal-object, but has meaning and functionality only in regard to achieving a goal, problem solving with tools often makes more of the planning process “visible” than is normally the case (Seed & Byrne, 2010). Because a tool often must be selected to meet specific criteria in order to work, or - more telling still - may have to be made from specific raw materials in a particular way, getting an appropriate tool becomes an extra stage in the planning process. Thus, to approach a cognitive understanding of animal planning, studying tool use is by no means the only approach, but it is certainly a good one. Historically, however, understanding cognition has not been the major driving force in the study of tool use in great apes in primatology: that stemmed instead from anthropology, a subject with a very different agenda. © Cambridge University Press 2013.

ABSTRACT: A 37-yr-old male chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) was evaluated for intermittent diarrhea, scrotal swelling, and lethargy of 2 days duration. Physical examination revealed marked swelling of the scrotum and perineal tissues with mild pitting edema and crepitus. Computed tomography revealed a mixed gas and soft-tissue density extending from the caudal ventral subcutaneous tissues caudally to the scrotum and perineal tissues. Surgical exploration and castration were performed to establish drainage, and culture revealed a polymicrobial infection. A diagnosis of scrotal and fascial plane abscessation consistent with Fournier's gangrene was made. Although castration with open drainage was performed, the animal died 36 hr after surgery. Postmortem examination and histopathology revealed necrotizing fasciitis of the penis, vaginal tunic, and subcutaneous perineal and perianal tissues.

ABSTRACT: Most social primates live in cohesive groups, so travel paths inevitably reflect compromise: decision processes of individuals are obscured. The fission-fusion social organisation of the chimpanzee, however, allows an individual's movements to be investigated independently. We followed 15 chimpanzees (eight male and seven female) through the relatively flat forest of Budongo, Uganda, plotting the path of each individual over periods of 1-3 days. Chimpanzee movement was parsed into phases ending with halts of more than 20 min, during which individuals fed, rested or engaged in social activities. Males, lactating or pregnant females and sexually receptive females all travelled similar average distances between halts, at similar speeds and along similarly direct beeline paths. Compared to lactating or pregnant females, males did travel for a significantly longer time each day and halted more often, but the most striking sex differences appeared in the organisation of movement phases into a day's path. After a halt, males tended to continue in the same direction as before. Lactating or pregnant females showed no such strategy and often retraced the preceding phase, returning to previously visited food patches. We suggest that female chimpanzee movements approximate an optimal solution to feeding requirements, whereas the paths of males allow integration of foraging with territorial defence. The 'continually moving forwards' strategy of males enables them to monitor their territory boundaries-border checking-whilst foraging, generally avoiding the explicit boundary patrols observed at other chimpanzee study sites. © Springer-Verlag 2009.

ABSTRACT: The goal of this study was to compare the performance of a chimpanzee and humans on auditory-visual intermodal matching of conspecifics and non-conspecifics. The task consisted of matching vocal samples to facial images of the corresponding vocalizers. We tested the chimpanzee and human subjects with both chimpanzee and human stimuli to assess the involvement of species-specificity in the recognition process. All subjects were highly familiar with the stimuli. The chimpanzee subject, named Pan, had had extensive previous experience in auditory-visual intermodal matching tasks. We found clear evidence of a species-specific effect: the chimpanzee and human subjects both performed better at recognizing conspecifics than non-conspecifics. Our results suggest that Pan's early exposure to human caretakers did not seem to favor a perceptual advantage in better discriminating familiar humans compared to familiar conspecifics. The results also showed that Pan's recognition of non-conspecifics did not significantly improve over the course of the experiment. In contrast, human subjects learned to better discriminate non-conspecific stimuli, suggesting that the processing of recognition might differ across species. Nevertheless, this comparative study demonstrates that species-specificity significantly affects intermodal individual recognition of highly familiar individuals in both chimpanzee and human subjects. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Pan troglodytes verus is considered one of the most endangered primates in the world due to habitat loss or degradation, and it is considered extinct in several regions of West-Africa. This study aims at developing a model that predicts habitat suitability for chimpanzee under different land cover scenarios and supports a multi-temporal analysis of the recent habitat evolution in southern Guinea-Bissau. The model, built using a maximum entropy framework, is spatially explicit, uses eco-geographic variables derived from landscape compositional, structural and functional attributes, and is based on nest location data collected in the field. The results show that the developed model has good levels of reliability and the map produced through its application reveals a current extension of 752 km2 of adequate habitat in a 2723 km2 study area. Forest related EGVs (ecogeographical variables) had the higher importance for the model production. Habitat suitability maps produced for three dates in the last three decades show that there has been a marked decrease in habitat extension and in connectivity to neighbouring regions. We analyse the implications of these results in possible strategies for the conservation of chimpanzees in Guinea-Bissau. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Introduction: Humans, as the most technological species, tend to assume that tool use is a sign of higher intelligence and that, over the course of our evolution, tools conferred a decisive advantage in the struggle to adapt to different environments (Mithen, 1996; Wynn, 2002; Wolpert, 2003; Dietrich et al., 2008). As such, animal species that use tools are considered more intelligent, while those that do not are judged as being less intelligent. This amounts to an anthropocentric judgment whereby humans adopt a human criterion to judge the adaptive skills of other species (Barrett et al., 2007; Goodrich & Allen, 2007). However, both phylogeny and ecology must be taken into account before one makes judgments about when and where we might expect tools to be used (Bluff et al., 2007; Hansell & Ruxton, 2008). Tool use as an adaptation Physical adaptations If one remembers that, in most cases, tools are an extension of one’s body that allow an individual to solve tasks that cannot be solved with the body alone (Goodall, 1970; Beck, 1980; Boesch & Boesch, 1990), we must acknowledge that some primate species possess more efficient physical specializations than humans. For example, baboons have very hard, sharp teeth, which allow them to break open hard-shelled fruits that humans would be unable to open without the help of a tool (Kummer, 1968). Similarly, orangutans and gorillas, which are clearly physically stronger than humans, have been seen accessing food resources using sheer force in situations where humans would need to rely on tools (Schaik & Knott, 1996; Cipolletta et al., 2007). In addition to sheer force, it has been argued that hands help in tool use and this would then explain some of the distribution of tool use in the animal kingdom, although we should not forget that birds hold tools with their beaks and some otters use tools as well. Therefore, independent of the cognitive capacities required to use tools, tool use by animals should not be expected to occur in all situations where humans might use them. Our natural tendency to anthropomorphize hinders us from reaching a better understanding of the evolution of tool use, and it is imperative that we look directly to animals for answers about when tools might be beneficial. © Cambridge University Press 2013.

ABSTRACT: The present study assesses imitative ability in chimpanzees and human children. A direct comparison of these two species was conducted in an object-manipulation task. The subjects were required to copy the model stack by stacking colored blocks in the same order as the model. Four juvenile/adolescent chimpanzees failed to copy the model stack even after a long training-period. Two adult chimpanzees eventually learned to copy the model stack of two blocks. However, they failed to copy the model of three blocks, and analysis of their stacking patterns revealed that they only focused on the color of the top block in the model. Human children started to copy the model of two blocks when they were two years of age and gradually increased the number of successfully copied blocks. The results from both chimpanzees and humans are discussed in terms of the social intelligence involved in object manipulation. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.

ABSTRACT: Chimpanzees and humans are closely related but differ in many deadly human diseases and other characteristics in physiology, anatomy, and pathology. In spite of decades of extensive research, crucial questions about the molecular mechanisms behind the differences are yet to be understood. Here I report ExonVar, a novel computational pipeline for Exon-based human-chimpanzee comparative Variant analysis. The objective is to comparatively analyze mutations specifically those that caused the frame shift and nonsense mutations and to assess their scale and potential impacts on human-chimpanzee divergence. Genomewide analysis of human and chimpanzee exons with ExonVar identified a number of species-specific, exon-disrupting mutations in chimpanzees but much fewer in humans. Many were found on genes involved in important biological processes such as T cell lineage development, the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, and antigen induced cell death. A "less-is-more" model was previously established to illustrate the role of the gene inactivation and disruptions during human evolution. Here this analysis suggested a different model where the chimpanzee-specific exon-disrupting mutations may act as additional evolutionary force that drove the human-chimpanzee divergence. Finally, the analysis revealed a number of sequencing errors in the chimpanzee and human genome sequences and further illustrated that they could be corrected without resequencing.

ABSTRACT: The evolution of altruism and reciprocity has been explained mainly from ultimate perspectives. However, in order to understand from a proximate perspective how humans evolved to be such cooperative animals, comparative studies with our evolutionary relatives are essential. Here we review several recent experimental studies on chimpanzees' altruism and reciprocity. These studies have generated some conflicting results. By examining the differences in the results and experimental paradigms, two characteristics of prosociality in chimpanzees emerged: (1) chimpanzees are more likely to behave altruistically and/or reciprocally upon a recipient's request, than without request, and (2) chimpanzees also show a tendency to regard others and help in contexts not involving food. Supposing that these two characteristics of altruism, recipient-initiated altruism and non-food altruism, were present in the common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans, it is possible that increased social cognitive abilities, capacity for language, necessity for food sharing, and enriched material culture favored in humans the unique evolution of cooperation, characterized by voluntary altruism and frequent food donation. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.

ABSTRACT: Seventeen adult chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) with an average age of 37 yr were immobilized with a combination of tiletamine-zolazepam (TZ) and medetomidine (MED) by one of two modes of delivery. Group A animals received the drug combination intramuscularly at 3 mg/kg and 0.05 mg/kg, respectively. Animals in group B received MED by oral transmucosal administration, meaning oral delivery with presumptive transmucosal absorption. MED at 0.1 mg/kg was mixed with marshmallow crme, and delivery was followed by 3 mg/kg of TZ intramuscularly. Chimpanzees from both groups were recovered after administration of atipamezole at 0.3 mg/kg intramuscularly. All chimpanzees were compliant with oral transmucosal drug administration, although two chimpanzees preferred oral MED mixed with applesauce. All animals exhibited some anxiety and excitatory behavior associated with darting, but this was reduced in group B, which was premedicated with oral transmucosal MED. The mean time from TZ administration to sedation sufficient for human contact was 16.4 and 14.7 min with and without oral transmucosal premedication, respectively. The mean time for recovery for those chimpanzees given oral transmucosal premedication was 13.8 min, which was significantly shorter than the time of recovery for the group not given oral premedication (P 0.02). Oral transmucosal administration of MED provided light sedation in 16 of 17 chimpanzees to the level of arousable recumbency and a heavier sedation in one chimpanzee with no adverse side effects. TZ combined with MED by either oral transmucosal or injectable administration provided safe, heavy, long sedation with rapid, smooth, uneventful recoveries.

ABSTRACT: Adolescence, the period lasting from the onset of puberty to the emergence of physical and sexual maturity, is a period of social change for many species including chimpanzees. Several reports have implicitly linked the physiological changes that occur during male chimpanzee adolescence to significant disruption in the social group, which in turn may result in serious agonism and wounding. To assess the association between adolescent males and wounding rates, 38 institutions housing 399 chimpanzees among 59 social groups, recorded all wounds incurred by chimpanzees over a 6-month period. The rate of wounding did not differ between groups with or without adolescent males. Adolescent males received the most wounds, but were no more likely to cause wounds than group members of any other sex-age class. Social groups with multiple adult males experienced lower wounding rates than those with a single adult male. Results indicate that (1) adolescent male chimpanzees may receive, but not inflict, more wounds than chimpanzees in other sex-age classes; and (2) management strategies that support natural social groupings may control and limit group agonism. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
