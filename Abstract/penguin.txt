ABSTRACT: Carrion decomposition has a significant impact on soil chemical profiles. However, soil nutrient research associated with animal carcasses in Antarctica has been relatively scarce, and the effect of penguin carrion decomposition on soil chemical composition is largely unknown. We aimed to determine Antarctica’s soil chemistry profiles associated with penguin carrion. Soil samples were collected from a penguin rookery near King Sejong Station, Barton Peninsula, King George Island, Antarctica. Dry combustion methods were used to identify soil nitrogen and sulfur, while ammonia, nitrate, and phosphate were determined colorimetrically using a spectrophotometer. In addition, total carbon, pH, electrical conductivity, soil moisture, and soil porosity were also determined. Overall, soil chemical properties were not significantly different between the stages of decomposition and the sampling locations. These findings suggest that nutrients from penguin carrion disperse and leach in limited quantities into the soil, probably due to the active scavenging activities by vertebrate scavengers and the slower decomposition rate resulting from cold temperatures in the Antarctic region. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: In order to evaluate mercury (Hg) accumulation patterns in Southern Ocean penguins, we measured Hg concentrations and carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) stable isotope ratios in body feathers of adult Adélie (Pygoscelis adeliae), gentoo (Pygoscelis papua), and chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarctica) penguins living near Anvers Island, West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) collected in the 2010/2011 austral summer. With these and data from Pygoscelis and other penguin genera (Eudyptes and Aptenodytes) throughout the Southern Ocean, we modelled Hg variation using δ13C and δ15N values. Mean concentrations of Hg in feathers of Adélie (0.09 ± 0.05 μg g−1) and gentoo (0.16 ± 0.08 μg g−1) penguins from Anvers Island were among the lowest ever reported for the Southern Ocean. However, Hg concentrations in chinstrap penguins (0.80 ± 0.20 μg g−1), which undertake relatively broad longitudinal winter migrations north of expanding sea ice, were significantly higher (P < 0.001) than those in gentoo or Adélie penguins. δ13C and δ15N values for feathers from all three Anvers Island populations were also the lowest among those previously reported for Southern Ocean penguins foraging within Antarctic and subantarctic waters. These observations, along with size distributions of WAP krill, suggest foraging during non-breeding seasons as a primary contributor to higher Hg accumulation in chinstraps relative to other sympatric Pygoscelis along the WAP. δ13C values for all Southern Ocean penguin populations, alone best explained feather Hg concentrations among possible generalized linear models (GLMs) for populations grouped by either breeding site (AICc = 36.9, wi = 0.0590) or Antarctic Frontal Zone (AICc = 36.9, wi = 0.0537). Although Hg feather concentrations can vary locally by species, there was an insignificant species-level effect (wi < 0.001) across the full latitudinal range examined. Therefore, feeding ecology at breeding locations, as tracked by δ13C, control Hg accumulation in penguin populations across the Southern Ocean. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Aspergillus fumigatus is a common opportunistic pathogen in different animals, including birds such as penguins. For the first time, a fungal strain identified as A. fumigatus was isolated from soil in the nests of gentoo penguins, Pygoscelis papua, on Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands (maritime Antarctica). This isolate (A. fumigatus UFMGCB 11829) displayed a series of potentially pathogenic characteristics in vitro. We evaluated its detailed molecular taxonomy and submitted the A. fumigatus UFMGCB 11829 Antarctic strain to in vivo pathogenic modelling. The isolate was confirmed to represent A. fumigatus morphological and phylogenetic analysis showed that it was closely related to A. fumigatus sequences reported from animals, immunosuppressed humans, storage grains, plants and soils. The strain displayed the best mycelial growth and conidia production at 37 ºC; however, it was also able to grow and produce conidia at 15º, demonstrating its capability to survive and colonize penguin nest at least in the summer season in maritime Antarctica. In pathogenicity tests, healthy mice did not showed symptoms of infection; however, 50% lethality was observed in immunosuppressed mice that were inoculated with 106 and 107 spores. Lethality increased to 100% when inoculated with 108 spores. Our data highlight the potential pathogenicity of opportunistic A. fumigatus that may be present in the Antarctic, and the risks of both their further transfer within Antarctica and outwards to other continents, risks which may be exacerbated due global climatic changes. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia 2024.

ABSTRACT: Mercury (Hg) is a global pollutant known for its significant bioaccumulation and biomagnification capabilities, posing a particular threat to marine environments. Seabirds have been recognized as effective bioindicators of marine pollution, and, among them, penguins present a unique opportunity to serve as a single taxonomic group (Sphenisciformes) for monitoring Hg across distinct marine ecosystems in the Southern Hemisphere. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive systematic review of Hg concentrations, and performed a meta-analysis that took into account the various sources of uncertainty associated with Hg contamination in penguins. Beyond intrinsic species-specific factors shaping Hg levels, our results showed that the penguin community effectively reflects spatial patterns of Hg bioavailability. We identified geographic Hg hotspots in Australia, the Indian Ocean, and Tierra del Fuego, as well as coldspots in Perú and the South Atlantic. Furthermore, specific penguin species, namely the Southern Rockhopper (Eudyptes chrysocome) and Macaroni penguin (Eudyptes chrysolophus), are highlighted as particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of Hg. Additionally, we identified knowledge gaps in geographic areas such as the Galápagos Islands, South Africa, and the coast of Chile, as well as in species including Fiordland (Eudyptes pachyrhynchus), Snares (Eudyptes robustus), Erect-crested (Eudyptes sclateri), Royal (Eudyptes schlegeli), Yellow-eyed (Megadyptes antipodes), and Galápagos (Spheniscus mendiculus) penguins. Overall, our study contributes to the growing body of literature emphasizing the role of penguins as bioindicators of Hg pollution, but it also highlights areas where further research and data collection are needed for a more comprehensive understanding of Hg contamination in marine ecosystems in the Southern Hemisphere. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: To examine variations in nacre color and thickness in Pteria penguin oysters obtained from Tonga and Japan, a novel approach with a focus on their potential for mabé pearl production was used. Detailed analyses of color and microstructure revealed that the middle position of the right-valve nacre (position 1) primarily showed a reduction in yellow pigmentation. This was indicated by a decrease in the yellowness index (YI) and an increase in the whiteness index (WI). In contrast, the anterior and middle positions of the left-valve nacre (positions 2 and 3) consistently displayed a higher level of yellow pigmentation. A comparison of oysters from different geographical origin found that Tonga wild-caught oysters had significantly thicker nacre than Tonga culture-site oysters, suggesting the influence of probable genetic diversity and environmental factors on nacre formation. Notably, nacre at position 1 was generally thinner, while at positions 2 and 3 it was thicker, which would influence the resultant pearl quality and attributes. We demonstrate the significance of the nacre position on the valve for mabé pearl production: position 1 tended to produce white pearls with pronounced interference colors, whereas position 2 tended to yield gold pearls. Furthermore, our findings highlight the significant impact of the oysters' geographic origin on mabé pearl color and quality. This study emphasizes the importance of considering the position of shell nacre and the potential influences of the oysters' genetic origins and environmental factors on mabé pearl formation. © 2023

ABSTRACT: Southern giant petrels (Macronectes giganteus) are important consumers that range across the oceans throughout the southern hemisphere. In Argentina, previous studies have shown they eat primarily pinnipeds and penguins, which they are assumed to scavenge, although there are occasional anecdotes of them attacking living penguins. Here we describe a predation attempt by a trio of southern giant petrels on a molting adult Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) at the large colony at Punta Tombo, Argentina. We relate giant petrel attendance patterns at the colony to the penguins' phenology, showing how giant petrel numbers rise with the increasing prevalence of vulnerable penguins. We suggest that living penguins—both fledglings and adults—may constitute a more seasonally significant proportion of the giant petrel diet than previously assumed, and their capture may represent a specialized predation technique. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Antemortem serodiagnosis of aspergillosis remains challenging in Sphenisciformes. Protein electrophoresis, serology (antibody, antigen) by ELISA, and gliotoxin detection provide variable diagnostic value. In the present study, a commercially available Western blot (WB) validated for use in humans and dolphins was adapted for use with penguin samples. Using the same method and reagents, samples were analyzed from multiple institutions in the United States and one facility in France. This was inclusive of normal juvenile African penguins (Spheniscus demersus, n = 10) and various species of penguins in the United States with confirmed infection (n = 9) as well as 52 samples from Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) in France. Cumulative WB scores (based on reactivity to different antigens) were found to be significantly higher in the group of penguins with confirmed infection (p < 0.0001). Significant differences were also observed between the clinically normal penguins in the two populations, with higher scores in the United States (median score 1.0, 95%CI [0-5], min 0, max 11) compared to France (median score 0,95%CI [0-0], min 0, max 5). The utilization of the WB as a diagnostic tool is inconclusive due to the use of samples from varying institutions, environmental background, age, and stages of infection. However, this tool may provide an overview of antigen reactivity in penguins infected with Aspergillus to help design a more robust serology assay and further understand the humoral immune response during infection.

ABSTRACT: Antarctica is the most remote and coldest regions of the planet, but the presence of REEs there has received little attention. This study assessed REE-contents in the feathers of adult gentoo penguins from Ardley Island, Kopaitic Island and Base O'Higgins. Field work was accomplished during 2011 (austral summer), and determination of elements was performed with ICP-MS. In general, REE-levels showed descending relations as follows: Ce > La > Y > Nd > Sc > Pr > Gd > Sm > Dy >Er > Yb > Eu > Ho > Tb > Tm > Lu. The data showed an increase of the levels of REEs from the lower part of the feather to the tip. This finding seems to be spatially dependent, but geochemical, anthropogenic conditions, feeding habits, sex, or even health status of birds should also be considered. It is a subject that requires deeper attention in future studies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: In vertebrates, fasting is an intricate physiological process associated with strong metabolic changes, yet its effect on pollutant residue variation is poorly understood. Here, we quantified long-term changes in plasma concentrations of 20 organochlorine and 16 perfluoroalkyl pollutants in king penguins Aptenodytes patagonicus during the breeding and molting fasts, which are marked by low and high levels of protein catabolism, respectively, and by strong lipid use. The profile of measured pollutants in plasma was dominated by perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS, initial relative contribution of 60%). Initial total pollutant concentrations were similar in molting (3.3-5.7 ng g-1 ww) and breeding penguins (range of 4.2-7.3 ng g-1 wet weight, ww). Long-term fasting (25 days) for molting and breeding led, respectively, to a 1.8- and 2.2-fold increase in total plasma pollutant concentrations, although the rate and direction of change were compound-specific. Hexachlorbenzene (HCB) and PFOS concentrations increased in plasma (net mobilization) during both types of fasting, likely due to lipid use. Plasma perfluoroundecanoate (PFUnDA) and perfluorotridecanoate (PFTrDA) concentrations increased in breeders (net mobilization) but decreased in molting individuals (net excretion), suggesting a significant incorporation of these pollutants into feathers. This study is a key contribution to our understanding of pollutant variation in blood during long-term fasting in wildlife. © 2024 American Chemical Society

ABSTRACT: The vertebral column in tetrapods consists of several constant regions, namely the cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and caudal regions. Each of these regions is characterized by a specific number of vertebrae, contributing to the overall vertebral formula. Supernumerary and/or missing vertebrae have only been sporadically mentioned for penguins, and the specific vertebral formula is only determined for some non-passeres orders. Variations in the anatomy and vertebral number of South American and Antarctic penguin species are evaluated here. Sixty-six specimens of Aptenodytes forsteri, Pygoscelis adeliae, P. antarcticus, P. papua, Spheniscus magellanicus, and Eudyptes chrysocome were examined to establish the vertebral formula for six South American and Antarctic species, reporting the type and frequency of the variations found in the generalized configuration. We found no intraspecific variation in respect of the number of cervical as well as cervicothoracic vertebrae in all penguin species studied. Intra- and interspecific variation occur in the thoracic, synsacral, and caudal regions comprising 6–7, 13–14 and 5–8 vertebrae, respectively. Particularly, the variations were found in the transitional zones between one region and another and/or between synsacral segments. M. Alejandra Sosa and Carolina Acosta Hospitaleche.

ABSTRACT: Avian begging calls mediate parent–offspring conflict and direct parental care to genetically related progeny. We found that the fundamental frequency of begging calls of African Penguins Spheniscus demersus decreases as the penguins age and gain mass, before reaching a lower plateau when the chick reaches about 1 kg. Our results suggest that the food solicitation signals of this species may inform parents of the offspring's body mass. Our results may also lead to the development of non-invasive tools for facilitating censusing chick growth in wild colonies. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Homeostasis of gut microbiota is critical for growth and health of animals. However, the impact of reproduction on penguin gut microbiota remains unclear, despite penguins being sentinel species of the marine environment. Through high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene, we examined changes in gut microbiota structure and function in captive female Gentoo penguins during the reproductive process, and also assessed the community stability and assembly mechanism. We found that gut microbiota alpha diversity decreased significantly in captive female Gentoo penguins after egg laying. Based on the comparison of gut microbiota compositions and their predicted functions, the Fusobacteria and pathogenicity increased after laying eggs, while Bacteroidetes and carbohydrate metabolism decreased. After laying eggs, the diversity of the gut microbiota decreased continuously until chicks left the nest. The co-occurrence network analysis revealed that the gut microbiota of captive female Gentoo penguins was less complex and more stable after egg laying. On the basis of the null model, deterministic processes drove the gut microbiota assembly in gravid Gentoo penguins, whereas reproductive processes elevated the contribution of stochastic processes. Our study provides insights into the reproductive physiology and gut microbiota assembly in penguins. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

ABSTRACT: The diurnal and nocturnal valve gaping behavior of the pearl oyster Pteria penguin was characterized through video analysis aided by open-source software. Juvenile pearl oysters were video-recorded for 48 hours under laboratory conditions, using commonly used surveillance hardware. The direct measuring of the distance changes between the two valve edges effectively revealed the pearl oysters’ tendency to open their valves wider at night-time, than during day-time. Moreover, the differences observed were also attained at the individual level. The description for the first time of this behavior has broader implications for the research in pearl oyster aquaculture. Moreover, it introduces a non-invasive tool for comprehensive assessment of adult oyster behavior. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: A major goal of evolutionary ecology is to understand the interaction between ecological differences and the functional morphology of organisms. Studies of this type are common among flying birds but less so in penguins. Penguins (Spheniscidae) are the most derived extant underwater flying birds using their wings for swimming and beak when foraging. The Humboldt Penguin (Spheniscus humboldti) and Magellanic Penguin (S. magellanicus) occur along the coast of South America and their morphology was compared in allopatry and sympatry throughout their ranges. Measurements included: mass, tarsus length, four beak/head dimensions, bite force, wing loading, and aspect ratio. A thin-plate spline/relative warp analysis was also used to detect subtle differences in wing shape. Both species generally overlapped in trait morphology, but Magellanic Penguins showed greater trait diversity. Wing morphology was more homogenous between species than beak morphology indicating a similar mode of locomotion but potential differences in prey procurement. Morphological character displacement in sympatry was only evident in beak length. Local adaptation was common in other traits, and Punta Norte (Argentina) was often distinct in having high variation, notably in beak depth, wing loading, and wing shape (relative warp 1). This may be attributed to the fact that penguins here dive deep and forage farther from their colony; they also have a greater colony size that may contribute to greater intraspecific competition for resources. These results support a potentially optimal wing design for aquatic movement, which likely applies to other penguin species. Differences in morphology may also be related to differences between Atlantic and Pacific ecosystems. © 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT: George Levick was a doctor and naturalist who took part in Captain Robert Falcon Scott's ill-fated 'Terra Nova' expedition to the Antarctic in 1910-13. He and other members of the 'Northern Party' were stationed at Ridley Beach, Cape Adare, over several months in 1911, and later endured fearful privations when stranded on 'Inexpressible Island', before eventually reaching a rescue ship. 1 Levick passed the time at Cape Adare by observing the gathering of Adélie penguins at the mating season, describing their behaviour as accurately as he could in a large notebook and photographing their actions, especially around nests in one chosen colony - giving both distance shots and close-ups (see our Figure 6). 2 He urged his companions to watch the birds too, but to 'disturb them as little as possible it is most important to allow them to settle down naturally without interference from us', in the interests of a dispassionate scientific record. 3 However, in a subsequent article in Nature, Levick sometimes idealised the penguins' mating rituals in anthropomorphic terms, as did a reviewer of his book. 4 There was throughout a tension between Levick's emotional involvement with the birds and the increasing necessity to kill some of them for food. He was working in primitive conditions and could take only still photographs of the penguins. Nevertheless, his successive snapshots formed narrative sequences, often homing in on the experiences of individual birds through a day, and this highly original procedure anticipated the conventions of wildlife filming. The text of the book is a commentary on the photographic images, rather than the photographs being merely ornaments to the text. Elsewhere, another member of Scott's expeditionary party, the 'camera artist' Herbert Ponting, did take some brief cinematograph shots of Adélie penguins, which were later used in the film The Great White Silence (1924). 5 Levick's Antarctic Penguins was first published in 1914. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Diana Donald.

ABSTRACT: A multitude of animal species undergo prolonged fasting events at regularly occurring life history stages. During such periods of food deprivation, individuals need to suppress their appetite. The satiety signalling gut hormone ghrelin has received much attention in this context in studies looking at mammalian systems. In wild birds, however, knowledge on the ghrelin system and its role during extended fasts is still scarce. In this study, we collected plasma samples for measurements of circulating ghrelin concentrations from adult southern rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome) during the three to four week-long moult-fast that they repeat annually to replace their feathers. We further sampled chicks before and after feeding bouts and non-moulting adults. Circulating ghrelin levels did not differ significantly between fed and unfed chicks but chicks had significantly lower plasma ghrelin levels compared to adults. Furthermore, penguins in late moult (i.e. individuals at the end of the prolonged fasting bout) had higher ghrelin levels compared to non-moulting adults. Our results show elevated levels of circulating ghrelin during moult and generally lower levels of ghrelin in chicks than in adults regardless of feeding state. Given the scarcity or absence of knowledge on the function of ghrelin in seabirds and in fasting birds in general, our results add greatly to our understanding of the avian ghrelin system. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Ammonia volatilized from penguin excreta is a significant nitrogen source in Antarctic ecosystems, influencing climate through new particle formation (NPF). Freeze-thaw events can trigger ammonia emissions, but their impact on penguin-derived ammonia is understudied and overlooked in models. Here we investigate the contribution of penguins to ammonia and their climatic impacts using cruise observations and GEOS-Chem-APM simulations. High ammonia concentrations, with a maximum exceeding 7000 ng/m3, were observed over the Southern Ocean and Prydz Bay, driven by air masses from penguin colonies. Simulations showed that incorporating freeze-thaw impact improves model performance, with penguin-derived ammonia emissions enhanced by up to 20-fold and reaching a total of 49 Gg across Antarctica in November. Elevated ammonia increased simulated secondary particle number concentrations by 30−300% through NPF, enhancing simulated cloud droplet number concentrations by 10−20% and altering cloud properties. This study underscores the importance of incorporating penguin emissions into models, particularly during freeze-thaw events. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Sex-related differences in vital rates that drive population change reflect the basic life history of a species. However, for visually monomorphic bird species, determining the effect of sex on demographics can be a challenge. In this study, we investigated the effect of sex on apparent survival, recruitment, and breeding propensity in the Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae), a monochromatic, slightly size dimorphic species with known age, known sex, and known breeding history data collected during 1996–2019 (n = 2127 birds) from three breeding colonies on Ross Island, Antarctica. Using a multistate capture–mark–recapture maximum-likelihood model, we estimated apparent survival ((Formula presented.)), recapture (resighting) probability ((Formula presented.)), and the probability of transitioning among breeding states and moving between colonies ((Formula presented.); colony-specific non-juvenile pre-breeders, breeders, and non-breeders). Survival rate varied by breeding status and colony, but not sex, and pre-breeders had higher survival rates than breeders and non-breeders. Females had a higher probability of recruiting into the breeding population each year and may enter the breeding pool at younger ages. In contrast, both sexes had the same probability of breeding from year to year once they had recruited. Although we detected no direct sex effects on survival, the variation in recruitment probability and age-at-first reproduction, along with lower survival rates of breeders compared to pre-breeders, likely leads to shorter lifespans for females. This is supported by our findings of a male-biased mean adult sex ratio (ASR) of 1.4 males for every female ((Formula presented.) proportion of males = 0.57, SD = 0.07) across all colonies and years in this metapopulation. Our study illustrates how important it can be to disentangle sex-related variation in population vital rates, particularly for species with complex life histories and demographic dynamics. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Seasonal migration, driven by shifts in annual climate cycles and resources, is a key part of the life history and ecology of species across taxonomic groups. By influencing the amount of energy needed to move, external forces such as wind and ocean currents are often key drivers of migratory pathways exposing individuals to varying resources, environmental conditions, and competition pressures impacting individual fitness and population dynamics. Although wildlife movements in connection with wind and ocean currents are relatively well understood, movements within sea-ice fields have been much less studied, despite sea ice being an integral part of polar ecology. Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) in the southern Ross Sea, Antarctica, currently exist at the southernmost edge of their range and undergo the longest (~12,000 km) winter migration known for the species. Within and north of the Ross Sea, the Ross Gyre drives ocean circulation and the large-scale movement of sea ice. We used remotely sensed sea-ice movement data together with geolocation-based penguin movement data to test the hypothesis that penguins use gyre-driven sea-ice movement to aid their migration. We found that penguins traveled greater distances when their movement vectors were aligned with those of sea ice (i.e., ice support) and the amount of ice support received depended on which route a penguin took. We also found that birds that took an eastern route traveled significantly further north in two of the 3 years we examined, coinciding with higher velocities of sea ice in those years. We compare our findings to patterns observed in migrating species that utilize air or water currents for their travel and with other studies showing the importance of ocean/sea-ice circulation patterns to wildlife movement and life history patterns within the Ross Sea. Changes in sea ice may have consequences not only for energy expenditure but, by altering migration and movement pathways, to the ecological interactions that exist in this region. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Penguins play an essential biochemical role in the Antarctic ecosystem, being the study of their dynamics of utmost importance to understand their environment, behaviour and populational trends in the current climate change scenario. In this study, we used multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) along the coast of the chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarcticus) colony of Vapour Col (Deception Island, Antarctica) to map potential sites of biochemical interactions with the surrounding sea water. Several runoff discharge points were identified, where a precise placing of environmental sampling station is suggested. Additionally, UAVs were used in combination with Object Detection Architectures to obtain the chinstrap colony population size. Applying a simulation for clutch initiation dates due to our off-laying peak count, we obtained an estimated range of 13,250 to 22,000 breeding pairs in the 2021/2022 breeding season, also suggesting an alternative approach using chinstrap chicks as proxy to estimate adult numbers. This research shows the utility of UAV-deep learning for environment characterization and wildlife monitoring, providing a solid framework for upcoming studies in the area. © 2024 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: The relative importance of genetic drift and local adaptation in facilitating speciation remains unclear. This is particularly true for seabirds, which can disperse over large geographic distances, providing opportunities for intermittent gene flow among distant colonies that span the temperature and salinity gradients of the oceans. Here, we delve into the genomic basis of adaptation and speciation of banded penguins, Galápagos (Spheniscus mendiculus), Humboldt (Spheniscus humboldti), Magellanic (Spheniscus magellanicus), and African penguins (Spheniscus demersus), by analyzing 114 genomes from the main 16 breeding colonies. We aim to identify the molecular mechanism and genomic adaptive traits that have facilitated their diversifications. Through positive selection and gene family expansion analyses, we identified candidate genes that may be related to reproductive isolation processes mediated by ecological thermal niche divergence. We recover signals of positive selection on key loci associated with spermatogenesis, especially during the recent peripatric divergence of the Galápagos penguin from the Humboldt penguin. High temperatures in tropical habitats may have favored selection on loci associated with spermatogenesis to maintain sperm viability, leading to reproductive isolation among young species. Our results suggest that genome-wide selection on loci associated with molecular pathways that underpin thermoregulation, osmoregulation, hypoxia, and social behavior appears to have been crucial in local adaptation of banded penguins. Overall, these results contribute to our understanding of how the complexity of biotic, but especially abiotic, factors, along with the high dispersal capabilities of these marine species, may promote both neutral and adaptive lineage divergence even in the presence of gene flow.  © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Aspergillosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in penguins, with triazole antifungal drugs being commonly used for prophylaxis and treatment. This report describes 15 cases of fatal hemolysis associated with liquid itraconazole and voriconazole formulations administered to African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) from four institutions. All penguins underwent stressful events (e.g. relocation, induced molt) and were administered commercial liquid itraconazole formulations or compounded voriconazole liquid suspension. Observed clinical signs in affected penguins prior to death included hyporexia, weight loss, lethargy, dyspnea, red-tinged droppings, and obtunded mentation. Intra- and extravascular hemolysis and hemoglobinuric nephrosis were the primary pathologic manifestations on postmortem examination. The concentration-dependent hemolytic potentials of itraconazole, voriconazole, and commercial and compounded vehicle suspensions were evaluated in vitro by exposing chicken whole blood as a surrogate for penguin blood. Hemoglobin content in blood plasma was then measured by spectrophotometry. Neither itraconazole nor voriconazole alone induced hemolysis in vitro. The vehicle ingredients sorbitol and hydromellose induced hemolysis, but not at predicted plasma levels in chicken erythrocytes, suggesting neither the azole antifungals nor their major vehicles alone were likely to contribute to hemolysis in vivo in these penguins. Potential mechanisms of toxicosis include generation of an unmeasured reactive metabolite causing hemolysis, preexisting erythrocyte fragility, or species-specific differences in hemolytic thresholds that were not assessed in the chicken erythrocyte model. More research is needed on the potential for toxicosis of azole antifungal drugs and carrier molecules in this and other avian species. Copyright 2024 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Apex marine predators, such as toothed whales and large petrels and albatrosses, ingest mercury (Hg) primarily in the form of methylmercury (MeHg) via prey consumption, which they detoxify as tiemannite (HgSe). However, it remains unclear how lower trophic level marine predators, termed mesopredators, with elevated Hg concentrations detoxify MeHg and what chemical species are formed. To address this need, we used high energy-resolution X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy paired with nitrogen (N) and Hg stable isotopes to identify the chemical forms of Hg, Hg sources, and species-specific δ202Hg isotopic values in emperor penguin, a mesopredator feeding primarily on Antarctic silverfish. The penguin liver contains variable proportions of MeHg and two main inorganic Hg complexes (IHg), Hg-dithiolate (Hg(SR)2) and Hg-tetraselenolate (Hg(Sec)4), each characterized by specific isotopic values (δ202MeHg = 0.3 ± 0.2 ‰, δ202Hg(SR)2 = −1.6 ± 0.2 ‰, δ202Hg(Sec)4 = −2.0 ± 0.1 ‰). Using δ15N as a tracer of food source, we show that Hg(SR)2 is likely not obtained through dietary intake, but rather is present as a biochemical demethylation product. Furthermore, on average, female penguins transferred Hg to the egg strictly as MeHg in the egg albumen but as mixtures of MeHg and IHg in the membrane (89 % and 11 %, respectively) and yolk (32 % MeHg and 68 % Hg(Sec)4). Despite IHg species in eggs, MeHg is still the main species quantitatively transferred by the mother to the chick because of the disproportionate mass of the MeHg-rich albumen compared to the yolk. This work highlights the transformation of MeHg to Hg(SR)2 during demethylation for the first time in multicellular organisms, but further work is needed to understand the formation of Hg(SR)2 in the presence of relatively abundant Se biomolecules in lower trophic level predator species. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are increasingly detected in wildlife and present concerning and unknown health risks. While there is a growing body of literature describing PFAS in seabird species, knowledge from temperate Southern Hemisphere regions is lacking. Little penguins (Eudyptula minor) can nest and forage within heavily urbanised coastal environments and hence may be at risk of exposure to pollutants. We analysed scat contaminated nesting soils (n = 50) from 17 colonies in lutruwita/Tasmania for 16 PFAS, plasma samples (n = 45) from nine colonies, and three eggs for 49 PFAS. We detected 14 PFAS across the sample types, with perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) most commonly detected. Mean concentration of PFOS in plasma was 2.56 ± 4.3 ng/mL (<LOD–22.3), soil was 2.92 ± 5.39 μg/kg (<LOD–29.8) and eggs were 11.89 ± 11.30 μg/kg (0.27–22.84). Mean concentration of PFHxS in plasma was 0.9 ± 0.84 ng/mL (<LOD–5.6), soil was 11.4 ± 39.18 μg/kg (<LOD–213.3) and eggs were 0.27 ± 0.11 μg/kg (<LOD–0.38). Urbanisation of breeding sites was positively associated with PFOS and PFHxS concentrations in soils and blood. Phenology appeared to be an important predictor of PFHxS load, with moulting birds having lower levels compared to non-moulting birds. We investigated PFAS associations with health parameters and found that haematocrit and total plasma proteins in females were negatively associated with PFOS and positively associated in males. The number of erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities in males was positively associated with PFOS. Findings are the first to document the presence of PFAS in this resident seabird nesting and foraging close to anthropogenically modified habitats. We demonstrate that even in low concentrations, PFAS may have detectable relationships with penguin health. Ongoing research is needed to investigate foraging ecology and trophic bioaccumulation pathways, as well as understand sublethal consequences from exposure. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Heat stress from high temperatures has been recognised as a threat to several bird species and one that is likely to increase in severity and frequency as a result of global environmental change. Many seabirds are particularly vulnerable as their adaptations to forage in cold water can make it hard for them to resist heat gain while on land. The African Penguin Spheniscus demersus forages in cool water (10–20°C) but breeds and moults on land where temperatures can exceed 30°C. Little is known about its thermal physiology and when heat stress will occur. Here, we provide the first account of changes in body temperature and behaviour in African Penguins in response to an experimental increase in ambient temperature from 20°C to 35°C. Surprisingly, the highest body temperature observed (39.2°C) was recorded at the start of the study. Presumably, this response in body temperature was due to the stress of transport and handling. Penguins returned to normal body temperature (37.3°C) after 3.5 hours and maintained normothermia for roughly an hour. We then observed the onset of heat storage at an ambient temperature of 29°C, whereafter body temperature increased steadily at a rate of ca.0.2°C per 1°C increase in ambient temperature. Panting commenced at an ambient temperature of 31.4°C, when body temperature was 37.8°C. In addition to panting, penguins changed their posture to facilitate heat dissipation by standing, raising their heads, and extending their flippers. Our results corroborate field observations and support the argument that African Penguins are highly vulnerable to heat stress in the near future as extreme heat events become more severe and frequent due to climate change. Our results also confirm that penguins are sensitive to handling, which elicits a hyperthermic response. Given the general sensitivity of penguins to disturbance, from a conservation perspective, we advise that cautionary measures be implemented at colonies during critical life-history stages. © The Author(s), 2024.

ABSTRACT: We tracked adult emperor penguins from Rothschild Island, west Antarctic Peninsula in 2015/2016 during a summer with extensive sea ice of long duration, contrasting with past years of reduced sea ice extent associated with the recent, rapid, warming trend across the region. We fitted ARGOS PTT devices to penguins of unknown breeding status. Of 33 penguins tracked, nine returned to the colony, presumably to provision offspring. Their foraging trips lasted 9.6 ± 3.7 days, with maximum distances of 75 ± 45 km from the colony within coastal waters. Also, 18 instruments transmitted until the initiation of the annual moult. Penguins travelled at ~ 2.3 km h−1 before slowing for moult. Post-moult, some devices continued to transmit, with speeds of ~ 0.8 km h−1, plausibly due to ice drift, which is rapid in this region. Penguins remained within the seasonal sea ice throughout, staying within 100 km of land, and generally within 5 to 10 km of features (open water, polynyas, leads, icebergs) that offered potential access to the ocean. Penguins were unlikely to have been constrained by the extensive sea ice habitat in 2015/2016. Similar habitats would also have been available in most years of the satellite record (since 1979); however, the moult locations in 2015/2016 would not have been available in many years, and penguins would have needed to find alternative moult locations during some years. Despite uncertainties, the moult period is a critical time for emperor penguins, particularly as sea ice declines, potentially affecting adult survival. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Group-living animals, including penguins, exhibit affiliative behaviors such as grooming (preening) and proximity. Such behaviors in non-primate animals have been less studied than those in primates. Our research focused on 20 identifiable Humboldt penguins in a zoo, analyzing kin relationships and reciprocity in preening and proximity by employing a 5-minute scan sampling method to observe and record individual behavior. Our findings revealed that preening and proximity were more prevalent among mate pairs. However, among non-mate pairs, such behaviors were more commonly observed between siblings and parent-offspring pairs. Notably, the individuals preened on each other simultaneously in all instances. This study highlights the potential influence of kin selection in shaping the affiliative behavior of penguins. Additionally, our findings indicate that penguins gain benefits from mutual preening. This study contributes to our understanding of social behaviors in non-primate species and emphasizes the need for further comparative studies of various animal taxa to elucidate the evolution of sociality. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Only limited data on concentrations of trace elements in the blood of avian species have been published. This information can play an important role in the conservation of endangered species and their protection from environmental pollutants and can also be clinically relevant in managed individuals. Some elements are essential for the health of the animals in human care, but little is known about expected concentrations for some of these elements. Therefore, 21 elements (silver, arsenic, gold, barium, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, iodine, mercury, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, platinum, antimony, selenium, thallium, vanadium, and zinc) were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry in lithium-heparinized plasma samples from Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) from a single zoological collection in Germany (n = 39). The plasma concentrations of cadmium, nickel, platinum, antimony, and thallium were under the limit of detection in most of the analyzed samples. The results also showed that the females had significantly (P ≤ 0.05) higher concentrations of silver, barium, cobalt, chromium, iron, mercury, magnesium, vanadium, and zinc in their plasma in comparison with males. A correlation between the element plasma concentration and the age of the individuals could not be found. The differences in plasma concentrations of individual element between males and females could be due to hormonal influences on the metabolism. Further studies in different seasons and other age groups are needed in the future to investigate environmental and host effects in more detail and to understand physiological mechanisms responsible for observed differences.

ABSTRACT: Significant marine heatwaves (MHWs) developed along the Western Australian coast in 1999 and 2011. Despite ecosystem losses and the southwards occurrence of many tropical fish species during and after the extreme MHW in 2011, there have been few studies on the effects of this MHW on seabirds, and no biological impacts related to the 1999 MHW have been reported. Using data from 1986–2019, we investigated the impacts of these events on breeding outcomes, body condition, diet composition, population size and mortality of little penguins on Penguin Island, in the temperate waters off Western Australia. Breeding outcomes were negatively impacted by the MHWs but body condition was not. Diet composition changed after the MHW, with sandy sprat Hyperlophus vittatus, the penguins’ typical major prey component, replaced by scaly mackerel Sardinella lemuru, a tropical fish species. Using an open robust design analysis that accounts for imperfect capture probabilities and staggered annual arrival and departure dates, we found that the population decreased by 80% following the 2011 MHW. Finally, more penguins died from starvation or from novel protozoal parasitic infections in 2011 and 2012 that were potentially introduced with the changed diet. This research highlights that the temporal and spatial influence of MHWs on seabirds depends on several factors. Furthermore, the magnitude and direction of a prey species’ response can be very localised and have significant impacts on avian predators. There are no obvious ways to mediate climate effects, but perhaps measures taken to reduce any synergistic impacts on prey abundance, particularly during MHW events, could be effective. © Inter-Research 2024.

ABSTRACT: Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are crucial for conserving marine biodiversity, and assessing the effectiveness of boundaries in protecting marine species is essential. In the Southwest Atlantic Ocean, four MPAs have been created. In this study we evaluate the use of these MPAs by Southern Rockhopper Penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome) that nest at Isla de los Estados, Argentina during the pre-molt period in February and March 2020 by combining geolocation sensor data and spatial analysis together with stable isotopes analysis (δ13C and δ15N) to assess their spatial and trophic niches. We recaptured 16 of 25 adults to which loggers had been attached (64 % recapture rate, 6 females and 10 males). Penguins dispersed mainly southward and used the MPAs as corridors towards feeding area such as the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone (APFZ). We found no evidence of sex-specific spatial and trophic niche partitioning. To develop robust conservation strategies, future studies should span multiple years and enhanced sampling effort to comprehensively explore the pre-molt trophic ecology and at-sea distribution of Southern Rockhopper Penguins. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The prevalence of microplastics (MPs, <5 mm) in natural environments presents a formidable global environmental threat MPs can be found from the Arctic to Antarctica, including glaciers. Despite their widespread distribution, studies on MP accumulation in apex predators inhabiting Polar Regions remain limited. The objective of this study was to conduct a comprehensive examination, for the first time, of MP bioaccumulation in various organs and tissue of Adélie penguins. This investigation comprehends the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), scat, internal organ (lung, trachea, spleen, and liver) and tissue (muscle) samples collected from Svenner Island, Antarctica during the 39th Indian expedition to Antarctica in 2019–2020. Our analyses revealed the presence of 34 MPs across the GIT, scat, lung, and trachea samples, with no MPs detected in muscle, spleen, or liver tissues. Blue-colored microfibers (>50 %) and MPs smaller than 1 mm (38 %) in size were prominently observed. Polymer characterization utilizing μ-FTIR spectroscopy identified low-density polyethylene (LDPE) (~63 %) as the predominant polymer type. The accumulation of MP fibers in the gastrointestinal tract and scat of Adélie penguins may originate from marine ambient media and prey organisms. Furthermore, the presence of LDPE fibers in the trachea and lungs likely occurred through inhalation and subsequent deposition of MPs originating from both local and long-range airborne sources. The identification of fibers ranging between 20 and 100 μm within the trachea suggests a plausible chance of cellular deposition of MPs. Overall our findings provide valuable insights into the organ-specific accumulation of MPs in apex predators. Adélie penguins emerge as promising environmental bio-monitoring species, offering insights into the potential trophic transfer of MPs within frigid environments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Numerous penguins can propagate pathogens with antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) into Antarctica. However, the effects of penguin dissemination on the lake ARGs still have received little attention via guano deposition. Here, we have profiled ARGs in ornithogenic sediments subject to penguin guano (OLS) and nonornithogenic sediments (NOLS) from 16 lakes across Antarctica. A total of 191 ARGs were detected in all sediment samples, with a much higher abundance and diversity in OLS than in NOLS. Surprisingly, highly diverse and abundant ARGs were found in the OLS with a detection frequency of >40% and an absolute abundance of (2.34 × 109)-(4.98 × 109) copies g-1, comparable to those in coastal estuarine sediments and pig farms. The strong correlations of identified resistance genes with penguin guano input amount, environmental factors, mobile genetic elements, and bacterial community, in conjunction with network and redundancy analyses, all indicated that penguins were responsible for the dissemination and high enrichment of ARGs in lake sediments via the guano deposition, which might greatly outweigh local human-activity effects. Our results revealed that ARGs could be carried into lakes across the Antarctica through penguin migration, food chains, and guano deposition, which were closely connected with the widespread pollution of ARGs at the global scale. © 2024 American Chemical Society.

ABSTRACT: Environmental microbes routinely colonize wildlife body surface microbiota. However, animals experience dynamic environmental shifts throughout their daily routine. Yet, the effect of ecological shifts in wildlife body surface microbiota has been poorly explored. Here, we sequenced the hypervariable region V3–V4 of the 16S rRNA gene to characterize the body surface microbiota of wild Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) under two ecological contexts: (1) Penguins walking along the coast and (2) Penguins sheltered underground in their nest, across three subantarctic breeding colonies in the Magellan Strait, Chile. Despite ecological contexts, our results revealed that Moraxellaceae bacteria were the most predominant and abundant taxa associated with penguin body surfaces. Nevertheless, we detected colony-specific core bacteria associated with penguin bodies. The most abundant were: Deinococcus in the Contramaestre colony, Fusobacterium in the Tuckers 1 colony, and Clostridium sensu stricto 1 in the Tuckers 2 colony. Our results give a new perspective on the niche environmental hypothesis for wild seabirds. First, the ecological characteristics of each colony were associated with the microbial communities from the nest soil and the body surface of penguins inside the nests. For example, in the colonies with heterogenous vegetation cover (i.e. the Tuckers Islets), there was a similar microbial composition between the nest soil and the body surface of penguins. In contrast, on the more arid colony (Contramaestre), we detected differences in the microbial communities between the nest soil and the body surface of penguins. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Mercury (Hg) biomonitoring requires a precise understanding of the internal processes contributing to disparities between the Hg sources in the environment and the Hg measured in the biota. In this study, we investigated the use of Hg stable isotopes to trace Hg accumulation in Adélie and emperor penguin chicks from four breeding colonies in Antarctica. Interspecific variation of Δ199Hg in penguin chicks reflects the distinct foraging habitats and Hg exposures in adults. Chicks at breeding sites where adult penguins predominantly consumed mesopelagic prey showed relatively lower Δ199Hg values than chicks that were primarily fed epipelagic krill. Substantial δ202Hg variations in chick tissues were observed in both species (Adélie: −0.11 to 1.13‰, emperor: −0.27 to 1.15‰), whereas only emperor penguins exhibited the lowest δ202Hg in the liver and the highest in the feathers. Our results indicate that tissue-specific δ202Hg variations and their positive correlations with % MeHg resulted from MeHg demethylation in the liver and kidneys of emperor penguin chicks, whereas Adélie penguin chicks showed different internal responses depending on their exposure to dietary MeHg. This study highlights the importance of considering intra- and interspecific variations in adult foraging ecology and MeHg demethylation when selecting penguin chicks for Hg biomonitoring. © 2024 American Chemical Society.

ABSTRACT: Adélie penguins are considered indicators of Antarctic ecosystems. Their populations have declined by more than 50% in the West Antarctic Peninsula, an area strongly affected by global warming, and that concentrates most of Antarctic krill harvesting. The use of high-resolution data to identify foraging areas regularly used by krill predators could provide valuable information for current discussions on the development of small-scale management and conservation measures for this region. We used information on the foraging trips of 57 individuals breeding in King George Island, tracked over 2019/2020, 2020/2021 and 2021/2022 breeding seasons during the chick-rearing stage, to identify their key foraging areas. Using an accelerometry-based latent behavioral analysis approach, we identified an area within 10 km of the colony consistently used by over 60% of the population throughout and between seasons. We also observed that almost 20% of the population uses the area near a seamount located 35 km from the colony for foraging, mainly during the late guarding phase when chick energy demands are highest or the effects of prey depletion might become more evident. The distances and duration of trips and the area explored increased as the season progressed and varied between seasons, consistent with annual differences in krill availability observed in the region. Foraging dives comprise roughly 40% of the dives performed during foraging trips, irrespective of the stage of the chick-rearing period, or the season analyzed. Our results emphasize the need to understand how variability in environmental conditions, prey availability, and energetic demands affect how predators use space, and the role that bathymetric features might play in providing reliable foraging grounds, for penguins, in a rapidly changing region. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

ABSTRACT: Historical data on chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica) breeding population sizes are sparse and sometimes highly uncertain, making it hard to estimate true population trajectories. Yet, information on population trends is desirable as changes in population size can help inform conservation assessments. Recently, Krüger (2023) (Diversity 2023, 15, 327) used chinstrap penguin nest count data to predict breeding colony size trends between 1960 and 2020, to estimate whether the level of population change within three generations exceeded IUCN Red List Criteria for “Vulnerable” populations. Chinstrap penguin population trends are an important research topic, but we caution that Krüger (2023)’s statistical analyses (intended to form the foundation for drawing valid, evidence-based inferences from sparse data) contain fundamental errors that invalidate that paper’s findings. We discuss oversights in several key steps (data processing, exploratory data analysis, model fitting, model evaluation, and prediction) of that paper’s analysis to help others detect and avoid some of the pitfalls associated with estimating population trends via mixed models. We also show through reanalysis that improved statistical modelling can yield better predictions of chinstrap penguin population trends, at least within the range of observed data. This case study highlights (1) the profound influence that seemingly minor differences in modelling procedures (both unintentional errors and other decisions) can have on predictions of population trends, and (2) the substantial inherent uncertainty in population trend predictions derived from sparse, heterogenous data. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Breeding seabirds are required to balance between feeding their chicks and maintaining their body condition. Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae), a keystone species of the Antarctic ecosystem, have foraging behavioral flexibility that depends on the marine environment and own body condition. This study collected tracking data and weight measurements from 47 brooding penguins during two breeding seasons at Cape Hallett (72°19´S, 170°12´E), Ross Sea. In 2021, the breeding season with a high sea ice concentration, penguins had lower body weights during the early guarding period compared to the body weights of the penguins in 2022. Penguins performed three types of foraging trips - ice hole trips, ice edge trips, and pack ice trips—during the 2021 breeding season. However, in the season characterized by a low sea ice concentration (2022), most of the foraging trips were pack ice trips. Furthermore, penguins performed relatively shorter pack ice trips and had lower foraging efforts than they did in 2021. On the other hand, we found that penguins with higher initial weights lost more weight, where for every additional 1 kg of weight, individuals lost 360 g more during the tracking period. We suggest that penguins use selective foraging strategies to adapt to their situation. Additionally, they regulate their food intake for raising chicks based on their body condition. In summary, our findings suggest how Adélie penguins determine foraging strategies and allocating food according to the marine environment and their body condition. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Zoos often alter social groups by moving individuals between collections to control numbers, maintain optimal genetic diversity, and for husbandry and management purposes. However, the impact of introducing new individuals into an existing social group is overlooked, and the consequences of these stressful events from an animal welfare perspective are underestimated. In this study, we use Social Network Analysis (SNA) to monitor and to investigate how the social dynamics of a colony of African penguins (Spheniscus demersus, n = 19) were affected by the introduction of groups of unfamiliar individuals (n = 6 and then n = 10) at different time intervals. The proximity data collected over a period of four months suggest that penguins established a non-random association and developed a significant level of preferred associations within the colony. Breeding pairs had a high degree of interaction with the rest of the colony, and their level of association was stable even when a new group was introduced. We found that the association preferences observed in the colony after introduction were not driven by sex and reproductive age. Instead, the main driver of association was the time of introduction, with individuals introduced at the same time being more likely to interact than those introduced at different times. We also speculate that, in addition to arrival time, familiarity plays a key role in group integration. In our specific case, the introduced penguins were already familiar with each other, having shared the same colony before arriving at the new one. Although the results are based on a case study and require further validation, they support the importance of maintaining relevant social ties within colonies and of relocating a few selected individuals who share prior familiarity to facilitate integration into a new colony. Our findings highlight the usefulness of implementing SNA to evaluate the impact of stressful events on the lives of animals. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) are under increasing environmental pressure. Monitoring colony size and population trends of this Antarctic seabird relies primarily on satellite imagery recorded near the end of the breeding season, when light conditions levels are sufficient to capture images, but colony occupancy is highly variable. To correct population estimates for this variability, we develop a phenological model that can predict the number of breeding pairs and fledging chicks, as well as key phenological events such as arrival, hatching and foraging times, from as few as six data points from a single season. The ability to extrapolate occupancy from sparse data makes the model particularly useful for monitoring remotely sensed animal colonies where ground-based population estimates are rare or unavailable. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exhibit widespread global distribution, extending to remote regions including Antarctica. Despite potential adverse effects on seabirds, PFAS exposure among Antarctic penguins remains poorly studied. We investigated the occurrence of 29 PFAS compounds in feathers and excreta of Gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) from Fildes Bay, Antarctica. Sample collection was conducted during the austral summer (February 2015) and analyzed by Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem ES (−) mass spectrometry. The results showed that adults tend to accumulate more PFOA, PFPeS and NaDONA than chicks, with PFOA emerging as the predominant compound in feathers. The compounds PFHxA, PFDoDA, PFBS, PFOS, 4:2 FTS, 6:2 FTS, and PFEESA were only detected in penguin excreta, indicating that they are not absorbed into the organism. The detection of PFAS in penguin feathers and excreta not only indicates local contamination but also reaffirms the far-reaching impact of anthropogenic pollutants. This study presents the first documented occurrence of NaDONA in Antarctica, despite its status as a regulatory-compliant alternative to legacy PFAS compounds—a finding that needs deeper attention. The data can serve as a base for further research to understand the full extent of PFAS contamination and its implications for Antarctic wildlife and ecosystems. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Byssus is a unique external structure in sessile bivalves and is critical for settlement and metamorphosis. However, little is known about the stout byssus in Pteria penguin. We explored the byssus structure and proteins using scanning electron microscopy and proteomics, respectively. The results revealed that P. penguin byssus has a dense and highly aligned fiber inner core, and the outer cuticle contains protein granules embedded in the protein matrix. Proteomic analysis revealed 31 proteins in the byssus, among which 15 differentially expressed proteins were mainly enriched in the EGF/EGF-like and laminin EGF-like domains. Foot proteins were enriched in the EF-hand, immunoglobulin, and fibronectin domains. All these domains can participate in protein-protein and/or protein-metal interactions in the extracellular matrix (ECM), which, together with the seven types of ECM proteins detected in the byssus, supports the hypothesis that the byssus is derived from the ECM. We also found that in vitro acellular structures of the byssus and the shell shared commonalities in their formation processes. These results are useful for further understanding byssus evolution and the characterization of byssus-related proteins. Significance: This manuscript investigates the structure and the origin of Pteria penguin byssus, given that byssus is vital to provide critical protection for reproduction and even against environmental stresses that affect survival. However, there is rare research on byssus protein composition. Hence, though scanning electron microscopy and proteomic analysis, we discovered that P. penguin byssus possesses the dense and highly aligned fiber inner core, and the outer cuticle has protein granules embedded in the protein matrix. Proteomic analysis showed that there were 31 proteins in the byssus, among which 15 proteins were mainly enriched in the EGF/EGF-like and laminin EGF-like domains. Foot proteins closely related to byssus formation were enriched in EF hand, immunoglobulin, and fibronectin domains. These domains are able to participate in protein-protein and/or protein-metal interactions in the extracellular matrix (ECM), which together with the seven types of ECM proteins detected in byssus support the hypothesis that byssus derive from the ECM. We also found in vitro acellular structures the byssus and the shell share commonalities in their formation processes. These results were useful for further understanding the byssus evolution and the characterization of the byssus-related proteins. © 2024

ABSTRACT: We studied the migration of Magellanic penguins near the southern tip of the breeding distribution, and for the first time found evidence of partial migration for this species within the same colony. Forty-three percent of the penguins studied stayed within ~ 290 km of the colony (residents), while others went northwards as far as 2000 km. All penguins spent the same amount of time at sea and traveled similar total distances, but residents experienced colder waters (2°C lower) and habitats with lower Chlorophyll-a concentrations than migrants. The two habitats are inhabited by different prey items, consequently offering the penguins distinct prey options. We have shown high variability in the non-breeding dispersion behavior of Magellanic penguins within the same colony; nonetheless, further research is required to understand the proximate and ultimate causes, and the consequences, of this behavior. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Penguins are proficient swimmers, and their survival depends on their ability to catch prey. The diving behaviour of these fascinating birds should then minimize the associated energy cost. For the first time, the energy cost of penguin dives is computed from the free-ranging dive data, on the basis of an existing biomechanical model. Time-resolved acceleration and depth data collected for 300 dives of little penguins (Eudyptula minor) are specifically employed to compute the bird dive angles and swimming speeds, which are needed for the energy estimate. We find that the numerically obtained energy cost by using the free-ranging dive data is not far from the minimum cost predicted by the model. The outcome, therefore, supports the physical soundness of the chosen model; however, it also suggests that, for closer agreement, one should consider previously neglected effects, such as those due to water currents and those associated with motion unsteadiness. Additionally, from the free-ranging dive data, we calculate hydrodynamic forces and non-dimensional indicators of propulsion performance ‒ Strouhal and Reynolds numbers. The obtained values further confirm that little penguins employ efficient propulsion mechanisms, in agreement with previous investigations. © 2024. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

ABSTRACT: In this work, we report long-term trends in the abundance and breeding performance of Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) nesting in three Antarctic colonies (i.e., at Martin Point, South Orkneys Islands; Stranger Point/Cabo Funes, South Shetland Islands; and Esperanza/Hope Bay in the Antarctic Peninsula) from 1995/96 to 2022/23. Using yearly count data of breeding groups selected, we observed a decline in the number of breeding pairs and chicks in crèche at all colonies studied. However, the magnitude of change was higher at Stranger Point than that in the remaining colonies. Moreover, the index of breeding success, which was calculated as the ratio of chicks in crèche to breeding pairs, exhibited no apparent trend throughout the study period. However, it displayed greater variability at Martin Point compared to the other two colonies under investigation. Although the number of chicks in crèche of Adélie penguins showed a declining pattern, the average breeding performance was similar to that reported in gentoo penguin colonies, specifically, those undergoing a population increase (even in sympatric colonies facing similar local conditions). Consequently, it is plausible to assume a reduction of the over-winter survival as a likely cause of the declining trend observed, at least in the Stranger Point and Esperanza colonies. However, we cannot rule out local effects during the breeding season affecting the Adélie population of Martin Point. © 2024, Editorial Office of Advances in Polar Science. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The Emperor Penguin Aptenodytes forsteri is the largest living species of penguin, found exclusively in Antarctica, and is unique in breeding during the winter. Consequently, fewer anatomical studies have been conducted on this species over time compared to others. This study aims to provide an updated and comprehensive description of the hindlimb musculature of Aptenodytes forsteri. The muscles of the thigh, shank and foot were compared along postnatal development. The results were compared with the muscles of swimming and diving birds and also with ground-dwelling taxa. By dissecting seven specimens, the origin and insertion were described in newborns, chicks and juveniles. Of the 37 muscles recognized, 19 correspond to the thigh, 14 to the shank, and four to the foot. Notably, the hindlimb muscles appear relatively developed compared to the overall body size in the newborns, showing considerable development in independent chicks, and reached full growth in the juvenile. The m. flexor hallucis brevis, m. extensor hallucis longus and m. lumbricalis were absent in all specimens, whereas the m. femorotibialis lateralis was found in only one specimen. Additionally, a branch of the m. flexor cruris medialis, originating in the abdominal area and merging with the pelvic portion before insertion, was observed in the newborn chicks. Aptenodytes forsteri showed similarities with Numida meleagris in the insertion of m. iliofibularis, and m. flexor cruris lateralis p. pelvica. These findings, along with other comparative results, constitute the first comprehensive descriptive study of the hindlimb musculature of Aptenodytes forsteri, including different ontogenetic stages. © 2025 Anatomical Society.

ABSTRACT: Pododermatitis is common in penguins kept under human care. Substrate optimization plays an important role in prevention and treatment; however, there is limited information on biomechanical properties of commonly used substrates on penguin feet. The objectives were to test the ability of different substrates to decrease weight loading on the central metatarsal pad of penguin feet in an ex vivo model using feet with and without bumblefoot harvested from two Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) cadavers. Penguin feet were attached to a digital force gauge mounted onto a stand for compression testing at 2.5 and 5 kg. Forces at the central metatarsal pad were measured in triplicate using small force sensors. Tested substrates included five granular surfaces (sand, wet sand, pea gravel, wet pea gravel, and crushed ice), three compliant surfaces (short-leaf Astroturf, long-leaf Astroturf, and neoprene), and three firm surfaces (tile, rubber drainage mat, and 3M Safety-Walk Wet Area Matting). Data were analyzed using linear mixed models. There were multifaceted effects of applied pressures, substrate surfaces, and pododermatitis on central metatarsal measured pressures. In general, doubling compression forces resulted in higher measured pressures in all firm and compliant surfaces but not in granular surfaces. Firm surfaces were associated with higher recorded plantar pressures at 2.5 kg, but different significance groupings emerged at 5 kg with a high-, medium-, and low-pressure cluster of surfaces. Pododermatitis lesions resulted in significant alterations in statistical significance clustering among substrate surfaces and unique substrate behaviors. The results of this study could help in making recommendations pertaining to foot health for penguin exhibits.

ABSTRACT: African penguins are among the most threatened seabird species globally and an African Penguin Biodiversity Management Plan (BMP) published in 2013 guides conservation strategies to prevent their extinction. To counter the impact of past guano exploitation which reduced the nesting habitat of these burrowing seabirds, rendering them vulnerable to predators and extreme weather events, a suite of artificial nests was deployed in various colonies over the past decades with varying success. The BMP called for new nest designs to maximise breeding output. This study assesses African penguin breeding success over the past 14 years in four types of artificial nests and in natural nests at all major colonies in South Africa. Overall, artificial nests outperformed natural nests and successfully increased breeding output of African penguins by 16.5% (95% CI: 6.7–26.2). No design was, however, consistently most effective across locations. For example, fibreglass nests had the poorest hatching success of all nest types at one colony (Bird Island), but outperformed cement nests at another (Boulders Beach). The latest design of double-layered ceramic nests tended to perform better than other artificial nests, although not consistently at all colonies and occupancy rates were low in some areas. Practical implication. The deployment of artificial nests proved to be a successful conservation measure for African penguins although the variety of habitats in the different colonies seems to have prevented a one solution-fits-all approach. The consistent poor breeding output in some areas in all nest types (<30% at the mainland colony in Simons' Town and the islands in Algoa Bay) further calls for colony-specific conservation strategies beyond artificial nests, while the continuous decline in African penguin numbers globally calls for broader measures urgently, primarily increasing access to their forage fish prey. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Plastics are one of the major forms of anthropogenic pollution. This waste can affect the individual survival in many species, including seabirds. The Southern Ocean ecosystems are thought to be less affected by this pollution, due to the low human presence and the natural protective barrier provided by southern oceanic fronts. Here, we report the first observation of macroplastic ingestion in two dead King penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) in the Crozet archipelago located south of these fronts. There is no evidence that the macroplastic fragments found in their stomach were the direct cause of death. We suggest that they were ingested by being confused with stones they used for food grinding. Although it is difficult to assess the local or distant origin of these macroplastics, efforts to collect waste from sites as remote as the subantarctic islands must become standard practice to ensure that such ingestions do not become commonplace. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Antarctica is one of the most remote regions on the planet, where many species of penguins inhabit. One of these species is the Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae), which occupies a high trophic level. Blood is an important indicator of short-term exposure to mercury (Hg) in avian species, however there are few publications investigating methylmercury (MeHg) in Antarctic penguin blood. During the austral summer of 2016, thirty adult specimens of Adélie penguins were captured at three locations of the King George Island and the north-west Antarctic Peninsula. This study determined by atomic fluorescence spectroscopy, Hg levels in the blood of adult Adélie penguins. Concentrations of MeHg ranged from 22.0 to 323.3 (ng/g dw), while concentrations of total Hg (THg) ranged from 31.9 to 410.1 (ng/g dw). To our knowledge, this is the first study to report MeHg levels in the blood of adult Adélie penguins in these locations. The results showed that the highest Hg levels were found where human activities are more prevalent. Future studies are needed to determine the actual impact of these activities on local Hg contamination. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Like many polar animals, emperor penguin populations are challenging to monitor because of the species’ life history and remoteness. Consequently, it has been difficult to establish its global status, a subject important to resolve as polar environments change. To advance our understanding of emperor penguins, we combined remote sensing, validation surveys and using Bayesian modelling, we estimated a comprehensive population trajectory over a recent 10-year period, encompassing the entirety of the species’ range. Reported as indices of abundance, our study indicates with 81% probability that there were fewer adult emperor penguins in 2018 than in 2009, with a posterior median decrease of 9.6% (95% credible interval (CI) −26.4% to +9.4%). The global population trend was −1.3% per year over this period (95% CI = −3.3% to +1.0%) and declines probably occurred in four of eight fast ice regions, irrespective of habitat conditions. Thus far, explanations have yet to be identified regarding trends, especially as we observed an apparent population uptick toward the end of time series. Our work potentially establishes a framework for monitoring other Antarctic coastal species detectable by satellite, while promoting a need for research to better understand factors driving biotic changes in the Southern Ocean ecosystem. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (BCL2), an anti-apoptotic factor in the mitochondrial regulatory pathway of apoptosis, is critically important in immune defenses. In this study, a novel BCL2 gene was characterized from Pteria penguin (P. penguin). The PpBCL2 was 1482 bp long, containing an open reading frame (ORF) of 588 bp encoding 195 amino acids. Four highly conserved BCL-2 homology (BH) domains were found in PpBCL2. Amino acid alignment and phylogenetic tree showed that PpBCL2 had the highest similarity with BCL2 of Crassostrea gigas at 65.24 %. Tissue expression analysis showed that PpBCL2 had high constitutive expression in gill, digestive diverticulum and mantle, and was significantly increased 72 h of Vibrio parahaemolyticus (V. parahaemolyticus) challenge in these immune tissues. Furthermore, PpBCL2 silencing significantly inhibited antimicrobial activity of hemolymph supernatant by 1.4-fold, and significantly reduced the survival rate by 51.7 % at 72 h post infection in P. penguin. These data indicated that PpBCL2 played an important role in immune response of P. penguin against V. parahaemolyticus infection. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Understanding the relative contributions of environmental, behavioural and social factors to reproductive success is crucial for predicting population dynamics of seabirds. However, these factors are often studied in isolation, limiting our ability to evaluate their combined influence. This study investigates how marine environmental variables, foraging behaviour and social factors (divorce), influence reproductive success in little penguins (Eudyptula minor) over 13 breeding seasons. By examining these factors together, we aimed to identify which is the most reliable predictor of population-level reproductive success. We found that divorce rate was the most consistent predictor of reproductive success, with lower annual rates of divorce preceding the breeding season associated with higher hatching and fledging success. Foraging trip duration also influenced reproductive success, but in contrasting ways: Longer trips during egg incubation were linked with increased hatching success, while shorter trips after hatching led to higher fledging success. Marine environmental conditions had unexpected effects, with a lower Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) correlating with improved hatching and fledging success, in contrast to previous research, while sea surface temperature (SST) had no significant effect on reproductive success. This highlights the complexity of seabird breeding responses to large-scale oceanographic indices, suggesting SOI and SST are generally less reliable measures to use as indicators of reproductive success. Our results suggest that divorce rate could serve as a valuable, noninvasive index of reproductive success in seabirds. © 2025 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The use of artificial structures by seabirds is a globally recognized phenomenon driven by escalating human coastal development. Designed as maritime infrastructure, breakwaters, jetties, and bridges inadvertently offer nesting habitat and refuge for a diverse assemblage of seabird species. The construction of a detached breakwater at the port terminal of the PERU LNG natural gas liquefaction plant in Melchorita, Peru, provided a unique opportunity to observe seabird colonization of new habitat, in this case colonization by Humboldt Penguins Spheniscus humboldti from 2008 to 2024. The penguins founded a permanent breeding site within 3.5 years after cessation of human activity at the site, which had provided protection from terrestrial predators and human interference. Between 2012 and 2021, penguin numbers increased to 2091 birds, peaking during the January molt, although numbers fluctuated. By 2021, the breakwater harbored a substantial proportion of the penguin population in Peru. The breakwater exemplifies the potential of artificial structures in mitigating habitat loss and supporting seabird conservation, underscoring the need for proactive management strategies amidst escalating coastal development and environmental challenges. © 2024, Marine Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: According to the ‘selfish herd’ hypothesis, most seabird species breed colonially so that individuals can decrease their risk of predation by forming compact groups. However, costs and benefits associated with colonial breeding may not be evenly distributed among individuals within a colony. At Adélie penguin colonies, individuals nesting on the periphery of subcolonies (distinct groups of nests) may experience higher rates of nest predation by south polar skuas, and thus the optimal aggregation pattern for Adélie penguins may be within groups that minimize the proportion of edge nests. Nevertheless, some penguins choose to nest solitarily, at significant distances from conspecifics. We tracked 50 of these “solitary-nesting” Adélie penguins at Cape Crozier, a large colony on Ross Island, during the 2021 nesting season and compared their breeding success to individuals nesting within subcolony boundaries. We found that both solitary and subcolony nests successfully raised chicks large enough to join crèches and left unattended by adults. However, chicks from solitary nests exhibited a rate of mortality more than six times higher during the transition from nest brooding/guarding to crèche stage. In the 2022 nesting season, we found that solitary nests which had previously hosted actively breeding penguins were more likely to be re-occupied. Solitary nesting therefore appears to be a less-successful alternative to breeding within subcolonies, but enough individuals could be successful with this approach to maintain the apparently disadvantageous behavior and effectively pioneer previously unused locations, possibly including eventual new colony locations. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Group-living animals must coordinate their behaviour to maintain group cohesion. Therefore, documenting when and how wild animals coordinate their behaviour in groups is important for inferring the cost of collective behaviour. However, previous field studies focused on certain species exhibiting strong social relationships, and limited information is available on species that form fluid groups, which may show different behavioural coordination. Here, using biologging, we examined the stability and mechanism of group cohesion in Adélie penguins, Pygoscelis adeliae, travelling on sea ice. GPS tracking showed that two or three birds in each of three groups departed the colony at the same time, travelled together for several hours and reached the ice edge simultaneously. In all groups, penguins achieved a consensus on travelling speed, maintaining group cohesion until reaching the ice edge. We collected records of three-axis acceleration for a group of three birds, which allowed us to classify their behaviours (resting, walking or tobogganing) and examine behavioural coordination among the group members in detail. Two possible mechanisms of synchronous travelling were speculated. First, the group members match their timing of resting, suggesting that the onset of resting of an individual is followed by that of the others. Second, locomotion modes (walking/tobogganing) and locomotion speed in each mode while travelling in groups differ between individuals. To maintain group cohesion, penguins may adjust either the speed in each locomotion mode or the proportional use of the locomotion mode to match the overall travelling speed. Additionally, the tracked penguins alternated their relative spatial positions and the order of synchronous resting initiation, suggesting mutual social influences. Overall, Adélie penguins actively maintain group cohesion with occasional members by mutually coordinating their behaviours while travelling in groups on sea ice. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: In the nutrient-limited Antarctic terrestrial habitat, penguins transfer a significant amount of nutrients from the marine to the terrestrial ecosystem through their depositions (i.e., guano). This guano influences soil physicochemical properties, leading to the formation of ornithogenic soil rich in nutrients and organic matter. We hypothesize that soil prokaryotic communities will be strongly influenced by the contribution of nitrogenous nutrients from penguin rookeries, maintaining the influence over long distances. The objective was to establish how the soil prokaryotic diversity and community structure change with distance from a penguin colony, which provides large amounts of guano and nitrogenous compounds, and to study the effects of these nutrients on the functional role of these communities. Methods include volcanic soil sampling along a 1200 m transect from the penguin active rookery and the characterization of soil nutrient content and soil prokaryotic communities using 16S rRNA high-throughput amplicon sequencing. In contrast to our hypothesis, the results showed that the impact of guano from the penguin colony was restricted to the first 300 m. Probably because the penguin rookery was sheltered, strong wind and wind direction did not affect the transport of nutrients from the penguin rookery. Areas close to the penguin rookery were dominated by Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, while areas situated further away were dominated by Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadetes, Nitrospirae, and Planctomycetes. Beta diversity analysis among the soil prokaryotic communities revealed a high degree of community heterogeneity, strongly associated with N compound characteristics (NH4, NO3, and %N), C, and pH. Inferences from N metabolism genes suggest a high potential of the microbial community for dissimilatory nitrate reduction genes (DNRA) to ammonium, assimilatory nitrate reduction (ANR), and denitrification. Although it is assumed that the nitrogenous compounds of the penguin colonies reach long distances and affect the prokaryotic community, this effect can vary with wind directions or the morphology of the site, reducing the impact of the guano over long distances, as our results indicate. On the other hand, functional predictions give some clues about the main actors in nitrogen cycling, through processes like dissimilatory nitrate reduction, assimilatory nitrate reduction, and denitrification. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

ABSTRACT: The links between foraging success, foraging effort and diet in a myctophid specialist seabird, the King Penguin Aptenodytes patagonicus, were investigated during seven breeding seasons using tracking and isotopic data. Despite the variable foraging conditions encountered by the birds, isotopic signatures (a proxy for diet) were invariable throughout the study. On the other hand, penguins stayed longer at sea when the foraging success indices (i.e. prey capture attempts per day and mass gained per day) were low. Although King Penguins can compensate for low prey capture rates by increasing foraging effort, their specialist diet during reproduction makes the species particularly sensitive to prey availability, with its conservation tightly linked to its main prey. © 2023 British Ornithologists' Union.

ABSTRACT: Penguins are critical indicator species for detecting changes in the Antarctic ecosystem. As climate change impacts the Antarctic environment, the distribution of penguin breeding populations is also shifting. In the Antarctic Peninsula region, several penguin species’ breeding areas overlap. Given the isolated location of penguin colonies, remote sensing data are essential to detect large-scale changes in their distribution and species composition. While it is established that remote sensing data can effectively monitor penguin breeding populations during the breeding season, species differentiation remains challenging due to their similar appearance. The aim of this study is to explore the possibilities and limitations of species discrimination in aerial optical imagery, particularly using very high-resolution aerial imagery. We investigate the spatial resolution required to distinguish species based on their phenotype. Additionally, we explore the possibility and reliability of discriminating species by analysing differences in guano cover appearance, spatial distribution of individuals, posture, and the presence of chicks. Our findings indicate that differentiation is feasible for nearly all the investigated distinguishing features, although the reliability and spatial resolution requirements of the aerial images vary significantly. Consequently, these results enable specific flight planning for optimal species discrimination under the given conditions and serve as the basis for future automated mapping of penguin species using machine learning, facilitating early detection of changes. © 2024 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Ornithogenic sediment may contain important paleoecological information concerning past bird population dynamics. In this paper, we analyse the distribution of n-alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in two sedimentary profiles collected from abandoned penguin colonies at Cape Bird, Ross Island, Antarctica. The geochronology of the sediment profiles was determined using 210Pb and AMS 14C dating techniques, and spans the past 1500 years. We observe low levels of n-alkanes (0.93–2.67 μg g−1) and PAHs (20.5–46.8 ng g−1) concentrations dominated by short-chain n-alkanes, low-molecular-weight and alkyl PAHs. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) shows that the PC 1 scores for n-alkanes and PAHs are significantly correlated with the input intensity of penguin guano and penguin bioelements. Using these proxies in combination with Generalized Additive Model (GAM), we reveal that breeding penguin population growth reaches a historical peak during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) prior to 1550 CE. This growth in population size corresponds to the extent of sea ice cover and the activity of the local atmospheric-ocean circulation. Warming induced by El Niño and the positive phase of the Southern Annular Mode, along with the expansion of ice-free zones and increased oceanic nutrient and food availability, are considered primary factors contributing to the growth of breeding penguin populations. Additionally, variations in sea ice extent and Amundsen Sea Low significantly influence penguin population dynamics. Our study suggests that n-alkanes and PAHs may be valuable organic proxies for reconstructing historical changes in breeding penguin populations, with the local sea ice extent and atmospheric-oceanic circulation exerting a major influence on Antarctic penguin population dynamics. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The egg production of captive African penguins differs considerably between individuals. An understanding of the physiological differences in African penguins with relatively greater and lesser egg production is meaningful for the captive breeding program of this endangered species. The objective of this study was to investigate differential microbial composition and metabolites in captive African penguins with different egg production. Fecal samples were collected from captive female African penguins during the breeding season. The results of 16 S rRNA gene sequencing showed that African penguins with different egg production had similar microbial diversities, whereas a significant difference was observed between their microbial community structure. African penguins with relatively greater egg production exhibited a higher relative abundance of Alphaproteobacteria, Rhizobiales, Bradyrhizobiaceae, Bradyrhizobium and Bosea. Meanwhile, penguins with relatively lesser egg production had an increased proportion of Klebsiella and Plesiomonas. We further identified a total of 1858 metabolites in female African penguins by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Among these metabolites, 13 kinds of metabolites were found to be significantly differential between African penguins with different egg production. In addition, the correlation analysis revealed that the egg production had significant correlations with most of the differential microbial bacteria and metabolites. Our findings might aid in understanding the potential mechanism underlying the phenomenon of abnormal egg production in captive African penguins, and provide novel insights into the relationship between gut microbiota and reproduction in penguins. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The African penguin population has declined precipitously in recent decades, and if current rates of decline persist, this species could become extinct in the wild by 2035. Resource extraction of small pelagic fish prey by the purse-seine fishery around African penguin breeding colonies has been identified as a demographically meaningful threat to African penguins. Consequently, long-term, effective no-take zones around breeding colonies have been endorsed by an expert panel of scientists constituted by the South African government. Here, we consider the six largest South African penguin colonies that currently hold 76% of the global population. We evaluate the adequacy of different no-take zone options using a trade-off mechanism recommended by the expert panel. For all six colonies except Bird Island, Algoa Bay, which is subject to the least fishing pressure, the current no-take zone delineations are assessed as having little benefit to the African penguin and little to no cost to the purse-seine fishery. Four of the six current no-take zones include ≤50% of the African penguins' core foraging areas. Alternative no-take zones that approximate a more balanced trade-off offer more impactful alternatives to the current fisheries restrictions. Given the urgent need to implement evidence-based conservation interventions for the endangered African penguin, we recommend the substitution of the current no-take zones with those proposed herein.  © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Anthropogenic activities generate increasing disturbance in wildlife especially in extreme environments where species have to cope with rapid environmental changes. In Antarctica, while studies on human disturbance have mostly focused on stress response through physiological and behavioral changes, local variability in population dynamics has been addressed more scarcely. In addition, the mechanisms by which breeding communities are affected around research stations remain unclear. Our study aims at pointing out the fine-scale impact of human infrastructures on the spatial variability in Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) colonies dynamics. Taking 24 years of population monitoring, we modeled colony breeding success and growth rate in response to both anthropic and land-based environmental variables. Building density around colonies was the second most important variable explaining spatial variability in breeding success after distance from skua nests, the main predators of penguins on land. Building density was positively associated with penguins breeding success. We discuss how buildings may protect penguins from avian predation and environmental conditions. The drivers of colony growth rate included topographical variables and the distance to human infrastructures. A strong correlation between 1-year lagged growth rate and colony breeding success was coherent with the use of public information by penguins to select their initial breeding site. Overall, our study brings new insights about the relative contribution and ecological implications of human presence on the local population dynamics of a sentinel species in Antarctica. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

ABSTRACT: Multiplex spatial proteomic methodologies can provide a unique perspective on the molecular and cellular composition of complex biological systems. Several challenges are associated to the analysis of imaging data, specifically in regard to the normalization of signal-to-noise ratios across images and subtracting background noise. However, there is a lack of user-friendly solutions for denoising multiplex imaging data that can be applied to large datasets. We have developed PENGUIN –Percentile Normalization GUI Image deNoising: a straightforward image preprocessing tool for multiplexed spatial proteomics data. Compared to existing approaches, PENGUIN distinguishes itself by eliminating the need for manual annotation or machine learning models. It effectively preserves signal intensity differences while reducing noise, improving downstream tasks such as cell segmentation and phenotyping. PENGUIN's simplicity, speed, and intuitive interface, available as both a script and a Jupyter notebook, make it easy to adjust image processing parameters, providing a user-friendly experience. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of PENGUIN by comparing it to conventional image processing techniques and solutions tailored for multiplex imaging data. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Several studies have examined the potential impacts of climate change on the abundance and distribution of Antarctic penguin species, particularly in the genus Pygoscelis. However, less attention has been given to traditionally sub-Antarctic penguin species. The Macaroni Penguin (Eudyptes chrysolophus) is one such sub-Antarctic species whose presence in Antarctica has historically been restricted to colonies on the South Shetland Islands and adjacent islands, but their status in the region has not been updated in decades. We compiled census data on all known Macaroni Penguin breeding colonies in the Antarctic Peninsula region in order to estimate the total Antarctic population. We estimate a population of 8053 breeding pairs for the region, which represents an approximately 10.7% increase since the last regional census in 1993. We identify local population changes at different colonies in comparison to historical census data. We also identify vagrant sightings in the region, as they may reflect prospecting of new breeding habitat, especially as ice-free areas continue to expand due to climate change. Our assessment identifies the South Shetland Islands and South Orkney Islands as notable data gaps. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

ABSTRACT: Coastal developments are ever-expanding and increasing the use of artificial lights within marine environments. Yet there is conflicting research on the impact of artificial lights on seabirds. Here, we experimentally investigated the impacts of artificial white lights on the behaviours (arrival time, group size, number of groups and vigilance) of breeding Little Penguins Eudyptula minor. Little Penguins are central-place foragers that spend daylight hours foraging at sea and return to their breeding colony after sunset to attend to their chicks or relieve their incubating partners. We exposed Little Penguins returning to their colony at night to either (1) a self-sustaining white LED floodlight or (2) a control system with a decoy light turned ‘off’. We used two different landing sites (site 1, site 2) that differed in landscape characteristics to assess whether behavioural responses to light were site-specific. Little Penguins arrived in larger groups at the landing site 2. Regardless of site, we observed fewer groups that arrived earlier when the light was ‘on’. The effects of artificial light (or ‘lack of artificial light’) on the vigilance of Little Penguins were site-specific, with Little Penguins spending proportionally more time in vigilance when the light was ‘off’ at site 2 compared with site 1. Our results support the idea that artificial lights produced from coastal developments can alter penguin behaviours, but that the effects of artificial lights can be context-dependent and need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Herpesviruses are associated with disease in many penguin species. Herpesvirus-associated lesions can cause significant morbidity and mortality in penguins and have been identified in African penguins (Spheniscus demersus), Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti), and a little blue penguin (Eudyptula minor) infected with spheniscid alphaherpesvirus 1 (SpAHV1). Further investigation is necessary to understand the impact of herpesviruses on penguin health, but there are no rapid, sensitive, and specific methods for detecting and quantifying herpesviral load. We therefore developed a quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay for the detection of SpAHV1 in penguins. TaqMan primer-probes targeting the DNA polymerase gene were designed using a commercial software program. Inter- and intra-assay variability, dynamic range, limit of detection, and analytical specificity were assessed. We used our assay to analyze previously collected field samples from Punta San Juan, Peru, in which conventional consensus PCR had detected one SpAHV1-positive penguin sample. Our qPCR assay was highly specific for SpAHV1. It had a dynamic range of 107–101 target copies per reaction and performed with high efficiency and low intra- and inter-assay variability. Reaction efficiency was not impacted by penguin DNA from SpAHV1-negative tracheal swabs. We detected an additional field sample as positive with our newly developed qPCR assay, and although this likely represents detection of another infected penguin, the true disease status of this population is currently uncharacterized given that no gold-standard test exists for SpAHV1. Our qPCR assay may provide a valuable tool in the surveillance and characterization of SpAHV1 in penguins. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Spat collection activities, targeting black-lip (Pinctada margaritifera) and winged (Pteria penguin) pearl oysters, support successful cultured round pearl and mabé pearl sectors in the Fiji Islands. To improve supply of pearl oysters for pearl production, a national spat collection program was developed based on standardised methodology, where commercially available spat collectors are deployed for 10–18 months. Research is now required to maximise the productivity of this program and optimising the duration of spat collector deployments is seen as a priority. This study considered whether there is justification to reduce the duration of spat collector deployments for black-lip and winged pearl oysters to less than 8 months. Spat collectors were deployed at multiple sites and then recovered after 5, 6, 7, or 8 months to examine the yield and size of resulting spat. While duration of spat collector deployment was important in determining the yield and size of harvested spat, it was not possible to generalise responses. Rather, conclusions were liable to vary over macro and micro spatial scales, depending on the target species. Such variability, coupled with the small size of spat at harvest, greatly limited the feasibility and rationale for reducing the duration of spat collector deployment to improve the supply of pearl oysters for pearl production. On this basis, we argue that there is no justification to modify the standardised methodology currently used within the national spat collection program in Fiji, where spat collectors are deployed for longer than 8 months. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The presence of rare earth elements (REE) in the southern hemisphere, particularly marine ecosystems of Patagonia, have received little attention. The Magellanic penguin, which is also known as the Patagonian penguin, inhabits only in austral regions of South America. Although seabird feathers have been used extensively as a bio-monitoring tool, no studies have addressed the effect of age on REE accumulation in Magellanic penguins. In this study, the concentrations of REE were determined by ICP-MS to detect La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Sc, Lu and Y in the feathers of Magellanic penguins from Magdalena Island, an important rookery in the Strait of Magallan. Age-related differences were studied to investigate the different patterns of REE bioaccumulation between adults and juveniles. The data showed that juvenile penguins exhibit higher REE-levels than adult individuals (p < 0.05). Mean REE-values (μg g−1 d.w) differed several orders of magnitude, ranging from 0.002 for Lu in adults to 1.15 for Ce in juvenile individuals. The results are useful to understand the bioaccumulation of REE in fauna from remote and cold regions of the southern hemisphere. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Tasmania (including offshore islands) has the largest breeding population of little penguins (Eudyptula minor) in Australia, but coastal development around nesting areas has led to habitat loss, often resulting in smaller, fragmented colonies. Colonies have also been subject to predation by introduced domestic species. This study assessed whether historical levels of domestic dog predation could threaten the viability of penguin populations. Data collected since the 1980s detailing little penguin kills by domestic dogs were used to inform the extent of individual mortality events. The potential impact of dog attacks on the viability of little penguin colonies of the sizes typically found on mainland Tasmania was explored using an age-based population model. Simulation was conducted over decadal timescales to assess the impact of attacks at varying frequencies and intensities on small (100 birds), medium (300 birds) and large (500 birds) colonies that were stable, growing or decreasing. Results suggested that frequent and intense dog attacks markedly increased the probability of colony decline, regardless of colony size. Even large, growing penguin colonies were at risk of decline. The risk of extinction was <10% for medium and large stable colonies if no more than 15–25 penguins were killed per attack and there were no more than 20 attacks per 50 years. For small-sized colonies, the risk of extinction was <10% if fewer than 10 attacks occurred per 50-year period and no more than 15 birds were killed per attack. Importantly, results suggested that for small colonies especially, even low levels of predator attack could lead to colony collapse in 10–15 years. For large colonies that were already decreasing, the average time to extinction was markedly increased with additional mortalities from dogs, highlighting the need for ongoing management measures that reduce or eliminate dog attacks to help conserve this iconic species. © 2024 Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation.

ABSTRACT: Knowledge of breeding success is essential for conservation, as it is required for monitoring populations and survival trends. Seabird reproductive success can be negatively affected by prey availability, marine-based stochasticity, extreme weather events, individual breeders' performance and direct threats such as disease, predation and fisheries interactions. The endangered yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes) is declining in mainland New Zealand, however, little is known about its breeding success in the subantarctic where the majority of the species breeds. Yellow-eyed penguin breeding success data were collected from a total of 167 nests on subantarctic Enderby Island, Auckland Islands, New Zealand, from the 2015 to 2017 breeding seasons. This included egg and chick mortality and fledging rates, plus a wider sample of the fledgling condition of 276 chicks. Fledging success was higher than in mainland New Zealand in some years, although chicks were smaller and lighter on average, highlighting the need for more information on juvenile survival probabilities in the subantarctic. Breeding success measures were similar in 2015 and 2016, but a large egg mortality in 2017 caused a significant reduction in breeding success that year. Such variability requires more investigation into the correlates of breeding success, including possible stressors such as foraging success, adverse weather and environmental effects, and pathogens. These results demonstrate the need for ongoing monitoring of yellow-eyed penguin breeding success across the subantarctic in order to establish baselines for normal variation and to determine whether anthropogenic (manageable) factors may be contributing to low productivity. This research highlights an important consideration for endangered species conservation; that breeding success may not be consistent over time, or across a species' entire range. Additional monitoring of all breeding populations should be carried out to ensure up-to-date information is available to inform conservation management decisions for the species. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The highly pathogenic Avian Influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 has caused a global outbreak affecting both wild and domestic animals, predominantly avian species. To date, cases of the HPAIV H5 Clade 2.3.4.4b in penguins have exclusively been reported in African Penguins. In Chile, the virus was confirmed in pelicans in December 2022 and subsequently spread across the country, affecting several species, including Humboldt penguins. This study aims to provide an overview of the incidents involving stranded and deceased Humboldt penguins and establish a connection between these events and HPAIV H5N1. Historical data about strandings between 2009 and 2023 was collected, and samples from suspected cases in 2023 were obtained to confirm the presence of HPAIV H5N1. Between January and August 2023, 2,788 cases of stranded and deceased penguins were recorded. Out of these, a total of 2,712 penguins deceased, evidencing a significative increase in mortality starting in early 2023 coinciding with the introduction and spreading of HPAIV H5N1 in the country. Thirty-seven events were categorized as mass mortality events, with the number of deceased penguins varying from 11 to 98. Most cases (97 %) were observed in the North of Chile. One hundred and eighty-one specimens were subjected to HPAIV diagnosis, four of which tested positive for HPAIV H5N1. Spatial analysis validates the correlation between mass mortality events and outbreaks of HPAIV in Chile. However, the limited rate of HPAIV H5N1 detection, which can be attributed to the type and quality of the samples, requiring further exploration. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: During August and September 2023, three giant icebergs, each bigger than Paris, successively grazed Clarence Island in the northeast of the Antarctic Peninsula, a home to a population of over 100 000 penguins. This incident may serve as a clarion call for the increasing iceberg calving due to global warming and its subsequent impact on the Antarctic ecosystem. Here we investigate this unexpected event and employ historical records and probabilistic analyses of iceberg grounding to assess the degree of impact on penguin colonies of Clarence Island. Among the eleven colonies, there is one with low impact, eight with medium impact, and two with high impact. The low-impact colony, Cape Lloyd, is located in the northern part of the island, while the high-impact colonies, False Ridge and Pink Pool, are in the southeast. The eight medium-impact colonies are distributed along both the eastern and western coasts of the island. This study provides essential support for evaluating the impact of iceberg activity on penguin colonies. We argue that penguin colonies located in areas prone to iceberg drift, such as Clarence Island, may become more vulnerable to the heightened risk of iceberg collisions or groundings in the warming future. Therefore, we hope the public will become more aware of the grave impacts of climate change on penguins and underscore the urgent need for effective conservation strategies. © Chinese Society for Oceanography and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

ABSTRACT: Humboldt Penguin (Spheniscus humboldti) population declines are attributable to several multifaceted anthropogenic impacts. At present, the exposure of Humboldt Penguins to high concentrations of heavy metals in the marine environment is a preeminent concern, due to mining along the Peruvian coast near key rookery sites. Metal and selenium concentrations were determined in eggs collected from September 2020 to April 2021 from a managed-care penguin population at the Brookfield Zoo to establish reference values for health indices conducted on wild populations. Concentrations of 16 elements, with emphasis on those found in mine efflux—arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, selenium, and zinc—were assessed via inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry in yolk, albumen, and eggshell. Data analyses indicate a clear delineation between egg constituents, with lipid-rich yolk displaying notably higher concentrations (lg/g) of arsenic (0.20 ± 0.064), chromium (0.086 ± 0.03), cobalt (0.01 ± 0.003), iron (238.65 ± 54.72), lead (0.32 ± 0.97), manganese (2.71 ± 0.66), molybdenum (0.57 ± 0.14), tin (3.29 ± 0.99), and zinc (64.03 ± 13.01) than other components (albumen and eggshell). These data confirm that heavy metals are partitioned differently across Humboldt Penguin egg components, which provides insight into the potential connection between embryonic nutrient source contamination and subsequent chick viability. © Wildlife Disease Association 2024

ABSTRACT: Marine pollution is becoming ubiquitous in the environment. Observations of pollution on beaches, in the coastal ocean, and in organisms in the Antarctic are becoming distressingly common. Increasing human activity, growing tourism, and an expanding krill fishing industry along the West Antarctic Peninsula all represent potential sources of plastic pollution and other debris (collectively referred to as debris) to the region. However, the sources of these pollutants from point (pollutants released from discrete sources) versus non-point (pollutants from a large area rather than a specific source) sources are poorly understood. We used buoyant simulated particles released in a high-resolution physical ocean model to quantify pollutant loads throughout the region. We considered non-point sources of debris from the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, Bellingshausen Sea, Weddell Sea, and point source pollution from human activities including tourism, research, and fishing. We also determined possible origins for observed debris based on data from the Southern Ocean Observing System and Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research program. Our results indicate that point source pollution released in the coastal Antarctic is more likely to serve as a source for observed debris than non-point sources, and that the dominant source of pollution is region-specific. Penguin colonies in the South Shetland and Elephant Islands had the greatest debris load from point sources whereas loads from non-point sources were greatest around the southernmost colonies. Penguin colonies at Cornwallis Island and Fort Point were exposed to the highest theoretical debris loads. While these results do not include physical processes such as windage and Stokes Drift that are known to impact debris distributions and transport in the coastal ocean, these results provide critical insights to building an effective stratified sampling and monitoring effort to better understand debris distributions, concentrations, and origins throughout the West Antarctic Peninsula. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) from the Barcelona zoo (n=9) were followed to assess their physiological stress status using conservative protocols. Corticosterone levels were measured in feathers and plasma as indicative of chronic and acute physiological stress, respectively. Other markers: B-esterases, potentially indicative of xenobiotic exposure were measured in plasma of these same individuals and reported for the first time in this species. The sensitivity to chemicals of environmental concern, employed as plastic additives, was assessed in vitro with plasma of this species using the inhibition of carboxylesterase (CE) and acetylcholinesterase enzymatic measurements. Among the tested additives, the organophosphorus flame retardants displayed the highest in vitro inhibitory potential on basal CE activity, suggesting their potential utility as biomarkers of this particular chemical class. Additionally, enzymatic measurements in plasma are determined for the first time in Humboldt penguin and can be regarded as baseline values for a potential field monitoring application. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Establishing methods that allow for more focused management of wildlife under predator pressure may increase the efficiency of managing problematic predators. Non-invasive dietary analysis and identification of conservation-sensitive prey in the diet of ‘culprit’ predator individuals could help to facilitate this and is worthy of exploration. Recently on Phillip Island, Australia, Little Ravens Corvus mellori have emerged as a prominent predator on the clutches of burrow-nesting Little Penguins Eudyptula minor. We tested the feasibility of using non-invasive PCR approaches targeting the penguin mitochondrial 16S rRNA marker gene to establish whether penguin DNA could be detected in raven faecal samples, potentially enabling the identification of culprit ravens missed by extensive field observation. Using a metabarcoding approach, we examined the feasibility of non-invasively establishing other dietary items via high-throughput amplicon sequencing. We documented components of raven diet using the universal mitochondrial 16S rRNA, insect-specific ‘Chiar’ 16S rRNA and plant ITS2. The assemblage of dietary items did not differ with raven culprit status (i.e. a raven previously observed preying upon penguin), sex or date. Penguin was detected in the diet of some individuals classified observationally as non-culprits. Although some cases may conceivably have been false detections, other explanations include missed depredation events, consumption via scavenging or through secondary consumption (e.g. eating invertebrates that have consumed penguin). While this study found metabarcoding unreliable for unambiguous assigning of raven culprit status, at least as we implemented it, it may hold promise complementing observations if consumption via scavenging can be distinguished from direct depredation. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: A 2-year-old, male, entire Eudyptula minor, kept in a colony of little penguins, started displaying neurological signs, including stumbling, shaking and ear scratching. Several treatment trials proved unsuccessful, and previous computed tomography failed to yield images of diagnostic quality. Due to the ongoing progression of the disease, the penguin was presented for general anaesthesia for magnetic resonance imaging. On presentation, a full neurological examination was conducted, the abnormalities were localised to vestibular apparatus or cerebellum, with a top differential diagnosis of bilateral otitis interna. The patient was scheduled for general anaesthesia to facilitate magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. There are limited reported data on anaesthesia of little penguins. When anaesthetising this species, there are multiple pre-anaesthetic considerations: fasting period, availability of suitable monitoring, the presence of a tracheal septum, positioning of the patient, challenging intravenous access and complications such as alterations in normal body temperature and environmental temperature. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Eocene penguins from Seymour Island play an important role in studies related to the taxonomy and evolution of the Sphenisciformes stem group. Among these penguins, the Palaeeudyptes species are particularly noteworthy for their unusually large size and the contentious nature of their classification criteria. In this study, we describe a new penguin skeleton with a well-preserved tarsometatarsus discovered in the Upper Eocene of Seymour Island, Antarctica. The new fossil exhibits tarsometatarsal characteristics of Palaeeudyptes but differs from two species of Palaeeudyptes previously found on Seymour Island, providing insights on the morphological diversity and evolutionary history of early penguins. We conduct normality and unimodality tests on Palaeeudyptes taxa from Seymour Island to reassess the hypothesis that size differences between the two species of this genus could be attributed to sexual dimorphism in a single species. The results revealed that size differences are unlikely due to sexual dimorphism. We also use the linear discriminant analysis to evaluate the taxonomic criteria for the two Palaeeudyptes species discovered in the Antarctic region. The data showed an overlap in the size distribution, indicating weakness in the classification criteria. Reassessing previous samples and establishing an additional diagnosis based on critical anatomical features could potentially resolve this issue. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Once a year, penguins undergo a catastrophic moult, replacing their entire plumage during a fasting period on land or on sea-ice during which time individuals can lose 45% of their body mass. In penguins, new feather synthesis precedes the loss of old feathers, leading to an accumulation of two feather layers (double coat) before the old plumage is shed. We hypothesized that the combination of the high metabolism required for new feather synthesis and the potentially high thermal insulation linked to the double coat could lead to a thermal challenge requiring additional peripheral circulation to thermal windows to dissipate the extra heat. To test this hypothesis, we measured the surface temperature of different body regions of captive gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) throughout the moult under constant environmental conditions. The surface temperature of the main body trunk decreased during the initial stages of the moult, suggesting greater thermal insulation. In contrast, the periorbital region, a potential proxy of core temperature in birds, increased during these same early moulting stages. The surface temperature of the bill, flipper and foot (thermal windows) tended to initially increase during the moult, highlighting the likely need for extra heat dissipation in moulting penguins. These results raise questions regarding the thermoregulatory capacities of penguins in the wild during the challenging period of moulting on land in the current context of global warming.  © 2024.

ABSTRACT: Energy governs species’ life histories and pace of living, requiring individuals to make trade-offs. However, measuring energetic parameters in the wild is challenging, often resulting in data collected from heterogeneous sources. This complicates comprehensive analysis and hampers transferability within and across case studies. We present a novel framework, combining information obtained from eco-physiology and biologging techniques, to estimate both energy expenditure and intake in 48 Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) during the chick-rearing stage. We employed the machine learning algorithm random forest (RF) to predict accelerometry-derived metrics for feeding behaviour using depth data (our proxy for energy acquisition). We also built a time-activity model calibrated with doubly labelled water data to estimate energy expenditure. Using depth-derived time spent diving and amount of vertical movement in the subsurface phase, we accurately predicted energy expenditure. Movement metrics derived from the RF algorithm deployed on depth data were able to accurately detect the same feeding behaviour predicted from accelerometry. The RF predicted accelerometry-estimated time spent feeding more accurately compared with historical proxies such as number of undulations or dive bottom duration. The proposed framework is accurate, reliable and simple to implement on data from biologging technology widely used on marine species. It enables coupling energy intake and expenditure, which is crucial to further assess individual trade-offs. Our work allows us to revisit historical data, to study how long-term environmental changes affect animal energetics. © 2024. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

ABSTRACT: A 26-y-old, male, captive Humboldt penguin (Spheniscus humboldti) was euthanized following a 3.5-mo history of weakened elimination mechanics, recurrent tenesmus, intermittent hemorrhagic droppings, and a cloacal mass. Blepharospasm, of unknown cause, of the right eye was present for ~3 mo before euthanasia. Autopsy revealed a cloacal adenocarcinoma with localized coelomic carcinomatosis and distant metastases to the liver and lungs. On histopathology, a 2.6 × 1.2 × 0.5-mm, well-demarcated mass was found surrounding the right optic nerve, expanding the subdural space and wrapping the leptomeninges. The mass was composed of neoplastic spindle-to-polygonal cells consistent with a meningioma, meningothelial subtype. No evidence of neoplasia was found in the optic chiasm or brain, indicating a primary retrobulbar meningioma. Immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin AE1/AE3, vimentin, and S100 revealed robust and consistent immunoreactivity to vimentin, and weak and variable immunoreactivity to cytokeratin and S100, supporting the diagnosis. Meningiomas have been described only rarely in avian species, and we found no reports of optic nerve meningiomas in any avian species to date. The optic nerve meningioma in this case was considered a clinically incidental finding. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: The identification of ophthalmic diseases that affect vision and/or cause discomfort should be a priority in captive penguins to improve their overall health and quality of life. Methods: A routine ophthalmological examination was performed on 80 clinically normal penguins (160 eyes), and any lesions observed were recorded. Results: Ocular lesions were frequent (56% of penguins), with cataracts being the most common (48.8% of penguins). Cortical cataracts (63% of eyes) and posterior subcapsular cataracts (27.4%) were the most commonly occurring. All maturation stages were found; incipient cataracts (52.1% of eyes with cataracts) were predominant, while Morgagnian cataracts (8.2%) were the least frequent. A correlation existed between lenticular changes and increasing age. Uveitis was present in 43.8% of eyes with cataracts, and ectropion uveae was the predominant clinical sign. Other ocular findings included blepharitis (3.8% of all eyes), corneal leukoma (5.6%) and posterior lens subluxation (7.5%). Limitations: The small number of birds of some species prevented the comparison of ophthalmic findings between species. Conclusion: This study corroborates the high prevalence of ocular lesions in captive penguins. Cataracts were frequent and age related. Most cataracts were cortical, and the predominant maturation stage was incipient. Lens-induced uveitis was a common finding. Lowered intraocular pressure was related to cataract formation. © 2023 The Authors. Veterinary Record published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British Veterinary Association.

ABSTRACT: Assessing the physiological stress responses of wild animals opens a window for understanding how organisms cope with environmental challenges. Since stress response is associated with changes in body temperature, the use of body surface temperature through thermal imaging could help to measure acute and chronic stress responses non-invasively. We used thermal imaging, acute handling-stress protocol and an experimental manipulation of corticosterone (the main glucocorticoid hormone in birds) levels in breeding king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus), to assess: 1. The potential contribution of the Hypothalamo-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis in mediating chronic and acute stress-induced changes in adult surface temperature, 2. The influence of HPA axis manipulation on parental investment through thermal imaging of eggs and brooded chicks, and 3. The impact of parental treatment on offspring thermal's response to acute handling. Maximum eye temperature (Teye) increased and minimum beak temperature (Tbeak) decreased in response to handling stress in adults, but neither basal nor stress-induced surface temperatures were significantly affected by corticosterone implant. While egg temperature was not significantly influenced by parental treatment, we found a surprising pattern for chicks: chicks brooded by the (non-implanted) partner of corticosterone-implanted individuals exhibited higher surface temperature (both Teye and Tbeak) than those brooded by glucocorticoid-implanted or control parents. Chick's response to handling in terms of surface temperature was characterized by a drop in both Teye and Tbeak independently of parental treatment. We conclude that the HPA axis seems unlikely to play a major role in determining chronic or acute changes in surface temperature in king penguins. Changes in surface temperature may primarily be mediated by the Sympathetic-Adrenal-Medullary (SAM) axis in response to stressful situations. Our experiment did not reveal a direct impact of parental HPA axis manipulation on parental investment (egg or chick temperature), but a potential influence on the partner's brooding behaviour. © 2024 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Oxygen store management underlies dive performance and is dependent on the slow heart rate and peripheral vasoconstriction of the dive response to control tissue blood flow and oxygen uptake. Prior research has revealed two major patterns of muscle myoglobin saturation profiles during dives of emperor penguins. In Type A profiles, myoglobin desaturated rapidly, consistent with minimal muscle blood flow and low tissue oxygen uptake. Type B profiles, with fluctuating and slower declines in myoglobin saturation, were consistent with variable tissue blood flow patterns and tissue oxygen uptake during dives. We examined arterial and venous blood oxygen profiles to evaluate blood oxygen extraction and found two primary patterns of venous hemoglobin desaturation that complemented corresponding myoglobin saturation profiles. Type A venous profiles had a hemoglobin saturation that (a) increased/plateaued for most of a dive’s duration, (b) only declined during the latter stages of ascent, and (c) often became arterialized [arterio-venous (a-v) shunting]. In Type B venous profiles, variable but progressive hemoglobin desaturation profiles were interrupted by inflections in the profile that were consistent with fluctuating tissue blood flow and oxygen uptake. End-of-dive saturation of arterial and Type A venous hemoglobin saturation profiles were not significantly different, but did differ from those of Type B venous profiles. These findings provide further support that the dive response of emperor penguins is a spectrum of cardiac and vascular components (including a-v shunting) that are dependent on the nature and demands of a given dive and even of a given segment of a dive. © 2024 Company of Biologists Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Reproductive success is an important demographic parameter that can be driven by environmental and behavioural factors operating on various spatio-temporal scales. As seabirds breed on land and forage in the ocean, processes occurring in both environments can influence their reproductive success. At various locations around East Antarctica, Adélie penguins' (Pygoscelis adeliae) reproductive success has been negatively linked to extensive sea-ice. In contrast, our study site in the Windmill Islands has limited fast ice present during the breeding season, allowing us to examine drivers of reproductive success under vastly different marine environmental conditions. Here, we examined the reproductive success of 450 Adélie penguin nests over a 10-year period using images obtained from remotely operated cameras. We analysed nest survival in relation to marine and climatic factors, environmental conditions at the camera site and immediately around the nest, and behavioural attributes reflecting parental investment and phenological timing. Our key result was a strong positive association between nest structure and chick survival, particularly when ground moisture and snow cover around the nest were high. Earlier nesting birds were more likely to build bigger nests, although it is unclear whether this is due to more time available to build nests or whether early arrival and high-quality nests are complementary traits. This intrinsic activity is likely to become more important if future predictions of increased snowfall in this region manifest. © 2024 Commonwealth of Australia.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to determine the minimum anesthetic concentration of isoflurane (MACISO) and sevoflurane (MACSEVO) and evaluate the cardiorespiratory changes induced by varying fractions of inspired oxygen (FiO2) in Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus). Twenty adult penguins (3.53 ± 0.44 kg) of undetermined sex were used. Both MACISO (n = 9) and MACSEVO (n = 13) were established using an up-and-down design. Next, twelve mechanically ventilated penguins were maintained at 1 MACISO or 1 MACSEVO (n = 6 per group) with the FiO2 initially set at 1.0. Three FiO2 values (0.6, 0.4 and 0.2) were then held constant during anesthesia for 20 minutes each. Arterial blood samples were collected for gas analysis after the 20-minute period for each FiO2. Mean ± SD MACISO was 1.93 ± 0.10% and MACSEVO was 3.53 ± 0.13%. Other than heart rate at 0.6 FiO2 (86 ± 11 beats/minute in MACISO and 132 ± 37 beats/minute in MACSEVO; p = 0.041), no significant cardiorespiratory differences were detected between groups. In both groups, decreasing the FiO2 produced increased pH values and reduced partial pressures of carbon dioxide and bicarbonate. Partial pressures of oxygen (PaO2) gradually lowered from 1.0 FiO2 through 0.2 FiO2, though hypoxemia (PaO2 < 80 mmHg) occurred only with the latter FiO2. The MACISO and the MACSEVO for the Magellanic penguin fell within the upper range of reported avian MAC estimates. To prevent hypoxemia in healthy, mechanically ventilated, either isoflurane- or sevoflurane-anesthetized Magellanic penguins, a minimum FiO2 of 0.4 should be used. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

ABSTRACT: The present work extends the scope of prior studies through analysis, modelling and simulation of the As, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe Mn, Mo, Ni and Zn release from Gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) and Chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarcticus) penguin guano to the Southern Ocean seawater and to Antarctic snow meltwater. Laboratory experimental results have been modelled considering kinetic processes between water and guano using two element pools in the guano compartment; its application allows us to interpret behaviours and predict release concentrations of dissolved trace elements from guano which are potentially useful for incorporation as elements source into biogeochemical models applied in the Southern Ocean. Variations in quantities and release patterns depending on the type of guano and aqueous medium in contact have been identified. The release percentages from the guano to the aqueous medium, once the steady state has been reached, vary depending on the water medium and guano type in the ranges of 100–2.9 % for Mo; 91.5–68.6 % for Ni; 81.8–22.8 % As; 52.0–43.9 % Cu; 26.9–7.4 % Mn; 24.9–5.4 for Co; 4.4–3.2 % for Zn and 0.94–0.51 % for Fe. Considering a penguin population of 774,000 Gentoo and 8,000,000 Chinstrap, the estimated annual mass released to the both seawater and freshwater would be ≈18,500 kg for Cu, ≈1710 kg for Zn, ≈1944 kg for Fe, ≈1640 kg for Mn, ≈499 kg for As, ≈289 kg for Ni, ≈155 kg for Mo, ≈36.7 kg for Cd and ≈8.1 kg for Co. These contributions can be locally significant both in promoting phytoplankton growth and in their role as inhibitors of primary productivity. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Individual trophic specialization (ITS) refers to the trophic diversification amongst individuals within a population. The gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) is considered a trophic generalist at the population level, but little is known about its individual trophic differentiation. We assessed the degree of ITS at one of its main breeding colonies: Ardley Island, South Shetland Islands. We used skin from 19 dead individuals to determine species and sex by molecular methods and a nail for stable isotope analysis of δ15N and δ13C. Isotopic niche metrics and ITS were estimated for the population and for each sex. We found a moderately high degree of ITS associated with the trophic position of the resources consumed (δ15N) for the population and both sexes, as well as a moderate degree of ITS in the foraging habitat (δ13C) for the population and females. Females showed a higher exclusive niche area, suggesting that they use resources and foraging areas that males do not, probably related to reproductive energy demands. Given the high population density of this species, ITS could function as a mechanism to decrease intraspecific competition. This combination of genetic and isotopic tools allowed us to provide relevant information on the trophic ecology of the gentoo penguin without manipulating animals or using invasive methods.

ABSTRACT: The African penguin is currently experiencing a significant decline, with just over 10,000 breeding pairs left. A substantial body of research reflects the impacts of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) on the marine environment, with wastewater treatment plants reported as one of the main sources of CEC release. In South Africa, CECs were identified contaminating the marine environment and bioaccumulating in several marine species. Approximately 70 % of all African penguin colonies breed in close proximity to cities and/or harbors in South Africa. Currently, the impact of CECs as a stressor upon the viability of African penguin populations is unknown. Based on the search results there was a clear lack of information on CECs' bioaccumulation and impact on the African penguin. This narrative review will thus focus on the prevalent sources and types of CECs and examine the reported consequences of constant exposure in seabirds, particularly African penguins. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Phenology is a major component of animals’ breeding, as they need to adjust their breeding timing to match optimal environmental conditions. While the effects of shifting phenology are well-studied on populations, few studies emphasise its ecological causes and consequences at the inter-individual level. Using a 20-year monitoring of more than 2500 breeding events from ~ 500 breeding little penguins (Eudyptula minor), a very asynchronously breeding seabird, we investigated the consequences of late breeding on present and next breeding events. We found that individuals breeding later had reduced breeding success, lighter chicks at fledging, lower probability of laying a second clutch, and decreased parents’ post-breeding body condition. Importantly, we found important cycling effects where delayed breeding during a given year led to significantly later laying date, lower breeding probability and lower breeding success when they breed during the next season, suggesting potential carry-over effects from one season to the next. To further understand the causes of such variability in phenology while earlier breeding is associated with better individual fitness, we aimed to assess intrinsic differences amongst individuals. We showed that the heterogeneity in breeding timing was partly fixed, the laying date being a significantly repeatable behaviour (17%), asking for more studies on heritability or early-development effects. This extensive study highlights the combined roles of carry-over effects and intrinsic differences on individual phenology, with important implications on breeding capacity through life. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

ABSTRACT: Sea ice, and particularly land-fast sea ice, is crucial for emperor penguins as a breeding and moulting platform and foraging habitat (Barbraud & Weimerskirch 2001). Emperor penguins use land-fast sea ice as a breeding platform to raise their chicks, from egg hatching in late July to mid-August until fledging, typically between mid-December and early January.

ABSTRACT: Electrophoresis is a useful diagnostic tool for detecting inflammation, including inflammation associated with infectious diseases (eg, aspergillosis in penguins). To our knowledge, reference intervals are not available for plasma proteins via electrophoresis in Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti). Therefore, preliminary reference intervals for blood plasma proteins measured by capillary zone electrophoresis were calculated for Humboldt penguins from a single zoological collection, and possible differences between the sexes and the ages of the birds were evaluated. Lithium heparinized plasma samples from 39 Humboldt penguins were analyzed. The following sex- and age-independent reference intervals were calculated: total protein 33.8-70.4 g/L, prealbumin 1.9-4.9 g/L, albumin 12.9-31.1 g/L, albumin: globulin ratio 0.7-1.7, α-globulins 4.5-11.6 g/L, β-globulins 5.6-20.6 g/L, and γ-globulins 2.6-8.4 g/L. Male penguins had a significantly (P = 0.047) higher albumin: globulin ratio and lower percentage of β-globulins (P = 0.015) in comparison with female penguins. Prealbumin (g/L) significantly (P = 0.021) decreased with increased age of the penguins. These results showed some differences between the sexes and ages of the penguins, which should be considered when interpreting the results. Further studies are needed to determine whether differences in other age groups or seasons exist, and also to evaluate which infectious diseases affect plasma proteins and how the reference values calculated here may deviate in ill penguins. © 2024 Association of Avian Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Microplastic pollution threatens some of the world's most iconic locations for marine biodiversity, including the remote Galápagos Islands, Ecuador. Using the Galápagos penguin (Spheniscus mendiculus) as a sentinel species, the present study assessed microplastics and suspected anthropogenic cellulose concentrations in surface seawater and zooplankton near Santa Cruz and Galápagos penguin colonies (Floreana, Isabela, Santiago), as well as in penguin potential prey (anchovies, mullets, milkfish) and penguin scat. On average, 0.40 ± 0.32 microplastics L−1 were found in surface seawater (<10 μm; n = 63 L), while 0.003, 0.27, and 5.12 microplastics individual−1 were found in zooplankton (n = 3372), anchovies (n = 11), and mullets (n = 6), respectively. The highest concentration (27 microplastics individual−1) was observed in a single milkfish. Calculations based on microplastics per gram of prey, in a potential diet composition scenario, suggest that the Galápagos penguin may consume 2881 to 9602 microplastics daily from prey. Despite this, no microplastics or cellulose were identified in 3.40 g of guano collected from two penguins. Our study confirms microplastic exposure in the pelagic food web and endangered penguin species within the UNESCO World Heritage site Galápagos Islands, which can be used to inform regional and international policies to mitigate plastic pollution and conserve biodiversity in the global ocean.

ABSTRACT: Southern Rockhopper Penguins Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome exhibit marked intra-clutch egg size dimorphism and engage in obligate brood reduction of the first and smaller laid egg, with the rearing of the two nestlings occurring only on rare occasions. Studying the sex ratio of hatchlings within a brood in this species, under this breeding strategy context, is essential to understanding population dynamics. The objectives of this study were to analyze egg size dimorphism within the broods, determine the offspring sex ratio, and investigate if the hatchling sex ratio was determined by hatching order and egg volume to discuss potential biases in the context of brood reduction. We molecularly assessed hatchlings’ sex ratio according to the hatching order at Isla Pingüino, Argentina (3 years, n = 68 broods). Sex ratio was not different from the expected 50:50 proportion in all the studied years. In this sense, we found a balanced sex ratio in the first hatchlings, typically the survivors of the brood reduction process. Although not significant, we found a bias toward females in the second hatchlings. Assuming less energy is required to raise a female compared to a male, because of its smaller size; this strategy might enhance the chances of raising two nestlings if conditions are optimal. Southern Rockhopper Penguins at Isla Pingüino appear to exhibit a strategic sex allocation evident in the second but not in the first hatchlings, which might be consistent with its out-of-the-norm exponential growth population. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

ABSTRACT: Cu is a vital micronutrient, but free Cu ions (Cu2+) in seawater, even at subnanomolar concentrations, can impede phytoplankton growth. Natural Cu complexation with organic ligands regulates Cu acquisition and, in most instances, reduces Cu2+ concentrations below toxic thresholds. Along the Antarctic coast, the sources and sinks of Cu and its associated ligands remain poorly defined. Despite the high productivity in the area, there are no studies on the role of trophic transfer in Cu cycling. This study explores penguin guano release of Cu and Cu ligands and its potential in neutralizing copper toxicity along the Antarctic coast. We collected guano in a Chinstrap penguin nesting location in the West coast of Deception Island and extracted its components into aqueous solution imitating natural processes. Copper concentration in guano was 0.4 mg (dry weight g)−1 constituting a potential toxic threat and showed biomagnification with respect to krill. Surface seawater samples collected from various locations varying in penguin activity, were analyzed to assess the potential influence of guano on the area. Visual examination and elevated levels of Al suggested that a substantial portion of guano was lithogenic. Consequently, only a modest 16 % of the total Cu present in guano could be extracted using mechanical methods. Notably, the concentrations of the extracted organic ligands were approximately 23 times higher than the concentrations of the extracted Cu. This significant presence of ligands effectively nullifies any potential toxicity that could have arisen from free Cu2+ ions. Guano ligands' conditional stability constants were lower than those in surface seawater suggesting phytoplankton exudation was the main ligand source in the area. Overall, guano acts as a key node for Cu cycling in coastal Antarctic waters but its deleterious potential is neutralized by ligands from krill digestion and the high background concentration of phytoplankton exudates. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: A 21-year-old captive female Humboldt penguin (Spheniscus humboldti) was in good health until the day before the animal died. However, the animal suddenly exhibited symptoms of vomiting and anorexia, and died in shortly thereafter. The autopsy revealed a blood clot in the abdominal air sac and 280 mL of dark red fluid in the body cavity. The ovary was twisted around a blood vessel. Based on the findings described, it was considered that the cause of death was hypovolemic shock due to massive intracoelomic hemorrhage by vascular collapse resulting from ovarian torsion. This is the first report of ovarian torsion in penguins. © 2024 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: Patagonia is one of the last pristine regions on the southern hemisphere. The impact of rare earth element (REEs) and trace elements (TEs) in this region have received little attention. The main goal was to assess REEs burden in feathers of adult magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus). Sampling was performed at Magdalena Island of the Chilean Patagonia during the austral summer of 2011. Multi-elemental determination of 16 REEs and 24 TEs was performed with ICP-MS. The levels of REEs, TEs, and stable isotopes (δ15N, δ13C, and δ34S) were measured to assess the factors that condition the avian exposure to environmental contaminants. The results showed an increase of the levels of REEs and TEs from the calamus to the feather's tip. In the whole feather, the highest levels corresponded to Ce, which exhibited more than two order of magnitude than Lu and Tm levels. Similar to other penguin species, magellanic penguins can be vectors of REEs and metals in remote regions. Stable isotopes revealed that trophic ecology may influence some of the element concentrations in feathers of magellanic penguins, an issue that requires deeper attention. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: We analyzed the variation in the secondary sex ratio of Magellanic Penguin Spheniscus magellanicus breeding in six colonies on the Patagonian coast of Argentina. We tested the effects of laying date and hatching sequence on the probability of producing sons and daughters. The global secondary sex ratio did not differ from equality, and there were no differences among the colonies. However, regardless of the colony, laying date, and hatching sequence, there was a significant effect on the proportion of males and females reared. Pairs that were laid early in the breeding season were more likely to raise a male. In addition, offspring that hatched first were more likely to be male than those that hatched second. Our results are consistent with the adaptive importance of producing males, likely the costliest sex, early in the breeding season or early in the brood when food resources are still abundant.

ABSTRACT: Currently, most studies focus on the spatial distribution patterns of selenium (Se) and its fractions in the horizontal surface soils with much less attention paid to their vertical distribution patterns. The investigation about their distribution patterns in soil profiles can further elucidate their migration and transformation paths. Here, total Se and its fractions in tundra soil profiles were quantified by sequential chemical-extraction method and hydride generation-atomic fluorescence spectrometry, to explore the Se distribution patterns and their relationships with penguin or seal population dynamics in maritime Antarctica. Total Se contents were one order of magnitude higher in penguin colony soil profiles than in seal colony and normal tundra. The vertical distribution patterns of total Se were in accord with those of total carbon (TC), total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and total sulfur (TS), and total Se levels showed significant positive correlations with historical penguin or seal population proxies obtained from Q-mode factor analysis. Organically bound Se (Seob) and residual Se (Sere) were the dominant fractions with proportions close to 80%, whereas bioavailable Se were the lowest among all fractions. Significant positive correlations of Seob with total Se, TC, TOC, TN, TP, and population proxy indicated that historically high penguin population size and their guano input promoted Seob accumulation. Our results showed that historical penguin and seal population dynamics and their guano input had an important effect on the distribution patterns for total Se and their fractions in soil profiles. This study provides critical information that is useful to understanding Se biogeochemical cycles and the impact of penguins and seals in coastal Antarctica. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Gentoo Penguin (Pygoscelis papua) is a species that reproduces in Antarctica and sub-Antarctic islands. During 2022 a Gentoo Penguin with an unusual plumage coloration was recorded at Esperanza/Hope Bay, north of the Antarctic Peninsula (63°24′ S, 57°01′ W). The coloring of plumage is achieved by two types of pigments known as carotenoids and melanins. Two different types of melanin (phaeomelanin and eumelanin) are responsible of producing different pigmentation patterns that oscillates between reddish-blackish coloration. The unusual coloration of the penguin was identified as melanism, a genetic condition that causes an excess of melanin pigment in feathers. This particular individual appeared to be in good health and exhibited normal behavior. As far as we know this is the second official report of melanism for the species since the first one in 1997 and it is the first report for the colony. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: As humans increasingly interact with nature, it is important to understand how humans perceive their impact(s) on wildlife. Using little penguins (Eudyptula minor) as a case study, we investigated which factors influenced self-reported understanding of human disturbance to wildlife and knowledge of species. We then determined whether participants changed their self-reported definition of what constitutes disturbance to wildlife following a behavioral evaluation of little penguin videos and assessed whether participants could be used to evaluate animal behavior videos. We showed that participants’ demographics influenced self-reported knowledge regarding little penguins. We also found that participants’ education levels correlated with their understanding of human disturbance and abilities to evaluate behavioral videos. However, we did not see a change in people’s understanding of what constitute disturbance to wildlife following the behavioral evaluation. Our results demonstrate the impact that participants’ education levels can have for both knowledge relevant to wildlife and behavioral studies. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Accumulating reports of negative impacts of tourist activities on wildlife emphasize the importance of closely monitoring focal populations. Although some effects are readily noticed, more subtle ones such as changes in physiological functions of individuals might go overlooked. Based on evidence of altered physiology associated with ecotourism on Magellanic penguins Spheniscus magellanicus, here we performed an integrated assessment using a diverse physiological toolkit together with more traditional fitness-related measures to better understand mechanisms and potential consequences. Chicks exposed to tourism showed altered immune parameters and elevated flea prevalence, reinforcing previous findings. Tourism-exposed female, but not male, chicks also showed relatively lower hematocrit and plasma protein levels, providing evidence consistent with a sex-specific response to tourist visitation. Physiological alterations detected in tourism-exposed young chicks (week 1–2) were maintained and the effect on flea infestation increased during the study period (week 4–5 of post-hatch). Despite the effects on physiology, these did not seem to translate into immediate fitness costs. No detectable tourism effects were found on brood sex ratios, chick growth and body condition, and survival until week 5–6 post-hatch. We detected no effects on reproductive output and only a marginal effect on nest survival during incubation despite previous reports of tourism-associated alterations in stress indices of adults. This disconnection could result if the physiological changes are not strong enough to impact fitness, if effects balance each other out, or if changes are part of a copying strategy. Alternatively, the physiological alterations might only show impacts later in the brooding cycle or even after chick emancipation from their parents. Our results suggest that integrative monitoring of potential anthropogenic impacts on wildlife should include evaluation of physiological mechanisms and individual-level responses in populations exposed to human activities. © 2023

ABSTRACT: An essential trait in the life history of any animal species is reproduction, including parental care. In seabirds, these actions are well defined and stereotyped. Our study focused on analyzing the parental care behavior, reproductive success, and phenology of the southern rockhopper penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome) population of Isla Pingüino, Argentina, through the use of autonomous time-lapse cameras combined with marking of individuals. We compared our results to data obtained from traditional monitoring methods used in the same colony. The phenology of their breeding cycle was the same as in other colonies of the SW Atlantic region. Although parents shared their chick rearing duties, females invested more time in incubating the eggs, while males were more dedicated to chick guarding. Chicks were more frequently fed by females, and males contributed only during the crèche period. The effect of heat stress on chick survival was assessed, since uncommonly high air temperatures were reached during the study, causing unprecedented chick mass mortality. Temperatures of > 25° C were a lethal threshold for chicks; hence, the occurrence of several extremely hot days increased chick mortality. Our combined methodology was useful to evaluate phenology, parental investment, and the variables that affect reproductive success (for instance, weather conditions). We recommend its use in future comparative and long-term studies at remote rockhopper penguin colonies to help improve the quality of monitoring and detect potential threats of this vulnerable species. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Australasia is home to unique and endangered avian species. Drug administration to this group of animal patients for prophylaxis and treatment is challenging from a number of different perspectives. A key limitation for optimal drug dosing in birds is the lack of published pharmacokinetic studies to guide dose requirements. The aim of this review was to systematically investigate published literature on pharmacokinetics in penguin species and compare that with the pharmacokinetics of other avian species with a focus on two drugs: enrofloxacin and voriconazole. The review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. A systematic literature search was performed in Pubmed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. A key finding is that penguin pharmacokinetics differs from other avian species, with weight-adjusted AUC and Cmax values higher than most other avian species (e.g., for enrofloxacin, the AUC in the African penguin is 85.7 μg h/mL, which is more than double the other bird species). Doses for some avian species may be successfully extrapolated from other avian species; however, it appears important to consider factors other than just body weight (e.g., clearance mechanism and drug physicochemical characteristics). Consequently, there is an important need for robust pharmacokinetic data in wildlife species to ensure optimal therapy for this special group of patients. As part of this review, we identify key aspects that should be considered when estimating dose in species for which there is limited pharmacokinetic information available. © 2023 American Chemical Society

ABSTRACT: Age-related variation in foraging performance can result from both within-individual change and selection processes. These mechanisms can only be disentangled by using logistically challenging long-term, longitudinal studies. Coupling a long-term demographic data set with high-temporal-resolution tracking of 18 Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae, age 4-15 yrs old) over three consecutive annual cycles, we examined how foraging behaviour changed within individuals of different age classes. Evidence indicated within-individual improvement in young and middle-age classes, but a significant decrease in foraging dive frequency within old individuals, associated with a decrease in the dive descent rate. Decreases in foraging performance occurred at a later age (from 12-15 yrs old to 15-18 yrs old) than the onset of senescence predicted for this species (9-11 yrs old). Foraging dive frequency was most affected by the interaction between breeding status and annual life-cycle periods, with frequency being highest during returning migration and breeding season and was highest overall for successful breeders during the chick-rearing period. Females performed more foraging dives per hour than males. This longitudinal, full annual cycle study allowed us to shed light on the changes in foraging performance occurring among individuals of different age classes and highlighted the complex interactions among drivers of individual foraging behaviour.  © 2023 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The presence of humans within the natural environment is increasing worldwide. Assessing the impact of such activities on wildlife is crucial for declining populations where human disturbance adds to existing pressures. Here, we investigated how human activities at night influenced Little Penguin Eudyptula minor numbers and behaviours (specifically return time, number of vocalizations and time spent in vigilance) on Granite Island, a declining population in South Australia, Australia. We combined data from regular night surveys with continuous video and audio monitoring to assess the impact of human activities on the Little Penguins. The use of white light (i.e. from torches or camera flashes) by people was the most frequent activity recorded at night (recorded on 65% of the monitored nights). Fewer penguins were found on land at night when Dogs Canis lupus familiaris were present, but not when the number of people increased, when concerts occurred, or when white lights were used. Little Penguins were observed more often returning late from sea at night when Dogs were present and when white lights were used, but not when concerts occurred. An increase in penguin vocalizations at night correlated with the presence of Dogs and the occurrence of concerts, whereas penguins vocalized less when white lights were used. The time Little Penguins spent in vigilance did not correlate with any of the disturbances analysed. Our study also highlights the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on wildlife, as the occurrence of human activities increased significantly following the implementation of the COVID-19 health protection measures. These results add to a growing body of literature suggesting that human activities on land, and their consequent disturbance(s), may affect the numbers and behaviours of wildlife and that appropriate measures need to be developed to limit such impacts. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: As one of the best studied components of the Southern Ocean food web, Pygoscelis penguins serve as an important window into the larger marine ecosystem, but the patchiness and heterogeneity of the census data available have made it difficult to assess trends in a policy-accessible way. Here we introduce a Pygoscelis penguin-specific biodiversity index, the ‘Penguindex,’ using the framework of the Living Planet Index (LPI), distilling 40 year population trends of pygoscelid penguins for the first time into a single pan-Antarctic indicator for use by policymakers. We also calculate species- and region-specific indices from which discrete eras of population dynamics can be identified. These indices, similar to the LPI itself, do not provide estimates of changes in absolute abundance of species but, instead, reflect comparable population trends and the relative magnitude of these changes. We find that the Adélie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) index was relatively stable across the Antarctic since 1980, with declines in regional indices across the Antarctic Peninsula region being contrasted by increases in regional indices for the Ross Sea and East Antarctica. The Chinstrap Penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica) index across the Antarctic declined by 61%. In stark contrast, the index for Gentoo Penguin (Pygoscelis papua) has increased seven-fold. Our analysis also identifies several marked eras of regional pygoscelid population change that may help identify key mechanistic drivers. We expect that the Penguindex will act as a useful reference tool for policymakers and hope that, by following this example, other taxonomic groups in the Antarctic might be tracked using the Living Planet Index framework. Importantly, our development of the Penguindex should facilitate the much-needed integration of Antarctic data into global biodiversity monitoring. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: A 2-year-old male African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) was presented to a veterinary teaching hospital for evaluation of a previously diagnosed subclinical, marked regenerative anemia. Physical examination at the zoological institution demonstrated biliverdinuria and pale oral mucous membranes. Diagnostic tests performed on the penguin since the diagnosis and prior to presentation to the veterinary teaching hospital included serial complete blood counts, plasma biochemistry panels, radiographic imaging, blood and plasma heavy metal testing, and infectious disease testing. The abnormal diagnostic test results were consistent with marked regenerative anemia and splenomegaly. At the veterinary teaching hospital, further diagnostic testing was ordered in an attempt to determine the cause of the biliverdinuria and pale oral mucous membranes. The diagnostic tests performed included a full-body contrast computed tomographic scan, upper gastrointestinal endoscopic procedure, bone marrow aspiration and evaluation, saline agglutination testing, blood Plasmodium species polymerase chain reaction screening, a vitamin profile panel, and repeat blood heavy metal testing. The complete blood count demonstrated a marked, regenerative anemia with the presence of dysplastic erythrocytes, and splenomegaly was found on the computed tomographic images without identifying a definitive cause. Primary disease differentials for the diagnosed regenerative anemia included a myelodysplastic syndrome and primary or secondary immune-mediated hemolytic anemia. The penguin was treated with oral prednisolone as an immunomodulatory agent; however, it did not result in a positive treatment response. The patient developed hyporexia, weight loss, and lethargy 2 months post presentation to the veterinary teaching hospital. Additional therapy with cyclophosphamide was initiated, and the penguin improved clinically, but then declined. The patient was euthanized due to a poor quality of life and prognosis 4 months after initial presentation and 1.5 years after the first complete blood count revealed the penguin to be anemic. Microscopic review of submitted postmortem tissue samples demonstrated a monomorphic population of neoplastic small lymphocytes infiltrating the spleen, consistent with splenic small cell lymphoma. The neoplastic cells did not label with the T-cell marker CD3 or B-cell markers CD20, CD79a, and Pax-5. © 2023 by the Association of Avian Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: An understanding of the microbial communities in African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) could provide valuable information for saving this endangered species. The objective of this study was to investigate the composition, diversity and sex-related differences in the intestinal microbiota of captive African penguins. Fecal samples were collected from 21 captive adult African penguins reared in the same conditions at Shanghai Zoo. The results show that Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes were the predominant bacteria in the intestinal microbiota of the captive African penguins. No difference was found in microbial diversity between female and male African penguins, as shown by their similar alpha and beta diversities. However, a notable sex-related difference was found between their microbial compositions. Female African penguins have a higher abundance of Pseudomonas and a lower abundance of Kocuria than males. A functional prediction indicates that the “mRNA surveillance pathway”, “Polyketide sugar unit biosynthesis”, “Wnt signaling pathway”, “Lysosome” and “Cell cycle” pathways were significantly enriched in the microbiota of female African penguins. In conclusion, the present study indicates that the compositions and predicted functions of the intestinal microbiota are significantly different between the sexes. Our data suggest that the intestinal microbiota of female African penguins are more unstable than the intestinal microbiota of males in captivity. © 2023 by the author.

ABSTRACT: The nesting site of Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) at Tucker islets (54°09'S; 70°17'W), Chile, is documented and information from the first population abundance estimate on the largest islet during the beginning of chick rearing is provided. Ground-based counts yielded an estimate of 8883 (95% Confidence Intervals: 6653–11,802) burrows; however, counts of active burrows resulted in a total estimate of 2218 (95% Confidence Intervals: 1593–2840) breeding pairs. Based on the estimated total of burrows, this suggests a population decline consistent with trends for other colonies in the Magellan Strait and adjacent waters in Chile. An annual monitoring program to track population changes, breeding success, and chick and egg survival rates is required to assess the species' conservation status of the colony. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2023.

ABSTRACT: A juvenile king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus) was sighted at San Martín Station, Marguerite Bay, west of the Antarctic Peninsula (68°07'S, 67°08'W) on 3 February 2020. The animal was apparently healthy. It was uninjured, moving freely between the station buildings. It remained in the area until 27 March, when it was last seen. Numerous king penguin records have been reported in recent years, mostly in the South Shetland Islands. Two chicks have even been recorded hatching on these islands, but there is currently no evidence that king penguins have raised a chick to emancipation successfully. Here we present the most southerly known record of king penguins, the only one farther south than the Antarctic Circle. Coupled with observations from other parts of Antarctica, the information presented here supports previous suggestions by other authors of a southwards expansion of this species specifically in the Antarctic Peninsula region. The presence of this species at numerous Antarctic localities suggests that the known distribution of this penguin could change in the near future in response to climate change. © The Author(s), 2024.

ABSTRACT: Byssus is important for marine bivalves to adhere robustly to diverse substrates and resist environmental impacts. The winged pearl oyster, Pteria penguin, can reattach or not reattach to the same environment, which leaves the development and survival of the oyster population at risk. In this study, diverse methods were employed to evaluate the byssus quality and explore the mechanism of byssus secretion at different temperatures. The results demonstrated that oysters maintained their byssus properties at different temperatures through polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) variation. They were both higher at 27 °C than at 21 °C. Furthermore, PPO activities of WB27 (31.78 U/g ± 1.50 U/g) were significantly higher than NB27, WB21, and NB21. Sectional observation revealed three types of vesicles, from which a novel vesicle might participate in byssogenesis as a putative metal storage particle. Moreover, cytoskeletal proteins may cooperate with cilia to transport byssal proteins, which then facilitate byssus formation under the regulation of upstream signals. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated that protein quality control, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and cytoskeletal reorganization-related genes contributed to adaptation to temperature changes and byssus fabrication, and protection-related genes play a critical role in byssogenesis, byssus toughness, and durability. These results were utilized to create a byssogenesis mechanism model, to reveal the foot gland and vesicle types of P. penguin and provide new insights into adaptation to temperature changes and byssus fabrication in sessile bivalves. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Penguin colonies significantly influence the distribution and diversity of vegetation communities in Maritime Antarctica, as they serve as vital sources of nutrients for both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Remote sensing techniques are becoming increasingly common for monitoring these vast Antarctic areas, especially with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) imagery, which provides the highest spatial resolutions to date. In fact, the use of hyperspectral (HS) sensors is crucial for accurately identifying and distinguishing between the main ground characteristics and vegetation communities in an Antarctic penguin colony, making this study one of the first UAV-based HS approaches to our knowledge. Consequently, this study provides a spectral library covering the entire spectral range from 400 to 2500 nm for the five main vegetation communities found at Hannah Point penguin colony (Livingston Island, Antarctica). Through this library, two valuable wavelength regions have been identified for distinguishing these communities based on pigments composition, specifically in the green (495–570 nm) and near-infrared (800–900 nm) ranges, that served as a reference for validating the results using 35 ground reference spectrometry data collected in 1667 wavelength bands within the 320–876 nm range. In addition, the supervised classification approach known as the “Spectral Angle Mapper” has been employed to monitor the coverage of each vegetation community based on the information provided by the aforementioned spectral library. The observed ecological gradient, which reveals an increase in vegetation complexity away from the high-nutrient content guano areas, highlights the influence of guano on the distribution of the main vegetation patterns across the entire penguin colony. The results of this study could serve as a reference point for more sophisticated research involving the use of UAV-based HS or MS sensors in Antarctica, offering unique opportunities to detect small variations in these remote ecosystems resulting from climate change. © 2023

ABSTRACT: Pulmonary aspergillosis occurring in captive penguins living in zoos and aquariums is a fatal disease owing to its high mortality rate. On conducting computed tomography, two gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) with respiratory clinical signs that were housed at an aquarium in Hokkaido, Japan were found to have a certain amount of fluid in their air sacs. This fluid was collected and cultured for bacteria and fungi, the results of which both came back negative. These results enabled us to rule out bacterial infection or aspergillosis and supported our decision not to administer antibacterial and antifungal drugs. Overall, the combination of computed tomography and air sac fluid examination was useful for ruling out bacterial infection or aspergillosis in penguins with respiratory clinical signs. © 2024 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: In vertebrates, developmental conditions can have long-term effects on individual performance. It is increasingly recognized that oxidative stress could be one physiological mechanismconnecting early-life experience to adult phenotype. Accordingly, markers of oxidative status could be useful for assessing the developmental constraints encountered by offspring. Although some studies have demonstrated that developmental constraints are associated with high levels of oxidative stress in offspring, it remains unclear how growth, parental behavior, and brood competitionmay altogether affect oxidative stress in long-lived species in the wild. Here, we investigated this question in a long-lived Antarctic bird species by testing the impact of brood competition (e.g., brood size and hatching order) on body mass and on two markers of oxidative damage in Adélie penguin chicks.We also examined the influence of parental effort (i.e., foraging trip duration) and parental body condition on chick body mass and oxidative damage. First, we found that brood competition and parental traits had significant impacts on chick bodymass. Second, we found that chick age and, to a lesser extent, chick body mass were two strong determinants of the levels of oxidative damage inAdélie penguin chicks. Finally, and importantly, we also found that brood competition significantly increased the levels of one marker of oxidative damage and was associatedwitha lower survival probability.However, parental effort and parental condition were not significantly linked to chick levels of oxidative damage. Overall, our study demonstrates that sibling competition can generate an oxidative cost even for this long-lived Antarctic species with a limited brood size (maximum of two chicks). © 2023, University of Chicago Press.

ABSTRACT: The use of stable isotopes of sulfur (δ34S) to infer avian diets, foraging habitats, and movements is relatively uncommon, resulting in a lack of information on patterns of δ34S incorporation in avian tissue. In a controlled study of Gentoo Penguins (Pygoscelis papua), we found that diet-tissue isotopic discrimination factors (Δ34Sdiet-tissue) differed among egg components and feathers synthesized from a common diet, ranging from –0.4 to –1.7%. We also found that methodical choices such as lipid extraction and prey tissue selection influenced calculated Δ34Sdiet-tissue values. Specifically, Δ34Sdiet-tissue values were lower (i.e., more negative) when calculated using whole fish relative to fish muscle and lipid-extraction biased egg yolk, but not fish tissue, δ34S values. The Δ34Sdiet-tissue values obtained for Gentoo Penguins fed a marine fish diet were generally lower than those reported for freshwater fish consumption by Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus), the only other bird species in which Δ34Sdiet-tissue has been quantified. We found support for the hypothesis that tissue Δ34Sdiet-tissue values are inversely related to dietary δ34S values in birds, similar to what has been observed in mammals. Given this relationship, the discrimination factors reported here for Gentoo Penguins may be broadly applicable to other avian species with a similar marine diet. Finally, we provide recommendations for future studies seeking to quantify Δ34Sdiet-tissue in avian tissues and guidance to allow for greater application of sulfur stable isotope analysis in ornithological research.

ABSTRACT: The occurrence of marine debris in the stomach contents of young male and female Spheniscus magellanicus stranded along the Atlantic coast of northern Argentina during its post-breeding exodus is reported for the first time. Marine debris was found in 15.5 % of 148 dead penguins, with a higher proportion of debris found in females when compared to males. A total of 81 debris items was recorded; plastic and paper each contributed with an equal number of debris whereas rubber contributed with a single item. Chemical identification performed using FTIR/ATR revealed that plastic items were largely LDPE and PA; other polymers included HDPE, PP and PS. The average length of fragmented plastic debris are in line with those reported from penguins stranded along the southern Brazilian coasts. Our study indicates that loads of ingested marine debris were roughly five times lower when compared to the estimates for the species in Brazilian beaches. © 2023

ABSTRACT: The gut microbiomes of Antarctic penguins are important for the fitness of the host birds and their chicks. The compositions of microbial communities in Antarctic penguin guts are strongly associated with the birds’ diet, physiological adaptation and phylogeny. Whilst seasonal changes in food resources, distribution and population parameters of Antarctic penguins have been well addressed, little research is available on the stability or variability of penguin stomach microbiomes over time. Here, we focused on two Pygoscelis penguin species breeding sympatrically in the maritime Antarctic and analysed their stomach contents to assess whether penguin gut microbiota differed over three austral summer breeding seasons. We used a high-throughput DNA sequencing approach to study bacterial diversity in stomach regurgitates of Adélie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarctica) penguins that have a similar foraging regime on Signy Island (South Orkney Islands). Our data revealed significant differences in bacterial alpha and beta diversity between the study seasons. We also identified bacterial genera that were significantly associated with specific breeding seasons, diet compositions, chick-rearing stages and sampling events. This study provides a baseline for establishing future monitoring of penguin gut microbiomes in a rapidly changing environment. Two supplementary figures and two supple001503 © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: As charismatic and iconic species, penguins can act as “ambassadors” or flagship species to promote the conservation of marine habitats in the Southern Hemisphere. Unfortunately, there is a lack of reliable, comprehensive, and systematic analysis aimed at compiling spatially explicit assessments of the multiple impacts that the world's 18 species of penguin are facing. We provide such an assessment by combining the available penguin occurrence information from Global Biodiversity Information Facility (>800,000 occurrences) with three main stressors: climate-driven environmental changes at sea, industrial fisheries, and human disturbances on land. Our analyses provide a quantitative assessment of how these impacts are unevenly distributed spatially within species' distribution ranges. Consequently, contrasting pressures are expected among species, and populations within species. The areas coinciding with the greatest impacts for penguins are the coast of Perú, the Patagonian Shelf, the Benguela upwelling region, and the Australian and New Zealand coasts. When weighting these potential stressors with species-specific vulnerabilities, Humboldt (Spheniscus humboldti), African (Spheniscus demersus), and Chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarcticus) emerge as the species under the most pressure. Our approach explicitly differentiates between climate and human stressors, since the more achievable management of local anthropogenic stressors (e.g., fisheries and land-based threats) may provide a suitable means for facilitating cumulative impacts on penguins, especially where they may remain resilient to global processes such as climate change. Moreover, our study highlights some poorly represented species such as the Northern Rockhopper (Eudyptes moseleyi), Snares (Eudyptes robustus), and Erect-crested penguin (Eudyptes sclateri) that need internationally coordinated efforts for data acquisition and data sharing to understand their spatial distribution properly. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: We identified a novel herpesvirus in 2 deceased captive blue penguins (Eudyptula minor). Moderate-to-severe myocardiocyte atrophy and necrosis, and eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies (INIBs), were seen in myocardiocytes in one bird; reticuloendothelial (RE) cell INIBs and multifocal RE cell necrosis were seen in both birds. The histologic findings were suggestive of viral infection. A herpesvirus PCR assay was positive in myocardial tissue from the bird with myocardial degeneration and in splenic tissue from both birds. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis showed that the virus, accessioned as spheniscid alphaherpesvirus 2 (SpAHV2), groups within the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily and forms a unique branch point in a subclade containing members of the Mardivirus, Simplexvirus, and Varicellovirus genera. Herpesvirus screening of tissues from 8 additional blue penguin postmortem examination cases (7 spleen, 1 liver) and combined conjunctival-choanal-cloacal swab samples from 13 live penguins revealed 5 additional dead and 7 live penguins that were positive for SpAHV2. The presence of SpAHV2 in healthy live animals and lack of significant herpesvirus-associated lesions as the cause of death in 6 of 7 SpAHV2-positive dead penguins suggests that this virus may be an endemic in blue penguins, and that recrudescence may cause disease and death. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Understanding how to influence ice adhesion to structures and prevent icing catastrophes is a paramount research question. Conventional industrial anti-icing methods are active, requiring an energy source. However, active strategies are energy intensive. Passive anti-icing surfaces have thus become an area of engineering interest. Such strategies, like low surface energy chemical coatings, produce highly anti-icing surfaces on a lab-scale but they have not succeeded in industrial applications. They lack efficacy over repeated icing/de-icing cycles and their materials are unsuited for harsh environments. The body feather of the sub-Antarctic Gento penguin Pygoscelis papua, which ornithologists note is perpetually free of ice despite its freezing environment, serves as a compelling source of passive anti-icing biomimetic inspiration which may overcome these aforementioned deficiencies. Through studying these feathers, it has become clear that two aspects of anti-icing (water-shedding and ice-shedding) are addressed in distinct ways by the Gentoo penguin. The water-shedding functionality of the feathers is derived from an air cushion created by the wire-like microstructure of the feather and is augmented by nano-scale grooves in the feather coated in preen oil. The preen oil is necessary to maintain water-shedding functionality, however once removed the ice-shedding functionality of the feathers is maintained. The ice-shedding functionality appears to be derived from wire-like morphology of the penguin body feather barbs and barbules which induce cracks that are easily opened at the ice-feather interface. Such a design strategy shows promise in addressing the common failings of passive systems. These anti-icing strategies were then tested on metallic biomimetic substrates. The barb structure of the penguin body feather was mimicked using ultra-fine woven stainless-steel wire cloth. Some stainless-steel wire cloths were laser machined to mimic the texturing and surface chemistry of the feathers. These cloths were indeed hydrophobic like the feathers. Both stainless-steel wire cloths had significantly reduced ice adhesion strengths compared to those of the flat monolithic stainless-steel sample. The laser-machined wire cloth had an ice adhesion strength of 63 ± 10 kPa compared to 603 ± 236 kPa for the flat sample. This both indicates that the ice-shedding capabilities of the sample are imparted by the structure and further strengthens the argument that water-shedding and ice-shedding are distinct phenomena that need to be addressed with two separate design strategies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The global loss of top predators has led to widespread changes in food webs. In Patagonia, it is hypothesized that local extirpations of terrestrial predators, including the puma (Puma concolor), has led to the expansion of Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) colonies across the Atlantic coast of Argentina. Interestingly, more recent wildlife conservation efforts in the region have led to an unexpected trophic link between pumas and penguins. Here, we used a camera trap array to assess this novel predator-prey relationship between pumas and penguins in Monte León National Park (MLNP) over a three-month period. Pumas were detected 12.5 times more than any other mammalian predator and were detected on 95% of the days during our study period. We also observed 28 individual events of pumas preying upon penguins. Our work demonstrates a strong linkage between the marine and terrestrial ecosystem at MLNP. Puma predation of penguins may have widespread ecological implications including effects on puma and penguin abundance, changes in puma social behavior, and interspecific competition among other prey items and carnivores in the park. We propose hypotheses and questions to investigate these potential outcomes. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Background: The presence of a tracheal septum dividing the trachea into two makes intubation one of the main challenges of penguin anaesthesia. Differences in the length and location of the aforementioned tracheal septum have been described in some penguin species. However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, it has not been reported in Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti). Therefore, one of the aims of this publication is to report the septal position in this Humboldt penguin. Furthermore, this publication describes the anaesthetic protocol and complications encountered and discusses some of the more important features of penguin anaesthesia. It is anticipated that this case report will aid in future procedures requiring anaesthesia of this penguin species. Case presentation: A 25-year-old female Humboldt penguin was anaesthetized at the University College Dublin Veterinary Hospital for radiographs and computed tomography (CT) following three weeks of inappetence. After assessing the health status of the penguin from the clinical history and performing a physical examination, an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status score of II was assigned and a combination of butorphanol 1 mg/kg and midazolam 1 mg/kg was administered intramuscularly to sedate the penguin. Induction of anaesthesia was performed via a face mask using sevoflurane in oxygen. The airway was intubated with a 4.0 mm Cole tube and anaesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane in oxygen during the entire procedure. Anaesthetic monitoring consisted of an electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure, capnography, and body temperature. Conclusions: Tracheal bifurcation was identified as the start of the tracheal septum 4.67 cm from the glottis using CT. Most of the anticipated complications of penguin anaesthesia, such as hyperthermia, hypothermia, regurgitation, hypoventilation, and difficulties in intubation were present in this case. However, no major sequalae occurred following the anaesthetic protocol described. © 2023, Veterinary Ireland.

ABSTRACT: While automated recorders are becoming a favourable tool to monitor birds, methods to analyse the large amount of data generated and their reliability for estimating population size are still limited. In this study, I compared Little Penguins Eudyptula minor call detection between a trained researcher, amateur volunteers and an automated software, assessed which environmental factors affect call variability and detectability and determined the feasibility of automated recorders to estimate population sizes. I found that (1) the number of calls detected by the trained researcher was significantly higher than those detected by the amateur volunteers and automated software, (2) neither wind speed nor moon illumination affected call variability and detectability, and (3) six automated recorders estimated between 3% (large colony) and 14–26% (small colony) of the population. This study contributes to our understanding of the efficacy of automated recorders for avian monitoring. © 2023 The Author.

ABSTRACT: It has been postulated that ultraviolet reflectance is important in mate choice in King Penguins Aptenodytes patagonicus, although not in other penguin species that do not have body parts that reflect UV light. However, this theory has been challenged. Here we aimed to determine the transmission of the ocular media in the large King Penguin as well as the smallest penguin, the Little Penguin Eudyptula minor, and a medium-sized penguin, the Gentoo Penguin Pygoscelis papua, to determine if the penguin eye is capable of seeing ultraviolet light. In all species the cornea absorbed the most damaging rays at 300 nm or below but it was the lens that predominantly determined the transmission of light between 300 and 400 nm. The lenses of a young King Penguin absorbed almost all light less than 370 nm and had 50% transmission at 406 nm, thus ultraviolet perception in the King Penguin is very limited. In contrast, 50% lenticular transmission was 329 nm in the Little Penguin and 367 nm in the Gentoo. Therefore, we suspect that ultraviolet light may be more important in the behaviour of smaller penguins than in the King Penguin, where it is unlikely to play a significant role. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Due to its persistence and potential ecological and health impacts, mercury (Hg) is a global pollutant of major concern that may reach high concentrations even in remote polar oceans. In contrast to the Arctic Ocean, studies documenting Hg contamination in the Southern Ocean are spatially restricted and large-scale monitoring is needed. Here, we present the first circumpolar assessment of Hg contamination in Antarctic marine ecosystems. Specifically, the Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) was used as a bioindicator species, to examine regional variation across 24 colonies distributed across the entire Antarctic continent. Mercury was measured on body feathers collected from both adults (n = 485) and chicks (n = 48) between 2005 and 2021. Because penguins’ diet represents the dominant source of Hg, feather δ13C and δ15N values were measured as proxies of feeding habitat and trophic position. As expected, chicks had lower Hg concentrations (mean ± SD: 0.22 ± 0.08 μg·g‒1) than adults (0.49 ± 0.23 μg·g‒1), likely because of their shorter bioaccumulation period. In adults, spatial variation in feather Hg concentrations was driven by both trophic ecology and colony location. The highest Hg concentrations were observed in the Ross Sea, possibly because of a higher consumption of fish in the diet compared to other sites (krill-dominated diet). Such large-scale assessments are critical to assess the effectiveness of the Minamata Convention on Mercury. Owing to their circumpolar distribution and their ecological role in Antarctic marine ecosystems, Adélie penguins could be valuable bioindicators for tracking spatial and temporal trends of Hg across Antarctic waters in the future.

ABSTRACT: The COVID-19 pandemic caused the Port Lockroy post office, a popular Antarctic tourism destination, to close in 2020, creating a natural experiment to test human impacts on the local gentoo penguins. This study examines the abundance of nesting gentoo penguins before, during, and after the COVID-19 anthropause at different spatial scales centered around the post office. We found that the Port Lockroy population increased 83 % (∼450 nesting pairs) from 2018 to 2021, with areas of the island open to pedestrians seeing the greatest gains in the number of nests. Jougla Point, a site just 150 m away from Port Lockroy and located within the same harbor, increased 90 % (∼900 nesting pairs) during the closure, while two nearby sites outside the harbor decreased by 60 % and 59 % (∼1000 nesting pairs total). We conclude that gentoo penguins immigrated from neighboring sites into the Port Lockroy harbor. This apparent redistribution of nesting gentoo penguins immediately reversed itself when the post office re-opened in 2022. These findings, which are particularly striking given the assumed strong site fidelity of gentoo penguins, suggest that human activity can alter gentoo penguins' choice in nesting location, and that the spatial extent of disturbance is perhaps larger than previously appreciated. We suggest testing the impacts of ship and zodiac traffic on breeding behavior, the cumulative effects of tourism on sets of geographically proximate colonies, and the timing of tourism in relation to nest initiation to inform policies focusing on minimizing disturbances to gentoo penguins as Antarctic tourism resumes. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Birds are known to be highly social and visual animals. Yet no specific visual feature has been identified to be responsible for individual recognition in birds. Here, using a differential looking paradigm across five experiments, we demonstrated that African penguins, Spheniscus demersus, spontaneously discriminated between life-size photographs of their monogamous, lifelong partner and a nonpartner colonymate using their ventral dot patterns. Our findings challenge the assumption of limited visual involvement in penguin communication and suggest a rather complex and flexible recognition process in these birds. The combination of our current results and previous findings, which showed cross-modal (visual/auditory) recognition in these animals, suggests that African penguins use their ventral dot patterns to individually recognize their colonymates. Our results provide the first evidence of a specific visual cue responsible for spontaneous individual recognition by a bird, and highlight the importance of considering all sensory modalities in the study of animal communication. © 2023 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: We introduce Promoter-Enhancer-Guided Interaction Networks (PENGUIN), a method for studying protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks within enhancer-promoter interactions. PENGUIN integrates H3K27ac-HiChIP data with tissue-specific PPIs to define enhancer-promoter PPI networks (EPINs). We validated PENGUIN using cancer (LNCaP) and benign (LHSAR) prostate cell lines. Our analysis detected EPIN clusters enriched with the architectural protein CTCF, a regulator of enhancer-promoter interactions. CTCF presence was coupled with the prevalence of prostate cancer (PrCa) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the same EPIN clusters, suggesting functional implications in PrCa. Within the EPINs displaying enrichments in both CTCF and PrCa SNPs, we also show enrichment in oncogenes. We substantiated our identified SNPs through CRISPR/Cas9 knockout and RNAi screens experiments. Here we show that PENGUIN provides insights into the intricate interplay between enhancer-promoter interactions and PPI networks, which are crucial for identifying key genes and potential intervention targets.

ABSTRACT: As a species highly reliant on stable fast ice as a breeding platform, emperor penguins are increasingly challenged in their breeding attempts due to changes in fast ice conditions. We collated habitat information of 27 emperor penguin colonies in East Antarctica (43°–167° E) from 2018 to 2023 using European Space Agency Sentinel-2 satellite images. Our objective was to examine the variability in habitat and ice conditions and associated repercussions for colony location and breeding success. Variables, such as location, colony movement and inter-annual variability in these parameters, were used to assess the adaptability of emperor penguins when local conditions change markedly. The major challenge emperor penguins currently face throughout Antarctica is untimely loss of breeding habitat resulting in increased or complete breeding failure, as observed in 9 colonies at least once during the study. One small colony at the West Ice Shelf lost its breeding area and has not been seen since 2021. The inter-annual movement of some colonies demonstrates the species’ adaptability and the need for ongoing monitoring of the global emperor penguin population using satellite imagery. We highlight caveats, such as availability of suitable satellite images and movement of colonies, that need to be accounted for to ensure sound interpretation of the monitoring findings. Ongoing Antarctic-wide monitoring is essential to quantify the impact of changing fast ice conditions on emperor penguins and also the cumulative impacts of other threats such as disease. The information presented is to provide background and empirical data for researchers, policy makers and managers. © (2024), (Inter-Research). All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: We conducted the first assessment of Adélie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) chick survival that accounts for imperfect resighting. We found that when chicks are larger in size when they enter the crèche stage (the period when both parents forage at the same time and chicks are left relatively unprotected), they have a higher probability of survival to fledging. We investigated the relationships between growth, crèche timing, and chick survival during one typical year and one year of reduced food availability. Chicks that hatched earlier in the season entered the crèche stage older, and chicks that both grew faster and crèched older entered the crèche at a larger size. These relationships were stronger in the year of reduced food availability. Thus, parents increased their chicks’ chance of fledging if they provided sufficient food for faster growth rates and/or extended the length of the brood-guarding period. Early nest initiation (i.e., early hatching) provided parents with the opportunity to extend the guard period and increase chick survival. However, to extend the guard stage successfully, they must provide larger meals and maintain higher chick growth rates, even if just one parent at a time is foraging, which previous work has shown is not possible for all individuals. We show that the factors governing tradeoffs in chick-rearing behavior of Adélie Penguin parents may vary in accord with environmental conditions, a result from which we can better understand species’ adaptations to environmental changes.

ABSTRACT: Acinetobacter spp. are often isolated from natural sources, but knowledge about their presence in wild animals is fragmented and uncomplete. The present study aimed to characterize a series of Acinetobacter radioresistens isolated from Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti). Fifteen Humboldt penguins from an inhabited northern Peruvian island were sampled. Microorganisms were identified by MALDI-TOF MS. Antibiotic susceptibility to 12 antimicrobial agents was established, and clonal relationships were determined. A representative isolate was selected for whole genome sequencing (WGS). A. radioresistens were isolated from the feces of 12 (80%) Humboldt penguins, being susceptible to all the antimicrobial agents tested, except eight cefotaxime-intermediate isolates. All A. radioresistens were clonally related. WGS showed that the isolate belonged to ST1972, the presence of two chromosomal encoded carbapenemases (blaOXA-23 and a putative subclass B3 metallo-β-lactamase), and a series of point mutations in antibiotic-resistance related chromosomal genes, which were considered as polymorphisms. In addition, a few virulence factors, including a capsule-encoding operon, superoxide dismutases, catalases, phospholipases and a siderophore receptor were identified. The present results suggest that A. radioresistens may be a common member of the gut microbiota of Humboldt penguins, but further studies in other geographical areas are needed to establish this finding.  © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: We surveyed the facilities that were members of the Japan Association of Zoos and Aquariums to clarify the incidence of aspergillosis, which is a major cause of death in captive penguins, and to discern effective preventive measures. Responses were obtained for 2910 penguins in 64 facilities; 73 penguins (2.5%) in 35 facilities had died from aspergillosis during the past 5 years from April 2016 to March 2021. Answers to questions about the rearing environment indicated that aspergillosis occurred significantly more often in facilities where penguins were reared outdoors, were in contact with soil, or were moved outside of the rearing enclosure. Answers to questions about their dead penguins indicated that 76% may have been at individual risk (e.g., young age, old age, molting period, and breeding season) and 54% were thought to be reared in uncomfortable environments (e.g., high temperature, high humidity). Aspergillosis may occur when individual risk factors and uncomfortable environmental factors are added to the risk factors of exposure to Aspergillus, such as the presence of soil. These conditions must be recognized as risk factors for aspergillosis, and appropriate preventive measures, such as avoiding penguin contact with the soil where Aspergillus is expected to be present, can minimize aspergillosis-related deaths. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Penguins (Aves, Sphenisciformes) are pursuit divers that feed mainly on krill, fish, and squid. Although they are opportunistic feeders, some species are more generalists than others and many show dietary preferences toward krill and other crustaceans or fish and squid. Their diving depth seems to follow a body size pattern and relates to the type of item that they prey on. Penguins dive with their wing; hence their wing musculature is responsible for the animal maneuverability and strength while diving. In the present study, ecological traits such as diving depths and prey composition are used to explore if morphology relates to foraging habits. A geometric morphometric approach is used to quantitatively address these morphological differences in the wing apparatus of all extant penguins and a fossil species taking into consideration allometric and phylogenetic factors. Results show that morphological differences among penguins with different diets are significant and strong; groups are well separated with the greatest differences found between piscivorous and crustacivorous penguins. Dive depth has a moderate covariation with morphology and a strong correspondence with wing area. Last, Madrynornis mirandus, an exceptionally well-preserved fossil from the Miocene of Patagonia, is found to be close to the piscivorous and generalist piscivorous species. It is proposed that swimming styles correlate with specific traits of the anatomy of wing and pectoral girdle skeleton and muscles. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT: The Magellanic Penguin Spheniscus magellanicus exhibits a broad latitudinal distribution in southern South America. However, the locations of many breeding colonies remain poorly known on the Pacific side, particularly in the southernmost region. Here, we provide information for six Magellanic Penguin colonies in the Strait of Magellan and adjacent waters that have been known by the local community for years but were unknown in the scientific literature until now: Rupert Islet, Tuckers Islet 1, Tuckers Islet 2, James Island 1, James Island 2, and Monmouth Island. These locations differ in population size and in vegetation coverage: most colonies are characterized by mosses, grasses, and bushes, but a dense forest cover characterizes Tuckers Islet 2. These records update our knowledge of the distribution of Magellanic Penguin colonies on the southernmost tip of South America. © 2024, Marine Ornithology. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Background: High-pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) has become a conservation threat to wild birds. Therefore, suitable vaccine technology and practical application methods require investigation. Methods: Twenty-four African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) were vaccinated with either a conventional inactivated clade 2.3.4.4b H5N8 HPAI whole virus or a tobacco leaf-produced H5 haemagglutinin-based virus-like particle (VLP). Six birds received a second dose of the inactivated vaccine. Antibody responses were assessed and compared by employing haemagglutination inhibition tests. Results: A second dose of inactivated vaccine was required to induce antibody titres above the level required to suppress virus shedding, while a single dose of VLP vaccine produced these levels by day 14, and one bird still had antibodies on day 430. Limitations: Bacterial contamination of the VLP vaccine limited the monitoring period and sample size in that treatment group, and it was not possible to perform a challenge study with field virus. Conclusion: VLP vaccines offer a more practical option than inactivated whole viruses, especially in logistically challenging situations involving wild birds. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Seabird feces as indicators of the exposure to environmental contaminants have been studied worldwide. Penguins are indicator species for marine pollution, but their role as biovectors of rare earth elements (REEs) to ecosystems have been little studied. The present study quantified the concentration of REEs and trace elements (TEs) in feces of gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua). Adult penguin excreta from Fildes Bay (King George Island) and Yelcho Base (Palmer Archipelago) were collected and then analyzed by ICP-MS. Among REEs, levels ranged from 0.0038 to 1.02 μg g−1 d.w. for Lu and Ce, respectively. For TEs, the levels varied widely through the sample set, with Al, Fe, Sr, Zn and Ti as the highest mean levels, particularly at Fildes Bay. The data show that gentoo penguins act as a biovector organism by transporting TEs and REEs from the sea to land via excreta, reaffirming that this species acts as an important biovector organism in Antarctic ecosystems. The potential impacts of this process on Antarctic ecosystems needs further research. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Drones are being increasingly used to monitor wildlife populations; their large spatial coverage and minimal disturbance make them ideal for use in remote environments where access and time are limited. The methods used to count resulting imagery need consideration as they can be time-consuming and costly. In this study, we used a fixed-wing drone and Beyond Visual Line of Sight flying to create high-resolution imagery and digital surface models (DSMs) of six large king penguin colonies (colony population sizes ranging from 10,671 to 132,577 pairs) in South Georgia. We used a novel DSM-based method to facilitate automated and semi-automated counts of each colony to estimate population size. We assessed these DSM-derived counts against other popular counting and post-processing methodologies, including those from satellite imagery, and compared these to the results from four colonies counted manually to evaluate accuracy and effort. We randomly subsampled four colonies to test the most efficient and accurate methods for density-based counts, including at the colony edge, where population density is lower. Sub-sampling quadrats (each 25 m2) together with DSM-based counts offered the best compromise between accuracy and effort. Where high-resolution drone imagery was available, accuracy was within 3.5% of manual reference counts. DSM methods were more accurate than other established methods including estimation from satellite imagery and are applicable for population studies across other taxa worldwide. Results and methods will be used to inform and develop a long-term king penguin monitoring programme. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: In Antarctica, prey availability for the mesopredator Adélie penguin, Pygoscelis adeliae, depends on sea-ice dynamics. By affecting cycles of sea-ice formation and melt, climate change could thus affect penguin diet and recruitment. In the light of climate change, this raises concerns about the fate of this dominant endemic species, which plays a key role in the Antarctic food web. However, few quantitative studies measuring the effects of sea-ice persistence on the diet of penguin chicks have yet been conducted. The purpose of this study was to fill this gap by comparing penguin diets across four penguin colonies in the Ross Sea and evaluating latitudinal and interannual variation linked to different sea-ice persistence. Diet was evaluated by analysing the δ13C and δ15N values of penguin guano, and sea-ice persistence by means of satellite images. Isotopic values indicate that penguins consumed more krill in colonies with longer sea-ice persistence. In these colonies, the δ13C values of chicks were lower and closer to the pelagic chain than those of adults, suggesting that the latter apparently catch prey inshore for self-feeding and offshore for their chicks. The results indicate that sea-ice persistence is among the principal factors that influence the spatiotemporal variability of the penguins’ diet. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The taxonomic status of strain P5891T, isolated from an Adélie penguin beak swab, was investigated. Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence, the strain was identified as a potentially novel Corynebacterium species, with the highest sequence similarities to Corynebacterium rouxii FRC0190T (96.7%) and Corynebacterium epidermidicanis DSM 45586T (96.6%). The average nucleotide identity values between strain P5891T and C. rouxii FRC0190T and C. epidermidicanis DSM 45586T were 68.2 and 69.2%, respectively. The digital DNA–DNA hybridization values between strain P5891T and C. rouxii FRC0190T and C. epidermidicanis DSM 45586T were 23.7 and 21.4%, respectively. Phylogenetic trees based on the 16S rRNA sequence placed strain P5891T in a separate branch with Corynebacterium canis 1170T and Corynebacterium freiburgense 1045T, while a phylogenomic tree based on the Corynebacterium species core genome placed the strain next to Corynebacterium choanae 200CHT. Extensive phenotyping and genomic analyses clearly confirmed that strain P5891T represents a novel species of the genus Corynebacterium, for which the name Corynebacterium mendelii sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain P5891T (=CCM 8862T=LMG 31627T). © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Penguin guano has been considered as a suitable bioindicator of the exposure to environmental contaminants in Antarctic environment. Although trace metal content values in penguin guano have been widely reported, the kinetics of their mobility in seawater have not been determined. In the present study, we have estimated the release rate of dissolved Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn from Gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) penguins guano to Antarctic seawater by 120 h laboratory and at external natural conditions of temperature and light experiments. A mathematical model using two metal pools guano (labile and equilibrium) and seawater compartments considering pseudo-first-order kinetics, is proposed in order to interpret and predict the release of trace metals. A good statistical agreement between experimental and modelled concentration values allows us obtention of kinetic parameters and partition coefficients (Kdi). These values allow to estimate releases into seawater from 5400 to 6.3 μg/day·penguin of Cu and V, respectively. More than 50 % of the initial content of all the studied elements are released during the first two hours, reaching 90 % release in the decreasing order of speed Ni ≫ Cu ≈ Mo > Mn > Co > Cd ≈ Pb; periods of up to one hour, Fe, V and Zn reach a maximum release and are then readsorbed. Equilibrium releases >90 % for Mo and Cd, and 55 % - 46 % for Co, Ni, Pb and Mn are obtained; Zn with 5.4 %, V with 1.7 % and Fe with 0.88 % show the lowest values. With an overwhelming growth of estimated population south of 60°S of 259.750 breeding pairs we estimate that the Gentoo penguin population is releasing annually in the Southern Ocean, 716 kg Cu, 188 kg Mn, 113 kg Fe, 102 kg Zn, 17.7 kg Mo, 12.0 kg Ni, 8.70 kg Cd, 4.59 kg Co, 6.27 kg Pb and 0.790 kg V of soluble metals. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Low-latitude penguins naturally breed in burrows dug in guano. This affords them a buffered environment that remains cool and humid, reducing the risk of hyperthermia while on land. As a conservation strategy, several versions of artificial housing units have been trialled at various breeding sites of African Penguins (Spheniscus demersus) around South Africa, where former guano exploitation forced many penguins to breed in exposed surface nests. While some units yielded a positive effect on breeding success by providing protection against predation, none of them have effectively mitigated the risk of heat stress in penguins or their eggs. Here, we investigated the microclimate of a recent double-layered design of ceramic artificial nests and compared that to natural burrows, exposed surface nests, and commonly used cement pipe nests, in austral summer 2021 on Bird Island, South Africa. We also recorded penguin behaviour during the hottest period at each of these nest types using remote camera traps to determine the onset of heat stress (panting). Double-layered ceramic nests out-performed all other nest types, including natural burrows, by remaining cooler throughout the day, with temperatures never exceeding 36.7°C. By contrast, all other nest types had multiple episodes where temperatures exceeded 40°C. Double-layered ceramic nests also maintained constant levels of high humidity (relative humidity [RH] >70%) throughout our study, whereas low humidity levels were observed in surface nests (RH ≈ 60%) and cement nests (RH <50%) during midday heat. We observed penguins panting at temperatures of 25°C in nest boxes, and at 22°C in exposed surface nests. This suggests that heat stress in African Penguins may occur much sooner than anticipated and that they are particularly vulnerable to hyperthermia as climate change-related global warming progresses. Fortunately, we are encouraged by the capacity of double-layered ceramic nest boxes to buffer environmental extremes and maintain suitable breeding conditions.  © The Author(s), 2022.

ABSTRACT: Among the longest Antarctic biological time series is that of Adélie penguin Pygoscelis adeliae population size at Cape Royds, 1955 to the present. Demographic trends over the 66 years fall into five periods: 1) decrease then recovery due to control of tourism from McMurdo Station/Scott Base; 2) further increase responding to the removal of > 20 000 trophically competing Antarctic minke whales Balaenoptera bonaerensis from the colony's wintering area; 3) stabilization but not decrease upon the ban of whaling in 1982, and whale recovery, owing to increased winds facilitating McMurdo Sound Polynya presence (easier ocean access during nesting); 4) decrease in 2001-2005 when two mega-icebergs, B15A/C16, opposed the wind effect by increasing sea-ice cover, thus limiting ocean access; and 5) after iceberg departure, minimal recovery due to the increased velocity of the wind-generated Ross Gyre reducing penguin breeding probability. A multivariant model using 1998-2018 data confirmed the roles of gyre speed (negative) and open water (positive) in colony growth. Additional negative influence came from high nest predation by south polar skuas Stercorarius maccormicki, reducing chick production, as well as perhaps increased trophic competition from nearby Weddell seals Leptonychotes weddellii. Clearly, long time series increase our understanding of penguin population dynamics responding to a complexity of factors.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.

ABSTRACT: The Humboldt penguin (Spheniscus humboldti) population at the Punta San Juan Marine Protected Area in Peru is considered critical to the long-term sustainability of this endangered species in Peru. Exposure of the rookery to environmental toxicants is a mounting concern because of regional growth of industries and human populations. Whole blood samples were collected from 30 free-ranging penguins in 2011 as part of a broader population health monitoring program. Dried blood spots (DBS) containing 50 μl of blood were prepared and analyzed to assess exposure to five groups of environmental contaminants. Concentrations of elements arsenic, cadmium, iron, lead, mercury, selenium, and thallium were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Persistent organic pollutant concentrations were measured using gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to analyze organochlorine pesticides (OCP; p,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDE, β-hexachlorocyclohexane, t-nonachlor, and oxychlordane), polychlorinated biphenyls (congeners 138 and 153), and polybrominated flame retardants (polybrominated biphenyl-153 and polybrominated diphenyl ether congeners 47 and 99). Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, including perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Results revealed low levels of exposure to these selected contaminants, at levels not considered to be of concern for wildlife health. DBS methodology was considered effective in a field-based setting for quantification of whole blood concentrations of environmental contaminants in penguins. © 2024 American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: The growth of ecotourism leads tour operators to develop means of exploration that facilitate access to remote and difficult-to-reach areas. For instance, new ice-class expedition ships can now bring visitors to isolated places in Antarctica that have never before been visited. In November 2021, a first ground visit was made to the Emperor Penguin Aptenodytes forsteri colony at the Jason Peninsula. The result is the first census of the population that has been conducted in situ. This example illustrates that reaching extremely isolated places through ecotourism is an opportunity to develop citizen science and collect useful data. © 2024, Marine Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: Predictions of the future emperor penguins population, linked to anthropogenic climate change, are stark. Current models suggest that if CO2 emissions continue to rise at present rates, almost all colonies will be quasi-extinct by the end of the century (Jenouvrier et al. 2021). The monitoring of populations is crucial to tracking these changes and, if possible, implementing conservation measures. Recent work using satellite imagery to discover, track and monitor emperor penguin populations has proved to be a key technology in understanding the locations, numbers and trends of the species (Barbraud & Weimerskirch 2001, Trathan et al. 2020, Jenouvrier et al. 2021). It also enables the discovery of unrecorded breeding sites (Fretwell et al. 2009), although there are inherent difficulties in determining what constitutes a new or undiscovered breeding colony (see Supplemental Material S1). In 2019, eight previously unreported emperor penguin breeding sites were found using the European Space Agency's Sentinel-2 satellite, a medium-resolution satellite with a spatial resolution of 10 m per pixel (Fretwell & Trathan 2021), bringing the number of known extant breeding locations to 61. Here, I report on the discovery of a further four breeding sites using Sentinel-2 and Maxar WorldView-2 imagery.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

ABSTRACT: The king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus) is a subantarctic species, but breeders were recently reported in Antarctica. Stranger Point (South Shetland Islands) represents the southernmost breeding site recorded so far. Here, we report the observations of king penguins molting and attempting to breed at Stranger Point during 11 consecutive years, and the first record of a molting individual at Esperanza/Hope Bay (tip of the Antarctic Peninsula). From 2011/2012, breeding attempts occurred every year at Stranger Point, except in 2021/2022. Only during 2014/2015 and 2016/2017, a chick hatched and survived until 5 months and 1 month old, respectively. In the remaining seasons, the egg was abandoned before hatching. In mid-February 2018, a dead adult king penguin was found, and then only a female adult was observed there. Strikingly, during 2017/2018 and 2018/2019, a second egg was laid some days after the first egg was abandoned. Unfortunately, the pair was not able to establish itself at Stranger Point, and no further sightings of molting king penguins were recorded at Esperanza/Hope Bay since the 2018/2019 season. Notwithstanding this, our observations highlight the importance of reporting all records of king penguins in Antarctica, thus providing fundamental information to assess future climate-driven shifts in the bio-geographic range of this species and the status of the population. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Many marine vertebrates traverse more than hundreds of kilometres of the ocean. To efficiently achieve such long-distance movements, the ability to maintain orientation in a three-dimensional space is essential; however, it remains unevaluated in most species. In this study, we examined the bearing distributions of penguins undertaking long-distance foraging trips and compared their bearing consistency between underwater and at the water surface, as well as between night and day, to quantify their orientation ability. The subject species, king penguins, Aptenodytes patagonicus, from Possession Island, Crozet archipelago (46°25′S, 51°45′E; January to March 2011), showed high bearing consistency both during dives and at the water surface whilst commuting towards/from their main foraging area, the Antarctic polar front. Their bearing consistency was particularly high during and after shallow dives, irrespective of the time of day. Meanwhile, their bearings tended to vary during and after deep dives, particularly in the middle of the trip, probably owing to underwater foraging movements. However, the overall directions of deep dives during the commuting phases were similar to those of shallow dives and post-dive periods at the water surface. These findings indicate that king penguins employ compass mechanism(s) that are equivalently reliable both underwater and at the water surface, at any time of the day. This orientation ability appears to enable them to achieve long-distance trips under strong temporal constraints. Further studies on the fine-scale bearing distributions of other diving vertebrates are needed to better understand movement strategies in marine environments. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: In large areas of the Southern Ocean, iron limits phytoplankton production. Although biologically mediated iron recycling has been studied for the higher trophic-level whales and the lower trophic-level krill, less is known of the numerically abundant seabirds foraging in Antarctic waters. In this study, we estimate the magnitude of iron recycled by two Antarctic breeding seabirds, the Adélie and emperor penguins, across the austral spring and summer in the Prydz Bay region, East Antarctica. Their contribution to iron recycling and associated pathways differs in line with their contrasting life history strategies (summer and winter breeding) and their breeding habitat (land and fast ice). We consider their breeding cycle in relation to their terrestrial activities compared to foraging periods at sea. High iron concentration (~419 mg kg−1) in guano of both penguin species suggests that they are a source of regenerated iron. Breeding emperor penguins supplied an average of 237 μmol iron m−2 day−1 on the fast ice that they breed on that eventually ends in the ocean when the ice melts completely in summer (November–February). During their foraging trips, the adult emperor penguins contribute between 7 × 10−5 and 4 × 10−4 μmol iron m−2 day−1, as their foraging ranges increase over the breeding season. In contrast, breeding Adélie penguins supplied between 254 and 1,243 μmol iron m−2 day−1 whilst at their colony, with a fraction of guano entering the ocean via meltwater flowing into the ocean. The flux decreases to 2 × 10−3 to 6 × 10−2 μmol iron m−2 d−1, whilst they are foraging. Our study finds that penguins redistribute a large flux of iron onto their colonies, which may enter the adjacent water through sea ice melt and facilitated through katabatic winds. Despite their high abundance in Prydz Bay, the contribution of penguins to iron flux during their foraging periods is minor, due to the enormous foraging range being covered. Further research into the bioavailability of iron by marine organisms coupled with parallel measurements of seawater iron concentration and phytoplankton uptake experiments will be invaluable in refining iron budgets in both this region and other hotspots along the Antarctic coast where higher trophic-level animals are abundant.

ABSTRACT: A late Pliocene (3.36-3.06 Ma) exposure of the Tangahoe Formation on the North Island of New Zealand preserves close fossil relatives of many extant seabird clades. Here, we report an extinct member of the little penguin (Eudyptula Bonaparte, 1856) lineage from the Tangahoe Formation - the smallest extinct crown penguin yet known. Eudyptula wilsonae n. sp. is based on the nearly complete skulls of an adult and a fledged but immature individual. Both skulls show more slender proportions than modern little penguins and precede genome-derived estimates for the divergence between Eudyptula minor minor Forster, 1781 (endemic to New Zealand) and Eudyptula m. novaehollandiae Stephens, 1826 (native to Australia and recently established in New Zealand). This raises the possibility that the fossil taxon represents a lineage directly ancestral to extant little penguins. Our results support a Zealandian origin for little penguins, with subsequent Pleistocene dispersal to Australia and a more recent Holocene range expansion of Eudyptula m. novaehollandiae back into New Zealand.

ABSTRACT: Background: According to the literature review, this is the first study investigating tear production (TP) and intraocular pressure (IOP) in the Pygoscelis penguins living in their natural habitat. The study aimed to establish normal values for standard ocular tests in the genus Pygoscelis, namely, the Adélie (Pygoscelis adeliae), gentoo (Pygoscelis papua), and chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarctica) penguins, in four different islands of Antarctica. Sampling was made by specifically using the left eye of the penguins. The Schirmer's tear test type I (STT-I) and the Tonovet® (rebound tonometer) were used to measure the TP and the IOP, respectively. Results: The mean TP and IOP values of 129 Adélie, chinstrap, gentoo, and 120 adult Adélie, gentoo penguins were determined as 10.2 ± 4.0 mm/min and 38.9 ± 13.2 mmHg, respectively. No statistical difference was detected between the penguin species for the mean IOP values, while the difference was determined in all the locations. However, statistical differences in the mean TP values were determined between all locations. Conclusion: The results of this study provide a reference range of Schirmer's tear test (STT) and IOP values in Pygoscelis penguins and show that the IOP is significantly affected by locations. This result can be attributed to the harsh climatic conditions of the Antarctic Peninsula that change very quickly. The described data may help diagnose clinical pathological findings in Pygoscelis penguins. The STT and rebound tonometry appears to be safe and reproducible methods in Pygoscelis penguins, as the results were obtained quickly and were well tolerated by the birds. Based on our results, we propose that similar studies can be initiated in crowded colonies of three penguin species of this genus on the Antarctic Peninsula, the southern Shetland Islands, and other frequently visited islands in Antarctica. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The COVID-19 pandemic and its lock-down measures have resulted in periods of reduced human activity, known as anthropause. While this period was expected to be favorable for the marine ecosystem, due to a probable reduction of pollution, shipping traffic, industrial activity and fishing pressure, negative counterparts such as reduced fisheries surveillance could counterbalance these positive effects. Simultaneously, on-land pressure due to human disturbance and tourism should have drastically decreased, potentially benefiting land-breeding marine animals such as seabirds. We analyzed 11 breeding seasons of data on several biological parameters of little penguins from a popular tourist attraction at Phillip Island, Australia. We investigated the impact of anthropogenic activities on penguin behavior during the breeding season measured by (1) distribution at sea, (2) colony attendance, (3) isotopic niche (4) chick meal mass, and (5) offspring investment against shipping traffic and number of tourists. The 2020 lock-downs resulted in a near absence of tourists visiting the Penguin Parade®, which was otherwise visited by 800,000+ visitors on average per breeding season. However, our long-term analysis showed no effect of the presence of visitors on little penguins' activities. Surprisingly, the anthropause did not trigger any changes in maritime traffic intensity and distribution in the region. We found inter- and intra-annual variations for most parameters, we detected a negative effect of marine traffic on the foraging efficiency. Our results suggest that environmental variations have a greater influence on the breeding behavior of little penguins compared to short-term anthropause events. Our long-term dataset was key to test whether changes in anthropogenic activities affected the wildlife during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Fecal corticosterone metabolite (FCM) concentrations, which can be determined noninvasively, have recently been explored as a stress indicator in birds. In our study, we measured FCM concentrations in penguins under nonmolting or molting conditions, cool or hot season, diseased condition, and incubation period. These measurements were conducted in an aquarium that housed king penguins, gentoo penguins, and African penguins. This study aimed to investigate the validity of fecal matter as a stress indicator. Our findings revealed that FCM concentrations were significantly higher in molting individuals than in nonmolting individuals. Compared with the cool season, FCM concentrations were significantly higher in penguins housed outdoors during the hot season. However, no differences were observed in penguins housed indoors. Diseased individuals and an incubating individual showed notably higher FCM concentrations than healthy individuals. Interestingly, the FCM concentration in king penguin that underwent cataract surgery was extremely high before the surgery. However, 1 month postsurgery, it decreased to a level similar to that of healthy individuals. We observed increased FCM concentrations in penguins considered to be exposed to stressors. Notably, FCM concentration decreased after removing the stress factor. The FCM concentration was found to be consistent with the stress state of penguins, suggesting its usefulness as a stress indicator. © 2024 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: Systemic anesthesia in penguins is often achieved using inhalation anesthetic agents alone, and information on injectable drugs for systemic anesthesia is limited. General anesthesia with a minimal effect on circulatory dynamics is necessary to perform noninvasive examinations and treatments in animals, including penguins. In this study, alfaxalone (ALFX), an injectable anesthetic agent, was examined to establish the optimal anesthetic method for gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua). Alfaxalone was administered intravenously through the metatarsal vein, and anesthesia was maintained by a constant rate infusion (CRI). A biological monitor was used to record numerous clinical indices, and the anesthetic depth was evaluated every 5 minutes during anesthesia; the CRI was adjusted until the optimal anesthetic depth was obtained. Anesthesia depth was assessed, and the CRI rate was adjusted. The CRI was stopped, and the time until recovery was recorded. Blood samples were collected to analyze plasma concentrations of ALFX. The mean total dose of ALFX required for anesthetic induction was 9 ± 1.9 mg/kg, the intubation time was 126 ± 21 seconds, and the maintenance infusion rate of ALFX was 0.3 ± 0.08 mg/kg/min. The time from discontinuation of anesthesia to extubation was 42 ± 23 minutes, and the time to recovery was 90 ± 33 minutes. Significant changes in the heart rate and blood pressure were not observed during the anesthetic events. The plasma concentration of ALFX under stable anesthesia was 6734 ± 4386 ng/mL (range, 3315-14 326 ng/mL). Although anesthesia using ALFX tended to result in a prolonged time to recovery in gentoo penguins, rapid induction of anesthesia and stable hemodynamics during anesthetic maintenance were achieved. Therefore, ALFX may be considered a suitable anesthetic method for noninvasive examinations and treatments in penguins. © 2023 by the Association of Avian Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: This study presents the results of a systematic survey of La Pastosa Islet, located 700 m off the west coast of Río Negro, Argentina. This small islet has the particularity of hosting the northernmost colony of Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) to date and contains evidence of its use by hunter-gatherer groups during the late Holocene. This growing colony started around 2002 and has had a significant impact on the subsurface archeological record of the islet by increasing erosion and exposing buried materials through nest excavation, particularly lithic artifacts. The spatial analysis of the distribution of artifact and penguin burrows indicates that the actions of the latter generated a “snapshot” of the subsurface distribution of the lithic record. The observed distribution suggested higher discard rates at the center of the islet. Furthermore, this study shows the synergy between both types of records in the formation dynamics of the lithic landscape and the agency of penguins as active landscape engineers. Finally, the obtained results have important implications for the management of the protected sector of the recently established Islote Lobos National Park, within which the study area is located. © The Author(s) 2023.

ABSTRACT: Aspergillosis is the primary fungal disease affecting captive penguins globally. Its diagnosis remains challenging, and currently no tests are both sensitive and specific for the detection of early infection. The present study evaluated a recently developed Aspergillus lateral-flow device (AspLFD) for the detection of Aspergillus spp. antigen in plasma and glottis mucus from captive penguins. In a pilot retrospective study, banked frozen plasma samples from captive penguins were reviewed: samples from 11 gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua papua) and 4 king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were used in the analysis. Positive plasma AspLFD test results were found in 80% (four of five) of the aspergillosis-positive cases tested. All of the aspergillosis-negative cases tested negative (10 of 10) on the AspLFD test. In a cohort prospective study, paired plasma and glottis swab samples were opportunistically and nonrandomly collected from captive gentoo penguins. In total, 26 penguins were tested. In the negative control group, AspLFD test was negative on plasma and swab in 100% of birds (14 of 14). In the aspergillosis-positive group, AspLFD test was positive on plasma samples from 33% (4 of 12) of birds, on swab samples from 50% (6 of 12) of birds, and on either plasma or swab samples from 75% (9 of 12) of birds. The AspLFD is currently used for the diagnosis of aspergillosis in humans and also shows promise for use in penguins. Larger prospective studies are recommended. © 2023 Journal of Zoo and Wildlife Medicine. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Reference intervals for clinical chemistry and haematology analytes are essential for the interpretation of blood results, but limited data are available for Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) in zoological collections as well as in the wild. The aim of the present study was therefore to establish reference intervals for a series of clinical chemistry and haematology analytes in a single zoological population of Humboldt penguins. Furthermore, possible variations of the analytes influenced by the age and sex of the individuals were investigated. Lithium heparinized plasma and whole blood samples from 39 animals were analysed and statistically evaluated. The following clinical chemistry analytes were significantly higher in females: glutamate dehydrogenase (p = 0.0003), alanine transaminase (p = 0.0005), alkaline phosphatase (p = 0.0245), aspartate aminotransferase (p = 0.0043), creatine kinase (p = 0.0016), lactate dehydrogenase (p < 0.0001), inorganic phosphorus (p = 0.0223), and sodium (p = 0.0415). No significant differences between males and females were found for any haematology analyte. Cholesterol (p = 0.0233; −0.39), white blood cell count (p = 0.0208; −0.40), and absolute heterophiles (p = 0.0148; −0.42) had significant negative correlations with the age of the penguins. The results indicate that the factors of sex and age should be considered when interpreting the results of haematological and clinical biochemistry assays, and further studies are needed to determine whether there are more differences in other age groups or seasons. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Gene expression can accelerate ecological divergence by rapidly tweaking the response of an organism to novel environments, with more divergent environments exerting stronger selection and supposedly, requiring faster adaptive responses. Organisms adapted to extreme environments provide ideal systems to test this hypothesis, particularly when compared to related species with milder ecological niches. The Emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) is the only endothermic vertebrate breeding in the harsh Antarctic winter, in stark contrast with the less cold-adapted sister species, the King penguin (A. patagonicus). Assembling the first de novo transcriptomes and analysing multi-tissue (brain, kidney, liver, muscle, skin) RNA-Seq data from natural populations of both species, we quantified the shifts in tissue-enhanced genes, co-expression gene networks, and differentially expressed genes characterising Emperor penguin adaptation to the extreme Antarctic. Our analyses revealed the crucial role played by muscle and liver in temperature homeostasis, fasting, and whole-body energy metabolism (glucose/insulin regulation, lipid metabolism, fatty acid beta-oxidation, and blood coagulation). Repatterning at the regulatory level appears as more important in the brain of the Emperor penguin, showing the lowest signature of differential gene expression, but the largest co-expression gene network shift. Nevertheless, over-expressed genes related to mTOR signalling in the brain and the liver support their central role in cold and fasting responses. Besides contributing to understanding the genetics underlying complex traits, like body energy reservoir management, our results provide a first insight into the role of gene expression in adaptation to one of the most extreme environmental conditions endured by an endotherm. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The agency of animals in technoscience has been much debated in science and technology studies, animal studies, and environmental collective action studies. In particular, the prominence of animals as mediators in environmental conflict opens avenues for dialogue with perspectives from the Global South, especially in the face of persistent colonial mining-energy regimes. The evocation of human-animal encounters contributed to the closure of two electricity generation projects in Chile and provided an insight into the surprises and complications of the inclusion of animal species–huemuls and Humboldt penguins–in distinct environmental campaigns. Although the influence of such ‘charismatic’ animals stands out as a fruitful approach to understanding the role of animals in environmental conflicts, it is helpful to consider alternative anti-colonial perspectives from the global South. In particular, the ch'ixi metaphor of the Aymara people–representing the politics of beings resulting from the juxtaposition of antagonistic realities, or what is and is not at the same time–creates productive frictions in human-animal encounters that differs from the notion of charismatic animals as mediators, especially when it comes to modes of resistance by local communities. This perspective recognizes the differentiated strength of the semiotic-material mediations of nonhumans that can emerge from human-animal ch'ixi encounters in collective environmental actions. © 2024 Process Press.

ABSTRACT: Salmonella enterica is one of the most important foodborne pathogens worldwide, and the emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR) clones can aggravate its public health importance. Wildlife species may act as reservoirs of these clones, but their role is not well understood. In this study, faecal samples from shorebirds, with a focus on the endangered Humboldt penguin (Spheniscus humboldti), collected from five sites in central Chile with different levels of anthropogenic pressure were analysed to characterize antimicrobial resistant S. enterica serovars. Overall, Salmonella was isolated from 22 of the 595 samples (3.7%), with positivity ranging between 1.6% and 9.5%, depending on the sampling site. Four of the Salmonella isolates were retrieved from Humboldt penguin samples (1.4% positive samples in this species). Serovars Infantis (nine isolates), Typhimurium (six), Goldcoast (four), and Enteritidis, Agona, and Give (one isolate each) were identified. Resistance levels were the highest for sulphamethoxazole (13/21 isolates with a non-wild-type phenotype), ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim (11/21 each). Whole-genome sequencing performed on eight S. Infantis strains revealed that seven carried the plasmid replicon IncFIB (pN55391), indicating the presence of the pESI-like megaplasmid, harbouring resistance determinants to multiple antimicrobial classes as well as heavy metal, biocides, and virulence-related genes. Furthermore, five S. Infantis isolates that showed an ESBL phenotype carried the blaCTX-M-65 gene, three of which were detected in Humboldt penguin faeces. The finding of an international emerging S. Infantis clone in protected wildlife is of concern to environmental, animal, and public health specialists, supporting initiatives for an active surveillance of resistance and virulence traits in wildlife exposed to anthropogenic areas.  © 2024 Clara M.

ABSTRACT: The known host range of circoviruses is continuously expanding because of more intensive diagnostic activities and advanced sequencing tools. Recently, a new circovirus (penguin circovirus (PenCV)) was identified in the guano and cloacal samples collected from Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) and chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarcticus) in Antarctica. Although the virus was detected in several asymptomatic subjects, a potential association with feather disease was speculated. To investigate the occurrence and implications of PenCV in other penguin species located outside of Antarctica, a broad survey was undertaken in African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) on two islands off the southern Namibian coast. For this purpose, specific molecular biology assays were developed and validated. None of the 151 blood samples tested positive for PenCV. Several reasons could explain the lack of PenCV positive samples. African penguins and Pygoscelis species are separated by approximately 6000 km, so there is almost no opportunity for transmission. Similarly, host susceptibility to PenCV might be penguin genus-specific. Overall, the present study found no evidence of PenCV in African penguin colonies in Namibia. Further dedicated studies are required to assess the relevance of PenCV among different penguin species. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Osteohistological studies allow us to obtain valuable information on different aspects related to the bone microstructure, physiology and ecology of organisms. Although the anatomy and morphology of penguin bones are well known, studies in osteohistology are still insufficient. In order to analyze the osteohistological variations between male and female adults of Pygoscelis adeliae (Aves, Spheniscidae), histological sections were prepared from various bones including appendicular (humerus, radius, ulna, carpometacarpus, femur, tibiotarsus, tarsometatarsus) and axial (vertebral and sternal ribs) elements. The results indicate that all sections showed compact tissue with reduced or absent medullary cavities and high bone density due to internal tissue compaction. Histologically, we identified three distinct tissue regions based on their bone matrix, vascular channels organization and compactions degree. Our results indicate osteohistological variations between sexes throughout the whole skeleton, including the first definitive evidence of medullary bone in the Sphenisciformes females. While the male specimen exhibited a medullary cavity characterized by an inner circumferential layer, the female displayed a medullary region without an inner circumferential layer, lower bone compaction, presence of medullary bone in all the sections, and greater development of intertrabecular spaces. These results are consistent with previous reports of medullary bone in females from other birds and provided an auxiliary criterion for sex differentiation. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Nutritional support in malnourished animals is an essential aspect of wildlife rehabilitation; this support is especially relevant when providing lifesaving nutrition to endangered species such as the African penguin (Spheniscus demersus). This study investigated the short-term effects of a commercially available, semi-elemental, critical care diet compared with a hand-made fish formula. Twenty-one African penguin chicks were selected on admission to the Southern African Foundation for the Conservation of Costal Birds in Cape Town, South Africa, in November 2015. Initial assessment included body weight, a full clinical exam, white blood cell count, packed cell volume, and total plasma protein. Ten animals received the commercial critical care diet, whereas a control group of 11 animals were fed hand-made formula for the 2-week study period. All animals were weighed daily and blood sampling was repeated after 14 days. The median weight of both groups increased significantly over 14 days (critical care diet χ2= 10.1, P = 0.002; control χ2= 7.4, P = 0.006). The difference was not significant between the groups for start weight (χ2= 0.1, P = 0.725) or end weight (χ2= 0, P = 1.000) and was not significantly different in the change over time for either absolute numbers (χ2= 1.7, P = 0.193) or percent gain (χ2= 0.8, P = 0.36). The values for packed cell volume, total plasma protein, and white blood cell count increased in all animals after the 14-day study period was complete. On the basis of the results of this study, it was determined that the differing diets led to similar weight gain. © 2023 Association of Avian Veterinarians. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Samples of bones (humerus) and claws of adult Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) were opportunistically obtained from twenty-seven carcasses at two important nesting sites in northern Chile: Chañaral Island (CHI) and Pan de Azúcar Island (PAI). The concentrations of trace elements (Cu, Zn, Pb, Ni, Fe, Se, As, Br, Mn and Cr) were determined by X-ray fluorescence. The highest levels (mean ± standard deviation, µg/g dry weight) of Cu (26.57 ± 4.08), Zn (163.9 ± 42.7), Pb (1.86 ± 1.53), Ni (0.31 ± 0.03), Se (7.70 ± 4.87) and Cr (0.25 ± 0.24) were detected in bones, whereas the highest levels of Fe (3,162 ± 1,579), As (6.75 ± 4.21), Br (0.12 ± 0.06) and Mn (76.7 ± 47.9) were found in claws. In bones, Se and Ni levels were higher (P < 0.05) in CHI than in PAI. In claws, the contents of Pb, Fe, and Mn were higher at CHI than those at PAI, whereas only As exhibited higher contents at PAI than those found at CHI. The trace element content in the claws and bones found herein may be the result of either acute or chronic exposure to penguins, respectively. These findings may serve as a baseline for further studies to design adequate and opportune plans to protect this vulnerable species. © 2024 Universidad Austral de Chile. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Despite the well-known potential health benefits of prebiotics and non-viable probiotics (paraprobiotics) in various animal species, research regarding their use in penguins is scarce. Our study aimed to investigate the impact of a combined administration of prebiotics and paraprobiotics (referred to here as “parasynbiotics”) on the gut microbiome and overall health of Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus). The parasynbiotics consisted of 1-kestose, which is a fructooligosaccharide comprising sucrose and fructose, and heat-killed Lactiplantibacillus plantarum FM8, isolated from pickled vegetables. It was administered to eight penguins aged <3 years (Young-group) and nine penguins aged >17 years (Adult-group) for 8 weeks. Results from 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that compared to baseline, parasynbiotic administration significantly decreased the relative abundance of intestinal Clostridiaceae_222000 in both groups and significantly increased that of Lactobacillaceae in the Young-group. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed a significant decrease in the plc gene levels encoding alpha-toxin of Clostridium perfringens in the Young-group after parasynbiotic administration (P=0.0078). In the Young-group, parasynbiotic administration significantly increased the plasma levels of total alpha-globulin (P=0.0234), which is associated with inflammatory responses. Furthermore, exposure of dendritic cells to heat-killed L. plantarum FM8 promoted the secretion of interleukin 10, a major anti-inflammatory cytokine. Overall, parasynbiotic administration enhanced the activity of gut Lactobacillaceae, decreased the levels of C. perfringens and its toxin encoding plc gene, and reduced inflammatory response in penguins. These results provide novel insights into the potential benefits of parasynbiotics for improving penguin health. © 2024 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: Carrion decomposition contributes to the soil microbial community structure. This research aimed to identify the soil arthropod, nematode, bacterial, and fungal communities associated with penguin carrion on King George Island, Antarctica. Soil samples were collected around and beneath fresh (freshly killed penguins by the predators) and dried (decomposed more than a year) penguin carrion. Soil bacterial and fungal communities associated with the penguin carrion were analyzed using the 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) gene sequencing, respectively. Arthropod identification was using Sanger sequencing and nematodes were determined using morphological identification. This study demonstrated no significant differences in arthropod and nematode, bacteria, and fungi communities between decomposition stages, soil location, and species of penguin carrion. This is the first study to identify soil arthropods, nematodes, bacterial, and fungal communities associated with penguin carrion, offering important insights into the initial documentation of the necrobiome communities in the polar region. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: In the face of global biodiversity loss that threatens social–ecological sustainability, we must improve our knowledge of species' behaviours, life histories and populations. Enhanced understanding is especially critical for taxa like seabirds that live in remote habitats where monitoring is logistically challenging, and technology-based approaches could lead to major advances. Considering conservation threats and breeding behaviours, penguins represent a promising taxon for further exploration of monitoring methods. Only five of 18 penguin species are currently considered species of Least Concern by the IUCN, and the sensitivity of penguins to ecological disturbances makes them important indicators of ecosystem dynamics. Penguins regularly congregate in dense breeding colonies and are visually and aurally conspicuous animals, making them relatively easy to monitor in some respects. In situ observations and visual remote sensing monitoring methods (i.e. camera traps, uncrewed aerial vehicles and satellite imagery) currently provide highly valuable information on penguin behaviour and population dynamics, but these methods have a number of shortcomings. Several rely on human presence in remote areas, some require clean lines of sight with no visual obstructions, and some offer limited spatial and temporal resolution. In this study we explore the use of passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) as a complementary remote sensing method to monitor penguin behaviour and populations at high spatial and temporal resolution without visual constraints or the need for continuous human presence. We conducted observations of vocalization rates and placed automated acoustic recorders in colonies of Magellanic Penguins Spheniscus magellanicus and Southern Rockhopper Penguins Eudyptes chrysocome in conjunction with camera traps. We found positive relationships between acoustic activity and counts of Magellanic Penguins in camera trap photos. We also identified clear diel patterns of acoustic activity that differed between breeding stages, and we found positive correlations between acoustic activity and estimates of colony density for various times of day and radii around recorders. While much work remains to improve this method and refine interpretation, PAM holds great promise as a complementary tool for monitoring the relative abundance and behavioural dynamics of penguins and other colonial animals, particularly those that burrow or nest in dense vegetation that impairs visual monitoring techniques. © 2023 British Ornithologists' Union.

ABSTRACT: Animal vocalisations encode a wide range of biological information about the age, sex, body size, and social status of the emitter. Moreover, vocalisations play a significant role in signalling the identity of the emitter to conspecifics. Recent studies have shown that, in the African penguin (Spheniscus demersus), acoustic cues to individual identity are encoded in the fundamental frequency (F 0) and resonance frequencies (formants) of the vocal tract. However, although penguins are known to produce vocalisations where F 0 and formants vary among individuals, it remains to be tested whether the receivers can perceive and use such information in the individual recognition process. In this study, using the Habituation-Dishabituation (HD) paradigm, we tested the hypothesis that penguins perceive and respond to a shift of ± 20% (corresponding to the natural inter-individual variation observed in ex-situ colonies) of F 0 and formant dispersion (ΔF) of species-specific calls. We found that penguins were more likely to look rapidly and for longer at the source of the sound when F 0 and formants of the calls were manipulated, indicating that they could perceive variations of these parameters in the vocal signals. Our findings provide the first experimental evidence that, in the African penguin, listeners can perceive changes in F 0 and formants, which can be used by the receiver as potential cues for the individual discrimination of the emitter. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Iron plays a crucial role in the high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll Southern Ocean regions, promoting phytoplankton growth and enhancing atmospheric carbon sequestration. In this area, iron-rich Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and baleen whale species, which are among their main predators, play a large role in the recycling of iron. However, penguins have received limited attention despite their representing the largest seabird biomass in the southern polar region. Here, we use breeding site guano volumes estimated from drone images, deep learning-powered penguin census, and guano chemical composition to assess the iron export to the Antarctic waters from one of the most abundant penguin species, the Chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarcticus). Our results show that these seabirds are a relevant contributor to the iron remobilization pool in the Southern Ocean. With an average guano concentration of 3 mg iron g−1, we estimate that the Chinstrap penguin population is recycling 521 tonnes iron yr−1, representing the current iron contribution half of the amount these penguins were able to recycle four decades ago, as they have declined by more than 50% since then. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: As the largest species of birds in Antarctica, penguins are called “biological indicators”. Changes in the environment will cause population fluctuations. Therefore, developing a penguin census regularly will not only help carry out conservation activities but also provides a basis for studying climate change. Traditionally, scholars often use indirect methods, e.g., identifying penguin guano and establishing regression relationships to estimate the size of penguin colonies. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of automatic object detection algorithms based on aerial images, which locate each penguin directly. We build a dataset consisting of images taken at 400 m altitude over the island populated by Adelie penguins, which are cropped with a resolution of 640 × 640. To address the challenges of detecting minuscule penguins (often 10 pixels extent) amidst complex backgrounds in our dataset, we propose a new object detection network, named YoloPd (Yolo for penguin detection). Specifically, a multiple frequency features fusion module and a Bottleneck aggregation layer are proposed to strengthen feature representations for smaller penguins. Furthermore, the Transformer aggregation layer and efficient attention module are designed to capture global features with the aim of filtering out background interference. With respect to the latency/accuracy trade-off, YoloPd surpasses the classical detector Faster R-CNN by 8.5% in mean precision (mAP). It also beats the latest detector Yolov7 by 2.3% in F1 score with fewer parameters. Under YoloPd, the average counting accuracy reaches 94.6%, which is quite promising. The results demonstrate the potential of automatic detectors and provide a new direction for penguin counting. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Remote individual animal identification is important for food safety, sport, and animal conservation. Numerous existing remote individual animal identification studies have focused on RGB images. In this paper, we tackle individual penguin identification using hyperspectral (HS) images. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to analyze spectral differences between penguin individuals using an HS camera. We have constructed a novel penguin HS image dataset, including 990 hyperspectral images of 27 penguins. We experimentally demonstrate that the spectral information of HS image pixels can be used for individual penguin identification. The experimental results show the effectiveness of using HS images for individual penguin identification. © 2024 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: While the heterogeneity among individuals of a population is more and more documented, questions on the paths through which it arises, particularly whether it is linked to fixed heterogeneity or chance alone, are still widely debated. Here, we tested how individual quality, energy allocation trade-offs, and environmental stochasticity define individual fitness. To do so, we simultaneously investigated the contribution of 18 life-history traits to the fitness of breeding little penguins (Eudyptula minor), using a structural equation model. Fitness was highly variable amongst the 162 birds monitored over their entire lifespan. It increased with the individual penguin’s ability to increase (a) the number of breeding events (i.e., living longer, breeding younger, breeding more often, and producing more second clutches) and (b) the breeding success per event through increased foraging performances (i.e., mass gained at sea). While all three processes (stochasticity, individual quality, and allocation trade-offs) affected fitness, interindividual variability in fitness was mainly driven by individual quality, birds consistently breeding earlier in the season and displaying higher foraging efficiency exhibiting higher fitness. Why some birds consistently can perform better at sea and breed earlier remains a question to investigate to understand how selection applies to these traits. © The Author(s) 2023.

ABSTRACT: The African Penguin Spheniscus demersus has been considered a threatened species since 1984 and, aside from a short period around 2000, its population has been in constant decline since at least the 1950s. By combining counts of the numbers of breeding pairs made at 26 colonies in South Africa and Namibia between 1979 and 2023 with Bayesian state–space models we reassess the species’ conservation status. The breeding population has declined by 77.8% (95% credible intervals: 71.8–84.6%) over the last 30 years (3 generations), from ∼44 300 breeding pairs in 1993 to ∼9 900 pairs in 2023. This falls just below the threshold for a global IUCN Red List status of Critically Endangered (CR) under criterion A2. However, the decline in Namibia exceeds that threshold at the national level (30-year decline = 82.4%, 78.2–86.2%) following the loss of ∼3 600 breeding pairs there in the last 5 years. In South Africa, the Western Cape population is now declining at <1.5% per annum, but the annual rate of decline in the Eastern Cape has worsened substantially, reaching 13% over the last 10 years. Overall, the global population has more than halved in the last decade and has fallen below 10 000 pairs for the first time. Moreover, “moving window reductions” over 3 generations using observed and projected population trajectories (up to the year 2033) indicate that the decline of the African Penguin population will exceed the 80% CR threshold (under criterion A4ab) with a high probability by 2028. Accordingly, we propose that the African Penguin should be transferred to the IUCN Red List category Critically Endangered. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Variation in formant frequencies has been shown to affect social interactions and sexual competition in a range of avian species. Yet, the anatomical bases of this variation are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the morphological correlates of formants production in the vocal apparatus of African penguins. We modelled the geometry of the supra-syringeal vocal tract of 20 specimens to generate a population of virtual vocal tracts with varying dimensions. We then estimated the acoustic response of these virtual vocal tracts and extracted the centre frequency of the first four predicted formants. We demonstrate that: (i) variation in length and cross-sectional area of vocal tracts strongly affects the formant pattern, (ii) the tracheal region determines most of this variation, and (iii) the skeletal size of penguins does not correlate with the trachea length and consequently has relatively little effect on formants. We conclude that in African penguins, while the variation in vocal tract geometry generates variation in resonant frequencies supporting the discrimination of conspecifics, such variation does not provide information on the emitter's body size. Overall, our findings advance our understanding of the role of formant frequencies in bird vocal communication.  © 2023 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: cAMP response element binding protein 2 (CREB2) acts as an intracellular transcriptional factor and regulates many physiological processes, including melanogenesis and melanocyte differentiation. In our previous research, the Creb2 gene has been characterized from Pteria penguin (P. penguin), but its role and regulatory mechanism in P. penguin are still unclear. In this study, first, the function of PpCreb2 in melanogenesis and innate immunity were identified. PpCreb2 silencing significantly decreased the tyrosinase activity and melanin content, indicating PpCreb2 played an important role in melanogenesis. Meanwhile, PpCreb2 silencing visibly suppressed the antibacterial activity of hemolymph supernatant, indicating that PpCreb2 was involved in innate immunity of P. penguin. Second, the PpCreb2 was confirmed to perform immune function by regulating the melanogenesis. The decreased melanin oxidation product due to PpCreb2 silencing triggered the declining of antibacterial activity of hemolymph supernatant, which then could be rescued by adding exogenous melanin oxidation products. Third, the regulation pathway of PpCreb2 involved in innate immunity was analyzed. The promoter sequence analysis of PpMitf discovered 5 conserved cAMP response element (CRE), which were specifically recognized by basic Leucine zipper domain (bZIP) of upstream activation transcription factor. The luciferase activities analysis showed that PpCreb2 could activate the CRE in PpMitf promoter via highly conserved bZIP domain and regulate the expression of PpMitf, which further regulated the PpTyr expression. Therefore, the results collectively demonstrated that PpCreb2 participated in innate immunity by activating PpMitf-mediated melanogenesis in P. penguin. © 2023

ABSTRACT: The atmospheric-oceanic circulation patterns, especially for the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), two major atmospheric circulation patterns in the Ross Sea region, have been reported to greatly affect climate and marine ecosystems. However, from a historical perspective, the influence of atmospheric-oceanic circulation patterns on penguin populations remains unclear in this region. Here, we analyzed two lacustrine sediment cores collected from abandoned penguin colonies at Inexpressible Island, Ross Sea, Antarctica, and by applying alternative geochemical indices, successfully reconstructed the populations of the Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) over the past ∼1500 years. We found that penguin population peaked during 750–1350 AD at Inexpressible Island, potentially due to habitat expansion in the warmer climate. After comparing with historical records of penguin populations at Cape Bird, Dunlop Island, and Cape Adare, all were found to have a common increase during the 750-1350 AD period in the Ross Sea. The population trend also coincided with extreme activities of El Niño and SAM (+). We inferred that the SAM-ENSO might promote influxes of Circumpolar and Modified Circumpolar Deep Waters into the Ross Sea. The enhanced influx of nutrient-rich deep water, together with a warmer climate may jointly enhance polynya efficiency and population increase of Adélie penguins. Our study indicates the potentially significant roles of ENSO and SAM in the regulation of Antarctic ecosystems. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Global biodiversity is in rapid decline, and many seabird species have disproportionally poorer conservation statuses than terrestrial birds. A good understanding of population dynamics is necessary for successful conservation efforts, making noninvasive, cost-effective monitoring tools essential. Here, we set out to investigate whether passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) could be used to estimate the number of animals within a set area of an African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) colony in South Africa. We were able to automate the detection of ecstatic display songs (EDSs) in our recordings, thus facilitating the handling of large datasets. This allowed us to show that calling rate increased with wind speed and humidity but decreased with temperature, and to highlight apparent abundance variations between nesting habitat types. We then showed that the number of EDSs in our recordings positively correlated with the number of callers counted during visual observations, indicating that the density could be estimated based on calling rate. Our observations suggest that increasing temperatures may adversely impact penguin calling behaviour, with potential negative consequences for population dynamics, suggesting the importance of effective conservation measures. Crucially, this study shows that PAM could be successfully used to monitor this endangered species’ populations with minimal disturbance. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Conservation of the endangered yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes) in New Zealand has principally sought to manage terrestrial threats, while relatively little has been done to understand or address marine threats, such as reduced prey availability, commercial fisheries interactions, and habitat destruction. We assessed spatial similarities between mainland yellow-eyed penguin marine distribution and resources (prey), risks (fisheries interactions), and areas of refugia (marine protected areas, MPAs). We determined if suitable penguin foraging habitat, based on environmental predictors using a Maxent species distribution model (SDM), also supports a high diversity of key prey species identified using a stacked SDM. We also created a novel index to predict areas of potential commercial fisheries interactions and mapped the overlap of penguin distribution and MPAs. Areas along the middle of the continental shelf had the highest prey diversity and probability of penguin presence, which overlapped with gillnet fisheries in these regions. Suitable penguin habitat also overlaps with trawl fisheries inshore along much of the South Island coast. <1 % of the penguin range overlaps with current MPAs, and the proposed South-East Marine Protected Areas network would protect only 3.6 % of the current penguin foraging distribution. This study takes an ecosystem approach to assess complex interactions between commercial fisheries, marine ecosystems, and MPAs, which is urgently required for marine spatial planning and adaptive ecosystem management of not only this endangered seabird but for southeast New Zealand coastal habitat and biota also. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Zoos and aquariums accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums embrace animal welfare as a foundational principle of habitat design. Modern habitats are designed to provide animals with choices and agency over their environment, and to encourage species-appropriate behavior and space use. In 2016, the Detroit Zoological Society opened the Polk Penguin Conservation Center, a 3065.80 m2 facility that features a naturalistic design. The building was designed to optimize animal welfare by incorporating various substrates, nesting sites, and a 1234 kL pool with elements of underwater complexity. The facility houses a mixed-species group of penguins that were previously housed in a smaller habitat that opened in 1968. Between 2015 and 2022, we opportunistically monitored the behavior of ten king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) as they moved back and forth between the two buildings while additional modifications were made to the new habitat. We collected 695 h of behavioral observations and 10,416 h of data from flipper-mounted time–depth recorders. We found that the king penguins spent less time engaged in aggression and more time engaged in swimming and positive social behaviors in the redesigned space. They also spent less time in proximity to other species of penguins and more time alone. These behavioral trends suggest that increased space and environmental complexity had positive welfare benefits for these penguins. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: First identified in 2002, diphtheritic stomatitis (DS) is a devastating disease affecting yellow-eyed penguins (Megadyptes antipodes, or hoiho in te reo Māori). The disease is associated with oral lesions in chicks and has caused significant morbidity and mortality. DS is widespread among yellow-eyed penguin chicks on mainland New Zealand yet appears to be absent from the subantarctic population. Corynebacterium spp. have previously been suspected as causative agents yet, due to inconsistent cultures and inconclusive pathogenicity, their role in DS is unclear. Herein, we used a metatranscriptomic approach to identify potential causative agents of DS by revealing the presence and abundance of all viruses, bacteria, fungi and protozoa - together, the infectome. Oral and cloacal swab samples were collected from presymptomatic, symptomatic and recovered chicks along with a control group of healthy adults. Two novel viruses from the Picornaviridae were identified, one of which - yellow-eyed penguin megrivirus – was highly abundant in chicks irrespective of health status but not detected in healthy adults. Tissue from biopsied oral lesions also tested positive for the novel megrivirus upon PCR. We found no overall clustering among bacteria, protozoa and fungi communities at the genus level across samples, although Paraclostridium bifermentans was significantly more abundant in oral microbiota of symptomatic chicks compared to other groups. The detection of a novel and highly abundant megrivirus has sparked a new line of inquiry to investigate its potential association with DS. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Penguin tarsometatarsi are shortened and flattened, and studies devoted to the internal characteristics of these composite bones are very limited. Therefore, we present here a comprehensive, x-ray-microscopy-based analysis based on tarsometatarsi of Eocene stem Sphenisciformes from Seymour Island (Antarctic Peninsula) as well as recent Aptenodytes forsteri, A. patagonicus, and Pygoscelis adeliae penguins. Our study focuses on four aspects: size variability of the medullary cavities, vascularization patterns with emphasis on diaphyseal vessels, cross-sectional anisotropy, and diaphyseal resistance to bending forces. Small-sized Eocene penguins (Delphinornis and Marambiornopsis) show well-developed tarsometatarsal medullary cavities, whereas the cavities of “giant” early Sphenisciformes are either smaller (Palaeeudyptes) or show a conspicuous intermetatarsal size gradient (Anthropornis). Extant penguins exhibit a decrease in cavity dimensions as their body size increases. Distributional tendencies of primary diaphyseal nutrient foramina are quite similar in the smaller Delphinornis, Marambiornopsis, and extant Pygoscelis on one side and in Palaeeudyptes and extant Aptenodytes on the other. Anthropornis shows a unique, plesiomorphic pattern with a prevalence of plantar blood supply to the metatarsals. The diaphyseal nutrient canals diverge in orientation, some obliquely away from the proximal part, others with disparate trajectories. Cross-sectional anisotropy along the tarsometatarsal shaft generally appears to be rather low. Clustering of coherency curves along certain tarsometatarsal segments may reflect a selection process that exerts a significant influence within biomechanically crucial sections. Diaphyseal resistance to mediolateral bending forces is explicitly more efficient in extant penguins than in Eocene Sphenisciformes. This can be interpreted as an adaptation to the waddling gait of extant penguins. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Swimming is an important behavior for all penguin species. However, zoo-housed penguins typically do not swim as often as their wild counterparts, which may have consequences for their health and welfare. In an effort to increase the swimming time of the African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) population at Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago, IL, USA (21 adults: 13 males, 8 females), we introduced a commercially available bubble curtain to the outdoor pool within the penguins’ habitat. The bubble curtain pushes pressurized air out through a hose fitted with small holes to create a stream of bubbles that generate water movement, which could entice penguins to swim. Over the course of 2 months, the penguins were exposed to a series of alternating conditions characterized by the bubble curtain being off or on for 2-week periods. A total of 228 swimming bouts were observed during this study. The bubble curtain did not increase the amount of time the penguins spent swimming, nor the maximum number of penguins in the pool during swim bouts. Rather, the penguins spent more time swimming when the bubble curtain was turned off, and the number of penguins in the pool during swim bouts was consistent across experimental phases. Additionally, we found that penguins swam the most when air temperatures were between 31 and 40 °F (approximately −1 to −4 °C). Unexpectedly, at least three individual penguins swam overnight between the hours of midnight and 6:00, highlighting the value of monitoring animals during entire 24 h periods. Collectively, this study provides detailed information about the swimming behavior of a zoo-housed African penguin population, and indicates that a bubble curtain was ineffective at stimulating swimming. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The proportions of individuals in various age classes in a population of wild animals affect population trends, behaviors, learning, and social structures. Knowledge of age structure is needed for effective conservation and management of populations. However, it is not always possible to determine the age or age class of individual animals, and hence the age structure of the population. Penguins, like most birds, cannot be aged once they molt into adult plumage. Spheniscus penguins attain adult plumage at 6 to 24 months of age, and individuals can live more than 30 years. We studied foot darkening in the four species of Spheniscus penguins to determine if age class can be determined from foot color. We compared how foot color changes with age among the four species to investigate potential functions of the darkening. We found that Spheniscus penguins have pale feet at hatching and the feet become darker with age throughout the lives of individuals. We showed that we can accurately predict the age structure of a colony of Magellanic penguins Spheniscus magellanicus, but not the ages of individual penguins, based on a sample of foot colors. The timing of foot darkening within species was consistent with foot color functioning in protection from UV radiation, and not with foot color functioning in thermoregulation. The species that breeds at the lowest latitudes and experiences the highest UV radiation (Galápagos penguins Spheniscus mendiculus) had feet that darkened at the earliest ages, and the species that breed at higher latitudes and experience less intense insolation (African S. demersus and Magellanic penguins) had feet that darkened latest. Humboldt penguins S. humboldti breed mostly at low latitudes and foot darkening was intermediate between Galápagos and Magellanic penguins. We also found that males’ feet darken somewhat earlier than females’ feet, likely because females spend more time in their nests (burrows or under vegetation) than males and have less sun exposure. We found that feet darkened in an individual over years, but not within a breeding season. The color change is a life-long process, likely an evolutionary adaptation within species, not a seasonal, temporary response to UV radiation. We propose foot darkening as a way to assess age structure in Spheniscus penguins. Foot color in a colony of Magellanic penguins can provide a rapid, noninvasive method to estimate the age structure of the colony. Copyright 2024 Rebstock et al.

ABSTRACT: Ecological predictions are necessary for testing whether processes hypothesized to regulate species population dynamics are generalizable across time and space. In order to demonstrate generalizability, model predictions should be transferable in one or more dimensions, where transferability is the successful prediction of responses outside of the model data bounds. While much is known as to what makes spatially-oriented models transferable, there is no general consensus as to the spatio-temporal transferability of ecological time series models. Here, we examine whether the intrinsic predictability of a time series, as measured by its complexity, could limit such transferability using an exceptional long-term dataset of Adélie penguin breeding abundance time series collected at 24 colonies around Antarctica. For each colony, we select a suite of environmental variables from the Community Earth System Model, version 2 to predict population growth rates, before assessing how well these environmentally-dependent population models transfer temporally and how reliably temporal signals replicate through space. We show that weighted permutation entropy (WPE), a model-free measure of intrinsic predictability recently introduced to ecology, varies spatially across Adélie penguin populations, perhaps in response to stochastic environmental events. We demonstrate that WPE can strongly limit temporal predictive performance, although this relationship could be weakened if intrinsic predictability is not constant over time. Lastly, we show that WPE can also limit spatial forecast horizon, which we define as the decay in spatial predictive performance with respect to the physical distance between focal colony and predicted colony. Irrespective of intrinsic predictability, spatial forecast horizons for all Adélie penguin breeding colonies included in this study are surprisingly short and our population models often have similar temporal and spatial predictive performance compared to null models based on long-term average growth rates. For cases where time series are complex, as measured by WPE, and the transferability of biologically-motivated mechanistic models are poor, we advise that null models should instead be used for prediction. These models are likely better at capturing more generalizable relationships between average growth rates and long-term environmental conditions. Lastly, we recommend that WPE can provide valuable insights when evaluating model performance, designing sampling or monitoring programs, or assessing the appropriateness of preexisting datasets for making conservation management decisions in response to environmental change. © 2023 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Aspergillosis is a major health problem in captive penguins due to the inhalation and the development of airborne spores of opportunistic environmental molds of the genus Aspergillus. Diagnosis is often delayed and treatments, based on the use of azole antifungals, are not fully effective. This study assesses the risk of exposure to Aspergillus sp. and determines the environmental reservoirs in the direct environment of a colony of Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) in a zoological park in Paris, and the risk of contamination with resistant isolates. Every 15 days between February and May 2022, environmental samples (air and subtract from the nests, pond water, pigeon and penguin droppings) were carried out in the penguin enclosure as well as clinical samples (one-time non-invasive sampling on chicks), and screened for Aspergillus sp. conidia. From 191 environmental samples, 264 strains of Aspergillus including 221 strains of A. fumigatus were isolated, mostly from ambient air, in the nests, and pond water. No “at risk” areas in the penguin environment have been highlighted, nor an increased risk because of the proximity with urban wild birds. However, the load of airborne Aspergillus in the nests increased significantly with outdoor temperature. Of the 221 strains isolated, we identified only one azole-resistant strain, displaying the TR34/L98H mutation in the cyp51A gene. This low prevalence of resistant strains may probably be partly explained by the urban location of the zoological park, surrounded by kilometers of urban areas without agricultural activities. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

ABSTRACT: Introduction: The study explores the indirect impact of climate change driven by gentoo’s penguin colonization pressure on the microbial communities of moss banks formed by Tall moss turf subformation in central maritime Antarctica. Methods: Microbial communities and chemical composition of the differently affected moss banks (Unaffected, Impacted and Desolated) located on Galindez Island and Сape Tuxen on the mainland of Kyiv Peninsula were analyzed. Results: The native microbiota of the moss banks’ peat was analyzed for the first time, revealing a predominant presence of Acidobacteria (32.2 ± 14.4%), followed by Actinobacteria (15.1 ± 4.0%) and Alphaproteobacteria (9.7 ± 4.1%). Penguin colonization and subsequent desolation of moss banks resulted in an increase in peat pH (from 4.7 ± 0.05 to 7.2 ± 0.6) and elevated concentrations of soluble nitrogen (from 1.8 ± 0.4 to 46.9 ± 2.1 DIN, mg/kg) and soluble phosphorus compounds (from 3.6 ± 2.6 to 20.0 ± 1.8 DIP, mg/kg). The contrasting composition of peat and penguin feces led to the elimination of the initial peat microbiota, with an increase in Betaproteobacteria (from 1.3 ± 0.8% to 30.5 ± 23%) and Bacteroidota (from 5.5 ± 3.7% to 19.0 ± 3.7%) proportional to the intensity of penguins’ impact, accompanied by a decrease in community diversity. Microbial taxa associated with birds’ guts, such as Gottschalkia and Tissierella, emerged in Impacted and Desolated moss banks, along with bacteria likely benefiting from eutrophication. The changes in the functional capacity of the penguin-affected peat microbial communities were also detected. The nitrogen-cycling genes that regulate the conversion of urea into ammonia, nitrite oxide, and nitrate oxide (ureC, amoA, nirS, nosZ, nxrB) had elevated copy numbers in the affected peat. Desolated peat samples exhibit the highest nitrogen-cycle gene numbers, significantly differing from Unaffected peat (p < 0.05). Discussion: The expansion of gentoo penguins induced by climate change led to the replacement of acidophilic microbiomes associated with moss banks, shaping a new microbial community influenced by penguin guano’s chemical and microbial composition.

ABSTRACT: The spring season of 2022 saw record low sea ice extent in Antarctica that persisted throughout the year. At the beginning of December, the Antarctic sea ice extent was tracking with the all-time low set in 2021. The greatest regional negative anomaly of this low extent was in the central and eastern Bellingshausen Sea region, west of the Antarctic Peninsula where, during November, some regions experienced a 100% loss in sea ice concentration. We provide evidence of a regional breeding failure of emperor penguin colonies due to sea ice loss using Sentinel2 satellite imagery. Of the five breeding sites in the region all but one experienced total breeding failure after sea ice break-up before the start of the fledging period of the 2022 breeding season. This is the first recorded incident of a widespread breeding failure of emperor penguins that is clearly linked with large-scale contractions in sea ice extent. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.

ABSTRACT: Penguins, like most birds, are considered monomorphic species. Cloacal endoscopy, laparoscopy, or molecular sex verification are used to determine sex in such animals. Our aim in this study was to investigate whether sex recognition can be performed in penguins by a non-invasive method using the shape of the bill. For this purpose, sex and population differences in penguins were investigated by geometric morphometric methods using photos of the bill in the dorsal and lateral views. Fifty-four African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) were taken for the study. Principal component analysis was applied to reveal the shape variations of the bill. Principal components were extracted for each bill projection. PC1 explained 37.06% of the total variation in the dorsal view, while PC1 for the lateral view explained 31.4% of the total variation. Canonical variance analysis was performed to reveal the differences between groups. The lateral view was more effective in revealing the differences between the groups and between the sexes. For the dorsal view, Procrustes distances values between any group were not statistically significant. The maxillary rostrum in female penguins was higher, while, in males, the mandibular rostrum was higher. The females’ bills were narrower than in males. Centroid size in males was on average larger than in females. Significant differences in bill shape between populations were also found. Using geometric morphometric methods, sex analysis can be conducted with less equipment and less stress on the birds. However, the environmental factors that cause bill variation in birds should be examined in more detail. Better knowledge of the effects of environmental factors on bill variation is important for geometric morphometric methods to give more accurate results in sex and population analyses. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Variation in the foraging niche and parental provisioning behaviors of breeding seabirds have the potential to affect population dynamics (e.g. foraging success, breeding productivity, and ultimately population size). We sampled blood plasma of family’ groups (females, males, and chicks) of Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) from Martillo Island, Argentina. We used stable isotope analyses on plasma samples to examine food provisioning, isotopic niche, trophic position, and diet composition of penguins between the early and late chick-rearing periods. We found clear differences in the isotopic niches of penguins between the two stages of the chick-rearing period related to shifts in foraging habitat and/or diet composition between stages. We found no evidence of individual consistency in isotopic niches or sex-specific selective provisioning by adults. In addition, we found high variability within family groups (accounting for 90% of the total isotopic variability). This study improves our understanding of the age, sex, individual, and breeding stage-specific trophic niches of Magellanic penguins, which may be helpful in projecting how they may respond to future environmental change (e.g., changes that affect prey availability). © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: From 1889 to 1919, Macquarie Island was the centre of one of the world’s most unusual extractive industries. On this small island, roughly midway between Australia and Antarctica, penguins were killed and boiled down to produce oil. Yet despite a single company having a virtual monopoly and investing heavily in machinery that allowed them to process up to 3500 penguins a day during the summer oiling season, penguin oil never became the lucrative commodity its boosters predicted. This article explores two overlapping processes of extraction in the Southern Ocean World. It firstly reconstructs the extraction of oil from penguins on Macquarie Island, a deeply controversial industry that triggered an organised transnational conservation movement aimed at ending penguin oiling and establishing a wildlife sanctuary on the island. This physical process of extraction is then used to explore the wider mentality of extraction that both animated the penguin oilers’ schemes and shaped visions for the island’s future articulated by the oilers’ critics. The article argues that the history of penguin oil provides an entry point for understanding how extraction has profoundly shaped human interactions with the Southern Ocean World. © 2023 ANU Press.

ABSTRACT: The bodies of penguins, which swim underwater to forage, are densely covered with feathers, in which the barbs are oriented in the longitudinal direction. We hypothesize that these barbs act as riblets and reduce friction drag during swimming. Considering various real-world swim conditions, the drag reduction effect is expected to be robust against changes in the flow speed and yaw angle relative to the flow. To test this hypothesis, we created trapezoidal riblets based on the morphology of these barbs and measured the drag of flat plates with these fabricated riblets in a water tunnel. The spacing, width, and height of the barbs were found to be approximately 100, 60, and 30 μm, respectively. This spacing resulted in a nondimensional spacing s + of 5.5 for a typical penguin swimming speed of 1.4 m s-1. We fabricated four types of riblets on polyimide films by ultraviolet laser ablation. The first was a small-scale riblet for which the spacing was decreased to 41 μm to simulate the surface flow condition of the usual and slower swim behaviors in our water tunnel. The other three were manufactured to the actual scale of real barbs (spacing of 100 μm) with three different rib ridge widths: 10, 25, and 50 μm. Yaw angles of 0°, 15°, 30°, and 45° were also tested with the actual-scale riblets. The drag reduction rate of the small-scale riblet was maximized to 1.97% by the smallest s + of 1.59. For all three actual-scale riblets, increasing the yaw angle from zero to 15° enhanced the drag reduction rate for the full range of s + up to 13.5. The narrow-ridge riblet reduced drag at an even higher yaw angle of 45°, but the drag increased with zero yaw angle. Overall, the medium-ridge riblet, which was representative of the barbs, was well-balanced. © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Penguins lost the ability to fly more than 60 million years ago, subsequently evolving a hyper-specialized marine body plan. Within the framework of a genome-scale, fossil-inclusive phylogeny, we identify key geological events that shaped penguin diversification and genomic signatures consistent with widespread refugia/recolonization during major climate oscillations. We further identify a suite of genes potentially underpinning adaptations related to thermoregulation, oxygenation, diving, vision, diet, immunity and body size, which might have facilitated their remarkable secondary transition to an aquatic ecology. Our analyses indicate that penguins and their sister group (Procellariiformes) have the lowest evolutionary rates yet detected in birds. Together, these findings help improve our understanding of how penguins have transitioned to the marine environment, successfully colonizing some of the most extreme environments on Earth. © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Given the increasing obligation to elevate animal welfare beyond minimum expectations, zoos need robust mechanisms to monitor physical activity and species-appropriate behaviours. This is not without challenge as animal behaviour can vary seasonally or be influenced by external factors such as weather and visitors. In theory, keepers who work with animals year-round are ideally situated to collect behavioural data. However, time pressure often means any data collection is minimal, ad-hoc, or skewed towards particular times of day. Here we compare infrequent low-intensity ad-hoc data on activity and behaviour of zoo-housed Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) collected by keepers with simultaneous high-intensity systematic data collected by a researcher. Once out-of-sight records (more frequent in researcher data) were excluded from both datasets, we found excellent agreement between keeper and researcher data. After this validation step, we collected extensive multi-year keeper data (diurnal hourly scan samples; 262 days across a 5-year study period) to assess potential influence of time of day, time of year, visitors, and weather on penguin behaviour. There were pronounced seasonal patterns: aquatic active behaviours were highest in autumn (38.9% in October) compared to early spring and late summer (February = 16.7%; August = 19.4%). Time of day was also important: terrestrial inactive behaviours increased throughout the day and this pattern was significantly more pronounced in summer than winter. Aquatic active behaviours were more frequent during warmer/sunnier conditions compared to cooler/wetter conditions, while the reverse was true for terrestrial inactive behaviours. Birds were much less active on days when the site was closed to visitors. Overall, we demonstrate that where keeper-collected data are validated and found to be robust and representative, there are real opportunities to study long-term behavioural patterns that can quickly translate to tangible husbandry benefits and improved animal welfare. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Recent fossil discoveries from New Zealand have revealed a remarkably diverse assemblage of Paleocene stem group penguins. Here, we add to this growing record by describing nine new penguin specimens from the late Paleocene (upper Teurian local stage; 55.5-59.5 Ma) Moeraki Formation of the South Island, New Zealand. The largest specimen is assigned to a new species, Kumimanu fordycei n. sp., which may have been the largest penguin ever to have lived. Allometric regressions based on humerus length and humerus proximal width of extant penguins yield mean estimates of a live body mass in the range of 148.0 kg (95% CI: 132.5 kg-165.3 kg) and 159.7 kg (95% CI: 142.6 kg-178.8 kg), respectively, for Kumimanu fordycei. A second new species, Petradyptes stonehousei n. gen. n. sp., is represented by five specimens and was slightly larger than the extant emperor penguin Aptenodytes forsteri. Two small humeri represent an additional smaller unnamed penguin species. Parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses recover Kumimanu and Petradyptes crownward of the early Paleocene mainland NZ taxa Waimanu and Muriwaimanu, but stemward of the Chatham Island taxon Kupoupou. These analyses differ, however, in the placement of these two taxa relative to Sequiwaimanu, Crossvallia, and Kaiika. The massive size and placement of Kumimanu fordycei close to the root of the penguin tree provide additional support for a scenario in which penguins reached the upper limit of sphenisciform body size very early in their evolutionary history, while still retaining numerous plesiomorphic features of the flipper.

ABSTRACT: In recent years, functional changes in Southern Ocean are becoming more noticeable, due to climate change and increasing human impacts, including a growing fishery that is concentrating in the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) region. Antarctic krill Euphausia superba is often the primary prey species for animals such as Pygoscelis penguins, a sentinel species for ecosystem monitoring and management. During the last two decades in the AP gentoo penguin numbers (Pygoscelis papua) have increased and their range has shifted southward, in contrast to the decline in numbers of Adélie (P. adeliae) and chinstrap (P. antarcticus) penguins. Given divergent population trends, the goal of this study was to examine differences in their diet, and size structure of Antarctic krill recovered from penguin diet samples. The study is based on diet samples collected during the austral summers on King George Island (South Shetland Islands) where P. adeliae, P. antarcticus, and P. papua breed in mixed colonies. Results indicate that the penguins consumed krill of similar sizes during the breeding period. In contrast to prior diet studies, we found higher proportions of krill in the gentoo diet and changes in the percentage of krill in the diet relative obtained during 1970s. The similarity in diets among all three species suggests that the availability prey items (e. g., fishes) may be changing and driving higher dietary overlap. Moreover, we also check differences in krill length among penguin individuals and we did not find any statistically significant differences. We also found plastic debris in penguin stomachs during both summers. © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: Ice-free areas in the Antarctic region are strongly limited. The presence of marine mammals and birds in those areas influence soil properties and vegetation composition. Studies on the terrestrial diatom flora in soils influenced by sea birds in the Maritime Antarctic region are scarce. Methods: Samples were collected from two transects on the western shore of the Admiralty Bay region. Light and scanning electron microscopic observations and statistical analyses were conducted to consider the impact of penguin rookeries on soil diatom assemblages. Results: The disturbance associated with the presence of penguin rookeries clearly influences the soil diatom diversity. Assemblages from areas with the highest nutrient input were characterized by a much lower diversity with only few species dominating the flora. One of recorded taxa could not be assigned to any of the known species. Therefore, based on the combination of morphological features analyzed using light and scanning electron microscopes and comparison with similar taxa in the Antarctic region and worldwide, the species is described hereby as new to science–Luticola kaweckae sp.nov. The new species is characteristic for soil habitats with strong penguin influence. Copyright 2022 Kochman-Kędziora et al.

ABSTRACT: The Endangered African Penguin Spheniscus demersus is in serious decline, with the total population falling at a rate of ∼5% per annum. The need to carry out regular monitoring to collect demographic and phenological data to assist in the planning and implementation of conservation actions needs to be balanced against the disturbance that may be caused by such monitoring. Many African Penguins are now fitted with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags that can be read remotely by ground readers at fixed locations in the colonies. In this study, we used data from these ground readers, combined with data collected during routine nest monitoring, to demonstrate that it should be possible to use data from the ground readers alone to monitor breeding success in the future. We found patterns of movements that varied during the various breeding stages. Adults took shifts of several days during incubation; during the brood period the adults alternated each day, with one remaining at the nest while the other went to sea. As the chicks grew large enough to be left alone, both parents usually foraged every day until the chicks fledged. In unsuccessful nests adults stopped attending the nest shortly after it had failed. If this work is taken forward it should be possible to greatly reduce the potential impact of regular nest monitoring. © 2023 NISC (Pty) Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Direct observation of foraging behavior is not always possible, especially for marine species that hunt underwater. However, biologging and tracking devices have provided detailed information about how various species use their habitat. From these indirect observations, researchers have inferred behaviors to address a variety of research questions, including the definition of ecological niches. In this study, we deployed video cameras with GPS and time-depth recorders on 16 chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarcticus) during the brood phase of the 2018-2019 breeding season on Signy (South Orkney Islands). More than 57 h of footage covering 770 dives were scrutinized by two observers. The outcome of each dive was classified as either no krill encounter, individual krill or krill swarm encounter and the number of prey items caught per dive was estimated. Other variables derived from the logging devices or from the environment were used to train a machine-learning algorithm to predict the outcome of each dive. Our results show that despite some limitations, the data collected from the footage was reliable. We also demonstrate that it was possible to accurately predict the outcome of each dive from dive and horizontal movement variables in a manner that has not been used for penguins previously. For example, our models show that a fast dive ascent rate and a high density of dives are good indicators of krill and especially of swarm encounter. Finally, we discuss how video footage can help build accurate habitat models to provide wider knowledge about predator behavior or prey distribution.  © 2022 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) are an endangered species, with approximately 70,000 mature adults remaining in the wild. Population loss is linked to a combination of environmental and anthropogenic stressors. The aim of the study was to validate a commercially available enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to assess adrenal activity and measure the response to stressors in the feces of African penguins. Fecal samples (n = 609) were collected from 12 African penguins housed at Mystic Aquarium throughout their natural lifecycle, including breeding and molt, where measurable changes in fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) levels are predicted to occur. Fecal samples collected post-veterinary exam were used for biological validation. Longitudinal analysis shows a significant difference (p = <0.0001) between the average FGM levels during baseline and breeding season, 33.97 ± 1.30 ng/g and 50.21 ± 3.18 ng/g, respectively. Females displayed significantly higher FGM levels than males during both baseline (p = 0.0386; females = 38.80 ± 2.19 ng/g; males = 29.34 ± 1.37 ng/g) and breeding periods (p = 0.0175; females = 57.53 ± 4.84 ng/g; males = 42.69 ± 3.95 ng/g). Average FGM levels decreased significantly over the three-week molting period, from 85.40 ± 20.35 ng/g at week one to 20.23 ± 5.30 ng/g at week three. A seasonal difference in FGM levels was observed in both male and female fecal samples, with Fall having the highest average FGM levels, 54.38 ± 3.64 ng/g, and Summer the lowest, 30.87 ± 2.21 ng/g. General linear mixed model analysis determined that lifecycle (females) and visitor presence (males) were the two factors which best explained the variation in FGM levels observed, however neither factor was found to be significant. These results show FGM analysis can detect physiologically meaningful changes in endocrine activity in African penguins and can be used to monitor health for penguins in aquaria and in the wild, thus contributing to conservation efforts for the survival of the species. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Background The Antarctic Penguin Biogeography Project is an effort to collate all known information about the distribution and abundance of Antarctic penguins through time and to make such data available to the scientific and management community. The core data product involves a series of structured tables with information on known breeding sites and surveys conducted at those sites from the earliest days of Antarctic exploration through to the present. This database, which is continuously updated as new information becomes available, provides a unified and comprehensive repository of information on Antarctic penguin biogeography that contributes to a growing suite of applications of value to the Antarctic community. One such application is the Mapping Application for Antarctic Penguins and Projected Dynamics (MAPPPD; www.penguinmap.com), a browser-based search and visualisation tool designed primarily for policy-makers and other nonspecialists, and mapppdr, an R package developed to assist the Antarctic science community. This dataset contains records of Pygoscelis adeliae, Pygoscelis antarctica, Pygoscelis papua, Eudyptes chrysolophus, Aptenodytes patagonicus and Aptenodytes forsteri annual nest, adult and/or chick counts conducted during field expeditions or collected using remote sensing imagery, that were subsequently gathered by the Antarctic Penguin Biogeography Project from published and unpublished sources, at all known Antarctic penguin breeding colonies south of 60 S from 01-11-1892 to 12-02-2022-02-12. New information This dataset collates together all publicly available breeding colony abundance data (1979-2022) for Antarctic penguins in a single database with standardised notation and format. Colony locations have been adjusted as necessary using satellite imagery and each colony has been assigned a unique four-digit alphanumeric code to avoid confusion. These data include information previously published in a variety of print and online formats as well as additional survey data not previously published. Previously unpublished data derive primarily from recent surveys collected under the auspices of the Antarctic Site Inventory, Penguin Watch or by the Lynch Lab at Stony Brook University. © Che-Castaldo C et al.

ABSTRACT: Mercury pollution is a serious global environmental issue and the characterization of its distribution and its driving forces should be urgently included in research agendas. We report unusually high mercury (Hg) concentrations (>5 μg/g) along with stable isotopes values in feathers of southern rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome) from colonies in the Southwest Atlantic Ocean. We found a highly heterogenous prevalence of Hg throughout the study area and over a three-fold higher mean Hg concentration in southernmost colonies. Variation in Hg concentrations among colonies is primarily explained by site, rather than by trophic position. We provide further support to the existence of a Hg hotspot in the food web of the Patagonian Shelf and spatially restrict it to the southern tip of South America. Our findings highlight the need for regional and colony-based seabird conservation management when high local variability and plasticity in foraging habits is evident. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Avian malaria, caused by Plasmodium spp. and transmitted by mosquitos, is a leading cause of mortality of captive penguins. Antimalarial drugs are currently used to control infections in penguins. However, the effectiveness of treatment reduces significantly by the time the clinical signs appear, while early and unnecessary treatment interferes with development of protective immunity. Therefore, for suppressing parasitemia without affecting the development of immunity in captive penguins, antimalaria drugs need to be administered at the right time, which requires reliable diagnostic tools that can determine the levels of circulating antimalaria antibodies. In the present study, we have developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) diagnostic assay based on the merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1) of P. relictum isolate SGS1 to specifically detect and relatively quantify antimalaria antibodies in penguins. We expressed and purified a truncated P. relictum isolate SGS1 MSP-1 and optimized its biotinylation and subsequent conjugation to streptavidin alkaline phosphatase for signal generation in ELISA. We tested the assay by analyzing sera obtained from penguins at the Baltimore Zoo, from Spring through Fall, and found that levels of detectable antibodies against MSP-1 varied seasonally for individual penguins, consistent with the expected seasonal variations in avian malaria prevalence. Corroboratively, we analyzed the sensitivity of the assay by titrating positive sera and found that the signal intensity generated was serum concentration-dependent, thus validating the ability of the assay to detect and relatively quantify the levels of antimalaria antibodies in penguin sera. © 2022

ABSTRACT: Rare earth elements (REE) and some transition metals (e.g. Nb) are a group of chemicals that have recently been widely used in industrial processes due to the increasing demand for new technologies. As a result, these chemicals are increasingly being released into the environment, which could mean that these pollutants could modify marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Seabirds, such as penguins, can biotransport pollutants and nutrients from the sea to land through excreta. However, there is no information about the role of the Humboldt penguin (Spheniscus humboldti) in bio-transporting emerging contaminants such as REE. This study aimed to assess any possible contribution of Humboldt penguins to the geochemical composition of some terrestrial areas. Excreta samples were collected from Chañaral Island, one of the most important sites in Chile for the conservation of Humboldt penguins. The results showed that this species tends to contribute to soil enrichment with REE (Ce, La, Nd, and Pr) and Nb through excreta, as well as with carbon. More studies are needed to see the potential impacts on the soil. © 2022, Escuela de Ciencias del Mar. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Novel Corynebacterium strains, 3BT and 7BT, were isolated from the oral cavities of young chicks of yellow-eyed penguins (hoiho), Megadyptes antipodes. A polyphasic taxonomic characterization of these strains revealed chemotaxonomic, biochemical and mor-phological features that are consistent with those of the genus Corynebacterium. The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values between the strains and their closest phylogenetic neighbour, Corynebacterium ciconiae CCUG 47525T were 99.07 %, values that are in line with their phylogenomic positions within the evolutionary radiation of the genus Corynebacterium. Digital DNA–DNA hybridization values and average nucleotide identities between the genome sequences of the two strains and related Corynebacte-rium species were well below the defined threshold values (70 and 95–96 %, respectively) for prokaryotic species delineation. The genome size of these strains varied between 2.45–2.46 Mb with G+C content 62.7–62.9 mol%. Strains 3BT and 7BT were Gram-stain positive bacilli that were able to grow in presence of 0–10 % (w/v) NaCl and at temperature ranging between 20–37 °C. The major fatty acids (>15 %) were C16: 0 and C18: 1 ω9c, and the mycolic acid profile included 32–36 carbon atoms. We propose that these strains represent a novel species, Corynebacterium megadyptis sp. nov. with 3BT (=DSM 111184T=NZRM 4755T) as the type strain. Phylog-enomically, strains 3BT and 7BT belong to two lineages with subtle differences in MALDI-TOF spectra, chemotaxonomic profiles and phenotypic properties. The fatty acid profile of strain 3BT contains C18: 0 as a predominant type (>15 %), which is a minor component in strain 7BT. Strain 7BT can oxidize N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, l-serine, α-hydroxy-butyric acid, l-malic acid, l-glutamic acid, bromo-succinic acid and l-lactic acid, characteristics not observed in strain 3BT. Therefore, we propose that these strains represent two subspecies, namely Corynebacterium megadyptis subsp. megadyptis subsp. nov. (type strain, 3BT=DSM 111184T=NZRM 4755T) and Corynebacterium megadyptis subsp. dunedinense subsp. nov. (type strain, 7BT=DSM 111183T=NZRM 4756T). © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: In 2017, a mortality event affected Humboldt penguins at Chester Zoo (UK), which coincided with the diagnosis of avian malaria (AM) in some birds. AM is found worldwide wherever a competent mosquito vector is present, but the disease is particularly severe in penguins and other species that originate from non-endemic regions. To better understand the role of AM and manage its threat to penguin collections, Plasmodium was surveyed through PCR at Chester Zoo in mosquitoes, penguins, and dead free-living wild birds during and around the mortality event. Additional sequences were obtained from penguin fatalities from four other UK zoological collections. All sequences were integrated into phylogenetic analyses to determine parasite species and lineages. In total, 753/6459 positive mosquitoes were recorded (11.7% prevalence), reaching a weekly peak of 30% prevalence in mid-summer. Among penguin fatalities at Chester Zoo, several penguins presented signs and lesions compatible with AM; nevertheless, exoerythrocytic meronts were identified in only one case and Plasmodium spp. was identified in 5/22 birds. Phylogenetic analysis revealed at least five parasite cytb lineages of three Plasmodium species (P. matutinum, P. relictum and P. vaughani) circulating in mosquitoes at Chester Zoo; however, infections in free-living wild birds and penguins were only from P. matutinum. Plasmodium matutinum was confirmed as the cause of death of one penguin and was highly suspected to be the cause of death of another three. The lineage LINN1 was associated with 4/5 penguin infections. AM had a key role in the penguin multicausal mortality event. Understanding the risk of AM to penguin collections at Chester Zoo and elsewhere requires long-term surveillance to examine the association between Plasmodium infection and penguin mortality and the variability in parasite virulence. Surveillance of Plasmodium spp. in mosquitoes and local birds provides information about the parasite's transmission cycle locally, and could warn about infection risks to species of interest, which is essential for efficient disease control and prevention. © 2022 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Tracking individual animals through time using mark-recapture methods is the gold standard for understanding how environmental conditions influence demographic rates, but applying such tags is often infeasible due to the difficulty of catching animals or attaching marks/tags without influencing behavior or survival. Due to the logistical challenges and emerging ethical concerns with flipper banding penguins, relatively little is known about spatial variation in demographic rates, spatial variation in demographic stochasticity, or the role that stochasticity may play in penguin population dynamics. Here we describe how adaptive importance sampling can be used to fit age-structured population models to time series of point counts. While some demographic parameters are difficult to learn through point counts alone, others can be estimated, even in the face of missing data. Here we demonstrate the application of adaptive importance sampling using two case studies, one in which we permit immigration and another permitting regime switching in reproductive success. We apply these methods to extract demographic information from several time series of observed abundance in gentoo and Adélie penguins in Antarctica. Our method is broadly applicable to time series of abundance and provides a feasible means of fitting age-structured models without marking individuals. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Climate change is leading to phenological shifts across a wide range of species globally. Polar oceans are hotspots of rapid climate change where sea ice dynamics structure ecosystems and organismal life cycles are attuned to ice seasonality. To anticipate climate change impacts on populations and ecosystem services, it is critical to understand ecosystem phenology to determine species activity patterns, optimal environmental windows for processes like reproduction, and the ramifications of ecological mismatches. Since 1991, the Palmer Antarctica Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) program has monitored seasonal dynamics near Palmer Station. Here, we review the species that occupy this region as year-round residents, seasonal breeders, or periodic visitors. We show that sea ice retreat and increasing photoperiod in the spring trigger a sequence of events from mid-November to mid-February, including Adélie penguin clutch initiation, snow melt, calm conditions (low winds and warm air/sea temperature), phytoplankton blooms, shallow mixed layer depths, particulate organic carbon flux, peak humpback whale abundances, nutrient drawdown, and bacterial accumulation. Subsequently, from May to June, snow accumulates, zooplankton indicator species appear, and sea ice advances. The standard deviation in the timing of most events ranged from ~20 to 45 days, which was striking compared with Adélie penguin clutch initiation that varied <1 week. In general, during late sea ice retreat years, events happened later (~5 to >30 days) than mean dates and the variability in timing was low (<20%) compared with early ice retreat years. Statistical models showed the timing of some events were informative predictors (but not sole drivers) of other events. From an Adélie penguin perspective, earlier sea ice retreat and shifts in the timing of suitable conditions or prey characteristics could lead to mismatches, or asynchronies, that ultimately influence chick survival via their mass at fledging. However, more work is needed to understand how phenological shifts affect chick thermoregulatory costs and the abundance, availability, and energy content of key prey species, which support chick growth and survival. While we did not detect many long-term phenological trends, we expect that when sea ice trends become significant within our LTER time series, phenological trends and negative effects from ecological mismatches will follow. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The overall population size and trend of the Magellanic Penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) is uncertain and population estimates are available only for few locations. The last complete census along its central-southern distribution range in Argentina, province of Santa Cruz, was made in the 1990s. This study updates the breeding population size along Santa Cruz. Population estimates were compared with the last complete census, and trends were studied when it was possible. With 353,256 estimated breeding pairs, the overall population in Santa Cruz remained relatively stable after 25 years. The Santa Cruz population represents 31% of the Argentine Patagonian coast population and could represent between 22 and 30% of the species' global population. Colony sizes varied between 9 and 127,492 breeding pairs. Changes in abundance differed among locations, with individual colonies showing increasing, decreasing, or stable trends, which suggests that local factors determine population dynamics. The most significant increases (> 40%) were observed in the southern sector of Santa Cruz. Contrary to what was observed at the north of the distribution range in the province of Chubut, where trends of several colonies were inversely related to colony size, in Santa Cruz most of the largest colonies remained stable or even increased from the 1990s onwards. © 2022 The Waterbird Society.

ABSTRACT: Changes in sea ice extent and polynya size and productivity associated with climate conditions in the Ross Sea region have an important role on the ecological responses of Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae). Nevertheless, there have been few studies that elaborate on the effects of atmospheric and oceanic circulation on their populations. Here, we reconstructed the population dynamics of Adélie penguins on Beaufort Island during the past 350 years using various alternative geochemical indices and Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). We explored the effects of atmospheric-ocean circulation patterns, including the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), and the Amundsen Sea Low (ASL), on the population ecology of penguins. The results indicated that their population on the island has been growing with fluctuations since ~1650 AD, and there were three significant increases, corresponding to 1650–1750, 1825–1900 and after 1950 AD. It was revealed that climate warming in this region was not a necessary factor for penguin population growth, since their populations maintained an increasing trend during the Little Ice Age (LIA) when relatively colder climate conditions prevailed. The present results indicated that atmospheric-ocean circulation patterns likely impose prominent influences on the historical change of penguin populations on Beaufort Island. © 2022

ABSTRACT: Infections with herpesvirus have contributed to respiratory, enteric, and neurological disease reports in avian species worldwide. Herpesviruses have been detected in penguin species before but have not been studied extensively. To better understand the impact of these viruses in free-living populations, an initial retrospective survey was performed on a wild population of Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) in the Punta San Juan Marine Protected Area, Peru (15°22′S, 75°12′W) using tracheal swabs collected from 28 penguins in 2016 and 34 penguins in 2018. DNA extracted from these swabs was analyzed using a consensus herpesviral PCR assay targeting the DNA polymerase gene, and positive samples were sequenced. A single sample from 2016 was positive for spheniscid alpha-herpesvirus-1 (SpAHV-1), establishing an overall sample prevalence of 1.6% (95% CI: 0-8.6%). The positive animal was an adult male that did not show any clinical signs of herpesviral infection and was otherwise healthy based on physical exam and laboratory findings. This is the first detection of a herpesvirus in penguins at Punta San Juan, Peru, and the first step toward characterizing the implications of SpAHV-1 for Humboldt penguins. This investigation highlights the importance of continual disease surveillance in wild populations over time to monitor for changes that may impact long-term population viability.  © 2023 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: A new cranium of penguin from the Late Miocene of the Bahía Inglesa Formation (Northern Chile) is described here. Specimen SGO.PV.22245 exhibits a unique combination of characters that suggests it belongs to a new species of either Eudypula Bonaparte, 1856, Spheniscus Brisson, 1760, or more probably to a more basal taxon related to them. The specimen is notably smaller than the fossil species of Spheniscus and more similar in size to the extant Spheniscus. The fossa glandulae nasalis narrows caudally, the crista nuchalis transversa and the crista temporalis are expanded like short wings, and a short crista nuchalis sagittalis connects with the rounded and cranially projected eminentia cerebellaris. The fossa temporalis is subtriangular and deeper caudally and the cranial roof is widely expanded. All these features approach the condition to some species of Spheniscus and Eudyptula. However, because of the incompleteness of the material and the fact that it cannot be compared with some fossil species of Spheniscus only known through postcranial material, we are not able to provide a more accurate assignment. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.

ABSTRACT: Aspergillus fumigatus is the main causative agent of avian aspergillosis and results in significant health problems in birds, especially those living in captivity. The fungal contamination by A. fumigatus in the environment of Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti), located in a Belgian zoo, was assessed through the analysis of air, water, sand and nest samples during four non-consecutive days in 2021–2022. From these samples, potential azole-resistant A. fumigatus (ARAF) isolates were detected using a selective culture medium. A total of 28 veterinary isolates obtained after necropsy of Humboldt penguins and other avian species from the zoo were also included. All veterinary and suspected ARAF isolates from the environment were characterized for their azole-resistance profile by broth microdilution. Isolates displaying phenotypic resistance against at least one medical azole were systematically screened for mutations in the cyp51A gene. A total of 14 (13.6%) ARAF isolates were identified from the environment (n = 8) and from Humboldt penguins (n = 6). The TR34/L98H mutation was observed in all resistant environmental strains, and in two resistant veterinary strains. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of this mutation in A. fumigatus isolates from Humboldt penguins. During the period 2017–2022, pulmonary aspergillosis was confirmed in 51 necropsied penguins, which reflects a death rate due to aspergillosis of 68.0%, mostly affecting adults. Microsatellite polymorphism analysis revealed a high level of diversity among environmental and veterinary A. fumigatus isolates. However, a cluster was observed between one veterinary isolate and six environmental strains, all resistant to medical azoles. In conclusion, the environment of the Humboldt penguins is a potential contamination source of ARAF, making their management even more complex. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Rehabilitation of wildlife can be a meaningful conservation technique if rehabilitated animals contribute to the breeding population. Endangered Yellow-eyed Penguins (Megadyptes antipodes) are declining on South Island, New Zealand, where modelling published in 2017 predicted their extirpation by 2043. Four management plans dating back to 1989 have been implemented in attempts to mitigate threats. The first three plans overlooked rehabilitation whereas the most recent, published in 2020, regarded rehabilitation as essential to save the South Island population. We assess the outcome of four decades of management of Yellow-eyed Penguins at Moeraki, southeast South Island, by Penguin Rescue, a volunteer conservation organisation. Here, nest numbers have fluctuated but overall increased at a long-term annual average of 5%. Their proportion of the southeast South Island total rose from 1% (six of about 453 nests) in 1982 to 26% (43 of about 166 nests) in 2021. Since 1986 our management has included rehabilitation of all juvenile or adult Yellow-eyed Penguins we encountered locally with life-threatening injuries, emaciation or sickness, with 590 of these marked before release from our rehabilitation facility. We accounted for the effect of rehabilitation on nest numbers by subtracting the number of rehabilitated female breeders and their female descendants from the total number of female breeders. Without rehabilitation nest numbers at Moeraki in 2021 probably would have remained similar to the initial six nests in 1982 instead of the seven-fold increase through four decades. We conclude that rehabilitation is an effective management technique for this species. © 2023 BirdLife Australia.

ABSTRACT: Understanding the physiology of stress in wild animals is essential for the conservation of species subject to anthropogenic perturbations. Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) are exposed to increasing anthropogenic impacts in their natural habitat. In this species, females are typically smaller and dive less deep than males. In related species, the more limited foraging habitat of females and their reduced resiliency due to their smaller size were associated with higher mortality. We hypothesise that potential sex-specific differences in the foraging behaviour of Humboldt penguins may also relate to differences in their physiological stress. Here, we studied sex-specific foraging and diving behaviours and variations in plasma corticosterone levels and leukocyte profiles of Humboldt penguins during the chick-rearing period in Northern Chile. We report no evidence of sex-related differences in most foraging parameters, except that males dived significantly deeper than females. We found that plasma corticosterone levels and leukocyte profiles showed no significant differences between the sexes. Furthermore, there was no clear relationship between an individual’s foraging behaviour and its plasma corticosterone level or leukocyte profile. In summary, we found no support for sex-related differences in physiological stress levels of Humboldt penguins, and no link between their foraging behaviour and their physiological stress. However, we acknowledge that our sample size is small and that more studies are needed. This study contributes with information on the physiological stress and foraging behaviours of Humboldt penguins in Northern Chile. This information can help to understand context-dependent differences in physiological parameters and foraging behaviours for the species. © 2022 BirdLife Australia.

ABSTRACT: The growth and implementation of biofuels and bioenergy conversion technologies play an important part in the production of sustainable and renewable energy resources in the upcoming years. Recycling sources from waste could efficiently ease the risk of world source strain. The waste classification was a good resolution for separating the waste from the recycled objects. It is inefficient and expensive to rely solely on manual classification of garbage and recycling sources. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have lately been used to classify recyclable waste, and this is the primary way for recycling the waste. This study presents a recycling waste classification using emperor penguin optimizer with deep learning (RWC-EPODL) model for bioenergy production. RWC-EPODL model focuses on recycling waste materials recognition and classification. When it comes to detecting and classifying trash, the RWC-EPODL model uses two stages. At the initial stage, the RWC-EPODL model uses AX-RetinaNet model for the recognition of waste objects. In addition, Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm is applied as hyperparameter optimizer of the AX-RetinaNet model. Following the EPO algorithm with a stacked auto-encoder (SAE) model, the EPO algorithm is used to fine-tune the parameters of the SAE technique for trash classification. The RWC-EPODL model's experimental validation is examined through a number of studies. The RWC-EPODL approach has a 98.96 percent success rate. The comparative result analysis reported the better performance of the RWC-EPODL model over recent approaches. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: There is great interest in measuring immune function in wild animals. Yet, field conditions often have methodological challenges related to handling stress, which can alter physiology. Despite general consensus that immune function is influenced by handling stress, previous studies have provided equivocal results. Furthermore, few studies have focused on long-lived species, which may have different stress-immune trade-offs compared to short-lived species that have primarily been tested. Here, we investigate whether capture and handling duration impacts innate immune function in a long-lived seabird, the Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae). We found no evidence for changes in three commonly used parameters of innate immune function upon holding time of up to 2 h, suggesting that immune function in this species is more robust against handling than in other species. This opens up exciting possibilities for measuring immune function in species with similar life-histories even if samples cannot be taken directly after capture. © 2023.

ABSTRACT: Animal hosts live in continuous interaction with bacterial partners, yet we still lack a clear understanding of the ecological drivers of animal-associated bacteria, particularly in seabirds. Here, we investigated the effect of body site in the structure and diversity of bacterial communities of two seabirds in the Strait of Magellan: the Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) and the king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus). We used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to profile bacterial communities associated with body sites (chest, back, foot) of both penguins and the nest soil of Magellanic penguin. Taxonomic composition showed that Moraxellaceae family (specifically Psychrobacter) had the highest relative abundance across body sites in both penguin species, whereas Micrococacceae had the highest relative abundance in nest soil. We were able to detect a bacterial core among 90% of all samples, which consisted of Clostridium sensu stricto and Micrococcacea taxa. Further, the king penguin had its own bacterial core across its body sites, where Psychrobacter and Corynebacterium were the most prevalent taxa. Microbial alpha diversity across penguin body sites was similar in most comparisons, yet we found subtle differences between foot and chest body sites of king penguins. Body site microbiota composition differed across king penguin body sites, whereas it remained similar across Magellanic penguin body sites. Interestingly, all Magellanic penguin body site microbiota composition differed from nest soil microbiota. Finally, bacterial abundance in penguin body sites fit well under a neutral community model, particularly in the king penguin, highlighting the role of stochastic process and ecological drift in microbiota assembly of penguin body sites. Our results represent the first report of body site bacterial communities in seabirds specialized in subaquatic foraging. Thus, we believe it represents useful baseline information that could serve for long-term comparisons that use marine host microbiota to survey ocean health. Copyright 2023 Ochoa-Sánchez et al.

ABSTRACT: Pseudouridine is one of the most abundant RNA modifications, occurring when uridines are catalyzed by Pseudouridine synthase proteins. It plays an important role in many biological processes and has been reported to have application in drug development. Recently, the single-molecule sequencing techniques such as the direct RNA sequencing platform offered by Oxford Nanopore technologies have enabled direct detection of RNA modifications on the molecule being sequenced. In this study, we introduce a tool called Penguin that integrates several machine learning (ML) models to identify RNA Pseudouridine sites on Nanopore direct RNA sequencing reads. Pseudouridine sites were identified on single molecule sequencing data collected from direct RNA sequencing resulting in 723 K reads in Hek293 and 500 K reads in Hela cell lines. Penguin extracts a set of features from the raw signal measured by the Oxford Nanopore and the corresponding basecalled k-mer. Those features are used to train the predictors included in Penguin, which in turn, can predict whether the signal is modified by the presence of Pseudouridine sites in the testing phase. We have included various predictors in Penguin, including Support vector machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Neural network (NN). The results on the two benchmark data sets for Hek293 and Hela cell lines show outstanding performance of Penguin either in random split testing or in independent validation testing. In random split testing, Penguin has been able to identify Pseudouridine sites with a high accuracy of 93.38% by applying SVM to Hek293 benchmark dataset. In independent validation testing, Penguin achieves an accuracy of 92.61% by training SVM with Hek293 benchmark dataset and testing it for identifying Pseudouridine sites on Hela benchmark dataset. Thus, Penguin outperforms the existing Pseudouridine predictors in the literature by 16 % higher accuracy than those predictors using independent validation testing. Employing penguin to predict Pseudouridine sites revealed a significant enrichment of “regulation of mRNA 3'-end processing” in Hek293 cell line and 'positive regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter involved in cellular response to chemical stimulus' in Hela cell line.

ABSTRACT: The African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) is an endangered species that continues to experience population decline. Understanding the behavior of this species is a critical step in the conservation efforts to prevent their extinction. A comprehensive activity budget of this species has yet to be conducted in any captive population, which are critical for the Species Survival Plan (SSP) breeding programs. We performed scan sampling observations on a group of 19 penguins to construct an activity budget. We also investigated the behavioral differences between males and females, as well as between adults and juveniles. Results indicate there are minimal sex differences in time budget allocations, but there are some notable age related differences. Creating and comparing activity budgets between populations are critical for understanding animal welfare in captive settings. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Organic nitrogen (ON) is an important participant in the Earth's N cycle. Previous studies have shown that penguin feces add an abundance of nutrients including N to the soil, significantly changing the eco-environment in ice-free areas in Antarctica. To explore the molecular transformation of ON in penguin guano-affected soil, we collected guano-free weathered soil, modern guano-affected soil from penguin colonies, ancient guano-affected soil from abandoned penguin colonies, and penguin feces from the Ross Sea region, Antarctica, and Fourier transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) was used to investigate the chemical composition of water-extractable ON. By comparing the molecular compositions of ON among different samples, we found that the number of ON compounds (>4,000) in weathered soil is minimal, while carboxylic-rich alicyclic-like molecules (CRAM-like) are dominant. Penguin feces adds ON into the soil with > 10,000 CHON, CHONS and CHN compounds, including CRAM-like, lipid-like, aliphatic/ peptide-like molecules and amines in the guano-affected soil. After the input of penguin feces, macromolecules continue to degrade, and other ON compounds tend to be oxidized into relatively stable CRAM-like molecules, this is an important transformation process of ON in guano-affected soils. We conclude the roles of various forms of ON in the N cycle are complex and diverse. Combined with previous studies, ON eventually turns into inorganic N and is lost from the soil. The lost N ultimately returns to the ocean and the food web, thus completing the N cycle. Our study preliminarily reveals the molecular transformation of ON in penguin guano-affected soil and is important for understanding the N cycle in Antarctica. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The objects of the study are decision support systems. The subject of the study is the decision-making process in management problems using the Emperor Penguin Algorithm (EPA), an advanced genetic algorithm and evolving artificial neural networks. A solution search method using the improved EPA is proposed. The study is based on the EPA algorithm for finding a solution regarding the object state. Evolving artificial neural networks are used to train EPA, and an advanced genetic algorithm is used to select the best EPA. The method has the following sequence of actions: – input of initial data; – setting agents on the search plane; – numbering EPA in the flock; – setting the initial velocity of the EPA and thermal radiation of each EPA; – calculation of the position of each EPA on the total search area and its cost; – approach (attraction) of the EPA to another EPA; – changing in the trajectory of EPA movement; – selection of the best individuals from the EPA flock; – ranking the obtained solutions and sorting them; – training EPA knowledge bases; – determining the amount of necessary computing resources for an intelligent decision support system. The originality of the proposed method lies in setting EPA taking into account the uncertainty of the initial data, improved global and local search procedures taking into account the noise degree of data on the state of the analysis object. The method makes it possible to increase the efficiency of data processing at the level of 13–17 % due to the use of additional improved procedures. The proposed method should be used to solve the problems of evaluating complex and dynamic processes in the interests of solving national security problems Copyright © 2023, Authors.

ABSTRACT: The bulk of the chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarcticus) global population inhabits the Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia Sea, which is a region undergoing rapid environmental changes. Consequently, regional level decreases for this species are widespread. This study aimed to evaluate the level of breeding colony changes in the Antarctic Peninsula and South Orkney Islands, which, roughly, hold 60% of the global chinstrap penguin population. The results indicated that within a period of 40 to 50 years, 62% of colonies underwent decreases, and the majority of colonies experienced decreases over 50%, which is represented by numbers in the range of 2000 to 40,000 pairs. Within three generations’ time, the whole population for the area had experienced decreases of around 30%. These levels of decrease add to the fact that the suspected causes are not likely reversible in the short- to mid-term, calling for increased concern about the conservation of this species. © 2023 by the author.

ABSTRACT: Understanding how animals move in dense environments where vision is compromised is a major challenge. We used GPS and dead-reckoning to examine the movement ofMagellanic penguins commuting through vegetation that precluded long-distance vision. Birds leaving the nest followed the shortest, quickest route to the sea (the 'ideal path', or 'I-path') but return tracks depended where the birds left the water. Penguins arriving at the beach departure spot mirrored the departure. Most of those landing at a distance from the departure spot travelled slowly, obliquely to the coast at a more acute angle than a beeline trajectory to the nest. On crossing their I-path, these birds then followed this route quickly to their nests. This movement strategy saves birds distance, time and energy compared to a route along the beach and the into the colony on the I-track and saves time and energy compared to a beeline trajectory which necessitates slow travel in unfamiliar areas. This suggests that some animals adopt tactics that take them to an area where their navigational capacities are enhanced for efficient travel in challenging environments. © 2022 Royal Society Publishing.

ABSTRACT: Operant conditioning has been used in a variety of animal species both in captivity (laboratories, zoological institutions) and in the wild. Such training may enrich the environment of animals or facilitate their manipulation but it can also be used to answer scientific questions (so far primarily regarding sense modalities). However, the trainability of animals may vary because of cognitive differences between species or because of individual and external factors within species. The assumed difficulty of training seabirds presumably explains, why they have been mostly overlooked in studies based on operant conditioning, such as psycho-acoustic studies. Here, as part of a broad project examining the hearing capacity of penguins, we trained four captive Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) for psychoacoustic trials, following well-established operant conditioning methods. In addition to describing the different steps of the training of penguins, we examined how the trainability of each individual (concentration, response to call and stationing quality) was affected by different life stages (moult, pairing interest) and environmental conditions (daylength, temperature, humidity, visitors). After 22 months and ca. 700 trials, all four penguins were ready for psychoacoustic measurements, which in turn extended over 22 additional months. However, the trainability of penguins was not stable over these 44 months, as their concentration decreased over time (presumably because of habituation) while the quality of their call response and stationing increased for most of them (presumably reflecting learning progress). Moreover, all trainability parameters were strongly reduced during moult while the effects of pairing interest and environmental conditions were more variable between individuals. Our study demonstrates that, despite the length and the instability of training as well as some interindividual differences in trainability, it is possible to train captive penguins for scientific purposes. As such, we hope that our study opens the path for further studies based on the training of animals, for which training is assumed to be challenging but for which scientific data are urgently needed because of their vulnerability in the face of environmental changes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Environmental pollutants and their effect on wildlife health play an important role in the conservation of endangered species and can be clinically relevant in captive animals too. Data on relevant concentrations of trace elements in captive birds with no known exposures are rare. For this study, silver, arsenic, gold, barium, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, mercury, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, thallium, selenium, and zinc were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry in lithium heparinized plasma samples from 18 Humboldt penguins at 2 zoological collections in Germany. The results showed that the plasma concentrations of silver, arsenic, gold, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, mercury, and selenium differed significantly (P ≤ 0.05) between the 2 penguin collections. The results indicate that the location of the birds has a strong influence on the plasma trace element concentrations. Well water used in the enclosures was suspected to be associated with these significant differences. Trace elemental concentrations in feed (eg, marine fish) and contamination from enclosure construction materials may also play a role. This study could provide a basis for further comparative, biomonitoring, toxicity, and reference interval studies. © 2023 Association of Avian Veterinarians. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Marine Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation Centers (MWRRCs) are crucial for the rehabilitation of endangered marine species, such as penguins, sea turtles, sea lions, and/or sea otters. In Chile, rescue of marine fauna is coordinated by the National Fisheries and Aquaculture Service (SERNAPESCA). This organization is responsible for assisting stranded animals and transporting them to 6 of the 13 MWRRCs that exist throughout the 6,435 km coastline of the country. Stranding events were analyzed for two species of pinnipeds (Otaria flavescens and Arctocephalus australis), two species of penguins (Spheniscus humboldti and Spheniscus magellanicus), two species of chelonians (Chelonia mydas and Lepidochelys olivacea), and one species of sea otter (Lontra felina) found stranded at the coast of Chile during 2009-2019 period. Success in post-rehabilitation release of individuals was also examined. A total of 2,818 stranding events were recorded with a total of 3,198 stranded animals, corresponding to O. flavescens (52.9%), S. humboldti (20.4%), S. magellanicus (17.9%) and L. olivacea (4.3%). Of the 3,198 stranded animals, 721 specimens were referred to MWRRC, and only 136 were released post-rehabilitation. This shows 18.8% of success rate in the release of marine fauna species post-rehabilitated in rescue centers after their stranding. It is necessary to improve coordination between SERNAPESCA and MWRRCs in Chile to improve the release rate and to increase the number of MWRRCs to recover endangered marine species that strand along the country’s coast. © The author(s).

ABSTRACT: The human-induced disturbances in Antarctica have caused changes in the structure and function of ecosystems. The Cape Hallett station was established in 1957 and abandoned in 1973. The station was built inside a penguin colony, and during its operation, many penguins were deported. Herein, we compared the number of breeding pairs across different time periods after station decommission and environmental remediation. The station occupied 4.77 ha within the Adélie penguin breeding area, and 349 nests were identified inside the station border in 1960. In 1983, the station’s territory decreased to 4.2 ha; meanwhile, 1683 breeding pairs were counted in the old station area. The past station area re-inhabited by Adélie penguins had 6175 nests in 2019. We assumed that recolonization might be particularly related to artificial mounds. The results of the present study confirm the recolonization of Adélie penguins at Cape Hallett for the first time, with visual analysis of spatial-temporal changes. Additionally, we suggest that reconstruction of the artificial or enhanced habitat may be required for successful restoration. Furthermore, continuous species monitoring with specific notes are needed with management interventions to protect Antarctic ecosystems, as well as the Ross Sea region MPA. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: In this study, we obtained samples through stomach lavage to determine the diet of Adelie Penguins Pygoscelis adeliae during the guard and crèche periods at Hope/Esperanza Bay, Antarctica, during four breeding seasons (2014–2019, except 2016). Antarctic krill was the dominant prey, contributing > 99.6% of the diet by mass. The remainder of prey were fish, amphipods, and mollusks. Among fish, the nototheniid Pleuragramma antarcticum was the most frequent while the bathydraconid Parachaenichthys charcoti dominated by mass. Mollusks and fish increased their contribution during the crèche period in accord with seasonal patterns elsewhere. © 2023, Marine Ornithology. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Endangered yellow-eyed penguins (Megadyptes antipodes) are central-place, benthic-diving foragers that search for prey in the productive marine areas off the coast of the South Island, New Zealand. Like other seabirds, they target specific, reliable areas of high prey abundance, which are often associated with oceanographic characteristics such as bathymetry, seafloor sediment type, and sea surface temperature. Employing GPS tracking data collected between 2003 and 2021, we created species distribution models using maximum entropy modelling (Maxent) to determine foraging space use and habitat suitability for yellow-eyed penguins across their entire South Island range and within five distinct subpopulations: Banks Peninsula, North Otago, Otago Peninsula, the Catlins, and Stewart Island. We quantified the importance of environmental variables for predicting foraging site selection during and outside the breeding season. Significant regional variation existed in predicted probability of penguin presence, and proximity to the nearest breeding area was a key predictor of suitable foraging habitat. When distance was not included in the models, dissolved oxygen concentration was the most important predictor in the overall South Island model and the North Otago, Otago Peninsula, and the Catlins subpopulation models, whereas water current speed and mean monthly turbidity were most important in Banks Peninsula and Stewart Island subpopulation models, respectively. Dynamic variables related to prey availability were often the most important variables in model predictions of the habitat selection of yellow-eyed penguins. Visualisations and findings from this study, particularly of the observed interactions between penguins and their marine habitat, can be used to direct conservation and resources during marine spatial planning and species management.

ABSTRACT: The rapid increase in seaborn trade since the 1990s has resulted in an increase in vessel-derived noise pollution, yet there is little evidence linking these activities to a decline in many marine taxa, such as seabirds. Algoa Bay, South Africa, is a marine biodiversity hotspot, providing habitats for the largest populations of endangered African Penguins (Spheniscus demersus), as well as other endangered seabirds, cetaceans and seals. The bay is situated on a major shipping route and since 2016 has hosted the first offshore ship-to-ship (STS) bunkering operations in the country, i.e. the supplying of fuel from one ship to another outside of harbours. Using Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, we estimated noise emissions from vessels as a proxy for underwater ambient noise levels within the core penguin utilisation area. Frequency of vessels using the bay doubled during our study, with numbers of bulk carriers increasing ten-fold. Ambient underwater noise levels were generally high in the bay (ca 140 dB re 1 μPa since 2015) but significantly increased by 2 dB SPL after the initiation of STS bunkering in 2016, corresponding to double the underwater noise intensity. This increase coincided with a significant and dramatic decline by 85% in penguin numbers from St Croix Island since 2016. Algoa Bay is now one of the noisiest bays in the world. This is the first study to assess the potential impact of vessel-derived underwater noise levels on a seabird population. Penguins, like marine mammal species, are known to be sensitive to marine noise pollution and urgent management interventions are required to mitigate this recent disturbance, to preserve the remaining stronghold of the African penguin and the marine mammals' populations sharing the penguins' habitat. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Corneal confocal microscopy has not previously been performed in penguins, despite recognition of its unusually flat shape. To identify features that the penguin shares with other birds and or mammals and those specific to penguins, we undertook confocal microscopic examination of two little (Eudyptula minor), four gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) and five king (Aptenodytes patagonicus) penguin corneas. Transmission electron microscopy was performed on one gentoo and one king penguin, for finer details. Features shared with other higher vertebrates included a five-layered cornea and a similar limbus. Typically avian were a lower density of stromal cells, a more regular arrangement of collagen bands and an absent basal nerve plexus. Features unique to penguins included a flattened superficial epithelium (king penguin), stromal myofibroblasts (all) and an irregular endothelium (little penguin). Other features uniquely identified by confocal microscopy in birds include epithelial and stromal nerves, guttata and stromal imprints on Descemet’s membrane. Transmission electron microscopy identified a lack of wing cells (king penguin), greater posterior collagen lamellae thickness (gentoo penguin) and significantly less interlacing of collagen lamellae in the central cornea (king and gentoo). Most of these unique features are yet to be explained, but some could be adaptations to diving. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: An experiment involving alternating closures to pelagic fishing of the neighbourhoods around two pairs of nearby islands with breeding colonies of African penguins was initiated in South Africa in 2008, with the aim to determine the impact on penguin reproductive success. Based on their analyses of the experiment, Sydeman et al. (2021) assert that the closures reduce competition with fisheries on forage fish, and should be maintained. In contrast, based on analyses conducted in accordance with the recommendations of an international review panel, the South African Government's scientific committee responsible for overseeing and analysing the experiment conclude that when compared to the concerning decline over recent decades of some 5% pa in overall penguin abundance, the effect of maintaining such closures towards arresting that decline would at best be minimal. This Comment summarises the history of the experiment and associated analyses, and then points to a number of shortcomings of Sydeman et al. (2021), most seriously incorrect results from not adequately accounting for the effects of pseudoreplication. It is argued that the present priority is identifying the main factor(s) responsible for the penguin decline, since the experiment has shown that this is not fishing in the neighbourhood of penguin colonies.  © 2022 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The eco-evolutionary history of penguins is characterised by shifting from temperate to cold environments. Breeding in Antarctica, the Emperor penguin appears as an extreme outcome of this process, with unique features related to insulation, heat production and energy management. However, whether this species actually diverged from a less cold-adapted ancestor, more ecologically similar to its sister species, the King penguin, is still an open question. As the Antarctic colonisation likely resulted in vast changes in selective pressure experienced by the Emperor penguin, the relative quantification of the genomic signatures of selection, unique to each sister species, could answer this question. Applying phylogeny-based selection tests on 7651 orthologous genes, we identified a more pervasive selection shift in the Emperor penguin than in the King penguin, supporting the hypothesis that its extreme cold adaptation is a derived state. Furthermore, among candidate genes under selection, four (TRPM8, LEPR, CRB1, and SFI1) were identified before in other cold-adapted homeotherms, like the woolly Mammoth, while other 161 genes can be assigned to biological functions relevant to cold adaptation identified in previous studies. Location and structural effects of TRPM8 substitutions in Emperor and King penguin lineages support their functional role with putative divergent effects on thermal adaptation. We conclude that extreme cold adaptation in the Emperor penguin largely involved unique genetic options which, however, affect metabolic and physiological traits common to other cold-adapted homeotherms. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Genetics Society.

ABSTRACT: Penguins have evolved excellent swimming skills as diving birds, benefiting from their agile wings. This paper experimentally analyzes the effects of the wing sweepback angle on thrust generation using a robotic penguin wing. A developed wing mechanism that can realize penguin-like flapping and feathering motion was used for actuating five alternative wing models, with different sweepback angles ranging from 0° to 50°. Force measurements under a steady water flow were conducted for both fixed and flapping states for all wing models. The results showed that small sweepback angles of 30° or less in the fixed state caused a steep lift curve and a moderate sweepback angle of 30° produced the largest lift-to-drag ratio. In the flapping state, the smaller sweepback wings generated a larger net thrust for the same wing motion, whereas the larger-sweepback wings produced more thrust under the same Strouhal number. The findings also revealed that larger sweepback wings more easily achieve the maximum net thrust in terms of less angle-of-attack control. In contrast, the hydrodynamic efficiency was not greatly affected by the sweepback. Regardless of the sweepback, the trend of the efficiency increasing with increasing flow speed indicates that the penguin wings can be more suitable for high-speed locomotion for higher hydrodynamic efficiency. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The effects of fresh and spray-dried microalgal diets on the growth, digestive enzymatic activity, and gut microbial community were investigated in juveniles of the winged pearl oyster Pteria penguin. A total of 240 pearl oysters were fed either live or spray-dried unialgal diets of the species Isochrysis zhanjiangensis and Platymonas subcordiformis at a final concentration of 150,000 cells/mL. The experiment was performed over 28 days in triplicate feeding trials under laboratory conditions. At the end of the feeding trials, the hepatopancreas and gut tissue were dissected to quantify the digestive enzymatic activity and analyze the gut bacterial community. The survival rate of the oyster juveniles in all trials was > 90 %. Moreover, the animals fed a spray-dried P. subcordiformis diet exhibited slightly higher shell growth rates. However, the mean shell height and the total wet weight were not significantly different among all experimental groups (P > 0.05). The digestive enzymes amylase, pepsin, and lipase exhibited significantly higher activity levels in oysters fed spray-dried diets than in those provided live microalgae. The different diets also provoked changes in the gut microbiota of the pearl oysters. A total of 27 phyla and 482 genera were detected within all groups examined; the Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Spirochaetes were the dominant phyla. In general, spray-dried diets exhibited a higher number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), Chao1, and Simpson and Shannon indices, implying the ability of these diets to promote high microbial biodiversity. Thus, these diets benefitted the maintenance of the intestinal micro-ecological balance and health. The study findings will help optimize intermediate culture technology and management of P. penguin juveniles. © 2022 The Authors

ABSTRACT: This paper provides data on a newly discovered colony of Magellanic penguins Spheniscus magellanicus in the southwest Atlantic Ocean. A new settlement was found while conducting southern rockhopper penguin Eudyptes chrysocome studies in the San Juan de Salvamento colony in Staten Island, Argentina. The colony holds 88 breeding pairs. While the origin of the founders was unknown, it is possible that they came from the nearby Observatorio Island colony located ~ 20 km away. New colonies allow populations to expand and establish in new areas, which could allow a species to respond to changes in climate. Nonetheless, this expansion might be a detriment to other penguin species that already occupied the area. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: All 18 extant species of penguin are strongly countershaded, having dark dorsal and light ventral coloration. In this paper, the thermal effects of this body color in penguins are investigated through analytical and observational analyses. First, a thermal analysis that takes into account the environmental characteristics of penguins’ habitats, fluxes, and morphology is used to analytically calculate penguin dorsal surface temperature. Next, a turbulent analytical solution for a heated boundary layer over a flat plate is applied to show that the dark color on the top of the penguins’ bodies is very effective at skin drag reduction. To verify this result, a 2D model penguin is computationally analyzed at different temperatures, confirming in principle underwater skin drag reduction through color-based surface warming with efficiency savings of up to 30%. Finally, to study how color-based increases in body surface temperatures are maintained through foraging dives, thermal cameras are used to measure the surface temperature of captive penguins before and after dives. This study shows conceptually that dark dorsal coloration in penguins could have a significant influence on in-water drag. © 2022, Jilin University.

ABSTRACT: Guano extraction in Peru has caused significant impacts on the endangered Humboldt penguin (HUPE, Spheniscus humboldti) colonies. These impacts include HUPE distress, breeding avoidance, and abandonment of nests. Mitigation strategies to minimize the interaction between breeding penguins and guano extraction have been developed and applied since 2001 at Punta San Juan, one of the largest HUPE breeding areas. This study aims to determine the effects of the two most recent guano harvests at Punta San Juan (2012 and 2019) on HUPE breeding. We conducted three analyses to evaluate if such events altered the number of breeding attempts (i.e. nests) or the breeding temporality (i.e. phenology) of the study colony. First, using yearlong nest counts for 11 years (2008–2019), we assessed if extraction years present significant variation in nesting phenology and number of nests compared to non-extraction years. Second, during the 2012 and 2019 guano harvests, we evaluated differences in nesting phenology and the number of nests between sectors of the study colony, given their proximity to extraction activities. Finally, we used a GLM to estimate the relationship between sector distance to extraction areas and the number of active nests on a week-to-week resolution (as nest desertion proxy) during the extraction periods. Results showed no evidence of guano harvest impacts on our study species. However, downward trends in the overall population and irregular variation in HUPE breeding temporality in recent years might be masking possible 2019 harvest effects. While this case exemplifies how a balance between economic and conservation interests can be achieved, it also illustrates the necessity of identifying underlying factors of HUPE population decline and the need for long-term monitoring. © 2022 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Ambassador animals are part of many zoo programs, but studies assessing their impact on these animals are relatively rare. This study validated an excrement glucocorticoid metabolite (GCM) assay for Magellanic penguins and used GCM measures in conjunction with behavioral observations to evaluate individual responses to participation in an ambassador animal program. Excrement samples and behavioral observations were collected daily from each bird during two phases, 1 week during which it participated in a twice-daily ambassador program and 1 week in which it did not. We found no differences in GCMs between phases or in comparisons between penguins with 5 or 10 years of program experience. GCM also did not show significant individual variation and did not increase over time during the program phase. There were no significant correlations between bird experience and behavior frequencies, nor GCM concentrations and behavior, across birds. We observed significant positive correlations between the penguins' engagement with novel objects during programs and their unguided approach to guests. Our results suggest that there is no adverse physiological effect of program participation on these penguins, that behavioral and physiological responses may be decoupled, and that choice and control can increase desired behaviors behavior during ambassador programs. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT: The lumbosacral-canal system in birds most likely operates as a sense organ involved in the control of balanced walking and perching, but our knowledge of it is superficial. Penguins constitute interesting objects for the study of this system due to their upright walking, but only the Humboldt penguin, Spheniscus humboldti, and some incomplete fossil penguin synsacra have been studied in this respect. Here, we give an integrative comparative insight into the synsacral canal of extant Emperor penguin, Aptenodytes forsteri, Adelie penguin, Pygoscelis adeliae, and Eocene giant Anthropornis and/or Palaeeudyptes Antarctic penguins, using computed tomography imaging and associated data-extraction methodologies, complemented by analytical approaches ranging from geometric morphometrics to modularity, curvature, and wavelet analyses. We document that the variability in the number of synsacro-lumbar vertebrae is evolutionarily conserved, and all studied synsacra possess osteological correlates of the lumbosacral-canal system. We also found that Eocene and extant Antarctic penguins were separable on the basis of the main direction of the shape-related (size-independent) variability within said system, and A. forsteri was unique in the entire studied set in terms of the relative cranial shift of this compound structure. Moreover, we suggest that the evolutionary processes, shaping both the terrestrial posture and gait, were responsible, in extant penguins, for the increased simplicity and stability of the synsacral canal cross-sectional periodic patterns, as well as pave the way for the lumbosacral-canal system modularity characterized by reduced atomization/complexity. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Aspergillosis remains difficult to diagnose in animals. Laboratory-based assays are far less developed than those for human medicine, and only few studies have been completed to validate their utility in routine veterinary diagnostics. To overcome the current limitations, veterinarians and researchers have to propose alternative methods including extrapolating from human diagnostic tools and using innovative technology. In the present overview, two specific examples were complementarily addressed in penguins and dolphins to illustrate how is challenging the diagnosis of aspergillosis in animals. Specific focus will be made on the novel application of simple testing in blood based on serological assays or protein electrophoresis and on the new information garnered from metabolomics/proteomics to discover potential new biomarkers. In conclusion, while the diagnostic approach of aspergillosis in veterinary medicine cannot be directly taken from options developed for human medicine, it can certainly serve as inspiration.

ABSTRACT: Individual differences in oxygen storage and carrying capacity have been associated with fitness-related traits and, for air-breathing aquatic animals, to diving ability and foraging success. In winter, many seabirds must replenish the energy reserves they have depleted during the breeding period. Thus, winter foraging efficiency can influence their upcoming breeding behaviour. Using gentoo penguins Pygoscelis papua as a study species, we investigated (1) if inter-individual variation in diving efficiency (proportion of time spent at the bottom) is associated with indices of oxygen storage and carrying capacity (haemoglobin, haematocrit, body mass), and (2) if measures of pre-breeding foraging effort (mean trip duration, total time at sea, and vertical distance travelled) are associated with these oxygen indices and breeding status. Haemoglobin was positively correlated with diving efficiency, particularly for deeper dives, and only penguins with high haemoglobin levels frequently dove to depths ≥ 140 m. Such differences could affect resource access. However, because reaching deep offshore waters likely requires travelling more than foraging nearshore, vertical distance travelled during pre-breeding increased with haemoglobin levels. The relationship with haematocrit was non-linear, suggesting that commonly used analyses may be inappropriate for this index. We found that early-laying penguins spent less time at sea prior to nesting than non-breeding penguins, suggesting that more efficient foragers lay earlier. Given that diving efficiency at depth is linked to aerobic capacity, anthropogenic activities taking place in either nearshore or offshore waters (e.g. shallow-water fisheries, offshore oil rigs) may have differing impacts on individuals. Further understanding these links could help the conservation of diving species. © S.P.M.-T., G.T.C., P.B., P.T., T.D.W., M.A.-M., and Joint Nature Conservation Committee 2023.

ABSTRACT: With the extinction of yello-eyed penguins Megadyptes antipodes on mainland New Zealand predicted within the next few decades, identifying preventable causes of mortality during the juvenile dispersal period is critical. Between 2017 and 2019, we tracked 30 juvenile yellow-eyed penguins during their post-fledging dispersal to determine their dispersal trajectory, marine habitat use, and to identify overlap with commercial gillnet fishing operations, a known cause of yellow-eyed penguin mortality. Using k-nearest neighbour local convex hulls, we identified core foraging hotspots (50% isopleths) and main marine habitats (95% isopleths). We identified environmental covariates that influenced penguin habitat use during separate stages of the dispersal journey. After fledging, juvenile yellow-eyed penguins from the Otago coast dispersed and foraged 140 to 692 km (mean ± SD = 359.9 ± 129.3 km) from their natal locations, north-northeast into the Canterbury Bight, a region where penguin bycatch in commercial gillnet fishing operations has been recorded. There was a 51.6% overlap between core juvenile foraging hotspots and known commercial gillnet fishery locations (from 2017 to 2019). Less than 12.6% of the core foraging hotspots occurred within the 4 nautical mile gillnet prohibition zone implemented in 2008. A recent extension in the size of the gillnet prohibition zone in 2020 increased this spatial overlap to cover 36.9% of core foraging hotspots and 28.9% of main marine habitats. These findings highlight the vulnerability of juvenile yellow-eyed penguins at this critical life-stage, but there is opportunity to amalgamate marine protection measures with other endangered species with overlapping distributions that are also at risk of gillnet-related mortality.  © Inter-Research 2022.

ABSTRACT: Yellow-eyed penguins (Megadyptes antipodes), or hoiho in te reo Māori, are predicted to become extinct on mainland Aotearoa New Zealand in the next few decades, with infectious disease a significant contributor to their decline. A recent disease phenomenon termed respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) causing lung pathology has been identified in very young chicks. To date, no causative pathogens for RDS have been identified. In 2020 and 2021, the number of chick deaths from suspected RDS increased four- and five-fold, respectively, causing mass mortality with an estimated mortality rate of >90%. We aimed to identify possible pathogens responsible for RDS disease impacting these critically endangered yellow-eyed penguins. Total RNA was extracted from tissue samples collected during post-mortem of 43 dead chicks and subject to metatranscriptomic sequencing and histological examination. From these data we identified a novel and highly abundant gyrovirus (Anelloviridae) in 80% of tissue samples. This virus was most closely related to Gyrovirus 8 discovered in a diseased seabird, while other members of the genus Gyrovirus include Chicken anaemia virus, which causes severe disease in juvenile chickens. No other exogenous viral transcripts were identified in these tissues. Due to the high relative abundance of viral reads and its high prevalence in diseased animals, it is likely that this novel gyrovirus is associated with RDS in yellow-eyed penguin chicks. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: So far, little has been done on the motor and perceptual asymmetry in the genus Spheniscus, which on the contrary, has been the target of much research in the wild due to its vulnerable ecological condition. The present study aimed to investigate the presence of lateralization on different asymmetry dimensions in Humboldt penguins by studying fourteen subjects housed in a captive colony in Italy. For each individual, the preferred foot to start walking and climbing on a weighing scale, the preferred side to reach the uropygium, and the preferred eye to scrutinize visitors outside the exhibit were recorded. Asymmetry was found at the individual level for the preferred foot to climb onto the scale (three left and five right out of 14) and the preferred side to reach the preen gland (two left and five right out of 14). Only thirteen penguins were seen interacting with people outside the exhibit using their left (four) or right (three) eye while swimming in the pool. No lateralization could be documented at the population level. The lack of lateralization at the population level could be attributable to the small size of the colony studied, hampering speculations on the social life of S. humboldti. Since the requirement for coordinated behaviors at the population level occurs when social interactions become common and recurrent in the natural behavior of a species, and because only one among the items studied was devoted to the study of social behavior, it will be necessary to broaden the research to other captive S. humboldti populations to expand our results. Data obtained from a larger number of animals could unveil a little piece of the puzzle that will allow evaluating lateralization at the population level in this species and ascertain if the Evolutionarily Stable Strategy could also be applied to S. humboldti. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Avian malaria is an important cause of mortality in captive penguins housed in outdoor exhibits. Mefloquine was used as a prophylaxis to treat a colony of 19 Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) for avian malaria. A target dose of 30 mg/kg was obtained from anecdotal literature for sphenisciforms that was not based on pharmacokinetic or toxicity studies. For this reason, preliminary plasma concentrations of mefloquine were acquired after the first dose in some penguins to ensure that plasma concentrations reached human malaria prophylactic concentrations. Afterward, each penguin in the entire colony received mefloquine (26-31 mg/kg [125 mg in toto] PO q7d). Regurgitation was frequently observed starting after the fourth weekly administration. Plasma concentrations of mefloquine after the seventh dose showed elevated concentrations, and the treatment was immediately terminated. Eight penguins died during and after the treatment period. The first fatality occurred after the fifth weekly administration, and 7 birds died within 7-52 days after the seventh weekly administration. Three penguins were found dead without previous symptoms. The other five presented with marked lethargy, dyspnea, poor appetite, and vomiting, and all died despite medical care. The remaining 11 penguins of the colony survived without any supportive care; 5 did not exhibit any clinical disease signs, while the other 6 showed a mild apathy and decreased appetite. Mefloquine toxicity was highly suspected on the basis of clinical signs, the elevated mefloquine plasma concentrations, and no other underlying pathologic disease conditions identified through postmortem examinations. Nonspecific lesions, including pulmonary congestion and edema and hepatic perivascular hematopoiesis, were noted in the birds that died. Additionally, 1 case presented with myocarditis, and mycobacteria were observed within granulomas in the respiratory tract of 2 penguins. Caution is advised, and further studies are encouraged before administering mefloquine to penguins. © 2023 Association of Avian Veterinarians. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Introduction: In Antarctica, there is growing concern about the potential effect of anthropogenic activities (i.e., tourism, research) on wildlife, especially since human activities are developing at an unprecedented rate. Although guidelines exist to mitigate negative impacts, fundamental data are currently lacking to reliably assess impacts. Physiological tools, such as circulating corticosterone levels, appear promising to assess the potential impact of human disturbance on Antarctic vertebrates. Methods: In this study, we compared the body condition, and the physiological sensitivity to stress (i.e., basal and stress-induced corticosterone level) of adult and chick Adélie penguins between a disturbed and an undisturbed area (i.e., 2 colonies located in the middle of a research station exposed to intense human activities and 2 colonies located on protected islands with minimal human disturbance). Results: We did not find any significant impact of human activities on body condition and corticosterone levels in adults (incubating adults, brooding adults). In chicks, there were significant inter-colony variations in stress-induced corticosterone levels. Specifically, the chicks from the disturbed colonies tended to have higher stress-induced corticosterone levels than the chicks from the protected areas although this difference between areas was not significant. In addition, and independently of human disturbance we also found significant differences in adult body condition, and chick corticosterone level between colonies. Discussion: Overall, our study suggests that this species is not dramatically impacted by human activities, at least when humans and penguins have cohabited for several decades. Our results support therefore the idea that this species is likely to be tolerant to human disturbance and this corroborates with the persistence of Adélie penguin colonies in the middle of the research station. However, our results also suggest that chicks might be more sensitive to human disturbance than adults and might therefore potentially suffer from human disturbance. Our study also suggests that specific individual and environmental variables outweigh the potential minor impact of human disturbance on these variables. Combining corticosterone with complementary stress-related physiological markers, such as heart rate, may strengthen further studies examining whether human disturbance may have subtle detrimental impacts on individuals.

ABSTRACT: Understanding the mechanisms of site colonization and range expansion is crucial to understanding population dynamics, particularly for colonial seabirds that may struggle to shift their breeding ranges under climate change. We provide an alternative and simple approach to estimating the number of migrating individuals among colonies when original mark-recapture datasets are not available for use in more integrated and established methods. Here we fit an age-structured population model with published vital rates and breeding success rates to simple point counts of abundance using rejection-based approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to estimate the contribution of immigration to four recently colonized Gentoo Penguin (Pygoscelis papua) breeding sites on the Western Antarctic Peninsula. We found that sustained immigration over several years was required to generate the rapid population growth observed, with some sites even showing evidence of an accelerating immigration rate following initial colonization. We demonstrate that our method is capable of estimating the contribution of immigration to population growth in a species where mark-recapture datasets are unavailable. By leveraging census data that are relatively easy to obtain, our approach provides a new method for understanding how range expansions occur in species such as Antarctic penguins whose habitat is undergoing changing climate conditions.

ABSTRACT: A taxonomic study was conducted on 16 bacterial strains isolated from wild Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) from Seymour (Marambio) Island and James Ross Island. An initial screening by repetitive sequence-based PCR fingerprinting divided the strains studied into four coherent groups. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences assigned all groups to the genus Corynebacterium and showed that Corynebacterium glyciniphilum and Corynebacterium terpenotabidum were the closest species with 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities between 95.4 % and 96.5 %. Further examination of the strains studied with ribotyping, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, comprehensive biotyping and calculation of average nucleotide identity and digital DNA–DNA hybridisation values confirmed the separation of the four groups from each other and from the other Corynebacterium species. Chemotaxonomically, the four strains P5828T, P5850T, P6136T, P7210T representing the studied groups were characterised by C16:0 and C18:1 ω9c as the major fatty acids, by the presence of meso-diaminopimelic acid in the peptidoglycan, the presence of corynemycolic acids and a quinone system with the predominant menaquinone MK-9(H2). The results of this study show that the strains studied represent four new species of the genus Corynebacterium, for which the names Corynebacterium antarcticum sp. nov. (type strain P5850T = CCM 8835T = LMG 30620T), Corynebacterium marambiense sp. nov. (type strain P5828T = CCM 8864T = LMG 31626T), Corynebacterium meridianum sp. nov. (type strain P6136T = CCM 8863T = LMG 31628T) and Corynebacterium pygosceleis sp. nov. (type strain P7210T = CCM 8836T = LMG 30621T) are proposed. © 2022

ABSTRACT: The presence of unsupervised dogs in urban areas close to sites of high natural value can have ne-gative effects on wildlife. On the Patagonian coast, where cities are often surrounded by natural environments, this problem may affect seabird colonies. Two islands with Magellanic Penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) colonies belonging to a protected area neighboring Puerto Deseado, Santa Cruz, suffered attacks by unsupervised dogs. In 2016 and 2022, several dogs reached these islands during low tides and attacked penguins. At Isla Quiroga, 421 penguins died in 2016, causing a decrease of 21.4% in its population. At Isla Quinta, 30 individuals died in 2016 and 32 in 2022, representing in both cases almost 100% of the colony. These are the first records of attacks since we are monitoring these colonies (>30 years). The growth of coastal cities is constant and these events could be-come more frequent and affect more species of seabirds. The control of unsupervised dogs in natural areas near coastal developments is a challenge that government entities should respond to in the short term. © 2022, Aves Argentinas - Asociacion Ornitologica del Plata.

ABSTRACT: Penguins are known to react to underwater noise, but it is unknown if they make use of sound cues while diving. We tested whether captive gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) can pair underwater sounds with food through Pavlovian conditioning. Two seconds after an underwater sound (a 1-4 kHz sweep with a received level of 130 dB re 1 µPa RMS) was played back to one or two unidentifiable penguins, a dead fish was flushed into the water close to the underwater sound source. After 8 weeks of conditioning, one or more individual penguins approached the sound source after sound emission in 78.3% out of 230 trials. In 43 intermixed control trials with no sound preceding the fish, the penguins did not show any reaction in the pre-flush period. In an additional experiment, three identified penguins reacted to the sound in 66.7-100% out of 30 trials, with 0% reactions in five intermixed control trials. Our experiments demonstrate that gentoo penguins can be conditioned to underwater sound and that they associate underwater sounds with food. It is possible that gentoos, as well as other species of penguins, use sound cues while foraging. This may explain why penguins have been observed to react negatively to anthropogenic noise. © 2022.

ABSTRACT: Central place foragers such as pelagic seabirds often travel large distances to reach profitable foraging areas. King penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) are well known for their large-scale foraging movements to the productive Antarctic Polar Front, though their fine-scale travelling and foraging characteristics remain unclear. Here, we investigated the horizontal movements and foraging patterns of king penguins to understand their fine-scale movement decisions during distant foraging trips. We attached multi-channel data loggers that can record depth, speed, tri-axis acceleration, tri-axis magnetism, and environmental temperature of the penguins and obtained data (n = 8 birds) on their horizontal movement rates from reconstructed dive paths and their feeding attempts estimated from rapid changes in swim speed. During transit toward main foraging areas, penguins increased the time spent on shallow travelling dives (< 50 m) at night and around midday, and increased the time spent on deep foraging dives (≥ 50 m) during crepuscular hours. The horizontal movement rates during deep dives were negatively correlated with maximum dive depths, suggesting that foraging at greater depths is associated with a decreased horizontal travelling speed. Penguins concentrated their foraging efforts (more deep dives and higher rates of feeding attempts) at twilight during transit, when prey may be more accessible due to diel vertical migration, while they travelled rapidly at night and midday when prey may be difficult to detect and access. Such behavioural adjustments correspond to a movement strategy adopted by avian deep divers to travel long distances while feeding on prey exhibiting diel vertical migration. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Intraspecific competition for food resources has the potential to be high for central-place foragers such as penguins and can result in spatial and dietary foraging niche segregation among individuals of the same species. We sampled adults, chicks, and juvenile individuals’ whole blood from three colonies of Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) from Tierra del Fuego along an inshore-offshore corridor. We analyzed the isotopic niche, the trophic position and the diet composition in penguins to investigate intraspecific trophic niche variation in relation to biological (age of individuals) and external factors (foraging habitats, colony location) using carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) stable isotope values. We found isotopic niche segregation between age classes within each colony. When comparing across colonies, only juvenile exhibited some degree of isotopic niche overlap among colonies. In addition, at all three colonies juveniles had the largest isotopic niches with relatively higher variation in δ13C values. All individuals consumed low trophic position (TP) prey items such as the pelagic form of Munida gregaria based on stable isotope mixing model results. Adults and juveniles incorporated high TP (silverside and nototheniids) prey items into their diets, except for juveniles from Martillo Island whose proportions mirror chicks’ values. These results denote that parents consumed different prey items for themselves than for their chicks. Intraspecific trophic niche partitioning between colonies showed a decreasing δ13C and δ15N values from the nearest inshore colony relative to the farther offshore colonies. Understanding within and between colonies foraging strategies are important to set up connectivity between populations, status of the different colonies, and to develop adequate conservation actions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Wildlife tourism is increasing worldwide and monitoring the impact of tourism on wild populations is of the utmost importance for species conservation. The Magellanic penguin Spheniscus magellanicus colony at Martillo Island, Argentina, was studied in the 2016-2020 breeding seasons. In all seasons, adults and chicks belonged to: (i) an area close to or within the tourist trail or (ii) an area far from the tourist trail and out of sight of the tourists. Blood samples were taken for carbon and nitrogen stable isotope composition, in order to estimate trophic niches, and for smears that were made in situ and were then stained in the laboratory where leucocyte counts and differentiation were made under optical microscope. Heterophil to lymphocyte ratios were used as proxies of stress. Repeated sampling showed individual stress levels reduced while wintering. In 2017, stress levels and trophic values were lower than 2018 for the same individuals. Trophic levels did not differ between tourism and no tourism areas within each season, and differed between 2017 and the remaining seasons, indicating a possible diet shift that year. Stress levels were higher for the tourism area than the no tourism area for adults and chicks in all years except for 2020, when stress levels in the tourism area were lower and similar to the no tourism area that year and previous years. Vessel transit within the Beagle Channel and tourist visitation to the penguin colony was greatly reduced in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. A combination of internal characteristics and external factors may be affecting the stress physiology of individuals. Therefore, future research should include sampling of multiple aspects of penguin physiology, behaviour and environmental context in order to evaluate each effect on Magellanic penguin stress and, ultimately, inform the conservation of this iconic species in time.  © The Author(s) 2023.

ABSTRACT: The mouths and anuses of Penguins house complex microflora, which play important roles in growth and development. In this study, 6,391,065 sequences were detected from the oral and anal microflora of gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) penguins, with Firmicutes and Proteobacteria dominating the oral and anus samples from female gentoo penguins, respectively, while in males, Proteobacteria dominated the oral samples and Firmicutes dominated the anus samples. In addition, we provide the first demonstration that the dominant oral and anal microflora of P. papua (notably Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteriodetes) exhibit a diel rhythm. Given that the status of penguin populations remains an issue of environmental and conservation concern, our work provides important insight into the health of this penguin species by focusing on the diversity, diel rhythms, and dynamics of dominant intestinal microflora, further offering useful reference materials for future studies on the diel interactions between microflora and the penguin host. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Influenza A viruses infect a range of host species, including a large variety of mammals and more than a hundred species of birds. A total of 95 avian fecal samples were collected from penguin colonies in the South Shetland Islands, close to the Antarctic Peninsula, and tested by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) to detect avian influenza viruses (AIVs). Five out of seven samples collected from Penguin Island were positive for AIVs. Analysis of the genomes recovered from four samples revealed the detection of influenza A(H11N2) virus in fecal samples from Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) and from a colony of chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarcticus). Bayesian phylogeographic analysis revealed the clustering of all currently available H11N2 samples from Antarctica’s avifauna in a single cluster that emerged at least in the early 2010s, suggesting its continued circulation on the continent. Our results reinforce the need for continuous surveillance of avian influenza on the Antarctic continent. IMPORTANCE Although wild birds play a role in the transmission and ecology of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) across the globe, there are significant gaps in our understanding of the worldwide distribution of these viruses in polar environments. In this study, using molecular analysis and full-genome sequencing, we describe the detection of distinct influenza A(H11N2) viruses in fecal samples of penguins in the Southern Shetland Islands, Antarctica. We emphasize the need for virus monitoring as AIVs may have implications for the health of endemic fauna and the potential risk of the introduction of highly pathogenic AIVs to the continent.

ABSTRACT: Understanding how predator foraging behaviour is influenced by the distribution and abundance of prey is a fundamental challenge in marine foraging ecology. This is particularly relevant in Southern Ocean ecosystems where the relationships between select predator species and Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) can inform ecosystem conservation and precautionary fisheries management. In this study, we examine the spatial associations between krill swarm characteristics and Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) foraging effort at Béchervaise Island, a long-term monitoring site in East Antarctica. Spatially integrating two years of regional-scale krill acoustic data with contemporaneous horizontal and vertical movement information from chick-rearing adult Adélie penguins, we assessed how penguin foraging effort changed in relation to krill swarm abundance and distribution across the survey area. Our findings show that penguin diving effort was focused in areas with a high number of krill swarms, yet they did not focus their effort in areas with high krill biomass. These results suggest the spatial organisation of Adélie penguin foraging effort can provide an indication of krill presence (and/or availability) but may not reflect krill abundance. We discuss our results in the context of penguin foraging strategies, capturing single krill within the water column rather than the engulfment feeding strategy of larger marine mammals such as whales. Our work substantially improves understanding of penguin-krill dynamics in East Antarctica and provides a greater level of nuance regarding the utility of Adélie penguins as indicator species under CCAMLR’s Ecosystem Monitoring Programme (CEMP). Understanding these predator-prey linkages will become increasingly important for managing any expanding krill fisheries in the region or changes in the prey field under future climate change scenarios. Thus, our results can be interpreted alongside other ecological indicators to support management of the East Antarctic sector of the Southern Ocean ecosystem.

ABSTRACT: This paper provides the first evidence of debris pollution, including plastic, in juvenile Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) found stranded on the Atlantic coast of southern Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. Macro-, meso- and microparticles of anthropogenic origin were observed in 100 % of the studied birds, with debris abundance ranging between 33 and 200 items/bird. Microparticles represented 91 % of the total debris and 97 % of them were fibers. Black particles were the most abundant (30 %), followed by transparent (26 %), blue (14 %), yellow (10.3 %), and red (10 %). Infrared and Raman spectroscopy identified 62.7 % of the total particles as plastics, with polypropylene (27.8 %) and polyester (21.6 %) being the most abundant polymers. Semi-synthetic cellulosic fibers, metallic particles, and pigments were also found. The presence of metallic microparticles was suggested for the first time in penguins. Stranded juvenile Magellanic penguins are proposed as promising bioindicators of plastic pollution in the South Atlantic. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Strain I-SCBP12nT, a novel Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, non-spore-forming, motile-by-gliding and rod-shaped bacterium, was isolated from a chinstrap penguin chick (Pygoscelis antarcticus) during a 2015 expedition to the Chilean Antarctic territory. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing confirmed that strain I-SCBP12nT belonged to the genus Flavobacte-rium, being closely related to strains Flavobacterium chryseum P3160T (98.52 %), Flavobacterium hercynium WB 4.2-33T (98.47 %) and Flavobacterium chilense LM-19-FpT (98.47 %). The genome size of strain I-SCBP12nT was 3.69 Mb with DNA G+C content 31.95 mol%. Genomic comparisons of strain I-SCBP12nT with type species in the genus Flavobacterium were performed, with obtained average values near 75.17 and 84.33 % for the blast and MUMer analyses of average nucleotide identity, respectively, and 0.86 for the tetranucleotides frequency analysis. These values are far from the accepted species cut-off values. Strain I-SCBP12nT contained MK-6 as the predominant menaquinone and the major polar lipids were aminophospholipid, an unidentified aminolipid and unidentified lipids. The predominant fatty acids (> 5 %) were iso-C14: 0, iso-C15: 0, anteiso-C15: 0, iso-C16: 0, iso-C16: 1, iso-C16: 0 3-OH, C15: 1 ω6c and summed feature 3 (C16: 1 ω7c/C16: 1 ω6c). Phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and genomic data supported the assignment of strain I-SCBP12nT (=CECT 30404T=RGM 3223T) to a novel species of Flavobacterium, for which the name Fla-vobacterium pygoscelis sp. nov.is proposed. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The African penguin Spheniscus demersus, endemic to the coast of southern Africa, has suffered anthropogenic-driven population declines since 1900 and is now listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. Conservation efforts currently underway are informed by the species’ adaptive response with respect to colonisation capacity and breeding success, vulnerability because of anthropogenic competition for prey species, and global climate change. Here, we show how the available nesting habitat of African penguins likely declined precipitously post the Last Glacial Maximum, driven by island inundation as sea levels rose naturally, before anthropogenic global warming. The average size and numbers of islands around the southern African coast decreased almost tenfold between ∼15 kya and the mid Holocene (∼7 kya). In addition, the geographic distribution of islands shifted predominantly away from the South African west to the south and east coasts. The natural decline of island habitat likely caused a decline in the penguin population, which is likely relevant in current assessments of the vulnerability of this species to novel anthropogenic drivers of population decline. The status of the African penguin as a post-Pleistocene refugial species has amplified its extinction risk due to anthropogenic impacts, despite natural resilience to paleoclimatic change afforded by an apparent capacity for habitat colonisation and evident persistence through late-Pleistocene bottlenecks. © 2023 NISC (Pty) Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Bilateral blindness is an important cause of mortality in penguin chicks. However, this pathological condition remains little explored for the endangered Humboldt Penguin Spheniscus humboldti. Here, we present the first spatiotemporal dataset detailing young Humboldt Penguins having bilateral blindness. Information was gathered from birds found stranded along the coast of continental Chile over a ten-year (2011– 2021) period. We present a number of cases analyzed by geographical distribution, sex, body mass, and season. Preliminary analysis shows that 73.3% of cases were concentrated along Chile’s central coast. Only 17.1% of individuals were sexed, and the distribution was slightly skewed in favor of males. Two temporal peaks were identified (2015 and 2019) in which slight decreases in body mass were observed. The highest incidence occurred in summer. This dataset will contribute to the understanding of the spatiotemporal mechanisms associated with bilateral blindness in Humboldt Penguins, a condition that can be related to pollution, climatic, and conservation issues. © 2023, Marine Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: Penguins are sentinel species for marine pollution, but their role as potential biovectors of REEs or TEs to ecosystems has been poorly studied. The present study analyzed (ICP-MS) feathers of young and adult Gentoo penguins from Fildes Bay, for 63 elements (including 15 REEs). Most of the REEs were present at very low levels, ranging from 0.002 (Lu) to 0.452 (Sm) μg g−1 d.w., several orders of magnitude lower than TEs. The content of TEs varied widely, with Al, Fe, Zn, Sr, Ba, Ti and Mn as the seven having the highest concentrations in the feathers of both age groups. The results show that P. papua deposits REEs and TEs through the feathers on the penguin rockery, whose potential actual impacts and long-term fate in remote regions need deeper research. This work presents essential baseline data that will be useful for further studies on Antarctic penguins. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Macquarie Island’s king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus) population has changed dramatically over recent centuries. Following near decimation from commercial exploitation during the 19th and early 20th centuries, chick numbers increased rapidly from 1930–1980. Since then, the population’s trajectory has remained unreported, and environmental factors potentially influencing the population are poorly understood. From 2007–2020, king penguin chicks were censused annually. Chick numbers fluctuated between years, ranging from 33,513–78,714. Overall, the numbers decreased at 1.06 ± 0.03% per annum. While further studies are required to infer causality, annual chick numbers were negatively correlated with environmental conditions on land and at sea. Heavy rainfall, total rainfall, and maximum east coast wave height during incubation correlated with fewer chicks that year. Warmer sea surface temperatures in the foraging region of adult king penguins during incubation and early chick-rearing also correlated with lower chick numbers. While interannual variability and the long generation time of king penguins makes it unclear if the decrease in chick numbers represent a decrease in the breeding population, it is clear the late 20th century rapid increase in Macquarie Island’s breeding population has ceased. Ongoing monitoring will establish if this is indicative of the population stabilising or an ongoing population decline. © The Author(s) 2022.

ABSTRACT: Wildlife populations are dynamic and changes in their spatial distribution and/or abundance at different locations may potentially change the scenarios under which conservation efforts should be allocated. To maximize success in management and/or conservation actions, regular monitoring and dynamic frameworks to re-adapt strategies are needed. Fluctuations in the size of penguin populations and shifts in the distribution pattern may reflect the combination of natural and anthropogenic alterations in their marine and coastal habitats where they forage and breed, respectively. This study updates information on the breeding distribution of Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) and their abundance along 1,200 km of coastline along its northernmost Atlantic breeding range, allowing to assess population trends at the colony level and to compare the status of the overall population at the regional scale. A total population of 643,070 pairs was estimated at 30 colonies, most of which were located on islands (70%). Colony size was highly variable, from 3 to 204,416 breeding pairs. Results show a clear northward redistribution with new recent settlements expanding the breeding range by 1° latitude. The overall breeding population in this coastal sector increased by about 19.7% (CI 10.7%–29.72%) from the mid-1990s to the 2015–2017 period. Growth rates varied among coastal sectors, but most colonies in the northernmost area (Rio Negro and northern Chubut) had consistently high rates of increase, while colonies in central and southern Chubut declined or remained relatively stable. Our results reflect the status of Magellanic penguins for over half of their global population and show considerable changes in their breeding distribution in a relatively short time. This dynamic scenario generates new conservation challenges, highlighting the importance of long-term monitoring and the need for coordination between resource managers of the different jurisdictions where Magellanic penguins breed. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: In long-lived species, reproductive skipping is a common strategy whereby sexually mature animals skip a breeding season, potentially reducing population growth. This may be an adaptive decision to protect survival, or a non-adaptive decision driven by individual-specific constraints. Understanding the presence and drivers of reproductive skipping behavior can be important for effective population management, yet in many species such as the endangered African penguin (Spheniscus demersus), these factors remain unknown. This study uses multistate mark-recapture methods to estimate African penguin survival and breeding probabilities at two colonies between 2013 and 2020. Overall, survival (mean ± SE) was higher at Stony Point (0.82 ± 0.01) than at Robben Island (0.77 ± 0.02). Inter-colony differences were linked to food availability; under decreasing sardine (Sardinops sagax) abundance, survival decreased at Robben Island and increased at Stony Point. Additionally, reproductive skipping was evident across both colonies; at Robben Island the probability of a breeder becoming a nonbreeder was ~0.22, versus ~0.1 at Stony Point. Penguins skipping reproduction had a lower probability of future breeding than breeding individuals; this lack of adaptive benefit suggests reproductive skipping is driven by individual-specific constraints. Lower survival and breeding propensity at Robben Island places this colony in greater need of conservation action. However, further research on the drivers of inter-colony differences is needed. © 2022 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Seabirds coexist within colonies yet the role of conspecifics, whilst foraging is still poorly understood. In the 2019/20 and 2020/21 breeding seasons Magellanic penguins Spheniscus magellanicus and Gentoo penguins Pygoscelis papua were equipped with video loggers and GPS devices (n = 3 and n = 2, respectively) or only GPS devices (n = 11 and n = 2) at Martillo Island (54°54′ S, 67°23′ W), Argentina and compared with GPS tracks from previous seasons (2014, 2015 and 2017). Magellanic penguins transited in groups with conspecifics to the feeding grounds (up to 13 individuals were recorded simultaneously) in search of pelagic Fuegian sprat Sprattus fuegensis, but then were not filmed in close company of conspecifics during prey capture. Gentoo penguins generally fed on Nototheniid sp. at the seafloor. Contrary to predictions, Gentoo penguins foraged with conspecifics in small groups of 2–4 individuals, they coordinated to dive down, search and ambush prey. Gentoo penguins were also recorded foraging pelagically on Fuegian sprat. Conspecifics play an important role either during the initial search for prey patches, particularly when searching for elusive pelagic prey or during the small-scale search and hunt for benthic prey hidden in the seafloor substrate. The presence of conspecifics seems to be important during foraging for Magellanic and Gentoo penguins and this may be reflecting a positive aspect of coloniality. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The family Chlamydiaceae is comprised of obligate intracellular bacteria, some of which are significant pathogens of humans and domestic animals. Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) are susceptible to Chlamydia psittaci outbreaks in captivity, and serological surveys detected antibodies against C. psittaci (or antigenically similar organisms) in wild populations of this species. To investigate the occurrence of Chlamydiaceae in wild Magellanic penguins, 167 cloacal swabs were collected from apparently healthy individuals at four breeding colonies along the coast of Chubut, Argentina. Real-time PCR revealed the presence of DNA from Chlamydiaceae-like bacteria in 61 cloacal swabs (36.5%). Detection did not correlate to nutritional status or to meaningful hematological abnormalities. Isolation in monkey kidney cells was unsuccessful, but DNA sequences for the 16S–23S rRNA region were obtained from one sample. Phylogenetic analysis showed a close relationship to unidentified Chlamydiaceae-like bacteria found in chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarcticus) in Antarctica and seagulls in France and the Bering Sea, and to Chlamydiifrater spp. isolated from flamingos in France. Further studies are necessary to clarify the taxonomy and investigate the epidemiology, pathogenicity, and zoonotic potential of this group of Chlamydiaceae-like bacteria. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Investigating the ecology of a species and the spatial requirements needed for their survival within an environment can improve and help develop conservation measures. In this study, we reviewed the literature describing the importance of fine-scale landscape characteristics on the distribution of penguin species. We then investigated little penguin nest-site use across eleven colonies in South Australia, with a focus on nest type, vegetation cover, nest entrance orientation, proximity to the nearest active nest, and side of the island. We showed that both abiotic and biotic variables were important for nest-site use in penguins and that the specific variables varied between species and populations. Little penguins in South Australia did not appear to use nest sites randomly, and active nests were mostly found on the northern side of the island and facing east or west. Our study highlights the importance of gaining a better understanding of penguin nest-site use, and their fitness consequences for populations, to ensure effective conservation outcomes. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Microplastic (<5 mm; MP) pollution has been an emerging threat for marine ecosystems around the globe with increasing evidence that even the world's most remote areas, including Antarctica, are no longer unaffected. Few studies however, have examined MP in Antarctic biota, and especially those from Antarctic regions with low human activity, meaning little is known about the extent to which biota are affected. The aim of this study was to investigate, for the first time, the occurrence of MP in the emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri), the only penguin species breeding around Antarctica during the austral winter, and an endemic apex predator in the Southern Ocean. To assess MP ingestion, the gizzards of 41 emperor penguin chicks from Atka Bay colony (Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica), were dissected and analyzed for MP >500 μm using Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier-transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. A total of 85 putative particles, mostly in the shape of fibers (65.9 %), were sorted. However, none of the particles were identified as MP applying state-of-the-art methodology. Sorted fibers were further evidenced to originate from contamination during sample processing and analyses. We find that MP concentrations in the local food web of the Weddell Sea and Dronning Maud Land coastal and marginal sea-ice regions; the feeding grounds to chick-rearing emperor penguin adults, are currently at such low levels that no detectable biomagnification is occurring via trophic transfer. Being in contrast to MP studies on other Antarctic and sub-Antarctic penguin species, our comparative discussion including these studies, highlights the importance for standardized procedures for sampling, sample processing and analyses to obtain comparable results. We further discuss other stomach contents and their potential role for MP detection, as well as providing a baseline for the long-term monitoring of MP in apex predator species from this region. © 2022

ABSTRACT: Trace elements, particularly rare earth elements (REE), are widely used as proxies to reconstruct paleoenvironmental and taphonomic conditions. We traced these elements in fossil penguin bones collected along the Paleogene sequence exposed in Seymour Island (=Isla Marambio) to test them as indicators of the tectonic changes to which this region was exposed. The results indicated the contents of REE in thirteen samples of the analyzed bone tissues. The negative europium anomaly in the samples from Bartonian and Priabonian beds reflects regional events. This signal coincides in time with the opening of the Drake Passage, and with the tectonic changes that occurred between the end of the Eocene and the beginning of the Oligocene, between the western margin of South America and the Antarctic Peninsula. © 2023 Pérez, Acosta Hospitaleche, Gómez-Peral, Gómez Dacal, Reguero, Poiré & Cavarozzi | CC BY-NC 4.0 | Acceso Abierto - Open Access.

ABSTRACT: Penguins perform lift-based swimming by flapping their wings. Previous kinematic and hydrodynamic studies have revealed the basics of wing motion and force generation in penguins. Although these studies have focused on steady forward swimming, the mechanism of turning manoeuvres is not well understood. In this study, we examined the horizontal turning of penguins via 3D motion analysis and quasi-steady hydrodynamic analysis. Free swimming of gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) at an aquarium was recorded, and body and wing kinematics were analysed. In addition, quasi-steady calculations of the forces generated by the wings were performed. Among the selected horizontal swimming manoeuvres, turning was distinguished from straight swimming by the body trajectory for each wingbeat. During the turns, the penguins maintained outward banking through a wingbeat cycle and utilized a ventral force during the upstroke as a centripetal force to turn. Within a single wingbeat during the turns, changes in the body heading and bearing also mainly occurred during the upstroke, while the subsequent downstroke accelerated the body forward. We also found contralateral differences in the wing motion, i.e. the inside wing of the turn became more elevated and pronated. Quasi-steady calculations of the wing force confirmed that the asymmetry of the wing motion contributes to the generation of the centripetal force during the upstroke and the forward force during the downstroke. The results of this study demonstrate that the hydrodynamic force of flapping wings, in conjunction with body banking, is actively involved in the mechanism of turning manoeuvres in penguins. © 2022.

ABSTRACT: Within the Southern Ocean, the greatest warming is occurring on the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) where clear cryospheric and biological consequences are being observed. Antarctic coastal systems harbour a high diversity of marine and terrestrial ecosystems heavily influenced by Antarctic seaweeds (benthonic macroalgae) and bird colonies (mainly penguins). Primary sea spray aerosols (SSA) formed by the outburst of bubbles via the sea-surface microlayer depend on the organic composition of the sea water surface. In order to gain insight into the influence of ocean biology and biogeochemistry on atmospheric aerosol, we performed in situ laboratory aerosol bubble chamber experiments to study the effect of different leachates of biogenic material - obtained from common Antarctic seaweeds as well as penguin guano - on primary SSA. The addition of different leachate materials on a seawater sample showed a dichotomous effect depending on the leachate material added - either suppressing (up to 52%) or enhancing (22–88%) aerosol particle production. We found high ice nucleating particle number concentrations resulting from addition of guano leachate material. Given the evolution of upper marine polar coastal ecosystems in the AP, further studies on ocean-atmosphere coupling are needed in order to represent the currently poorly understood climate feedback processes. © 2022 The Authors

ABSTRACT: King penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) are colonial seabirds presenting an extraordinary breeding cycle. Parents take over 14 months to raise a single chick to independence, upon which fledglings depart at sea for more than a year. Juveniles often return to the colony within the three austral summers following departure, and before the age of first reproduction (around 5-6 years old), possibly to acquire the essential skills involved in breeding. Little to nothing is known on the acquisition of parental behaviour. Here, we report an anecdotal, yet highly unusual, observation of chick-chick feeding behaviour in this species. The behaviour is highly unusual in that two non-sibling chicks, not yet independent, and hatched at different times (early and late) of the same breeding season were observed, the older chick feeding the younger one. Whereas alloparental feeding is known to occur in this species, this is the first reported observation of a chick-chick feeding event. This unusual behaviour raises the question of whether the early social environment plays a role in the acquisition of essential parenting skills in this species.  © 2023 Anne Cillard et al.

ABSTRACT: This note reports observations of two moulting emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) on Horseshoe Island, West Antarctica, during the Seventh Turkish Antarctic Expedition in February 2023. This is the first time this species has been documented on this island. Emperor penguins largely depend on fast-ice to breed and moult. The Antarctic Peninsula hosts few emperor penguin colo-nies. Horseshoe Island has become one of the northernmost points along the western Antarctic Peninsula where emperor penguins are documented to moult. © 2023, Norwegian Polar Institute.

ABSTRACT: Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is an effective method for bioacoustic researches. With the emergence of autonomous recording units (ARUs) and development of acoustic signal recognizer, PAM has been widely used in researches on conservation and ecology. However, challenges (e.g. extreme weather conditions) still remain in estimating species or population abundance based on acoustic monitoring. Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) has been regarded as an ecological indicator in the Southern Ocean, and its population dynamics has ecological significance. We assessed the ability of an acoustic index, vocal activity rate (VAR), to estimate population size of Adélie penguin chicks on Inexpressible Island, Ross Sea, using acoustic data collected via ARUs. Linear mixed model analysis showed that VAR had a significant correlation with the abundance of penguin chicks and wind speed (conditional R2 = 0.743). This demonstrated that VAR could be effectively applied in assessing the population size of Adélie penguin chicks with wind speed being considered, affirming the effectiveness of PAM in monitoring the population dynamics of vocal species in extreme-climate regions. © 2022

ABSTRACT: Breeding success is often correlated with climate, but the underlying bottom-up mechanisms remain elusive—particularly in marine environments. Consequently, conservation plans of many species often consider climate change as a unilateral threat, ignoring that even nearby populations can show contradicting trends with climate. Better understanding the relationship between climate and environment at different scales can help us interpret local differences in population trends, ultimately providing better tools to evaluate the global response of a species to threats such as global warming. We studied a growing king penguin population nesting at Kerguelen island (Southern Indian Ocean), hosting one of the largest colonies in the world. We used a unique dataset of foraging, breeding success, and climate data spanning over 25 years to examine the links between climate, marine environment, and breeding success at this colony. The results were then compared to the neighboring population of Crozet, which experienced the steepest decline for this species over the past few decades. At Crozet, penguins experienced lower breeding success in warmer years due to productive currents shifting away from the colony, affecting foraging behavior during chick rearing. At Kerguelen, while chick mass and survival experienced extreme variation from year to year, the annual variation was not associated with the position of the currents, which varied very little compared to the situation in Crozet. Rather than being affected by prey distribution shifts, we found evidence that chick provisioning in Kerguelen might be influenced by prey abundance, which seem to rather increase in warmer conditions. Furthermore, warmer air temperature in winter increased chick survival rate, likely due to reduced thermoregulation cost. Investigating the mechanisms between climate and fitness allowed us to predict two different fates for these populations regarding ongoing global warming. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: We present a response to Butterworth and Ross-Gillespie's (2022) comment on our perspectives on how forage fish fisheries are impacting the endangered African penguin (Sphenicus demersus), and corresponding management options. Butterworth and Ross-Gillespie overstate model uncertainties and downplay the clear ecological and conservation significance of the fisheries closure experiment. We demonstrate that their criticism of "pseudo-replication"is weak, and not in line with their own analyses nor with the interpretations of many international scientific review panels commissioned by the government of South Africa to evaluate experimental results. Their comment does not alter our fundamental conclusions that forage fisheries operating near penguin breeding colonies compete with the birds for food resources, are detrimental to the penguin's population health, and are impeding recovery. Given that sardines are depleted (DFFE, 2021) and the African penguin is approaching a conservation crisis, we reiterate our position that continuing the precautionary approach of closures at the local scale of central-place foraging penguins is warranted to facilitate their population growth under fisheries management goals to conserve and maintain ecosystem functions.  © 2022 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

ABSTRACT: The ability to vary the characteristics of one's voice is a critical feature of human communication. Understanding whether and how animals change their calls will provide insights into the evolution of language. We asked to what extent the vocalizations of penguins, a phylogenetically distant species from those capable of explicit vocal learning, are flexible and responsive to their social environment. Using a principal components (PCs) analysis, we reduced 14 vocal parameters of penguin's contact calls to four PCs, each comprising highly correlated parameters and which can be categorized as fundamental frequency, formant frequency, frequency modulation, and amplitude modulation rate and duration. We compared how these differed between individuals with varying degrees of social interactions: same-colony versus different-colony, same colony over 3 years and partners versus non-partners. Our analyses indicate that the more penguins experience each other's calls, the more similar their calls become over time, that vocal convergence requires a long time and relative stability in colony membership, and that partners' unique social bond may affect vocal convergence differently than non-partners. Our results suggest that this implicit form of vocal plasticity is perhaps more widespread across the animal kingdom than previously thought and may be a fundamental capacity of vertebrate vocalization.  © 2022 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The distribution of marine zooplankton depends on both ocean currents and swimming behavior. Many zooplankton perform diel vertical migration (DVM) between the surface and subsurface, which can have different current regimes. If concentration mechanisms, such as fronts or eddies, are present in the subsurface, they may impact zooplankton near-surface distributions when they migrate to near-surface waters. A subsurface, retentive eddy within Palmer Deep Canyon (PDC), a submarine canyon along the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), retains diurnal vertically migrating zooplankton in previous model simulations. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the presence of the PDC and its associated subsurface eddy increases the availability and delivery of simulated Antarctic krill to nearby penguin foraging regions with model simulations over a single austral summer. We found that the availability and delivery rates of simulated krill to penguin foraging areas adjacent to PDC were greater when the PDC was present compared to when PDC was absent, and when DVM was deepest. These results suggest that the eddy has potential to enhance krill availability to upper trophic level predators and suggests that retention may play a significant role in resource availability for predators in other similar systems along the WAP and in other systems with sustained subsurface eddies. © The authors 2022.

ABSTRACT: Systematic data collection has become increasingly important in zoos as it facilitates evidence-based decision-making. Here, we describe the results of a two-year study on exhibit use and pair-bonding in a colony of Humboldt penguins. We used two different data collection apps to evaluate their effectiveness and suitability for evaluating pair-bond strength. Data were collected using instantaneous scan sampling and all-occurrence sampling 2–3 times per week for 2 years for a total of nearly 240 h of observation (19 h with one system and 219 h with the other system). The activity patterns (in particular, time spent in the water) differed amongst penguins and between the two data collection tools. Patterns of courtship-related behaviors varied tremendously across individuals. The longer pairs had been bonded, the more time they spent in close proximity. We highlight two important considerations for institutions aiming to collect such systematic data. First, it is critical to interpret all findings in context by incorporating husbandry details and keeper insights to highlight explanations that may not be readily apparent from the data. Second, one must explore all aspects of any data collection system before committing to its use—system setup, ease of data collection, format and accessibility of exported data. Not doing so may negate the value of systematic data collection by limiting the use and interpretability of the data. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Anthropogenic climate change is resulting in spatial redistributions of many species. We assessed the potential effects of climate change on an abundant and widely distributed group of diving birds, Eudyptes penguins, which are the main avian consumers in the Southern Ocean in terms of biomass consumption. Despite their abundance, several of these species have undergone population declines over the past century, potentially due to changing oceanography and prey availability over the important winter months. We used light-based geolocation tracking data for 485 individuals deployed between 2006 and 2020 across 10 of the major breeding locations for five taxa of Eudyptes penguins. We used boosted regression tree modelling to quantify post-moult habitat preference for southern rockhopper (E. chrysocome), eastern rockhopper (E. filholi), northern rockhopper (E. moseleyi) and macaroni/royal (E. chrysolophus and E. schlegeli) penguins. We then modelled their redistribution under two climate change scenarios, representative concentration pathways RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (for the end of the century, 2071–2100). As climate forcings differ regionally, we quantified redistribution in the Atlantic, Central Indian, East Indian, West Pacific and East Pacific regions. We found sea surface temperature and sea surface height to be the most important predictors of current habitat for these penguins; physical features that are changing rapidly in the Southern Ocean. Our results indicated that the less severe RCP4.5 would lead to less habitat loss than the more severe RCP8.5. The five taxa of penguin may experience a general poleward redistribution of their preferred habitat, but with contrasting effects in the (i) change in total area of preferred habitat under climate change (ii) according to geographic region and (iii) the species (macaroni/royal vs. rockhopper populations). Our results provide further understanding on the regional impacts and vulnerability of species to climate change. © 2022 The Authors. Global Change Biology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Penguins require vision that is adequate for both subaerial and submarine environments under a wide range of illumination. Here we provide a structured overview of what is known about their visual system with an emphasis on how and how well they achieve these goals. Amphibious vision is facilitated by a relatively flat cornea, the power in air varying from 10.2 dioptres (D) to 41.3 D depending on the species, and there is good evidence for emmetropia both above and below water. All penguins are trichromats with loss of rhodopsin 2, a nocturnal feature, but only deeper diving penguins have been noted to have pale oil droplets and a preponderance of rods. Conversely, the diurnal, shallow-diving little penguin has a higher ganglion cell density (28,867 cells/mm2) and f-number (3.5) than those that operate in dimmer light. In most species studied, there is some binocular overlap, but this reduces upon submergence. However, gaps in our knowledge remain, particularly with regard to the mechanism of accommodation, spectral transmission, behavioural measurements of visual function in low light, and neural adaptations to low light. The rarer species also deserve more attention. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Abandoned rookeries belonging to any of the Pygoscelis species are very particular taphocoenosis, usually preserved due to the accumulations of bones, pebbles, and guano year after year in the same nesting area, that condense together with other biogenic material and form ornithogenic sediments. The results of the excavation, sieved and analyses of sediment and materials found in two rookeries formed during the last 8000 years, named Pingfo I and Pingfo II and found in the 25 de Mayo/King George Island (South Shetland Islands, West Antarctica) are presented here. The analyses of the bones and eggshells, taxonomic and ontogenetic composition, elements representation, transport degree, predation, and scavenging marks, together with the micropalaeontological content provided informative tools for the reconstruction of the nesting areas, suggesting that bones were transported and accumulated in Pingfo I that would represent high energy beach, whereas a breeding colony was settled in Pingfo II. The preservation of hexactinellid spicules and several arthropod remains are particularly informative for the levels at Pingfo I. The preservation of a Culicidae (Diptera) wing could be the first middle Holocene record of the group in Antarctica, the only continent without extant mosquitoes. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Recent rapid environmental changes in Antarctica have often produced a sudden barrier to the marine animals. Adélie penguins, one of the top predators in the Antarctic ecosystem, are reported to confront the changes near the habitats by the appearance of large icebergs or drift ice. We tracked the foraging trips of Adélie penguins with GPS and time-depth recorders during the chick-guarding period in December 2018, at Adélie Cove in the Ross Sea, Antarctica, when 240 km2 of a giant ice floe was approaching near the foraging areas. Here, we aimed to investigate how Adélie penguins respond to these natural obstacles. Our results showed that, among the 18 penguins, 4 individuals moved to the south of the Silverfish Bay fast ice and 14 moved further east beyond the large ice floe to the sparse drift ice. The 14 birds on the sparse ice either crossed (through the ice floe surface, n = 7) or bypassed (to the northern ice boundary, n = 2; to the southern ice boundary, n = 5). Compared to a neighboring population on Inexpressible Island, Adélie Cove penguins had a longer foraging trip duration and movement distance. Our results suggest that the giant ice floe could alter the foraging paths and penguins bypassed or crossed the ice to reach their foraging areas by spending more energy and time. For better understanding, further studies are required to estimate if penguins suffer from these changes. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: When suitable nesting habitat is rare, birds may have to share it with heterospecific individuals with similar nesting requirements. The resulting species mosaic may in turn affect how breeding birds communicate vocally with each other. For instance, they may modify their vocalizations if the ambient noise produced by heterospecifics interferes with their own vocalizations. The colonies of Gentoo Penguins (Pygoscelis papua ellsworthi) are interesting to examine whether such a vocal variation occurs in colonial seabirds, as these birds frequently breed in the same colony as Adélie (P. adeliae) or Chinstrap (P. antarcticus) penguins. We investigated whether the presence of congeneric penguins breeding in the same colony as Gentoo Penguins affected the acoustic characteristics of their most common vocalization, the ecstatic display call. Based on vocalizations recorded in 23 breeding colonies along the Antarctic Peninsula during 3 field seasons, we found that the frequency of ecstatic display calls of Gentoo Penguins was consistently lower (average exhale phrase ∼460 Hz lower, average inhale phrase ∼370 Hz lower) as well as decreased in energy distribution when they bred in mixed colonies with Adélie Penguins than when they bred only in proximity to conspecifics. In contrast, the frequency of both inhale and exhale phrases was unaffected by the presence of Chinstrap Penguins, potentially due to the already greater frequency difference between these 2 species. The apparent vocal plasticity, in mixed colonies with Adélie Penguins, likely allows Gentoo Penguins to adjust the quality of their vocalizations depending on the acoustic space available in their colonies, and hence possibly enhance signal transmission between conspecifics. However, whether this acoustic adjustment is sufficient to increase the detectability of vocalizations and localization of individuals has yet to be determined.  © 2022 American Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Black-footed penguins (Spheniscus demersus) are classified as endangered, and the populations of gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) are rapidly decreasing. The optimization of semen cryopreservation in these species, for preserving their genetic diversity in genome resource banks, is essential for the success of captive breeding programs. This study compares the effectiveness of two permeating cryoprotectants, dimethylacetamide (DMA) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), on frozen–thawed sperm characteristics. Semen samples were collected during each breeding season once a week during two consecutive years. Semen samples were packaged in 0.25 ml straws and frozen by placing them in nitrogen vapors. After thawing, sperm motility characteristics were examined by computer-assisted sperm analysis. Propidium iodide and SYBR-14 were used as fluorochromes for the examination of membrane integrity. DNA integrity was evaluated by TUNEL assay. Gentoo sperm characteristics after freeze-thawing did not show any differences when using DMSO or DMA. In black-footed samples, progressive motility, curvilinear velocity (VCL), straight-line velocity (VSL), average path velocity (VAP), linearity (LIN), and straightness (STR) were greater using 8% DMSO (P < 0.05) than 6% DMA. The cryoresistance ratio (CR) using 8% DMSO was greater (P < 0.05) in gentoo than black-footed samples for CR-VCL and CR-VAP, and 6% DMA returned greater CR values (P < 0.05) than in black-footed samples for all characteristics evaluated. No differences were found in DNA fragmentation. In conclusion, the present results highlight the benefits of using 8% DMSO compared to 6% DMA in penguins. Sperm from black-footed showed a higher sensitivity to freezing-thawing process than gentoo sperm. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Persistent organic chemicals are non-biodegradable in nature and have a tendency to bioaccumulate in the top organisms of the food chain. We measured persistent organic chemicals, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), and benzotriazole-based ultraviolet stabilizers (UV-BTs), in the serum of captive king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) using gas chromatography with an electron capture detector and mass spectrometry to examine their age-related accumulation. PCBs, DDE, UV-PS, and UV-9 were detected in the blood of captive king penguins, and the concentrations of total PCBs, DDE, and UV-9 were positively correlated with age. These results suggest that there is a similar age-related accumulation of persistent organic chemicals in marine birds in the wild, and that older individuals are at a higher risk of contamination. © 2022 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: The approximately 18 species of penguins are variably affected currently by a number of threats essentially of anthropogenic origin. Future threats are predicted to include alterations in marine ecosystems due to a changing climate and increased levels of infectious disease. Historically, the investigations of infectious disease of the penguins found within the Antarctic biogeographic regions have been focused on diseases common in domestic poultry. Within the last decade, metagenomic studies have broadened our knowledge of viruses associated with those penguins, though these have not been linked to an infectious disease. In the future, human activities and the effects of climate change may facilitate the introduction of disease-causing microorganisms into Antarctic penguins. © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Routine post mortems of deceased penguins from Penguin Island, Western Australia, found that a temporal cluster of cases presented with characteristic gross and microscopic changes, namely birds in good body condition with hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, multifocal hepatic and splenic necrosis and numerous, 1–2 μm diameter protozoan parasites within the necrotic foci. Electron microscopy identified the protozoa as belonging to the phylum Apicomplexa. Molecular investigations by PCR gave inconsistent results. PCR performed by an external laboratory identified a novel Haemoproteus spp. organism in samples from 4 of 10 cases from this group, while PCR at Murdoch University identified Toxoplasma gondii in 12 of 13 cases (including 9 of the 10 assayed at the external laboratory). Immunohistochemistry of formalin fixed tissues also identified Toxoplasma in the hepatic and splenic lesions. The distinctive mortalities which were observed in this group of penguins are attributed to a fulminant toxoplasmosis, with a concurrent Haemoproteus infection in some cases. Though the clinical signs of infection are unknown, the gross and microscopic appearance at post mortem is sufficiently characteristic to allow a diagnosis to be made on these features. Definitive confirmation of Toxoplasma infection can be made by immunohistochemistry or PCR. © 2022 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Ice-free areas hold the most biologically active and diverse ecosystems in Antarctica, in which penguins play an important role. As the climate conditions changed in the past, penguins migrated among different breeding sites, making their populations recorded in a certain area a key index to explore the interactions between the local environment and ecological processes. Two 210Pb-dated ornithogenic soil profiles encoded MR1 and MR2 are used in this study to recover the time of Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) recolonization in Cape Royds of Ross Island, and their recent population change based on the element assemblage related to penguin guano, including Cu, Cd, Hg, P, S, Se, and Zn. It is revealed by both profiles that abundant penguins reentered this ice-free area at about 1820 to 1830, corresponding to the onset of a continuous warming. We found the reconstructed penguin population change pattern of MR1 in the lake margin in good agreement with the census and monitoring data since the late 1950s, and the pattern was subjected to environmental factors including temperature, sea ice, and polynyas. Our results showed that the ornithogenic soils in the lake margin can reflect the size of the penguin colony, and bridge the gap between long-term records and modern census, laying the basis for assessing the future penguin population in response to the drastically changing climate due to anthropogenic influence. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Despite its current low diversity, the penguin clade (Sphenisciformes) is one of the groups of birds with the most complete fossil record. Likewise, from the evolutionary point of view, it is an interesting group given the adaptations developed for marine life and the extreme climatic occupation capacity that some species have shown. In the present contribution, we reviewed and integrated all of the geographical and phylogenetic information available, together with an exhaustive and updated review of the fossil record, to establish and propose a biogeographic scenario that allows the spatialtemporal reconstruction of the evolutionary history of the Sphenisciformes, discussing our results and those obtained by other authors. This allowed us to understand how some abiotic processes are responsible for the patterns of diversity evidenced both in modern and past lineages. Thus, using the BioGeoBEARS methodology for biogeographic estimation, we were able to reconstruct the biogeographical patterns for the entire group based on the most complete Bayesian phylogeny of the total evidence. As a result, a New Zealand origin for the Sphenisciformes during the late Cretaceous and early Paleocene is indicated, with subsequent dispersal and expansion across Antarctica and southern South America. During the Eocene, there was a remarkable diversification of species and ecological niches in Antarctica, probably associated with the more temperate climatic conditions in the Southern Hemisphere. A wide morphological variability might have developed at the beginning of the Paleogene diversification. During the Oligocene, with the trends towards the freezing of Antarctica and the generalized cooling of the Neogene, there was a turnover that led to the survival (in New Zealand) of the ancestors of the crown Sphenisciform lineages. Later these expanded and diversified across the Southern Hemisphere, strongly linked to the climatic and oceanographic processes of the Miocene. Finally, it should be noted that the Antarctic recolonization and its hostile climatic conditions occurred in some modern lineages during the Pleistocene, possibly due to exaptations that made possible the repeated dispersion through cold waters during the Cenozoic, also allowing the necessary adaptations to live in the tundra during the glaciations. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Birds generally employ bipedal terrestrial locomotion; their wings flap synchronously to provide aerial propulsion. Penguins (Spheniscidae) are non-flyers that use their modified wings (flippers) to ‘fly’ underwater, again using synchronous action. The family is distributed from the equator to the Antarctic; the earliest penguins lived at temperate latitudes. On land, penguins usually walk bipedally and slowly (waddling) because their legs are short and their bodies long and fusiform. Their flippers are held out sideways and show little movement; they may function like balance poles. A few penguin species breed at high latitude and make substantial terrestrial migrations over snow and ice; they intermittently use an alternative terrestrial locomotory mode (tobogganing) in which they lie on their ventral surfaces and use the feet alternately to propel them more quickly. The emperor penguin Aptenodytes forsteri makes two-way trips (<250 km) to breed, encountering both ice and several types of snow. The topography varies from flat areas to steep slopes and ridges. In this study we analysed 13 publicly available video records and demonstrate that the flippers are also used for propulsion (particularly for climbing in deep snow). Gait analysis reveals that all four limbs are employed in a quadrupedal, ipsilaterally coordinated manner: the classic mode of tetrapod terrestrial locomotion. During climbing, tetrapod limb action is supplemented by use of the beak as an anchor. During quadrupedal locomotion over snow the flippers move snow on their power strokes, thereby demonstrating exchange of forces. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Mercury (Hg) is a great concern for marine environments. Bird feathers have been widely used to assess Hg pollution. In this study, we determine mercury concentrations in body feathers of juvenile Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) from the southeastern sector of Buenos Aires province, Argentina, during a non-breeding season, considering both sexes. Hg levels, considering both females and males together, ranged between 265.5 and 1515.52 ng/g. These levels are well below the concentrations in feathers suggested for taking actions focused on the protection of seabirds. Non-significant differences between sexes regarding Hg levels were found, probably because juveniles were sexually immature and females did not excrete Hg by egg laying yet. Hg concentrations found in this study were an order of magnitude higher than those reported 10 years ago for the species in breeding areas on the Argentine coast. Thus, the present study provides relevant information indicating a possible increase of Hg pollution in the southwestern region of the Atlantic Ocean and thus trigger for the development of monitoring programs and regional strategies to improve the conservation status of this species. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Propulsion performance of swimming and flying animals is often evaluated by using dimensionless numbers, such as the Strouhal and Reynolds numbers. They have been shown to allow a better understanding of locomotion efficiency, using relatively simple approaches and avoiding overly complex computational models. Specifically, it has been reported that efficient propulsion is more likely to occur when Strouhal number values – estimated from propulsive frequencies and amplitudes – are within a relatively narrow range, depending on the corresponding Reynolds number, broadly expressing the fluid resistance to the animal motion. We have estimated both Strouhal and Reynolds numbers for seven species of penguins after analysing relevant kinematic data taken from the literature. The obtained values neatly indicate that, as expected, penguins employ efficient propulsion mechanisms. Additionally, by comparing these values with those for alcids – seabirds that can also fly – we have found that penguins swim at least as efficiently as alcids. However, we have also found that the swimming number – proportional to the product of Strouhal and Reynolds numbers – neatly correlates to the diving abilities of the considered species and apparently indicates, in a straightforward hierarchical manner, the gains in diving due to the loss of flying abilities. Within the penguin species, a clear correlation is also observed between diving performance and drag coefficient values. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The Endangered African penguin (Spheniscus demersus), endemic to the Benguela upwelling ecosystem, is the only species of penguin found in Africa. Historically, the species was abundant throughout the region, with the population estimated to be in the order of 1.5–3.0 million individuals in the early 1900s. However, the removal of guano from breeding sites, the commercial harvesting of penguins and their eggs, and reduced prey availability in the northern Benguela meant this had decreased to ∼51,500 breeding pairs by 1989. Since then, the population has decreased further by >65%, and in South Africa by around 40% since it was classified by the IUCN as Endangered in 2010. This contemporary decline shows no sign of reversing and results from the cumulative impact of several threats, foremost of which are a shift in prey availability away from South Africa’s west coast and the compounding influence of competition with commercial fishing. In this chapter we summarize the African penguin’s biological traits and key aspects of behavior, provide an overview of the population decline and its key drivers, and finally describe both the existing and proposed conservation measures. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The sophisticated spatial reference tools that exist today greatly facilitate studies of spatial ecology. Historically, however, the lack of such tools meant that spatial data were often imprecise, ambiguous or sometimes inaccurate. This can hinder or confound assessments of whether species distributions have changed in the past over decadal timescales. This is the case for Adélie penguins breeding at the southern limit of their breeding range in East Antarctica. In this short note, we resolve uncertainties in the locations of Adélie penguin breeding sites observed in the first population survey in Prydz Bay in 1981 by examining the original working notes of that work in combination with data from a recent survey in 2009 and a recently published spatial reference and identification system for coastal East Antarctica. By clarifying the historical locations, we conclude that the Adélie penguin breeding distribution has remained unchanged in this region over the past three decades, and we provide a robust baseline for assessing change in the future.

ABSTRACT: The endangered yellow‐eyed penguin/hoiho (Megadyptes antipodes) predominantly forages benthically within its mainland range and shows high foraging site fidelity. Identifying consistencies in foraging locations can allow effective conservation, especially when managing bycatch risk. This study investigated the at‐sea distribution of penguins breeding on Stewart Island to explore site‐specific foraging strategies and inform fisheries management. During the 2020/21 season, 19 adult breeding yellow‐eyed penguins from Port Pegasus, Paterson Inlet, and Codfish Island were fitted with GPS‐TDR dive loggers to track their movements and diving behaviours. A total of 25,696 dives were recorded across 91 foraging trips. Birds from Port Pegasus reached significantly greater depths, spent longer at the seafloor, and performed longer dives. They also had the smallest foraging distribution, with most activity concentrated inshore. Compared to Port Pegasus, foraging radii and trip lengths were twice as large for Paterson Inlet and four times larger at Codfish Island. Despite differences in available foraging habitat, considerable individual and intra‐site consistency for preferred foraging locations was observed. Localised behaviour and inter‐site differences in dive metrics suggest significant plasticity in foraging ecology across their mainland range; however, individual behaviour and preferred foraging locations were extremely predictable. Thus, risk of mortality from fisheries can be quantified and managed accordingly. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: Chen et al. (Polar Biology, 43(11):1769–1781) recently reported lagged, region-specific responses of Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) abundance to environmental variability in the Ross Sea, Antarctica. Their study suggests that lags are important toward understanding Adélie penguin population change. Though we agree with many of their findings, there are several issues with these authors’ hypotheses and consequent interpretation of their results. Generally, the selected environmental variables and the scales analyzed need proper justification, as their reasoning of the causality on penguin abundance at the Ross Sea is not in agreement with previous natural history studies of both the penguins and their prey carried out in this region. Here we provide critically constructive comments on their paper and present alternative initial hypothesis to explain their results. We suggest that the variables analyzed and their scale, should be re-considered in order to reach conclusions that help explain the recent changes in Adélie penguin colonies in the Ross Sea, ‘home’ to about one-third of the global population. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Diet is a key factor affecting seabird foraging behaviour, ultimately influencing survival, breeding success and long-term population viability. The density and distribution of prey species in the marine environment are influenced by many factors including climate effects such as El Niño southern oscillation and climate change that alter water temperature. While poor quality diet has been implicated as a contributing factor in the decline of some mainland New Zealand yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes) populations, little is known about their diet in the subantarctic where the majority of the species breeds. Blood and feather samples (n = 63) were collected for stable isotope analysis of diet from 25 individual birds breeding on subantarctic Enderby Island, Auckland Islands, New Zealand, from 2015 to 2018. Diet data were analysed by factors such as breeding year, sex and foraging behaviour. Stable isotope analysis demonstrated significant changes in diet during each year of the study, which included both El Niño and La Niña conditions. Diet during El Niño conditions comprised lower trophic level prey, which were more benthic, and found closer to shore than diet during La Niña. Coupled with the reported variable breeding success of yellow-eyed penguins in the subantarctic, variable diet suggests prey availability is likely to be a limiting factor in some years. Prey availability is therefore expected to be a major influence on survival and breeding success of this endangered species in the future, particularly if the effects of climate change become more pronounced. This research highlights an urgent conservation need to identify prey species utilized by the southern population, along with their distribution in time and space, and therefore also the effect of diet on long-term population stability. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: A native Australian corvid, Little Raven Corvus mellori, has emerged as a dominant and problematic predator of an ecologically and economically important seabird, the Little Penguin Eudyptula minor. In 2013, ravens successfully preyed upon clutches/broods of the burrow-nesting penguin, especially those in shallower, more accessible burrows. Individual raven size might mediate which ravens attack penguins; smaller ravens may be able to enter burrows more easily; alternatively, larger ravens may be more capable of overcoming penguin parental defence. Here, we consider the predator-prey interactions to assess whether associations with burrow characteristics persisted and examine whether raven size mediated propensity to prey upon penguin eggs. We compared data from the 2013 and 2015 penguin breeding seasons at Phillip Island (Victoria, Australia) for differences in clutch survival and burrow characteristics. We also examined raven morphometrics to determine if any physical differences existed between known burrow-predators (“culprits”) and other birds. During the 2013 breeding season, penguins suffered clutch losses of 61.1% compared with 33.9% in 2015. Burrow characteristics changed between seasons—most noticeably, burrows were deeper in 2015 and ravens no longer discriminated between burrow characteristics. Culprits were heavier and larger. While we could not eliminate inter-annual variability as a possible contributing factor, our results were consistent with rapid adaptation of prey and predator to intense emergent depredation. Penguins may now construct deeper burrows, and ravens evidently no longer select more vulnerable burrows. Larger ravens may be more capable of approaching and attacking penguin burrows. © 2022, Marine Ornithology. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Health diagnostics of wildlife have historically relied on the evaluation of select serum biomarkers and the identification of a contaminant or pathogen burden within specific tissues as an indicator of a level of insult. However, these approaches fail to measure the physiological reaction of the individual to stressors, thus limiting the scope of interpretation. Gene-based health diagnostics provide an opportunity for an alternate, whole-system, or holistic assessment of health, not only in individuals or populations but potentially in ecosystems. Seabirds are among the most threatened marine taxonomic groups in the world, with ~25% of this species currently listed as threatened or considered of special concern; among seabirds, the penguins (Family Spheniscidae) are the most threatened seabird Family. We used gene expression to develop baseline physiological indices for wild penguins in the Falkland-Malvinas Islands, and captive zoo penguins. We identified the almost complete statistical separation of penguin groups (gentoo Detroit Zoo, gentoo Falkland-Malvinas Islands, rockhopper Detroit Zoo, and rockhopper Falkland-Malvinas Islands) based on gene expression profiles. Implementation of long-term longitudinal studies would allow for the assessment of temporal increases or decreases of select transcripts and would facilitate interpretation of the drivers of change. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Remote sensing has evolved as an alternative to traditional techniques in the spatio-temporal monitoring of the Antarctic ecosystem, especially with the rapid expansion of the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), providing a centimeter-scale spatial resolution. In this study, the potential of a high-spatial resolution multispectral sensor embedded in a UAV is compared to medium resolution satellite remote sensing (Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8) to monitor the characteristics of the Vapor Col Chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarcticus) colony ecosystem (Deception Island, South Shetlands Islands, Antarctica). Our main objective is to generate precise thematic maps of the typical ecosystem of penguin colonies derived from the supervised analysis of the spectral information obtained with these remote sensors. For this, two parametric classification algorithms (Maximum Likelihood, MLC, and Spectral Angle, SAC) and two non-parametric machine learning classifiers (Support Vector Machine, SVM, and Random Forest, RFC) are tested with UAV imagery, obtaining the best results with the SVM classifier (93.19% OA). Our study shows that the use of UAV outperforms satellite imagery (87.26% OA with Sentinel-2 Level 2 (S2L2) and 70.77% OA with Landsat 8 Level 2 (L8L2) in SVM classification) in the characterization of the substrate due to a higher spatial resolution, although differences between UAV and S2L2 are minimal. Thus, both sensors used in tandem could provide a broader and more precise view of how the area covered by the different elements of these ecosystems can change over time in a global climate change scenario. In addition, this study represents a precise UAV monitoring that takes place in this Chinstrap penguin colony, estimating a total coverage of approximately 20,000 m2 of guano areas in the study period. © 2022 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Alert distance (AD) and flight initiation distance (FID) are popular measures used to explore the reaction of prey to approaching predators, and thus the economics underlying optimal escape strategies. AD likely mirrors the effort invested into vigilance, while FID provides an estimate of the perceived risk of an approaching threat. Although individual variation in AD and FID is influenced by environmental factors such as variation in predation pressure and human disturbance, the repeatabilities of these traits (especially AD), and therefore their designation as personality traits, remain under-investigated. Here, we studied the repeatability of AD, FID, and the decision to flee in a flightless, ground-breeding seabird, the king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus). A single experimenter approached three times over three consecutive days 47 incubating king penguins from two different colonies with varying human disturbance levels. We explored the effects of weather, time of day, and approach speed of the experimenter on these behaviors. Weather had an effect on all three behaviors. In warm, sunny weather AD increased. In rainy, windy weather birds were more likely to flee, but waited longer before initiating flight. Faster approach speeds between AD and FID increased FID. Weather conditions and speed of approach affected repeatability estimates, highlighting the need to consider external sources of variation when refining such estimates. FID and the decision to flee were significantly and moderately repeatable (r = 0.26 and 0.57, respectively), while AD was not. There was no evidence of behavioral habituation or sensitization in either colony. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH

ABSTRACT: Reproductive performance typically improves with age, reaching a plateau at middle age and subsequently declining in older age classes (senescing individuals). Three potential non-exclusive mechanisms can explain the improvement in reproductive performance with age: (1) selection (poor quality individuals are removed from the population with increasing age), (2) constraint (individual efficiency increases through experience), and (3) restraint (reproductive investment increases with age as the residual reproductive value decreases). While all three mechanisms received strong empirical support, few studies have aimed at teasing apart those hypotheses and understanding their underlying functioning. In little penguins (Eudyptula minor), we used a 19-yr longitudinal dataset on breeding and foraging of more than 450 individuals to investigate the effect of age on breeding success. We separated within-individual from among-individual age effects using state-of-the-art statistical methods (within-subject centering and population change decomposition). We then assessed whether within-individual changes in breeding resulted from ontogenetic changes in foraging performances, breeding phenology or access to mates and nest sites. Fidelity and assortative pairing explained the high correlation in male and female ages within a pair. Breeding performances followed a typical bell-shaped curve with performance increasing up to 8 yr old, before reaching a plateau and subsequently declining after age 16. Both selection and within-individual processes occurred, although within-individual changes dominated differences in age-dependent breeding success. The selective appearance had almost no effect (apart from ages 2–3), and selective disappearance mostly affected changes at old ages (above 16), although they were also responsible for the slight increase in reproductive performances from ages 5–8. Focusing on within-individual changes, birds exhibited higher performances at middle ages, with birds foraging better, laying earlier and changing partner and nest less often. Their reproductive investment did not vary with age for females and slightly decreased for males. This supports the constraint hypothesis but not the restraint one. Finally, the increase in breeding performances at young ages was explained by the age-related increase in foraging performances during chick-rearing and advancement of laying. In contrast, reproductive senescence was defined by a general decrease in bird performances. © 2021 The Ecological Society of America.

ABSTRACT: Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) are frequent winter visitors of the coastal waters of Brazil. During this migration, they may experience a number of health problems (e.g. malnutrition, trauma, bycatch in fisheries, interaction with marine debris, oiling) which lead them to wash ashore, where they are rescued and brought to rehabilitation facilities to receive veterinary care. From 2012 to 2014, a total of 226 Magellanic penguins, mostly juveniles (98%), were successfully rehabilitated and released with flipper bands in coastal waters of Espírito Santo state, Brazil, by the Institute of Research and Rehabilitation of Marine Animals. Of these, 28 (12.3%) were resighted along the coast of Brazil and Uruguay on the months following their release. The spatial and temporal distribution of resightings suggests that rehabilitated penguins were able to reorient themselves and engage in normal migratory movements after release, but the data also reveals that they experienced gradual body mass loss in the post-release period. The proportion of individuals resighted was significantly higher in penguins released during the non-breeding season of 2012 (16.3%) than in 2013 (1.8%), which may be linked to decreased prey availability in southeast Brazil due to the oceanoclimatic conditions related to the 2011–2012 El Niño event. Nearly one-third of resighted penguins had injuries or feather damage associated with flipper bands, and similar problems were also seen in penguins that were admitted after having been rehabilitated and released months earlier by other rehabilitation facilities. Subcutaneous transponders, temporary plumage dyes and satellite transmitters are discussed as alternatives to monitor the post-release movements and survival of rehabilitated Magellanic penguins. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Sociedade Brasileira de Ornitologia.

ABSTRACT: A female, 14-year-old, African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) weighing 2.5 kg with the anorexia for one day and 22 months history of bumblefoot was found dead in aquarium. Grossly, severe bumblefoot in the central surface of the right foot, severe enlarged liver and kidneys with orange color were observed. Histopathologically, pinkish amorphous materials were accumulated in liver, spleen, kidney, and stomach. The pinkish materials in the liver, kidney, spleen, and stomach were confirmed as amyloid with typical orange color reactions using Congo red stain under the light microscope and with bright red color expressions using Congo red stain under the fluorescence microscope. Based on the typical gross and histopathologic findings and special staining, this case was confirmed as systemic amyloidosis. A long period time of moderate bumblefoot might be closely associated with the occurrence of systemic amyloidosis in the captive penguin. © The Korean Society of Veterinary Clinics.

ABSTRACT: Droughts in many regions of the world are increasing in frequency and severity which, coupled with effects from anthropogenic water extraction and diversion, are reducing river discharges. Yet to date, few studies have investigated the impacts of hydrological droughts (i.e., reduced river outflows to the ocean) on seabirds. Here, we examined the consequences of the “Millennium Drought” on the local decline of an iconic Australian seabird, the little penguin (Eudyptula minor). We analysed monthly and annual penguin numbers in relation to river outflow, rainfall, the characteristics of the coastal waters (sea surface temperatures and chlorophyll-a concentrations), and local abundance of key predators and prey species. We found a negative association between monthly penguin numbers and both sea surface temperatures and river outflow. Annual penguin numbers were positively associated with southern garfish numbers (our local indicator of food availability) but negatively associated with annual chlorophyll-a concentrations. Our findings emphasizing the need for further research into the effect of hydrological droughts on seabird populations and for improved river management that account for potential downstream impacts on the coastal environment receiving freshwater from rivers.   Copyright © 2022 Colombelli-Négrel, Nur, Auricht, Clarke, Mosley and Dann.

ABSTRACT: During the last 60 years, several space missions have been designed and launched to explore our neighboring planet, Mars. Most of these expeditions had the goal of mapping the planet and evaluating some of its key characteristics, such as terrain configuration and composition. In this context, in 2018 the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding (MARSIS) instrument, on board the European Space Agency's (ESA) Mars Express Orbiter, led to the discovery of a subglacial lake located at the South Pole of Mars, in the same area where several geysers were first observed in the late'90s. This discovery suggested complex seasonal dynamics associated with both the Mars icy caps and led to the launch of some missions to inspect the main features in situ. However, none of the attempts was successful. This paper presents the phase-A design of a fully European rover mission, called MARs South Pole ExploratioN and Geysers in-sitU Investigation (MARS-PENGUIN), to sample the icy crust above the South Pole subglacial lake in different locations and characterize the aforementioned geysers' phenomena from a close distance. The mission, composed of a service module, a rover, and a martian helicopter, is designed to reach the subglacial lake region during the martian spring, in 2029, after a ten-month cruise, to spot the geysers during their activity period. This work reports the requirements, the feasibility analysis, and the preliminary technical development for each subsystem. Moreover, the operational phase is characterized, with an emphasis on the sampling strategies adopted to meet the mission objectives. Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The illustration is an important tool to aid in the description and understanding of anatomy, and penguins (Aves: Sphenisciformes: Spheniscidae) are an important clade in environmental monitoring, paleontology, and other research fields. Traditionally, anatomic illustration has been informed by dissection. More recently, micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) has proven to be a powerful tool for three-dimensional anatomic imaging, although larger specimens are more challenging to image due to increased X-ray attenuation. Here, we used traditional dissection and micro-CT to illustrate the skulls of Aptenodytes patagonicus, Eudyptula minor, and Pygoscelis papua, and the extracranial soft tissue of E. minor. Micro-CT prevented the loss of orientation, disarticulation, and distortion of bones that might result from cleaning and drying skulls, while immobilization was achieved by freezing the specimens before imaging. All bony elements in the head were accurately depicted. Fixing, dehydrating, and diffusion staining with iodine (diceCT) enabled the identification of muscles and other large nonmineralized structures, but specimen preparation precluded the ability to show smaller nerves and vessels. The results presented here provide a guide for anatomic studies of penguins and our summary of sample preparation and imaging techniques are applicable for studies of other similarly sized biological specimens. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: A Malaysian Aquaria, the Underwater World Langkawi (UWL), has brought in 14 African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) for their ex-situ conservation. Following The Penguin Husbandry Manual produced by the American Zoo Aquarium Association (AZA), the UWL has adopted the population as their management regime and, as a result, has successfully bred the population from a total of 14 individuals to 40 individuals. This study aims to evaluate the captive management of penguins at the UWL and increase the efficiency of the management regime at the UWL. Environmental data were collected in this study, including the size of the Enclosure 13, temperature, lighting, seawater quality, and feeding data. The results showed that the showcase areas fulfilled the minimum requirements of the penguin, and no significant difference was found between morning and the evening temperatures. However, it differed significantly from the six lighting spots, and the pool's water was within the comfort zones. The diet provided for the African penguins at UWL follows their requirements. However, the amount of food supplied to each penguin at UWL is low compared to the food intake of the same individual penguin in the wild. Overall, the management of UWL is excellent practice. However, some weaknesses need further improvement. © 2022 National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources (NISCAIR). All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Identifying the factors influencing seabird breeding output is critical for their conservation because breeding performance in turn influences population dynamics. This is particularly important in sensitive environments, where ecological disturbances can lead to changes in population trends of extremely specialized species in a relatively short time. Here, we have reported on the breeding output of the Adélie penguin Pygoscelis adeliae in three colonies of the Mid Victoria Land, Ross Sea (Antarctica), in 2017/2018–2018/2019 to provide scientific information for the Ross Sea Marine Protected Area research and management plan. Breeding chronology, breeding success and chick growth did not differ between study colonies and were in line with data reported for other penguin colonies across Antarctica. Penguin breeding success was higher in central than in peripheral nests and decreased with an increasing number of neighboring nesting skuas; conversely, at-nest weather conditions experienced by chicks did not seem to play a role. Our findings suggest that the quality of the nesting environment seems more important than the general condition of the colony in determining breeding output. Therefore, along with marine habitat characteristics for the planning of management and conservation of seabirds, the importance of the terrestrial environment must be also duly considered. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Most seabirds forage far from land, making them hard to observe when foraging. Satellite tracking of seabirds shows where they come into conflict with human uses of the ocean, and whether they use protected areas. Because tracking data are expensive, data from one colony and/or year are sometimes used to design marine protection for a species across its range. Two assumptions commonly made are that foraging distance increases with colony size and individuals are uniformly distributed around colonies. We tested these assumptions using Magellanic penguins Spheniscus magellanicus as an example. We used a large tracking dataset of 338 penguins foraging for chicks at 10 colonies in Argentina from 1996 to 2019. Foraging distance increased with population size among colonies, but predicted distances would not cover foraging areas for all colonies. There was no relationship between population size and foraging distance within colony among years for colonies with ten and 23 years of data. Penguins were not uniformly distributed around colonies. Penguins used ~24% (12-40%) of the ocean available within the colony’s maximum foraging distance. We also show that overlap between penguin foraging areas and marine protected areas (MPA) and hydrocarbon concessions varied among colonies partly because of variation in how far offshore penguins forage. Overlap with MPAs was low (0% – 20%) for seven of the ten colonies and high (23% – 100%) for the other three. Overlap with a large area permitted for hydrocarbon exploration (seismic surveys) was relatively high (23% – 81%) for seven colonies where penguins forage offshore. Data from one colony are unlikely to indicate the most effective marine spatial planning for all colonies. Our data show that to be effective, marine planning should consider the temporal and spatial dynamics of ocean conditions and the response of marine wildlife to these changes. Climate variability is predicted to increase, making knowledge of foraging-location variation among colonies and years critical to conservation planning.

ABSTRACT: Until the last decade, gentoo penguins were usually split into two subspecies, northern gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua papua) breeding in the Falkland Islands, South Georgia, and other subantarctic islands and southern gentoo penguins (P. papua ellsworthi) breeding in the South Sandwich, South Orkney and South Shetland islands, and Antarctic Peninsula. Recent genetics research, however, suggests that the population at South Georgia is much more closely related to those further south and should be included in P. papua ellsworthi. In Japanese zoos and aquariums, captive breeding of gentoo penguins is conducted separately in three populations: “Captive-South Georgia,” originating from South Georgia, “Captive-South Shetlands,” originating from South Shetlands, and “Captive-Unknown,” originating from at least one founder of unknown subspecies. The aims of the present study were to investigate the genetic diversity and differentiation of these captive populations using microsatellite analysis. Genetic diversity in each captive population was similar to that found in the wild, although they had much lower contemporary effective population sizes. Pairwise genetic differentiation indexes (FST) among the three captive populations were as follows: 0.0309 (“Captive-South Georgia” and “Captive-Unknown”), 0.1094 (“Captive-South Georgia” and “Captive-South Shetlands”), and 0.1214 (“Captive-South Shetlands” and “Captive-Unknown”). Using Bayesian clustering, there was relatively high genetic differentiation between the “Captive-South Shetlands” group, which formed a distinct cluster, and individuals of the “Captive-Unknown” group, which were assigned to clusters in common with “Captive-South Georgia.” The results from the present study are useful for future management of captive gentoo penguin populations in Japan. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT: Aspergillosis is a fungal infection caused mainly by Aspergillus fumigatus that often results in respiratory disease in birds. Aspergillosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in captive-bred penguin species. Currently, there is no registered vaccine to prevent aspergillosis. Recent research demonstrated that oral administration of gram-negative bacteria expressing high levels of galactose-α-1,3-galactose (α-Gal) modulates anti-α-Gal immunity and protects turkeys from clinical aspergillosis caused by experimental A. fumigatus infection. The role of anti-α-Gal immunity in penguins has not been studied. Here, we tested the distribution of α-1,3-galactosyltransferase (α1,3GT) genes in the fecal microbiome of Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti). The occurrence of natural anti-α-Gal antibodies (Abs) in sera and eggs of healthy Humboldt penguins was also assessed. A trial was then conducted to test whether oral administration of Escherichia coli Nissle, expressing high α-Gal levels, modulates anti-α-Gal immunity in a colony of Humboldt penguins. Animals in the vaccination and placebo groups were evaluated before the trial and followed for one year for aspergillosis detection using a diagnostic panel including computed tomography scans, capillary zone electrophoresis, 3-hydroxybutyrate levels, and anti-A. fumigatus Abs. Anti-α-Gal Abs were detected in sera (IgM and IgY) and eggs (IgY) of healthy penguins. Microbiota analysis and functional predictions revealed the presence of α1,3GT genes in the microbiota of Humboldt penguins and other penguin species. A strong decrease in anti-α-Gal IgM levels was observed in all animals in the placebo group three months after vaccination protocol. This decrease was not observed in E. coli Nissle-treated penguins. After the vaccination protocol, we found a positive correlation between anti-E. coli IgY and anti-α-Gal IgY in the E. coli Nissle group, suggesting a correlation between the presence of the bacteria and these Abs. During the study period, three penguins exhibited respiratory signs consistent with aspergillosis. Two were from the placebo group whose symptoms resolved with specific treatments, while a single vaccinated individual developed fatal respiratory aspergillosis eight months after the trial. We conclude that E. coli Nissle represents a safe potential probiotic with a protective effect against aspergillosis in Humboldt penguins that deserves to be further explored for therapeutic uses in these animals.

ABSTRACT: Stress and mortality of pearl oysters during nucleus implanting for round pearl and mabé pearl production can be reduced using appropriate anaesthetics that allow improved access to nucleus implanting sites. This study evaluated the efficacy of three different concentrations of benzocaine (0.25, 0.50 and 1.20 g L-1) and 1-propylene phenoxetol (2.50, 3.00 and 3.50 mL L-1) when presented to ‘small’ (dorso-ventral height [DVH], 78.7 ± 1.6 mm), ‘medium’ (DVH, 118.2 ± 2.0 mm) and ‘large’ (DVH, 149.3 ± 1.1 mm) cohorts of the winged pearl oyster, Pteria penguin. Results showed the following general trends across treatments with both anaesthetics: (1) greater proportions of large oysters became relaxed compared to small oysters; (2) large oysters required shorter exposure times to become relaxed than small oysters; (3) for each size class of oyster, an increase in anaesthetic concentration resulted in an increased proportion of relaxed oysters; and (4) ‘mantle collapse’ (where the mantle collapses away from the shell) was only recorded in large oysters in treatments with higher concentrations of anaesthetics. The most effective concentration of benzocaine to use with small, medium and large Pt. penguin was the highest level tested in this study (1.20 g L-1). Similarly, the highest concentration of 1-propylene phenoxetol tested (3.5 mL L-1) was also the most effective with all three size classes of Pt. penguin. These treatments caused mantle collapse in large oysters, for which use of lower, less effective anaesthetic concentrations may be considered preferable, to avoid potentially negative impacts of mantle collapse on subsequent mabé pearl production. As well as efficacy, choice of anaesthetic should consider ease of preparation and preparation time. Benzocaine requires dissolving in methyl alcohol and heating to 88–92˚C, while 1-propylene phenoxetol is readily soluble in seawater. © 2021 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Foraging provides an integrative view of the effects of environmental variability on marine predators, from direct effects through increased energetic costs at sea to indirect effects through modification of prey accessibility. Using a 19 yr automated monitoring system of ~400 individuals (>45 000 foraging trips), we investigated short-term and interannual variability in foraging performance (trip duration and mass gain) of breeding little penguins Eudyptula minor, nearshore seabirds living in a climate change hotspot. We found marked but variable seasonal patterns in foraging performance, with clear optimum periods but no decreases in trip duration or mass gain throughout the breeding season. Although foraging performance was less variable at the inter-annual scale, we highlighted 3 groups of low, average and good annual foraging performance. Low foraging performance during post-guard was associated with significantly lower breeding success. To understand how the environment might explain such variability, we simultaneously studied the effect of variables that may affect penguin foraging directly by altering energy costs at sea (currents, waves and tides) and indirectly by modifying prey availability (primary production and vertical stratification). Although foraging performance is often thought to mainly depend on prey accessibility, lower foraging performance was mostly associated with increased waves and currents and only secondarily with a decreased and shallower stratification. Finally, synchrony between penguin phenology and primary production cycles explained interannual foraging performance, highlighting the importance of seabird breeding phenology.  © Inter-Research 2022.

ABSTRACT: Avian malaria is caused by infection with haemoprotozoa of the genus Plasmodium. Infection is endemic in large parts of the world and is typically subclinical in birds that are native to these regions. Several penguin species have evolved in non-endemic regions without the selective pressure that these parasites exert and are highly susceptible to infection when transplanted to endemic regions, for example, in the context of zoological collections or rehabilitation centers. Avian malaria in penguins typically causes acute mortality without premonitory signs, or less commonly, nonspecific signs of morbidity, followed by mortality. Additionally, infection is reported in wild penguins, though the significance of these infections remains equivocal. As global temperatures continue to increase, avian malaria is likely to pose a continued and further threat to conservation efforts in captive environments. Intra vitam diagnosis currently relies on the evaluation of blood smears and molecular methods. The former is unreliable in penguins, as the acute clinical course typically does not allow the development of parasitemia. This absence of parasitemia also makes speciation challenging. Current molecular methods typically target the Cytochrome B or 18s subunit and have proven variably sensitive and specific. Reliable intra vitam diagnosis of avian malaria and further information about the causative agents at a species level would be very valuable in understanding the epidemiology and likely future course of avian malaria infection in penguins, and in particular, the implications avian malaria may have for conservation efforts. This paper provides an overview of malaria in penguins, discusses its changing impact on management and conservation, offers a summary of current diagnostics, and suggests future direction for the development of diagnostic tests. The latter will be key in understanding and managing this disease. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: Visitor Site Guidelines are the principal instruments guiding tourist activities and behaviour at intensively visited sites. These instruments attempt to minimize tourist impacts on Antarctic wildlife, including penguins. However, some recommendations still need to be reinforced by empirical research. Although penguins have enjoyed considerable research attention, a knowledge gap still exists regarding penguins' behavioural responses to realistic tourist activities, including talking sound, viewing distance and movement speed. To fill this gap, we conducted a series of experiments to simulate these activities on two penguin species breeding at an intensively visited site during the 2019-2020 season. We performed 106 replicates of passive and active human presence treatments. Responses varied between species, but active human presence consistently triggered significantly higher responses of strong vigilance behaviour. Our results reinforce Visitor Site Guidelines' recommendations of keeping quiet, moving slowly and increasing viewing distance if changes in behaviour are observed. We also recommend adopting a more conservative viewing distance in the early breeding season. Additional management-orientated empirical studies are needed, including on different species, sites and stages of the breeding season, as such results are valuable for strengthening tourism guidelines and assessing the efficacy of management measures under a post-COVID-19 scenario of increasing Antarctic tourism.

ABSTRACT: Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and severe, leading to an increase in direct, adverse thermoregulatory impacts on wildlife. Here, we document an unprecedented, single-day, heat-related mortality event of Magellanic Penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) at Punta Tombo, Chubut Province, Argentina, one of the largest breeding colonies for this species. We found 264 dead adults and 90 dead chicks in the breeding colony and along the beaches after recording the highest temperature in the shade (44°C on January 19, 2019) since the study started in December 1982. We found dead adults and chicks in postures used to release heat (i.e. lying prone with flippers and feet extended away from the body and/or bills open). We found no evidence for other causes of mortality other than heat (e.g., disease, toxic algae, starvation). Adults potentially died of dehydration, because dead adults were in significantly worse body condition than adults that survived. Dead adults had either empty stomachs or <50 g of food, and 27% of the dead adults died traveling between the nesting area and the water. More males died than females (83% male and 17% female; n = 94). In one section of the colony, ~5% of 1, 153 adults died in the heat. Mortality rates of adults were unevenly distributed across the colony, suggesting that the presence of microclimates or easier beach access was an important factor to penguin survival. The body condition indices of dead and live chicks were similar and chicks that died from heat had food in their stomachs (mean = 405 ± 128 g; n = 14), suggesting that food likely inhibited their ability to thermoregulate. Documenting the effects of extreme weather events on populations is crucial to predicting how they will respond to climate change because these events, although rare, are expected to become more frequent and could have severe impacts on populations.

ABSTRACT: Information on marine predator at-sea distributions is key to understanding ecosystem and community dynamics and an important component of spatial management frameworks that aim to identify regions important for conservation. Tracking data from seabirds are widely used to define priority areas for conservation, but such data are often restricted to the breeding population. This also applies to penguins in Antarctica, where identification of important habitat for nonbreeders has received limited attention. Nonbreeding penguins are expected to have larger foraging distributions than breeding conspecifics, which may alter their interactions with physical environmental factors, conspecifics, other marine predators, and threats. We studied the movement behavior of nonbreeding Adélie penguins tracked during the 2016/2017 breeding season at King George Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. We quantify how nonbreeding penguins' horizontal moment behavior varies in relation to environmental conditions and assess the extent of spatial overlap in the foraging ranges of nonbreeders and breeders, which were tracked over several years. Nonbreeders increased their prey search and area-restricted foraging behavior as sea surface temperature and bottom depths decreased, and in response to increasing sea ice concentration. Nonbreeders tended to transit (high directional movement) over the relatively deep Central Basin of the Bransfield Strait. The majority of foraging behavior occurred within the colder, Weddell Sea–sourced water of the Antarctic Coastal Current (incubation) and in the Weddell Sea (crèche). The utilization distributions of breeders and nonbreeders overlapped in the central Bransfield Strait. Spatial segregation was greater during the crèche stage of breeding compared to incubation and brood, because chick provisioning still constrained the foraging range of breeders to a scale of a few tens of kilometers, while nonbreeders commenced with premolt foraging trips into the Weddell Sea. Our results show that breeding and nonbreeding penguins may not be impacted similarly by local environmental variability, given that their spatial and temporal scales of foraging differ during some part of the austral summer. Our study highlights the need to account for different life history stages when characterizing foraging behavior of marine predator populations. This is particularly important for “sentinel” species monitored as part of marine conservation and ecosystem-based management programs. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The Emperor Penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri), the largest extant penguin, inhabits exclusively in Antarctica. Little is known about the spine of this species; this work presents a description of the vertebral column of an adult of A. forsteri, compared with specimens from different ontogenetic stages (chick, fledgling, and juvenile). We also analyze the regionalization of the spine with a principal component analysis (PCA), and the modularity with an elliptical Fourier analysis, performing a PCA, followed by a linear discriminant analysis on the PC scores. Our results show that the vertebrae are completely ossified in adults, while the suture lines between the different elements are visible in the previous stages and some structures remain cartilaginous. A total of 42/43 vertebrae were counted (13 cervicals, 2 cervicothoracics, 6/7 thoracics, 13 synsacrals, and 8 caudals), and an extra vertebra appears in the thoracic region of one specimen. These regions are already differentiated in fledglings, but not in chicks. Six modules associated with the S-shape of the adult neck were recognized and are represented by different numbers of vertebrae: module 1 (C1), module 2 (C2), module 3 (C3–5), module 4 (C6), module 5 (C7–9) and module 6 (C10–13). Differences in the vertebral configuration in modules 5 and 6 of previous stages were found, where cervical 10 is part of module 5 due to the absence of the processus ventralis corporis. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Aspergillosis is a major fungal infection in humans and animals. Penguins (Order Spheniscidae) are particularly susceptible to aspergillosis, and aspergillosis in captive penguins is presently a major problem. We were faced with the challenge of combating aspergillosis in an aquarium. As a solution, we organized a multidisciplinary aspergillosis control team, including a medical and veterinary mycologist. Since Aspergillus, including Aspergillus fumigatus, is abundant in soil, we thought it necessary to minimize contact between captive penguins and soil to prevent aspergillosis. As a countermeasure, we stopped using a route for outdoor penguin marches where the soil was exposed. Additionally, after outdoor penguin marches, the feet of penguins were washed with seawater to avoid bringing soil into the rearing facility for penguins. Furthermore, since A. fumigatus was detected on several spots in the environment of the rearing facility by swab analysis, we cleaned and sanitized the rearing facility with 0.02% sodium hypochlorite and hot water. As a result of the above measures, there has been no incidence of aspergillosis in captive penguins since 2016. These results show that our preventive measures are working well. As shown here, we presented an example of how the multidisciplinary control team, which included a mycologist, successfully implemented preventive measures against aspergillosis. Due to changes in the rearing environment and the impact of global warming on penguins, it is expected that the role of mycologists in aspergillosis control will expand in the future. © 2022, Japanese Society for Medical Mycology.

ABSTRACT: A 10-month-old male king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus) presented with an acute episode of collapse. Complete blood count and serum biochemistry revealed a severe lymphocytic leukocytosis (white blood cell count 122.76 × 103/µl; lymphocytes 117.8 × 103/µl), elevated creatinine kinase (1414 IU/L) and mild anaemia (packed cell volume 33%). Marked hepatomegaly was noted on radiographs of the coelom. Blood smears contained an extremely high number of lymphocytes with frequent bizarre forms and a high mitotic count. Despite good initial response to treatment with steroids and prophylactic antimicrobials, the bird's lymphocytic leukocytosis increased, and the animal spontaneously died 2 weeks after initial presentation. Postmortem examination revealed infiltration of multiple organs, including bone marrow, with neoplastic lymphocytes consistent with T-cell phenotype. © 2022 British Veterinary Association.

ABSTRACT: Penguins are highly specialized divers that are expected to reflect environmental variation by adjusting their foraging behavior. We performed a comprehensive analysis of the at-sea distribution, diving, and foraging performance of Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) during the early chick-rearing period over two consecutive breeding seasons. The study was conducted at Cabo dos Bahías, (44° 54′ 50″ S; 65° 32′ 37″ W) a breeding colony located south of the latitudinal range of penguins’ main prey item Argentine anchovies (Engraulis anchoita). We also linked penguin foraging behavior to sea surface temperature (SST) to examine how birds cope with differences in oceanographic conditions. For this, we instrumented 37 adult penguins (18 in 2015 and 19 in 2016) with data loggers. In addition, we recorded chick growth in body mass during the first 12 days of life. Overall, the diving patterns of adult Magellanic penguins were similar in both breeding seasons. However, during 2015, adult breeders spent more time at the sea surface between foraging dives and performed more foraging dives per hour. The time spent foraging was higher in 2016 than in 2015. Foraging penguins also expanded their foraging range more than 100 km during 2016. Temperature records gathered by diving penguins during 2016 showed significantly higher temperatures, both at the sea surface as well as at the bottom of dives. Adults performed a higher foraging effort and chicks gained weight faster during 2016. Site-specific variability in prey distribution and abundance may be responsible for inter-seasonal discrepancies in the foraging and diving patterns. We reasoned that any environmental change could cause a shift in the distribution of anchovies, which would change the foraging behavior of penguins as they attempted to optimize their chick growth. Penguins from Cabo dos Bahías appear to face this environmental challenge with a highly sensitive at-sea foraging performance by increasing foraging effort when necessary. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: CASE DESCRIPTION A 25-year-old 4.4-kg male aquarium-hatched African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) was evaluated because of a raised 1.5 X 0.5-cm pigmented mass extending from within the right naris noted 2 days earlier. CLINICAL FINDINGS The penguin had a raised pigmented mass extending out from the right naris and onto the upper beak. Histologic examination of excisional biopsy specimens confirmed a diagnosis of malignant melanoma. A treatment plan including administration of meloxicam, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy was initiated. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME Treatment with meloxicam (0.2 mg/kg, PO, q 24 h) was initiated and continued for a total of 45 weeks; however, the medication was discontinued for a period of 6 weeks because of the risk of toxic effects in the chick that the penguin was feeding at that time. The penguin underwent local hypofractionated radiation therapy and received 4 once weekly 8-Gy fractions of radiation (total radiation dose, 32 Gy). The penguin was administered a canine melanoma vaccine transdermally every other week for 4 doses, with a booster injection given 7 months after the first dose. Treatment with the vaccine appeared to have no adverse effects. The penguin’s pre- and postvaccination tyrosinase-specific antibody titers were measured with an anti–human tyrosinase-specific ELISA, and a 3-fold titer increase indicated a positive humoral immune response to the canine melanoma vaccination. The penguin died of unrelated causes 54 weeks after initial diagnosis, and there was no evidence of metastasis on necropsy. CLINICAL RELEVANCE These case findings suggested that vaccination with a canine melanoma vaccine may be a safe and useful adjunct treatment for management of malignant melanoma in penguins. © 2022 American Veterinary Medical Association.

ABSTRACT: In this study, the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 gene, three nuclear microsatellite markers, and the MHC class II DRβ1 exon 2 were assessed for species-specific differences that would allow the diagnostic identification of Spheniscus mendiculus, S. humboldti, and S. magellanicus specimens. Analyses of reference samples for these species revealed that genetic variation at these markers showed species-specific haplotypes and alleles that can provide positive evidence for species identification. Bayesian cluster analyses demonstrated high probability of assignment (>99%) for individual samples to their corresponding species. The set of nuclear and mitochondrial markers studied proved useful for the identification of a juvenile penguin stranded on the Pacific Ocean shores of El Salvador as a Magellanic Penguin. The negative consequences of accidental captures of Magellanic Penguins by fishermen and the relocation of wildlife through human intervention are discussed. © Neotropical Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Marine predators recovering from historic, commercial, over-harvesting can create conservation challenges when they prey on vulnerable species. Pinniped predation of seabirds presents one such challenge and identifying the source colonies experiencing seal predation are needed to inform conservation management and decision planning. Here, we present a novel application of stable isotope and trace element techniques to identify the source colony of little penguins (Eudyptula minor) predated by long-nosed fur seals (Arctocephalus forsteri). We created baseline biochemical ‘feather-prints’ from feathers for six major breeding colonies across south-east Australia to compare with feathers from predated penguins recovered from seal scats. Feeding trials of captive seals confirmed that digestion of penguin feathers did not compromise stable isotope (δ13C and δ15N) or trace element (Al, Ti, Sr and Mg) signatures. The resulting biochemical ‘feather-prints’ were found to be robust in being correctly classified to local sites (78%) and broader regions (85%). The distinguishing ‘feather-prints’ appeared to be driven by industrial inputs from land, colony-specific foraging patterns and potentially proximity to oceanographic systems (i.e. upwelling). Here, we show that 46-70% of predated feathers were assigned to ‘local’ penguin colonies. We consider that the regional penguin abundances and the proximity of their colonies to seal sites, as well as demographic-specific foraging patterns may shape their contribution to seal diet at local, regional and inter-regional scales. This diagnostic tool is powerful, having broad applications identifying seabird colonies at greatest risk to pinniped predation and informing targeted, site-specific, conservation effort.

ABSTRACT: As a result of climate changes, penguins are predicted to be at risk of losing their breeding habitats. Changes in penguin colony distribution suggest that some colonies have withstood environmental changes better than others, serving as initial post-glacial settlements or refuges in adverse climatic conditions. Here we have synthesized over 200 dates (including 91 new dates) of penguin remains and of guano in 107 ornithogenic profiles from abandoned nests on Inexpressible Island, one of the longest persisting Adélie penguin colonies in Antarctica, to investigate the dynamics of population size and the role of this island in the ecological history of this species. The results indicate that, following the retreat of Ross Ice Shelf, the Adélies first colonized this island at ∼8.6 kyr BP, documenting the earliest known breeding site in the Ross Sea since deglaciation. During ∼7-3 kyr BP the reconstructed population on Inexpressible Island was generally consistent with the change in pack ice, reaching relative peaks at 5.5–5.0 and 4.0–3.5 kyr BP. After brief decline at 3.5–3.0 kyr, substantial enlargement of the penguin colony occurred between 3.0 and 1.5 kyr BP, attributed to the immigration from the abandoned colonies along the Scott Coast. During this time, the persistent efficiency of Terra Nova Bay polynya offered conditions favourable to the expansion of the penguin population on Inexpressible Island, which probably represented a refuge area under increased coastal sea-ice. This longest-dwelling penguin colony may provide a valuable refuge for the Adélie penguin if the recurrent Terra Nova Bay polynya persists under future climatic and environmental changes, as occurred in the past. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Human activity and climate change are increasing the spread of species across the planet, threatening biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Invasion engineers, such as birds, facilitate plant growth through manuring of soil, while native vegetation influences plant germination by creating suitable microhabitats which are especially valuable in cold and dry polar regions. Here we tested how penguin-derived nitrogen, several common Antarctic moss species and warming affect seed germination and growth of the non-native grass Agrostis capillaris under laboratory conditions. Experimental settings included a simulation of contemporary season-specific Antarctic light and temperature (2°C) conditions and a +5°C warming scenario. Mosses (Andreaea depressinervis, A. regularis, Sanionia uncinata and Chorisodontium aciphyllum) incorporated a range of nitrogen content and isotopic nitrogen signatures (δ15N) due to variation in sampling proximity to penguin colonies. Moss species greatly affected time to germination with consequences for further growth under the simulated Antarctic conditions. Grass seeds germinated 10 days earlier among A. regularis compared to S. uncinata and C. aciphyllum and 26 days earlier compared to A. depressinervis. Moss-specific effects are likely related to microclimatic differences within the moss canopy. Warming reduced this moss influence. Grass emerged on average 20 days earlier under warming, leading to increased leaf count (88%), plant height (112%) and biomass (145%). Positive correlations were identified between moss and grass nitrogen content (r = 0.377), grass biomass (r = 0.332) and height (r = 0.742) with stronger effects under the warming scenario. Transfer of nitrogen from moss to grass was confirmed by δ15N (r = 0.803). Overall, the results suggest a shift from temperature-limited to N-limited growth of invasive plants under increased warming in the maritime Antarctic. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: (1) Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a promising alternative to conventional antibiotics. Among AMPs, the disulfide-rich β-defensin AvBD103b, whose antibacterial activities are not inhibited by salts contrary to most other β-defensins, is particularly appealing. Information about the mechanisms of action is mandatory for the development and approval of new drugs. However, data for non-membrane-disruptive AMPs such as β-defensins are scarce, thus they still remain poorly understood. (2) We used single-cell fluorescence imaging to monitor the effects of a β-defensin (namely AvBD103b) in real time, on living E. coli, and at the physiological concentration of salts. (3) We obtained key parameters to dissect the mechanism of action. The cascade of events, inferred from our precise timing of membrane permeabilization effects, associated with the timing of bacterial growth arrest, differs significantly from the other antimicrobial compounds that we previously studied in the same physiological conditions. Moreover, the AvBD103b mechanism does not involve significant stereo-selective interaction with any chiral partner, at any step of the process. (4) The results are consistent with the suggestion that after penetrating the outer membrane and the cytoplasmic membrane, AvBD103b interacts non-specifically with a variety of polyanionic targets, leading indirectly to cell death. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Food availability and oceanographic conditions drive the distribution and movement of marine vertebrates. Tracking efforts towards seabirds usually focus on their breeding period, tagging adults in colonies. In this study, we tracked four juvenile and one adult Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) with satellite transmitters. These individuals were caught incidentally in gillnets and were tagged at sea, with the exception of the adult that was rehabilitated and released on the beach. The penguins were tracked in their wintering grounds, where behavior and oceanographic characteristics of the area used were determined. All five birds remained along the coast of southern Brazil and Uruguay in neritic waters up to 10 km offshore and 50 m in depth. The four juveniles used a mean area of 1,426 km2, travelling on average at 7.4 km/h. The high turning angles observed and mean sinuosity of 2.46 indicated that the penguins were foraging. The adult penguin covered an area of 1,033 km2, at a mean speed of 4.6 km/h, and with low sinuosity (0.43), which is suggestive of either travelling movements or an experienced hunter who needs a few turning angles to forage. The adult travelled 538 km in total, reaching a maximal distance of 465 km. Locations were obtained over a period of 7–10 days, and all five penguins remained in waters of the coastal branch of the Malvinas Current, an area characterized by cold sea surface temperatures (SST, mean = 13.4 °C) and high primary productivity. Salinity values (34.06 PSU) were also typical of the Malvinas Current and were influenced by the La Plata River plume, whose waters are low in salinity and nutrient rich. All five penguins remained near the coast probably because these waters are rich in nutrients, and carry the penguins' main prey, the Argentine anchovy (Engraulis anchoita). Regarding conservation concerns involving these penguins, we highlight the current management of the anchovy fisheries and the development of offshore windfarms that could potentially cause major disturbances to the penguins’ foraging habitat. The establishment of the Albardão National Park in the nearshore area used by the penguins is highly desirable for the protection of the species and their feeding resources. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Penguins are perhaps the most beloved birds. On land, their behavior appears so humorous and expressive that we can be excused for attributing to them moods and foibles similar to our own. Few realize how complex and mysterious their private lives truly are, as most of their existence takes place far from our prying eyes, hidden beneath the ocean waves. Now in a new, updated edition, this stunningly illustrated book provides a unique look at these extraordinary creatures and the cutting-edge science that is helping us to better understand them. Featuring more than 400 breathtaking photos, this is the ultimate guide to all 18 species of penguins, including those with retiring personalities or nocturnal habits that tend to be overlooked and rarely photographed. This revised second edition features updated scientific information and some spectacular new photographs. Penguins is the most ambitious book to date by Tui De Roy, Mark Jones, and Julie Cornthwaite. Their travels, spanning more than two decades, have seen them crisscross the southern hemisphere to virtually everywhere that penguins are found, from the sun-baked lava shores of the Galápagos to some of the remotest subantarctic islands, as well as all around the Antarctic continent, where Emperor penguins breed on the deep-frozen sea. A book that no bird enthusiast or armchair naturalist should do without, Penguins includes discussions of penguin conservation, informative species profiles, fascinating penguin facts, and tips on where to see penguins in the wild. • Covers all 18 species of the world’s penguins • Features more than 400 stunning photos • Explores the latest science on penguins and their conservation • Includes informative species profiles and fascinating penguin facts. © 2013, 2022 Tui De Roy, Mark Jones and Julie Cornthwaite.

ABSTRACT: Penguins (order Sphenisciformes, family Spheniscidae) are flightless aquatic birds commonly exhibited in aquarium and zoological facilities. Almost all species are native to the Southern Hemisphere, the exception being the Galapagos penguin that lives near the equator. In general, the 17 penguin species can be categorized into those that live in warm-temperate or cold weather zones. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

ABSTRACT: Very high-resolution satellite (VHR) imagery is a promising tool for estimating the abundance of wildlife populations, especially in remote regions where traditional surveys are limited by logistical challenges. Emperor penguins Aptenodytes forsteri were the first species to have a circumpolar population estimate derived via VHR imagery. Here we address an untested assumption from Fretwell et al. (2012) that a single image of an emperor penguin colony is a reasonable representation of the colony for the year the image was taken. We evaluated satellite-related and environmental variables that might influence the calculated area of penguin pixels to reduce uncertainties in satellite-based estimates of emperor penguin populations in the future. We focused our analysis on multiple VHR images from three representative colonies: Atka Bay, Stancomb-Wills (Weddell Sea sector) and Coulman Island (Ross Sea sector) between September and December during 2011. We replicated methods in Fretwell et al. (2012), which included using supervised classification tools in ArcGIS 10.7 software to calculate area occupied by penguins (hereafter referred to as ‘population indices’) in each image. We found that population indices varied from 2 to nearly 6-fold, suggesting that penguin pixel areas calculated from a single image may not provide a complete understanding of colony size for that year. Thus, we further highlight the important roles of: (i) sun azimuth and elevation through image resolution and (ii) penguin patchiness (aggregated vs. distributed) on the calculated areas. We found an effect of wind and temperature on penguin patchiness. Despite intra-seasonal variability in population indices, simulations indicate that reliable, robust population trends are possible by including satellite-related and environmental covariates and aggregating indices across time and space. Our work provides additional parameters that should be included in future models of population size for emperor penguins. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Drawing on ethnographic research in the Falkland Islands (Malvinas), this paper analyzes how disputed oil interests become embedded in data infrastructures for environmental governance. Nearly four decades after a war that cemented the South Atlantic archipelago’s British status, offshore oil discoveries have led Argentina's government to renew its sovereignty claim, arguing that the islands are within its waters. Nonetheless, the British Falkland Islands Government (FIG) has licensed unilateral drilling. Centering on a “data gap” project, financed by the FIG and its oil licensees, the article describes how marine ecologists tag penguins with tracking sensors, as part of a new geographic data infrastructure for the South Atlantic. Data representing penguin foraging are supposed to feed into environmental impact assessments for oil exploration. The article demonstrates how these data and confidence ratings in environmental impact statements reinforce access to and control over maritime territory and resources. Extending recent claims that data have become key actors within environmental governance networks, this research finds that particular data practices may actually enhance fossil fuel industry interests through measures of transparency, leaving ambiguous matters related to transboundary impacts and local pollution unresolved. © The Author(s) 2019.

ABSTRACT: Penguins are one of the key components of the Antarctic ecosystem. Changes in penguin population size can indicate Antarctic ecosystem change. The two species of pygoscelid penguins, Adélie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and Gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) penguins, breed sympatrically on Ardley Island, King George Island, Antarctica. However, there has been an increase in the Gentoo penguin breeding population and a decline in the Adélie penguin breeding population on the island. Whether the difference in population fluctuations between the two penguin groups is connected to their diet remains uncertain. Herein, the 18S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (18S rRNA) and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) genes were sequenced from penguin feces using the Illumina MiSeq platform to investigate the fecal eukaryote composition of the two pygoscelid penguin groups to obtain insight into their diets. Significant differences in the abundance of Tardigrada and Rotifera sequences in the fecal eukaryote composition were observed between the Adélie and Gentoo groups. A range of food groups, including Actinopteri, Bivalvia, Coscinodiscophyceae, Florideophyceae, Haptophyceae, Hydrozoa, Malacostraca, and Phaeophyceae, were discovered in the penguin diets. Euphausia was the most important component of the diets of both Pygoscelis penguins. Compared with Adélie penguins, which showed a higher abundance of Actinopteri, Gentoo penguins presented a higher percentage of Euphausiidae in their diet. The COI gene is a more suitable taxonomic marker than the 18S rRNA gene for the dietary analysis of penguins. The results allowed the dietary components of Adélie and Gentoo penguins on Ardley Island to be characterized. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To evaluate the agreement between 3 point-of-care (POC) devices and a reference laboratory for measuring β-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB) concentration in African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) whole blood (WB) and plasma samples and the precision of each POC device for measuring β-HB concentration in plasma samples. ANIMALS 48 healthy African penguins. PROCEDURES Blood was obtained from the right jugular vein of each penguin, and β-HB concentration was measured on each POC device using fresh WB and heparinized plasma and at the reference laboratory using plasma. β-HB concentration was measured in plasma on each POC device. RESULTS All devices overestimated serum β-HB concentrations on average by 0.46 mM relative to the reference laboratory. WB samples had less error than plasma for meters A and C. Meter A had the lowest total error observed (26.4%) and the lowest mean difference (0.19 mmol/L) relative to the reference laboratory. Controlling for other factors, the magnitude of disagreement was not affected by sex, age, packed cell volume, or serum total solids concentration. CLINICAL RELEVANCE WB, not plasma, should be used for measurement of β-HB concentration on the POC meters tested. Meter A showed good correlation with the reference laboratory for WB. The use of POC devices for the measurement of β-HB concentration may be acceptable when laboratory analyzers are not available. Further research is needed for clinical application and the diagnostic value of POC meters compared with reference laboratories. © 2022, American Veterinary Medical Association. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Ecological segregation has been documented between males and females in different populations of seabirds. Moreover, foraging behaviour and diet have been associated with markers of oxidative status, and have been suggested to be a driver of sex-biased oxidative costs of reproduction in wild marine vertebrates. Nevertheless, the ecological role of sex driving such associations has been little studied. We, therefore, examined whether foraging habitat (δ13C), trophic level (δ15N), dietary antioxidants (retinol and α-tocopherol) and oxidative status (antioxidant capacity and oxidative damage, ROM) were ecologically segregated by sex in Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) breeding in Peninsula Valdés (Argentina) visualizing the isotopic, dietary antioxidant, and oxidative status Bayesian spaces as proxies for ecological niches. Our results suggest that specific sexual segregation by ecological niche partially drives the relation between foraging, dietary antioxidants, and oxidative status. The dietary antioxidant niche showed females with extremely low α-tocopherol levels relative to males, although retinol values seemed to be similar between sexes. Higher trophic levels preys (high δ15N) were positively associated with α-tocopherol in males suggesting that their greater dependence on the Argentinian hake (a benthopelagic fish rich in α-tocopherol) led to a higher absorption of specific dietary antioxidants than females. In addition, a positive relation between α-tocopherol and ROMs in males suggested that their benthic foraging was associated with greater oxidative damage, and that higher levels of alpha-tocopherol in benthopelagic fish were not sufficient to prevent higher levels of oxidative damage associated with the consumption of such fish. Overall, sex-biased dietary antioxidant niche linked with sex-specific ecological segregation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Aims: To survey the diversity of fungal species that may be cultured from Antarctic penguins and pinnipeds, and to test the in vitro susceptibility to triazole drugs of any medically important Aspergillus spp. isolates. Methods: During an expedition to Argentinean Antarctic research stations at Potter Peninsula (South Shetland Islands) and Primavera Cape (Antarctic Peninsula) in February 2019, samples (n = 212) were collected from fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella), elephant seals (Mirounga leonine), leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx), Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) and crabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophaga) and gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua). Oral, nasal and rectal swabs and skin/hair brushings were collected from pinnipeds, and skin/feather brushings, cloacal swabs and moulted feathers from penguins. Samples were cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar and/or potato dextrose agar plates and fungal isolates identified by morphological criteria followed by PCR amplification and DNA sequencing. Antifungal susceptibility of Aspergillus spp. isolates to triazoles was tested. Results: Fungi from 21 genera were isolated from 121/212 (57.1%) samples obtained from pinnipeds and penguins. Among pinnipeds from Potter Peninsula (fur seals and elephant seals), the most frequent fungal species were Debaryomyces hansenii and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, isolated from the oral, nasal and/or rectal mucosa, and Antarctomyces psychrotrophicus isolated from the skin/hair of all sampled individuals. Among pinnipeds from Primavera Cape (leopard seals, Weddell seals and crabeater seals), the most frequent fungal species were Naganishia adeliensis and Cryptococcus neoformans var. uniguttulatus, isolated from the nasal/oral mucosa of 4/33 (15.2%) and 5/33 (12.1%) animals, respectively. The most frequently isolated fungal species from gentoo penguins (Potter Peninsula), were Pseudogymnoascus pannorum and A. pyschrotrophicus, which both were isolated from skin/feathers of 7/15 (46.7%) birds, and Thelebolus microsporus, isolated from the cloacal mucosa and skin/feathers of 5/15 (33.3%) and 2/15 (13.3%) birds, respectively. Fungi that are potentially pathogenic to both humans and animals (Aspergillus fumigatus, Asp. flavus, Asp. versicolor, Candida parapsilosis and Microsporum canis) were isolated from 4/38 (10.5%), 1/38 (2.6%), 2/38 (5.3%), 4/38 (10.5%) and 2/38 (5.3%) sampled pinnipeds, respectively. Only non-azole-resistant isolates of Asp. fumigatus and Asp. flavus were identified. Conclusions: The fungal biodiversity in Antarctic pinnipeds and gentoo penguins was explored using standard mycological culture followed by PCR and DNA sequencing. The frequency of fungal carriage varied among animal species, sample type and location.

ABSTRACT: If not carefully managed, harvesting of Antarctic krill risks disturbing the ecological balance of many Antarctic and sub-Antarctic sites where krill-dependent predators feed. One of the least disturbed sites anywhere within the Southern Ocean and one where krill fishing has so far been virtually non-existent is the South Sandwich Islands volcanic archipelago. Some of the main krill predators breeding at the South Sandwich Islands are penguins, with five species breeding on the islands, the dominant species of which is the chinstrap penguin. In this paper we report on the results of ARGOS PTT deployments during the chinstrap penguin chick-rearing period, using the recorded foraging trips to develop habitat models. Foraging habitats used by chinstrap penguins during this period were best characterised by distance from the colony and sea surface temperature and, using these two covariates, we predicted the chick-rearing foraging habitat use around all islands. We show that the provisions of the South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands Marine Protected Area ensure that chinstrap penguins, and other krill-dependent predators with similar foraging ranges, likely have robust protection during the summer. During the winter, when krill predators are likely to forage further offshore, seasonal sea ice provides a physical barrier to exclude the fishery, again ensuring the islands’ unique biodiversity receives strong protection. However, to the north of the marginal sea ice zone, competition between krill predators and the fishery could exist if the fishery were ever to explore new locations for resource extraction. We make a number of conclusions, including the need for winter tracking data to inform future management options. © 2022 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Mabé pearl culture has become a significant addition to traditional rural livelihood activities in Tonga and in other south Pacific countries. Mabé pearl culture is a low-cost, low-tech alternative to round pearl culture, can be undertaken by local people with minimal training, and has considerable potential for value adding through production of jewellery and handicraft items. Mabé pearls are produced by attaching hemispherical nuclei to the inner shell surface of pearl oysters where subsequent coverage with nacre (mother of pearl) produces commercial pearls after a culture period of around 12 months. Traditionally, local mabé pearl farmers attempt to maximise pearl output by implanting four high-profile nuclei into each oyster. Recent research has indicated that fewer nuclei, and those with lower profile, may improve the overall quality of resulting mabé pearls and this has been adopted as best-practice by Tongan mabé pearl farmers. This study reports an economic comparison of these two nucleus implanting arrangements. Results showed that annual returns were not dissimilar with the traditional implanting method (four high-profile nuclei) generating USD 6977 per annum, while the recommended best-practice method (two low-profile, one high-profile nuclei) generated USD 6795 per annum. While the traditional method may generate potentially higher annual returns, there are two key considerations that favour the best-practice method: (1) reduced labour commitment that provides opportunity to engage in other livelihood activities; and (2) the production of a higher grade of pearls is more supportive of developing high value export markets for Tongan mabé pearls. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The reservoirs for NDM-producing Enterobacterales are increasing, not only in hospitals, but also in the environment and in the community, challenging the therapeutic efficacy of carbapenems. We aimed to characterize an isolate of Escherichia coli harboring the blaNDM-1 gene recovered from the bloodstream of a penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) in Southern Brazil. A total of 74 bacterial isolates recovered from arterial blood samples from dead birds were submitted to species identification and antibiotic susceptibility evaluation. One isolate presented resistance to carbapenems (E. coli 89PenNDM) and proved to harbor the blaNDM-1 gene by multiplex high-resolution melting real-time PCR (PCR-HRM). Conjugation experiments indicated that the blaNDM-1 was transmissible to E. coli J53. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) confirmed the presence of the blaNDM-1 gene in a conjugative plasmid (IncA/C2 plasmid) in both the E. coli 89PenNDM and its transconjugants. The isolate was classified as ST 156 and many other resistance genes (e.g., sul1, sul,2, strA, floR, tet(A)) were identified, all carried in the same IncA/C2 plasmid. This is the first report of blaNDM-1-producing E. coli isolated from a penguin in the Brazilian seacoast. The presence of a carbapenemase gene in wildlife animals is of concern as they may become reservoirs of multidrug-resistant bacteria and disseminate them to the environment. © 2021, Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia.

ABSTRACT: The diet of Adélie penguins, Pygoscelis adeliae, is a useful indicator in understanding the ecological conditions of their habitats. The diets of Adélie penguins were studied using metabarcoding and quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyses of fecal DNA from seven habitats along the Ross Sea region. Using metabarcoding analysis with dual universal primers (18Sv9 and miniFish), the overall diet composition and detailed information about piscine prey were clearly elucidated. It was found that two krill species (Euphausia superba and Euphausia crystallorophias) and notothenioid fish were the most abundant in the diets of Adélie penguins. Among the notothenioid prey, Pleuragramma antarctica (56.50%) and Pagothenia borchgrevinki (18.21%) were the two most abundant species. qPCR analysis showed a significant geographic difference in the composition of main prey. Penguins inhabiting outbound parts of the Ross Sea (Capes Adare (CA) and Duke of York Island (DY)) mainly preyed on E. superba, without any significant changes in prey composition. By contrast, those inhabiting the inbound parts of the Ross Sea (Edmonson Point (EP) and Inexpressible Island (II)) preyed on E. crystallorophias and notothenioid fish rather than E. superba. Compared with the outbound habitats, prey compositions for penguins inhabiting the inbound regions were significantly different year to year, which was presumably due to the food availability based on the annual environmental and meteorological conditions of the coastal region along with the inbound parts of the Ross Sea. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The Ross Sea, Antarctica, supports large populations of Emperor Penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) and Adélie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae), two key meso-predators that occupy high trophic levels. Despite these species are largely studied, little is known about their diet outside the breeding period. In the present study, we investigated the intra-annual diet of Adélie and Emperor Penguins belonging to five colonies in the Ross Sea through the stable isotope analysis of different tissues (feathers and shell membranes), synthetized in different seasons, and guano that indicates recent diet. Penguin samples and prey (krill and fish) were collected during the Antarctic spring–summer. δ13C and δ15N of tissues and guano indicate spatio-temporal variation in the penguin diet. The krill consumption by Adélie Penguins was lowest in winter except in the northernmost colony, where it was always very high. It peaked in spring and remained prevalent in summer. The greatest krill contribution to Emperor Penguin’s diet occurred in summer. The relative krill and fish consumption by both species changed in relation to the prey availability, which is influenced by seasonal sea ice dynamics, and according to the penguin life cycle phases. The results highlight a strong trophic plasticity in the Adélie Penguin, whose dietary variability has been already recognized, and in the Emperor Penguin, which had not previously reported. Our findings can help understand how these species might react to resource variation due to climate change or anthropogenic overexploitation. Furthermore, data provides useful basis for future comparisons in the Ross Sea MPA and for planning conservation actions. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: According to central place foraging theory, animals will only increase the distance of their foraging trips if more distant prey patches offer better foraging opportunities. Thus, theory predicts that breeding seabirds in large colonies could create a zone of food depletion around the colony, known as “Ashmole’s halo”. However, seabirds’ decisions to forage at a particular distance are likely also complicated by their breeding stage. After chicks hatch, parents must return frequently to feed their offspring, so may be less likely to visit distant foraging patches, even if their quality is higher. However, the interaction between prey availability, intra-specific competition, and breeding stage on the foraging decisions of seabirds is not well understood. The aim of this study was to address this question in chinstrap penguins Pygoscelis antarcticus breeding at a large colony. In particular, we aimed to investigate how breeding stage affects foraging strategy; whether birds foraging far from the colony visit higher quality patches than available locally; and whether there is evidence for intraspecific competition, indicated by prey depletions near the colony increasing over time, and longer foraging trips. Methods: We used GPS and temperature-depth recorders to track the foraging movements of 221 chinstrap penguins from 4 sites at the South Orkney Islands during incubation and brood. We identified foraging dives and calculated the index of patch quality based on time allocation during the dive to assess the quality of the foraging patch. Results: We found that chinstrap penguin foraging distance varied between stages, and that trips became shorter as incubation progressed. Although patch quality was lower near the colony than at more distant foraging patches, patch quality near the colony improved over the breeding season. Conclusions: These results suggest chinstrap penguin foraging strategies are influenced by both breeding stage and prey distribution, and the low patch quality near the colony may be due to a combination of depletion by intraspecific competition but compensated by natural variation in prey. Reduced trip durations towards the end of the incubation period may be due to an increase in food availability, as seabirds time their reproduction so that the period of maximum energy demand in late chick-rearing coincides with maximum resource availability in the environment. This may also explain why patch quality around the colony improved over the breeding season. Overall, our study sheds light on drivers of foraging decisions in colonial seabirds, an important question in foraging ecology. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: Diving marine predators forage in a three-dimensional environment, adjusting their horizontal and vertical movement behaviour in response to environmental conditions and the spatial distribution of prey. Expectations regarding horizontal-vertical movements are derived from optimal foraging theories, however, inconsistent empirical findings across a range of taxa suggests these behavioural assumptions are not universally applicable. Methods: Here, we examined how changes in horizontal movement trajectories corresponded with diving behaviour and marine environmental conditions for a ubiquitous Southern Ocean predator, the Adélie penguin. Integrating extensive telemetry-based movement and environmental datasets for chick-rearing Adélie penguins at Béchervaise Island, we tested the relationships between horizontal move persistence (continuous scale indicating low [‘resident’] to high [‘directed’] movement autocorrelation), vertical dive effort and environmental variables. Results: Penguins dived continuously over the course of their foraging trips and lower horizontal move persistence corresponded with less intense foraging activity, likely indicative of resting behaviour. This challenges the traditional interpretation of horizontal-vertical movement relationships based on optimal foraging models, which assumes increased residency within an area translates to increased foraging activity. Movement was also influenced by different environmental conditions during the two stages of chick-rearing: guard and crèche. These differences highlight the strong seasonality of foraging habitat for chick-rearing Adélie penguins at Béchervaise Island. Conclusions: Our findings advance our understanding of the foraging behaviour for this marine predator and demonstrates the importance of integrating spatial location and behavioural data before inferring habitat use. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: In a scientifically-transformative project, South Africa implemented a decade-long field experiment to understand how fisheries may be affecting its most iconic seabird, the African penguin Spheniscus demersus. This unique effort prohibits the take of anchovy and sardine within relatively small areas around four African penguin breeding colonies, two in the Benguela upwelling ecosystem and two in the adjacent Agulhas region. For the Benguela, fisheries closures within the birds' primary foraging range increased their breeding productivity and perhaps reduced parental foraging efforts, indicating that the fisheries are competing with the birds for food. Results were less clear for foraging behaviour in the Agulhas, but no data on breeding success were collected there. The African penguin is endangered, its population continues to decline, and fisheries closures have been demonstrated to improve demographic traits that contribute to population growth. Therefore, given the critical status of the species, fisheries closures should be maintained, at least at Dassen Island where the population has great capacity to expand and support other nearby colonies. Continuing or implementing corresponding fisheries closures in the Agulhas region is also warranted, as well as creating and testing the value of pelagic closed areas during the non-breeding season when the penguins disperse widely across these ecosystems. These management actions would increase penguin food supplies and may help to meet societal goals of halting the decline of the penguin population, as well as maintaining the economic and cultural services provided by fisheries and ecotourism.  © 2021 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

ABSTRACT: Skeletal elements of the penguin eye and their functional and phylogenetic implications (Aves: Sphenisciformes: Spheniscidae). Journal of morphology, 282, 874–886. In this paper, mention was made of a bone in the posterior portion of the eye for which we used the term ‘os opticus’. This name has been widely used for this bone, as has ‘Gemminger's ossicle’ and ‘os nervi optici’ (Baumel, 1993; Franz-Odendaal & Vickaryous, 2006; Tiemeier, 1950). However, it has been brought to the authors' attention that the term ‘os opticus’ is grammatically incorrect. The singular should be ‘os opticum’ and the plural ‘ossa optica’, as ‘os’ is a Latin third declension neuter noun and ‘opticus, -a, -um’ an adjective. The latter is not a classical Latin word but rather derives from the Greek ‘ὄψις’ and was adopted into Latin at some point. But that transference from Greek to Latin is common. Therefore the following should be noted: p. 874 (abstract) ‘os opticus’ should be ‘os opticum’ p. 875 (x3, introduction) ‘os opticus’ should be ‘os opticum’ p. 875 (introduction) ‘ossa optica’ is correct p. 875 (introduction) ‘os optici’ should be ‘ossa optica’ p. 875 (methods), ‘os opticus’ should be ‘os opticum’ p. 879 (results) ‘os opticus’ should be ‘os opticum’ p. 881 (results) ‘os opticus’ should be ‘os opticum’ p. 884 (x2, Fig. 11 caption) ‘os opticus’ should be ‘os opticum’ p. 885 (x3, discussion) ‘os opticus’ should be ‘os opticum’ Peter W.

ABSTRACT: Stable isotopes are widely used in ecosystem studies to decipher trophic relationships between species. Using stable isotopes as trophic markers requires knowledge of the stable isotope ratios of consumer and putative prey, and of trophic discrimination factors (TDFs), the difference between the stable isotope ratios of predator and prey. TDFs differ among species, tissue sampled and the consumer’s physiological state. We tested whether consumer ontogeny also influences its stable isotope ratios by measuring the δ13C and δ15N values, and their associated TDFs, of African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) blood components (whole blood, red blood cells, plasma) among four age classes (chicks, fledglings, juveniles and adults). Blood was sampled from captive penguins concurrently with their diet. Ontogenetic effects on TDFs were complex, depending on the blood component and isotope considered. Blood components differed in their sensitivity to consumer physiology, but TDFs for both carbon and nitrogen were generally lower for the younger age classes. Age class influenced the stable isotope compositions of whole blood and red blood cells with chicks and fledglings exhibiting significantly lower δ13C and δ15N values than juveniles and adults. Plasma showed no effect of ontogeny. The results indicate age class affects stable isotope ratios and TDFs through ontogenetic changes in physiology. Therefore, when uncertainty concerning TDFs exists in studies of wild animals, stable isotope analysis should preferably be combined with other dietary techniques. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The effects of an injectable anesthesia with 0.05 mg/kg medetomidine, 5 mg/kg ketamine, and 0.5 mg/kg butorphanol administered together intramuscularly were evaluated in 22 captive Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti, 10 male and 12 female), with a mean age of 8.5 ± 8.23 years. The birds fasted for18-24 hours prior to the procedure. Induction was followed by 4 distinct progressive responses of the birds to the anesthetic effect, including onset of initial effects at 2.0 ± 1.7 minutes (x ± SD), sternal recumbency with the head still elevated at 2.2 ± 1.6 minutes, lowering and placing the beak tip to the ground at 3.6 ± 3.4 minutes, and lateral positioning of the neck and head at 4.2 ± 3.4 minutes. A general state of sedation, muscle relaxation, and analgesia were noted 10.0 ± 2.8 minutes postinjection. However, according to an established scoring system for the assessment of anesthetic depth in avian patients, a surgical plane of anesthesia was not achieved. Muscle relaxation determined by the same scoring system lasted for 31.4 ± 17.1 minutes. The penguins' mean respiratory rate did not demonstrate significant change and spontaneous ventilation was present throughout the procedure. Relative peripheral arterial oxygen saturation decreased significantly from 92.83 ± 5.77% at 10 minutes to 90.91 ± 5.77% at 40 minutes following induction. The birds' heart rate also decreased significantly from 112.55 ± 23.97 beats/min at 10 minutes to 101.65 ± 25.42 beats/min at 40 minutes. The measured cloacal temperatures were maintained within normal range despite ambient temperatures of up to 28.3°C (82.9°F). Reversal of medetomidine with 0.25 mg/kg atipamezole was conducted after 45.1 ± 7.3 minutes. Recovery was smooth but of variable duration with patients being able or willing to stand steadily in an upright position after 50.1 ± 34.6 minutes. One penguin died during recovery from a ruptured left ventricle and consecutive pericardial tamponade, but no predisposing factors were identified. The anesthetic protocol proved to be effective for noninvasive and minor painful procedures (eg, diagnostic imaging, blood collection). Disadvantages to the administration of the combined anesthetic agents in the penguins included a short period of muscle relaxation and smooth but potentially prolonged recovery. The safety of the anesthetic protocol described for Humboldt penguins in this report has to be evaluated critically against the the death of 1 penguin during recovery. © 2021 Association of Avian Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: African Penguins Spheniscus demersus are endangered and declining seabirds which make extensive use of vocal signals for intra-specific vocal communication. Accordingly, passive acoustic monitoring tools could be developed as robust population monitoring methods that cause minimal disturbance to the birds. In this study, we collected soundscape recordings at the Stony Point penguin colony (Betty’s Bay, South Africa) during the breeding season in 2019 to document the circadian rhythms of vocal activity of this species and to investigate whether the magnitude of variation of three different ecoacoustic indices correlates with the number of ecstatic and mutual display songs counted in recordings, which might inform on the breeding activity of the colony. Indeed, whereas ecstatic display songs are produced by males during intersexual competition and territorial defence, mutual display songs are given by parents returning to the nest after foraging trips. We found that the vast majority of the display songs (> 80%) occurred between 04:00–08:00 and 17:30–21:30 h. We also found that the Acoustic Entropy Index was a good predictor of the number of penguins’ songs within a recording. Overall, our study shows that African Penguins vocalizations have the potential to assist the monitoring of this species while minimizing disturbance. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The period of emancipation in seabirds, when juveniles change from a terrestrial existence to a life at sea, is associated with many challenges. Apart from finding favourable foraging sites, they have to develop effective prey search patterns and physiological capacities that enable them to capture sufficient prey to meet their energetic needs. Animals that dive to forage, such as king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus), need to acquire an adequate breath-hold capacity, allowing them to locate and capture prey at depth. To investigate the ontogeny of their dive capacity and foraging performance, we implanted juvenile king penguins before their first departure to sea and also adult breeders with a data-logger recording pressure and temperature. We found that juvenile king penguins possess a remarkable dive capacity when leaving their natal colony, enabling them to conduct dives in excess of 100 m within their first week at sea. Despite this, juvenile dive/foraging performance, investigated in relation to dive depth, remained below the adult level throughout their first year at sea, probably reflecting physiological limitations as a result of incomplete maturation. A significantly shallower foraging depth of juveniles, particularly during their first 5 months at sea, could also indicate differences in foraging strategy and targeted prey. The initially greater wiggle rate suggests that juveniles fed opportunistically and also targeted different prey from adults and/or that many of the wiggles of juveniles reflect unsuccessful prey-capture attempts, indicating a lower foraging proficiency. After 5 months, this difference disappeared, suggesting sufficient physical maturation and improvement of juvenile foraging skills. © 2021. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd

ABSTRACT: A large part of the Antarctic surface is covered by lichens since they can withstand extreme environmental conditions. Lichens are primary colonizers and contribute to soil formation by deteriorating rocks through a combination of chemical and physical mechanisms. Therefore, fossil remains found exposed on the surface are usually colonized by epilithic and endolithic lichens. The objective of this work is to determine the biodeterioration generated by lichens on fossil remains and its taphonomic implications. We identified the presence of the euendolithic lichens Lecidea andersonii and Athallia holocarpa growing into fossil penguin bones from Antarctica. The bioerosive damage was evaluated using light and electron microscopic techniques. Pits corresponding to apothecium and sinuous thin fissures remodeled, or in some cases produced, by hyphae were distinguished from the cracks originating from physical weathering. The maximum depth that hyphae extend inside the bone, probably constrained by the light supply, was established to be 2.5 mm. We provided a tool for the reconstruction of the chronology of the taphonomic events, describing the type and magnitude of the damage into the bones. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Species extinction risk is accelerating due to anthropogenic climate change, making it urgent to protect vulnerable species through legal frameworks in order to facilitate conservation actions that help mitigate risk. Here, we discuss fundamental concepts for assessing climate change risks to species using the example of the emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri), currently being considered for protection under the US Endangered Species Act (ESA). This species forms colonies on Antarctic sea ice, which is projected to significantly decline due to ongoing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We project the dynamics of all known emperor penguin colonies under different GHG emission scenarios using a climate-dependent meta-population model including the effects of extreme climate events based on the observational satellite record of colonies. Assessments for listing species under the ESA require information about how species resiliency, redundancy and representation (3Rs) will be affected by threats within the foreseeable future. Our results show that if sea ice declines at the rate projected by climate models under current energy system trends and policies, the 3Rs would be dramatically reduced and almost all colonies would become quasi-extinct by 2100. We conclude that the species should be listed as threatened under the ESA. © 2021 The Authors. Global Change Biology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: For top consumers in marine environments, trophic discrimination factors (∆13C and ∆15N) between food and consumers’ tissues are expected to be similar among related species. However, few studies conducted in the laboratory indicate a large variability among species, which should be potentially higher in free-ranging animals. Here, we test for differences in tissue-specific ∆13C and ∆15N values of two wild penguin species (Chinstrap Pygoscelis antarctica and Gentoo P. papua) breeding in sympatry at Livingston Island, Antarctica. A total of 41 adults and 28 chicks, and food items comprised exclusively by Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba, n = 22) in Chinstraps and almost exclusively in Gentoos, were sampled for stable isotope analyses. Overall, Δ13C values varied between -1.8 and 4.0 ‰ and Δ15N values ranged from 1.2 to 6.1 ‰, and these differed between species, tissues and age-classes. Δ13C in adult penguins differed between species for feather and blood. Species-specific differences in Δ13C and Δ15N were seen in chick nail and muscle, while only Δ13C values differed between species in feathers. Our results show that trophic discrimination factors can differ substantially between closely related species consuming similar prey, especially in Δ13C value. Variation in Δ13C was driven by species, tissue and age-class, while variation in Δ15N was mostly driven by tissue type. Trophic discrimination factors may be associated to physiological and/or stress factors which may fluctuate in the wild, and this was particularly evident on chicks. This study highlights the use of diet-specialised species for the determination of trophic discrimination factors in the wild. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: We examined a set of penguin bones from different Eocene levels of the Submeseta Formation in Marambio/Seymour Island (James Ross Basin, Antarctic Peninsula) and found the bioerosive traces fossils presented here. Traces were assigned to ?Machichnus bohemicus, Machichnus indeterminate, Nihilichnus nihilicus, Centrichnidae indeterminate, and other ambiguous structures grouped into morphologic descriptive categories such as ‘shallow pits with radial scratches’, ‘indeterminate tunnels’, ‘rounded to sub-rounded shallow holes’, ‘oval deep traces’. According to the possible interpretations of these trace fossils, the taphonomic history of the remains, although different in all the cases, would include the primary deposition in a marine environment, transportation and subaerial exposure. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Avian orthoavulavirus 1 (AOaV-1) causes Newcastle disease, one of the most important and contagious infections in poultry, where migratory birds can play a key role as a reservoir. Seven hundred and seven serum samples were collected from five penguin species (King, Magellanic, Gentoo, Chinstrap and Adelie penguins) in the Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic zones. Using a competitive ELISA to detect antibodies against AOaV-1, we identified positive individuals in all penguin species. The Magellanic penguin showed the highest seropositivity rate (30.3%), suggesting it could be a natural reservoir of this virus. At the Antarctic zones, Chinstrap penguin showed the highest occurrence (7.5%). Interesting, positive sera was only obtained in Sub-Antarctic and Northern zones at the Antarctic peninsula, no seroreactivity was observed in Southern locations. Further studies are needed to establish the role of these penguin species in the epidemiology of the AOaV-1 and determine the effects of this virus in these populations. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH

ABSTRACT: Physio-logging has the potential to explore the processes that underlie the dive behavior and ecology of marine mammals and seabirds, as well as evaluate their adaptability to environmental change and other stressors. Regulation of heart rate lies at the core of the physiological processes that determine dive capacity and performance. The bio-logging of heart rate in unrestrained animals diving at sea was infeasible, even unimaginable in the mid-1970s. To provide a historical perspective, I review my 40-year experience in the development of heart rate physio-loggers and the evolution of a digital electrocardiogram (ECG) recorder that is still in use today. I highlight documentation of the ECG and the interpretation of heart rate profiles in the largest of avian and mammalian divers, the emperor penguin and blue whale. © Copyright © 2021 Ponganis.

ABSTRACT: Aim: Delimiting recently diverged species is challenging. During speciation, genetic differentiation may be distributed unevenly across the genome, as different genomic regions can be subject to different selective pressures and evolutionary histories. Reliance on limited numbers of genetic markers that may be underpowered can make species delimitation even more challenging, potentially resulting in taxonomic inconsistencies. Rockhopper penguins of the genus Eudyptes comprise three broadly recognized taxa: northern (E. moseleyi), southern (E. chrysocome) and eastern rockhopper (E. filholi). Their taxonomic status has been controversial for decades, with researchers disagreeing about whether E. chrysocome and E. filholi are distinct species or conspecific. Our goal is to evaluate genome-wide patterns of divergence to evaluate genetic differentiation and species delimitation in rockhopper penguins, and to assess which mechanisms may underlie previous discordance among nuclear versus mitochondrial analyses. Location: Sub-Antarctic and temperate coastal regions of the Southern Hemisphere. Methods: We generated reduced-representation genomic libraries using double digest restriction-site associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing to evaluate genetic differentiation, contemporary migration rates and admixture among colonies of rockhopper penguins. Results: The extent of genetic differentiation among the three taxa was consistently higher than population-level genetic differentiation found within these and other penguin species. There was no evidence of admixture among the three taxa, suggesting the absence of ongoing gene flow among them. Species delimitation analyses based on molecular data, along with other lines of evidence, provide strong support for the taxonomic distinction of three species of rockhopper penguins. Main conclusions: Our results provide strong support for the existence of three distinct species of rockhopper penguins. The recognition of this taxonomic diversity is crucial for the management and conservation of this widely distributed species group. This study illustrates that widespread dispersive seabird lineages lacking obvious morphological differences may nevertheless have complex evolutionary histories and comprise cryptic species diversity. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: We developed a reliable noninvasive PCR method for sex identification of the Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) based on the amplification of the chromobox-helicase DNA-binding (CHD) gene. Two sets of nested primers (F1/R1, F2/R2) were designed to amplify the introns of the CHD1W and CHD1Z genes. The fecal samples were lysed in an optimized lysis reagent containing PCR buffer. The fecal lysate was employed as the template DNA to perform PCR amplification. Following nested PCR, agarose gel electrophoresis was performed, and the amplicons exhibited a sex-specific band pattern (211 bp and 315 bp in females, 211 bp in males). There was no amplification failure of our specific primers in 14 tested samples (7 males and 7 females), and the results of genotypic identification matched the records of sex based on oviposition behavior and pairing combination (based on the monogamy of the Gentoo penguin). The preliminary results showed that these nested primers could also be used for sex identification of Chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica) and King penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus). In conclusion, we successfully sexed Gentoo penguins using DNA extracted from fecal samples and performed nested PCR of sex-specific CHD genes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

ABSTRACT: Multiple occurrences of yolk sac retention prompted a retrospective investigation in a recently formed colony of captive Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti). Necropsy reports of 141 parent-reared penguin chicks that died between January 2014 and December 2018 were reviewed for evidence of yolk sac retention, defined as the presence of a yolk sac at postmortem examination of a chick aged 7 d or greater, and analyzed by demographic and pathological variables for identification of risk factors. Fifty-nine (65%) chicks that died at age 7 d or greater had a retained yolk sac at postmortem examination, revealing that this was a common condition in penguins in this population. Chicks that retained their yolk sac were also more likely to present with minimal gut contents (P ¼ 0.02), have a prominent bursa of Fabricius (P, 0.01), and be the first chick hatched of their clutch (P ¼ 0.02). Parental experience and age were not predictive of yolk sac retention, but there was a trend for chicks with retained yolk sacs to present with a poorer body condition, reduced weight, and reduced crown-rump length compared to chicks without a retained yolk sac. Histopathological and bacteriological findings of retained yolk sacs were not significantly different from those of chicks under 7 d of age. Although likely to be multifactorial, the association between yolk sac retention and indicators of suboptimal feed intake and growth (empty gastrointestinal tract, poor body condition score, decreased crown-rump length, and decreased weight at death) is hypothesized to be a result of parental neglect, leading to starvation and absorption arrest of the yolk, as previously indicated in broiler chicks. © 2021 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians

ABSTRACT: Currently, more than 20% (51/240) of zoos and aquariums accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums house African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) in their collections. The African penguin Species Survival Plan (SSP) veterinary advisors regularly collect information from those facilities to characterize morbidity and mortality for this species and to collate preventative medicine and treatment regimens. These efforts resulted in more than 10 yr of collection of management data across the SSP, representing the care and management of more than a thousand birds. The most common morbidities reported included those of dermatologic (27%, 125/452 institutions) and musculoskeletal or neurologic (18%, 82/452 institutions) disease, while the most common causes of mortality were respiratory diseases (20%, 65/323 deaths) and systemic or multifactorial conditions (19%, 62/323 deaths). Aspergillosis cases accounted for 69% (45/65 deaths) of respiratory-related mortality and avian malaria cases comprised 31% (19/62 deaths) of mortality related to systemic diseases. Mortality was most commonly reported in geriatric birds, or those older than 15 yr of age (34%, 111/323 deaths). Reproductive related mortality was only defined in female birds, while other causes of death were more evenly distributed between sexes. Utilizing the SSP data to determine morbidity and mortality trends within this population provides important information to veterinary and animal care teams, allowing them to provide enhanced levels of care to the penguins housed at their institutions. By recognizing the most important diseases and causes of death in this species, management and healthcare resources can target conditions with the highest impact on the population.  © Copyright 2021 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Understanding the movements of animals that spend much of their life at sea is difficult but important for effective conservation. Determining the at-sea distributions of Macaroni (Eudyptes chrysolophus) and Royal (Eudyptes schlegeli) Penguins poses particular challenges, including their occurrence in remote locations and difficulties in species identification owing to overlap in morphological characters, particularly in immature birds. Here we use DNA sequencing to examine vagrant Macaroni and Royal Penguins from Antarctica and New Zealand in order to improve understanding of their non-breeding distributions. Our sampling included samples from living birds, museum specimens and scavenged penguin remains recovered from the stomachs of Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni) caught north of the Ross Sea. Mitochondrial control region (HVRI) sequences indicated that the two samples from New Zealand were likely Royal Penguins as were the scavenged penguins. Both Macaroni and Royal Penguins were detected at Terre Adélie, Antarctica, despite the nearest breeding colony of Macaroni Penguins being 4000 km away. We provide the first evidence of Royal Penguins reaching the Ross Dependency. All but one of the vagrants were immature birds, supporting suggestions that this age group is the most likely to disperse large distances from the breeding colonies. Our study demonstrates how DNA sequences can assist in identifying taxa with similar or overlapping morphologies, as well as fragmentary bird remains. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Parent–offspring conflict theory predicts that offspring seek to prolong the parental care period, while parents strive to shorten it as much as possible. Transition to the crèche phase in penguins involves changes in the dynamic of parental investment in chicks, and thus may be modulated by interests that benefit parent or offspring. We explored parent–offspring interactions in the Chinstrap Penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica) to understand the influence such interactions would have on transition to crèche phase. We studied the effect of hatching date, nestling age, brood size, and nest location on parent–offspring interactions and the length of the guard phase. All behavioral variables related to nestling demands for parental investment increased as well as parental aggression towards their chicks, with increased nestling age. Brood size showed significant effects on both nestling and parental behavior. Hatching date was negatively correlated with the age at crèche. Consequently, the decision to leave the chicks unguarded seemed to be more based on the condition of adults rather than of the chicks. Given the short time available for breeding in Antarctica and that penguins are long-lived birds with several opportunities to breed, there may be conflicting selective factors between investment in feeding chicks versus extending the period of resource acquisition and storage prior to moult. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Reproductive success can improve with experience, which increases with age in many long-lived species. Signals that provide reliable information about age are therefore of importance for mate choice and consequently are under sexual selection. In birds, these are often vocal signals as well as visual signals in the form of plumage coloration. King penguins, Aptenodytes patagonicus, are sexually monomorphically ornamented seabirds that perform a complex visual and acoustic courtship display. Coloured beak spots and ear patches contain information about the condition and physiological status of adult males and females, but their role as a signal of age has previously only been studied in young birds. Vocalizations have mainly been studied as signals of individuality and not in the context of courtship. We investigated two multicomponent signals in the context of mate choice by analysing beak spot, ear patch and call parameters of wild king penguins. We explored the relation between these signals and age as well as age classes (chicks, juveniles, adults). Ornament parameters were weakly correlated with in males, but not in females, while acoustic parameters were highly correlated with age in both sexes. The calls' fundamental frequency and energy parameters and all the beak spot parameters reliably classified individuals into their age class. Since age class was redundantly encoded in both acoustic and colour parameters, we hypothesize that calls and ornaments function as back-up signals that increase the chance of accurately conveying the age class of the sender to receivers. King penguins might sequentially analyse age class signals during courtship, where acoustic signals serve as long-range communication when sender and receiver are out of sight, and ornamentation signals become important at close range. We show the importance of considering bimodal, multicomponent signals when studying complex behaviour and discuss how signalling environment, the species’ life history and mating system influence the evolution of communication signals. © 2021 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Members of the Picornaviridae family comprise a significant burden on the poultry industry, causing diseases such as gastroenteritis and hepatitis. However, with the advent of metagenomics, a number of picornaviruses have now been revealed in apparently healthy wild birds. In this study, we identified four novel viruses belonging to the family Picornaviridae in healthy Magellanic penguins, a near threatened species. All samples were subsequently screened by RT-PCR for these new viruses, and approximately 20% of the penguins were infected with at least one of these viruses. The viruses were distantly related to members of the genera Hepatovirus, Tremovirus, Gruhelivirus and Crahelvirus. Further, they had more than 60% amino acid divergence from other picornaviruses, and therefore likely constitute novel genera. Our results demonstrate the vast undersampling of wild birds for viruses, and we expect the discovery of numerous avian viruses that are related to hepatoviruses and tremoviruses in the future. © 2021 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Background: Captive populations of penguins outside of their natural distributions are often maintained in outdoor facilities, such as zoos and aquariums. Consequently, such penguins in captivity are constantly exposed to mosquito vectors and risk of avian malarial infection during their active period from spring to autumn, which can be lethal to these naïve birds. Previous studies have investigated parasite prevalence in mosquitoes or penguins, but simultaneous investigations, which would be crucial to monitor the transmission dynamics and cycle within a facility, have not been done. To identify dominant lineages and trends, multiple-year surveys are recommended. Methods: Avian malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.) and related haemosporidia were tested in penguins and mosquitoes at an aquarium in Japan through multiple years from 2011 to 2018. Prevalence and dynamics were confirmed, and molecular analyses targeting the protozoal cytb gene were used to reveal the transmission cycle. Blood meals of mosquitoes were also identified using molecular methods. Results: Parasite detection in penguins tended to fluctuate within an individual. Two Plasmodium lineages were consistently detected in mosquitoes that had fed on penguins and wild birds observed around the aquarium. Plasmodium lineage CXPIP09 was detected from both mosquitoes and penguins, suggesting active transmission at this facility. However, Plasmodium cathemerium PADOM02 was only detected in mosquitoes, which may be due to host, vector or parasite-related factors, or detection methods and their limits. Additionally, Haemoproteus larae SPMAG12 was detected from penguins, suggesting active transmission via biting midges. Conclusions: The mismatch in parasite composition between penguins and mosquitoes shows that multiple aspects such as captive birds, wild birds and vector insects should be monitored in order to better understand and control avian malarial infection within ex-situ conservation facilities. Furthermore, morphological analyses would be needed to confirm competency and infection dynamics of avian malaria parasites. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Understanding the spatial distribution of seabirds contributes to comprehending their ecological requirements and dispersion patterns. We studied the at-sea distribution of female Southern Rockhopper Penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome (J.R. Forster, 1781)) at Isla de los Estados colony during the early chick-rearing period. We used a clustering analysis approach to identify different groups according to the foraging trip (tracking and diving data from GPS and temperature and depth data loggers) and diet (d15N composition on blood samples) characteristics. Foraging trips differed in duration, location, and dive depths explored. Females in clusters 1 and 3 traveled longer distances and in opposite directions (36.3 6 21.3 and 40.3 6 14.0 km, respectively). Females in cluster 2 fed closer to the colony (16.8 6 7.8 km). Dives occurred in pelagic habitats. Higher d15N values suggested a greater proportion of fish (e.g., the Fuegian sprat, Sprattus fuegensis (Jenyns, 1842)) consumption in the northern foraging areas (cluster 1). The variability observed in the spatial distribution suggests flexibility in the foraging behavior of Southern Rockhopper Penguins and availability of adequate foraging areas within the colony range during the early chick-rearing period, both important features for Southern Rockhopper Penguin population. These results contribute to understanding the use of the Southern Ocean by marine mesopredators and top predators and to the marine spatial planning in the area. © 2021 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Sub-Antarctic fur seals, Arctocephalus tropicalis, are widely distributed in the southern hemisphere, breeding on islands north of the Antarctic Convergence in the South Atlantic, South Indian, and Southwestern Pacific Oceans. At their breeding grounds, sub-Antarctic fur seals feed on a variety of fish, cephalopods, crustaceans, and occasionally, on penguins. According to the literature, the species feeds mainly on squid and fish, in the southern Brazilian coast, during the non-breeding period and far away from its breeding colonies. Here, we present records of predation on penguins by sub-Antarctic fur seals off southern Brazilian coast (29°20′S, 49°43′W to 33°44‵S, 53°22′W). We examined the gastrointestinal contents of 61 sub-Antarctic fur seals collected from 1987 to 2019. Remaining of penguins were found in the gastrointestinal tracts of three adult males (4.9%). We identified feathers, and other bird parts by comparing them specimens from scientific collections and illustrations in the literature. Seabirds found in the gastrointestinal tracts of the three sub-Antarctic fur seals were most probably Magellanic Penguins, Spheniscus magellanicus. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting predation on penguins by sub-Antarctic fur seals far from their breeding colonies. Although penguins are not among the main prey of sub-Antarctic fur seals, our results suggest that they occasionally feed on penguins during the non-breeding period along the southern coast of Brazil. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: When provisioning chicks, parents trade-off their time, energy, and other resources to maximize reproductive success. As parents adjust investment to maximize their fitness, impacts on offspring growth can occur. We investigated provisioning and chick growth of Adélie Penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) at one of the largest colonies (∼175,000 pairs), during one year of normal chick growth and survival and in a year which, by chance, was characterized by low chick growth and survival ("difficult" year). We measured daily average amount and quality of food delivered, as well as foraging-trip duration, and compared them to chick mass and skeletal growth during two years of contrasting conditions. We used mixed-effects models to test the prediction that increased parental investment would lead to increased growth rates, while accounting for confounding effects. There was no evidence of an effect of parent age. All provisioning measures predicted growth of at least one morphological character but, especially during the year of normal reproductive success, no provisioning measure strongly predicted growth across most morphological characters. However, during the difficult year parental investment positively affected growth rates, especially for males that were fed relatively more fish. The observed variation in growth rates between males and females, and between years of contrasting apparent resource availability, was large enough to lead to size differences that may subsequently affect post-fledging survival and ultimately population processes. © 2021 The Waterbird Society.

ABSTRACT: Captive penguins with respiratory diseases exhibit advanced pathological conditions upon the appearance of clinical signs. Therefore, the successful treatment of respiratory diseases remains difficult after the onset of clinical signs, leading to high mortality rates. In this study, we measured air sac volume using computed tomography (CT) to evaluate the respiratory condition of penguins. In a regular quarterly health checkup, blood samples were collected from 45 penguins housed at an aquarium in Hokkaido, Japan. A total of 12 penguins with abnormal blood parameters underwent CT. The air sac volumes were calculated in three-dimensional CT, and the scatter plots of the air sac volumes and body weights were analyzed. No correlation was found between the air sac volume and body weight in both the gentoo and king penguins. Two gentoo penguins with infiltration and one king penguin with multiple nodules on CT were tentatively diagnosed with aspergillosis and treated with oral administration of itraconazole. Follow-up CT examination was performed until the outcome: healed or died. The mean air sac volumes of the two gentoo penguins, which recovered after treatment, increased from 273.9 and 329.0 cm3 before healing to 449.0 and 424.6 cm3 after healing, respectively. Meanwhile, the air sac volume of the king penguin, which subsequently died, decreased from 1,556.9 to 920.6 cm3 despite treatment. Changes of the air sac volume in the same individual could be useful for evaluating the respiratory condition of penguins. ©2022 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: Antarctica is a relatively pristine continent that attracts scientists and tourists alike. How-ever, the risk of environmental pollution in Antarctica is increasing with the increase in the number of visitors. Recently, there has been a surge in interest regarding diesel, heavy metals and microplastics pollution. Contamination from these pollutants poses risks to the environment and the health of organisms inhabiting the continent. Penguins are one of the most prominent and widely distributed animals in Antarctica and are at major risk due to pollution. Even on a small scale, the impacts of pollution toward penguin populations are extensive. This review discusses the background of penguins in Antarctica, the anthropogenic pollution and cases, as well as the impacts of diesel, heavy metals and microplastics toxicities on penguins. The trends of the literature for the emerging risks of these pollutants are also reviewed through a bibliometric approach and network mapping analysis. A sum of 27 articles are analyzed on the effects of varying pollutants on penguins in Antarctica from 2000 to 2020 using the VOSviewer bibliometric software, Microsoft Excel and Tableau Public. Research articles collected from the Scopus database are evaluated for the most applicable research themes according to the bibliometric indicators (articles, geography distribution, annual production, integrated subject areas, key source journals and keyword or term interactions). Although biblio-metric studies on the present research theme are not frequent, our results are sub-optimal due to the small number of search query matches from the Scopus database. As a result, our findings offer only a fragmentary comprehension of the topics in question. Nevertheless, this review provides valuable inputs regarding prospective research avenues for researchers to pursue in the future. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: Large animals such as sea birds and marine mammals can transport limiting nutrients between different regions of the ocean, thereby stimulating and enhancing productivity. In Antarctica this process is influenced by formation and breakup of sea ice and its influence on the feeding behaviour of predators and their prey. We used analyses of bioactive metals (for example, Fe, Co, Mn), macronutrients (for example, N) and stable isotopes (δ13C and δ15N) in the excreta of Adélie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) as well as Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) from multiple sites, among multiple years (2012–2014) to resolve how changes in sea ice dynamics, as indicated by MODIS satellite images, were coincident with prey switching and likely changes in nutrient fluxes between the offshore pelagic and coastal zones. We also sampled excreta of the south polar skua (Stercorarius maccormicki), which preys on penguins and scavenges the remains of both penguins and seals. We found strong coincidence of isotopic evidence for prey switching, between euphausiids (Euphausia superba and E. crystallorophias) and pelagic/cryopelagic fishes (for example, Pleuragramma antarcticum) in penguins, and between pelagic/cryopelagic fishes and Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni) in Weddell seals, with changes in sea ice cover among years. Further, prey switching was strongly linked to changes in the concentrations of nutrients (Fe and N) deposited in coastal environments by both penguins and seals. Our findings have important implications for understanding how the roles of large animals in supporting coastal productivity may shift with environmental conditions in polar ecosystems. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Yellow-eyed penguins, Megadyptes antipodes, are an endangered species that are endemic to New Zealand. Outbreaks of diphtheritic stomatitis have caused significant mortality for this species, especially among young chicks. In this study, we isolated 16 Corynebacterium sp. isolates from the oral cavities of 2- to 14-day-old chicks at a range of infection stages and sequenced the genomes to understand their virulence mechanisms. Phylogenomic and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) characterization indicate that these strains belong to a novel Corynebacterium species. A simple multiplex PCRbased diagnostic assay has been developed to identify these strains rapidly and reliably. Similar to other corynebacteria, genomic islands and prophages introduced significant diversity among these strains that has potentially led to minor functional variations between the two lineages. Despite the presence of multiple corynebacterial virulence genes and a spaDEF-type pilus gene cluster among these strains, the survival rate was much higher in Galleria mellonella larvae than in those inoculated with Corynebacterium ulcerans NZRM 818 and Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis NZRM 3004. Therefore, these strains are opportunistic pathogens causing high mortality among young penguin chicks due to a less-developed immune system. © 2021 American Society for Microbiology.

ABSTRACT: Studies of parasitism in chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica) are infrequent and mainly refer to the identification and description of its parasites, with little ecological data. In an attempt to address that lack of knowledge, we collected endo- and ecto-parasites from 326 live and four dead of chinstrap penguins, in three different localities of Antarctica not studied before. Three species of endoparasites and two of ectoparasites were found parasitizing birds: two tapeworms, Tetrabothrius pauliani (Cestoda: Tetrabothriidae) and Parorchites zederi (Cestoda: Dilepididae); one roundworm, Stegophorus macronectes (Nematoda: Acuariidae), and one feather louse: Austrogoniodes gressitti (Insecta: Phthiraptera: Philopteridae). Ticks (Ixodes uriae—Acari: Ixodidae) were collected from the ground near the penguin nesting colonies at two localities, Shirreff Cape and Narebsky Point. New ecological data are given for the two species of ectoparasites. No parasites were found in the blood collected from 300 live penguins. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Polar regions, symbols of wilderness, have been identified as potential sinks of mercury coming from natural and anthropogenic sources at lower latitudes. Changes in ice coverage currently occurring in some areas such as the Antarctic Peninsula could enhance these phenomena and their impacts on local biota. As long-lived species at the top of food chains, seabirds are particularly sensitive to this highly toxic metal with the capacity to be biomagnified. Specifically, their feathers can be useful for Hg monitoring since they mainly accumulate its most toxic and persistent form, methyl-Hg. To that end, feathers of gentoo (Pygoscelis papua), chinstrap (P. antarcticus), and Adélie penguins (P. adeliae) (n = 108) were collected by passive sampling in seven different locations throughout the Antarctic Peninsula area and analyzed by ICP-MS after microwave-digestion. More than 93% of the samples showed detectable Hg levels (range: 6.3–12,529.8 ng g−1 dry weight), and the highest ones were found in the feathers of chinstrap penguins from King George Island. Hg bioconcentration and biomagnification seem to be occurring in the Antarctic food web, giving rise to high but non-toxic Hg levels in penguins, similar to those previously found in Arctic seabirds. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Samples from 29 adult Gentoo (Pygoscelis papua), Chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarcticus), and Adélie Penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) at the King Sejong Station on Narębski Point, King George Island, Antarctica, were investigated to detect antibodies to avian influenza, Newcastle disease virus, infectious bursal disease virus, infectious bronchitis virus, Mycoplasma, and Salmonella. Antibodies were identified from one Gentoo Penguin and one Chinstrap Penguin against infectious bronchitis virus; from one Gentoo Penguin against Newcastle disease virus; from one Gentoo Penguin against Mycoplasma synoviae; and from two Chinstrap Penguins against Salmonella pullorum. Thirty-three dead penguin chicks were collected from the breeding colony for necropsy, histopathological examination, and polymerase chain reaction. Pulmonary hemorrhage and congestion were the main necropsy findings. ©Wildlife Disease Association 2021.

ABSTRACT: Animals constantly test the borders of their own ecological niche and tend to expand their range, which is now additionally challenged by global climate change. Following human exploitation throughout the Southern Ocean in the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, numbers of King Penguin breeding pairs have increased and former breeding sites have been re-colonized. Since 2010 a breeding colony became (re-)established at Bahía Inútil, Strait of Magellan, Tierra del Fuego, Chile. The aims of this study were to study the foraging ecology of King Penguins at this new breeding site, which is characterized by a set of different environmental variables as it is located within the confined environment of the Magellan Strait, more than 300 km from the open ocean. During the course of this study, thirty-two birds were successfully equipped with external devices that recorded 206 foraging trips by breeding and non-breeding birds. With one exception, all birds foraged throughout the year exclusively in the Magellan Strait with the main foraging areas located within 100 km from the colony. The diving activities of 15 King Penguins were recorded during 59 foraging trips, the deepest dive was 160 m and the longest dive lasted 6.75 mins. Based on a representative subsample of 3000 dives, mean dive depth was 32 ± 34 m and mean dive duration 117 ± 84 s. Accordingly, foraging trip durations throughout the year were significantly shorter than those recorded for conspecifics elsewhere. In accordance with these changes in foraging behavior, stomach contents from seven birds showed a mix of fish and squid, with Falkland sprats Sprattus fuegensis as the main prey item present in all samples. The implications of these behavioral adaptations are discussed with regard to this unusual confined foraging environment and predicted changes in the performance of King Penguins breeding elsewhere following global change. © 2021 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The identification of when, how and where animals feed is essential to estimate the amount of energy they obtain and to study the processes associated with prey search and consumption. We combined the use of animal-borne video cameras and accelerometers to characterise the body and head movements associated to four types of prey capture behaviours in the Magellanic Penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus). In addition, we evaluated how the K-Nearest Neighbour (K-NN) algorithm recognized these behaviours from acceleration data. Finally, we compared the total capture and the capture per unit time (CPUT) derived by identifying prey capture events using the K-NN algorithm to that derived by counting undulations in the dive profile (“wiggles”). During captures, body and head movements were highly variable in the tridimensional space. Energy expenditure (i.e., VeDBA values) during diving periods with prey captures was from three to four times higher than during controls diving periods (i.e., with no capture events). The K-NN classification resulted effective and showed accuracy scores above 90% when considering both head and body related features. In addition, when captures were estimated using the K-NN method, the CPUT was similar or higher to that estimated by counting wiggles. Our study contributes to the knowledge of the trophic ecology of this species and provides an alternative method for estimating prey consumption in the Magellanic Penguin and other diving seabirds. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The population of Gentoo Penguins (Pygoscelis papua) in the maritime Antarctic is rapidly increasing. Due to regional climate changes, they colonise previously inaccessible territories southwards. For more than a century, the southernmost colony of Gentoo Penguins was located on Petermann Island (Wilhelm Archipelago). Since 2002, several colonies were established nearby, including on Cape Tuxen (Graham Land), which is currently the southernmost breeding colony documented for this species on the Antarctic Peninsula. It increased from 100 nests in 2007 to 592 nests in 2020. Since a colony is located on the cliffs and there is a lack of pebbles, some breeding pairs started building their nests predominantly out of the nearby living mosses or moss banks. P. papua are known for using mosses as nesting material in the sub-Antarctic, but such nesting behaviour is new for southernmost colonies in the Antarctic. In this short note, we report such nests on the Cape Tuxen, provide photographs and discuss the possible impact on the terrestrial ecosystems. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Sexing weakly/criptically dimorphic birds requires invasive techniques or molecular analysis. Alternatively, sexing can be based upon morphometric analysis, which remains invaluable in remote field conditions such as Polar regions. Nevertheless, discriminatory power may be affected by methodological issues hampering comparison between/within studies, e.g. considering alternative analytical techniques or measurements taken by different researchers. We investigated the sexing potential of bill length, bill depth and body mass in adult Adélie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae of known sex. We performed discriminant analysis on a large dataset of measurements (237 males; 264 females) taken from penguins marked between 1994 and 2001, at Edmonson Point (Ross Sea, Antarctica). In a second step, we accounted for measurements collected by different researchers through permuted discriminant analysis. We found moderate support for sex discrimination through bill measurements (77%). Considering body mass did not improve classification power substantially (78.2%), possibly because of confounding inter/intra-annual oscillations in body condition. Discriminant rate decreased when controlling the researcher effect (72.7% and 71.4%, respectively). Results were also confirmed by logistic (mixed) models. Simulations showed that reduction in sample size markedly increased uncertainty in classification power. Differences with previous studies achieving a slightly greater classification power for sexing Adélie penguins through morphometrics could be related to (i) our higher sample size and/or (ii) geographical, population-specific differences, e.g. lower degree of sexual dimorphism. Our work emphasises key-factors influencing performance of morphometric sexing in avian species, advocating population-specific validation with large sample size as well as the necessity to account for the researcher effect prior to apply morphometric sexing. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Standardized measures of behavior can be powerful tools for assessing the impact of whale watching activities on natural populations of cetaceans. To determine the possible impact of tourism on dolphins between a period without whale watching (1989–1992) (T1) and a period with whale watching (2010–2020) (T2), we examined the changes in the rate of surface behaviors, the group size of long-time resident bottlenose dolphins living in the waters of the Humboldt Current off Chile, and for T2 alone, we compared these differences between two localities, the Punta de Choros and Chañaral de Aceituno coves. We observed a significant decrease in the group size of the resident population and in the frequency of surface events associated with the absence and presence of tourism. For T2, we observed significant differences for the frequency of surface events between the Chañaral de Aceituno and Punta de Choros coves and differences in the frequency of surface events at different hours of the day. This was associated with the number of vessels at the time of the encounter. In addition, we observed for T2 that the most observed instantaneous response of the dolphins to the presence of tourist vessels was to avoid the boats, while approaching the boats was the least observed response. The number of vessels present in each dolphin encounter was the most important variable for our model as it explains these differences. These results show that tourism vessels have a significant impact on dolphin behavior and sociability, while the same population of dolphins have different spatial and temporal responses to different impacts of tourism. Further studies are needed to establish whether changes in the rate of surface behaviors are associated with higher levels of stress in dolphins and with effects on their health and reproductive success in the long term. © Copyright © 2021 Toro, Alarcón, Toro-Barros, Mallea, Capella, Umaran-Young, Abarca, Lakestani, Peña, Alvarado-Rybak, Cruz, Vilina and Gibbons.

ABSTRACT: The identification and subsequent protection of suitable breeding habitat for little penguins (Eudyptula minor) is restricted by data deficiency across large stretches of the species range. For example, presence/absence data is lacking for much of the Canterbury coast, mainland New Zealand. In October 2019, a Protected Species Detection Dog was used to conduct the first comprehensive survey for E. minor along the greater Kaikōura coastline. The principal objectives were to locate and map the distribution of sites utilised by E. minor between Waipapa Bay and the Conway River, characterise areas of suitable breeding habitat and identify ‘little blue’ and ‘white-flippered’ morphotypes. Eudyptula minor were located within just 0.7% of a coastal stretch measuring c. 75 km. A single breeding colony was located in severely fragmented habitat on the southern face of the Kaikōura Peninsula, South Bay. The Detection Dog gave positive indications at six further isolated sites in sheltered bays, including two active nests on the northern faces of Spy Glass Point (Piripaua) and the Kaikōura Peninsula. We highlight the importance of the breeding colony at South Bay, Kaikōura, and recommend the protection of existing habitat as a priority for the survival of E. minor along the greater Kaikōura coastline. © 2020 The Royal Society of New Zealand.

ABSTRACT: Egg laying is one of the most important phases in a female bird's breeding cycle. Its cost is high because eggs contain all the resources needed for the development of an embryo. Variation in size and quality of eggs can have important long-term consequences for offspring survival. Hatching asynchrony is known to influence sibling competition in many bird species. Last-hatched chicks will have a competitive disadvantage throughout the pre-fledgling period because they are smaller. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of hatching asynchrony and egg size variation on the growth and fledging success of Magellanic penguin Spheniscus magellanicus chicks after disentangling the effects of parental condition. We simultaneously manipulated egg size dimorphism, hatching asynchrony and parental condition by performing a cross-fostering experiment, creating broods with controlled egg size dimorphism and hatching asynchrony in a colony of Magellanic penguins located in Isla Quiroga, Santa Cruz, Argentina. We found that hatching asynchrony had a negative effect on last-hatched chicks, but this disadvantage was mitigated by egg size dimorphism in their favor. Moreover, females in good condition invest more in second than in first chicks, which, added to a greater investment by foster fathers, leading to offspring fledging in good condition. On the contrary, for the first-hatched chicks, we found that body condition of the biological father was an important factor for their growth. We conclude that raising more than one chick seems to be a decision based on parental condition throughout the breeding season. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Penguins (Sphenisciformes) are an iconic order of flightless, diving seabirds distributed across a large latitudinal range in the Southern Hemisphere. The extensive area over which penguins are endemic is likely to have fostered variation in pathogen pressure, which in turn will have imposed differential selective pressures on the penguin immune system. At the front line of pathogen detection and response, the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) provide insight into host evolution in the face of microbial challenge. TLRs respond to conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns and are frequently found to be under positive selection, despite retaining specificity for defined agonist classes. We undertook a comparative immunogenetics analysis of TLRs for all penguin species and found evidence of adaptive evolution that was largely restricted to the cell surface-expressed TLRs, with evidence of positive selection at, or near, key agonist-binding sites in TLR1B, TLR4, and TLR5. Intriguingly, TLR15, which is activated by fungal products, appeared to have been pseudogenized multiple times in the Eudyptes spp., but a full-length form was present as a rare haplotype at the population level. However, in vitro analysis revealed that even the full-length form of Eudyptes TLR15 was nonfunctional, indicating an ancestral cryptic pseudogenization prior to its eventual disruption multiple times in the Eudyptes lineage. This unusual pseudogenization event could provide an insight into immune adaptation to fungal pathogens such as Aspergillus, which is responsible for significant mortality in wild and captive bird populations.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

ABSTRACT: The Ross Sea has the world's largest marine protected area. Modified Circumpolar Deep Water (MCDW) has significant effects on physical and biological processes in the Ross Sea. Totally 13 penguin ornithogenic sediment profiles were collected from Inexpressible Island, Ross Sea, and the Cd/P ratios were used as a proxy of MCDW intrusion, enabling to reconstruct the variability of MCDW intrusion into the Ross Sea during the past 6,000 years. During the intervals of ∼0.7–1.6 and ∼2.8–6.0 kyr BP, enhanced MCDW intrusion increased the heat supply which warmed the surface water and reduced the coastal sea ice concentration. By contrast, reduced MCDW intrusion during ∼1.6–2.8 kyr BP caused a decrease in the penguin population via restricting food supply and/or increasing sea ice concentration. Thus, changes in MCDW were responsible for driving millennial changes in sea ice and penguin population in the Ross Sea. © 2021. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.

ABSTRACT: Penguins accumulate mercury due to their long-life span together with their high trophic position. We sampled adult and juveniles' feathers from three colonies of Spheniscus magellanicus from Tierra del Fuego along an inshore-offshore corridor. We integrated toxicological information (mercury concentrations) and foraging biomarkers (δ13C, δ15N) into a common data analysis framework (isotopic niche analysis) to evaluate the influence of age, location, and foraging behaviors on mercury concentrations. Adults had higher feather mercury concentrations, δ13C, and δ15N values compared to juveniles. Also, adult and juvenile feather mercury concentrations differed between colonies, with lower mercury concentrations at the nearest inshore colony relative to the farther offshore colonies. Trophic position and the isotopic niche analyses suggest that this geographic gradient in mercury concentrations is due to differences in colonies' foraging areas. Understanding penguins' exposure to mercury derived from local food webs is a crucial first step in evaluating the impacts of this heavy metal on their conservation status. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The species Spheniscus magellanicus, popularly known as the Magellanic penguin, is the most common penguin species in the Brazilian coast. Its strandings are related to several causes, ranging from fishing interaction, diseases, anthropic pressures, to the occurrence of storms and extreme weather events. These different phenomena can affect the species’ search for food, their physical conditioning and survival, and can lead individuals to death. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the effects of environmental variables on the strandings of Magellanic penguins that occurred at Ilha Comprida, in the southern coast of São Paulo State, Brazil, between 1998 and 2016. Strandings data were collected at the monthly frequency using beach monitoring techniques. Monthly averages of the environmental variables wave height (WH), sea level pressure (SLP), wind intensity (WI) and sea surface temperature (SST) were also obtained from various sources. The methodology applied here consisted of a preliminary correlation analysis and a subsequent multiple regression analysis using Generalized Linear Models (GLM) with binomial distribution. The results demonstrated that there is a relationship between the combined effect of the increase in SLP and the decrease in SST with the number of strandings. The strandings, as expected, were also associated with the migratory period of the species and their occurrence in the study area. The results provided new knowledge about the factors, mainly non-anthropogenic, that can lead to the stranding of Magellanic penguins on the study area, contributing to future initiatives for animal conservation and preservation. © 2021

ABSTRACT: Species that are constantly exposed to disturbances, such as human disturbance or non-lethal contacts with predators or conspecifics, can experience chronic stress. Within a species range, variation in the frequency and predictability of such disturbances can lead to population differences in stress responses. Here, we investigated the stress response of Little Penguins Eudyptula minor to an introduced predator and a conspecific at two South Australian colonies that differed in habitat, conspecific density, levels of human disturbance and predation risk (high, low). We used playback experiments of Cat Felis catus or Little Penguin calls and recorded the behaviour and physiological (heart rate) response of adults in relation to playback type (Cat, Penguin) as well as habitat characteristics (habitat type, nest type, nest visibility) and number of conspecifics present. Our results showed that individuals from the high-disturbance colony (also living in a mixed habitat with fewer neighbours) exhibited higher vigilance and heart rate responses than individuals from the low-disturbance colony (living in a closed habitat with a high number of neighbours). Our results highlight that guidelines for managing penguin species cannot be generalized across populations and need to be colony-specific. © 2021 British Ornithologists' Union

ABSTRACT: In this study, it was aimed to present the results of microbiological, cytological, histopathological, and immunohistochemical analyses of ocular samples from an Antarctic (Ardley Island, King George Island) Gentoo penguin chick (Pygoscelis papua) with a pyogranulomatous lesion in the right eye. Samples were taken from both the healthy left eye and the lesion in the right eye. Conventional culture methods and phenotypic and molecular tests were used for bacterial isolation and identification, respectively. None of the isolates could be identified phenotypically. As a result, four of the five isolates obtained from the right eye were considered to belong to putative novel bacterial species and taxa as their similarity to GenBank data was below 98.75%. The isolates were considered to be Pasteurellaceae bacterium, Corynebacterium ciconiae, Cardiobacteriaceae bacterium, Actinomyces sp., and Dermabacteraceae bacterium. The only isolate from the left eye was identified as Psychrobacter pygoscelis. The cytological analysis demonstrated cell infiltrates composed mostly of degenerate heterophils, reactive macrophages, plasma cells, lymphocytes, and eosinophils. Based on histopathological findings, the lesion was defined as a typical pyogranulomatous lesion. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the granuloma was positive for TNF-α, IL-4, MMP-9, IL-1β, and IL-6. This is the first documented report of the unilateral pyogranulomatous ocular lesion in a Gentoo penguin chick, living in its natural habitat in Antarctica. This report also describes the isolation of four bacteria from the infected eye, which are considered to belong to novel Genus, species, or taxa. The primary bacterial pathogen that caused the ocular lesion was not able to be detected and remains unclear. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

ABSTRACT: Little penguins (Eudyptula minor), or Kororā in Māori, show variation in their behavioural responses towards zoo visitors in Australian zoos. We experimentally examined the effects of visitor presence on the behaviour and stress physiology of little penguins at Wellington Zoo, New Zealand. The two treatments were: (1) Visitor presence–the exhibit was open to visitors; and (2) Visitor absence–the exhibit was closed to visitors. We found that when the exhibit was closed to visitors, the percentage of penguins observed close to the visitor viewing pier increased from about 1% to 9%, but there was little effect on other behaviours and faecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations. This result of increased avoidance of the visitor viewing pier when the exhibit was open to visitors suggests close visitor contact, particularly from above, may be fear-provoking for these penguins. We conclude that designing enclosures to allow close viewing proximity of visitors, such as visitors looming over the pool, may be futile in improving visitor experience, since this species of penguins is likely to avoid these types of viewing areas when visitors are present. Visitors positioned close to and above penguins may be particularly problematic since visitors in this position may be perceived as threatening. © 2021 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: There is limited direct empirical evidence to evaluate the efficacy of using opportunistically found bird carcasses as proxies for estimating pollutant exposure in populations of live birds for avian ecotoxicology studies. In this study, we analyzed total mercury concentrations in feathers collected from live Gentoo Penguin (Pygoscelis papua) chicks and from Gentoo Penguin chick carcasses found at the same breeding colonies. Distributions of mercury concentrations for feathers from live-caught chicks and from found-dead chicks broadly overlap and, for our study, feathers from found-dead penguin chicks provide similar information about exposure to mercury as do feathers from live penguin chicks from the same locations. Our results suggest that, when mercury is estimated to be below adverse effect levels, the common practice of sampling from opportunistically found chick carcasses is a suitable and less-invasive alternative method of specimen collection in penguin colonies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Drastic climate change is widely believed to threaten the ecological security of penguins. Previous studies have concluded that penguins on the Scott Coast, southern Ross Sea, disappeared from ∼2000 yr BP; two opposite hypotheses of “cooling” and “warming” have been proposed for the disappearance. Here, by identifying penguin guano and remains such as eggshell fragments, bones and feathers in a sediment profile from Dunlop Island, we found that this island was not abandoned at ∼2000 yr BP. In addition, sedimentological evidence from Cape Ross deduced the permanent snow/ice cover at ∼1700 yr BP, which is consistent with a Neoglacial cooling period on the Scott Coast. We suggest that Neoglacial cooling caused the widespread abandonment of penguin colonies on the Scott Coast, by the increased coastal sea ice and/or snow/ice accumulation. However, penguins persisted at particular localities due to specific topographical or oceanic conditions shielding them from the impacts of snow and ice. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The cornea is a specialized component of the vertebrate eye that provides protection, refractive power, transparency for optical imaging and mechanical support. However, the corneas of birds have received little attention with no comprehensive study of their functional morphology. Using light microscopy and both scanning and transmission electron microscopy, the first description of the ultrastructure of all of the main components of the cornea in two different-sized individuals of the Little Penguin Eudyptula minor is presented. Two types of microprojections protrude from the surface of the cornea with a predominance of microridges and microvilli found in central (flattened) and peripheral regions, respectively. Epithelial cell density is higher in peripheral cornea, especially in the larger (older) individual, while there is a reduction of epithelial cell density with age. The cornea comprises a thick epithelium uniquely attached to the basement membrane with numerous incursions rather than anchoring fibres and anchoring plaques as is found in other vertebrate corneas. Posterior to Bowman's layer, the orthogonally-arranged collagen fibril lamellae in the stroma form extensive branches and anastomoses. Desçemet's membrane is well-developed with an anterior or foetal portion with long banding. However, the thickness of Desçemet's membrane is larger in the older individual with the inclusion of an additional irregular pale-staining posterior portion. Polygonal endothelial cells extend across the cornea as a monolayer with often tortuous cell junctions. Endothelial cell density increases towards the periphery, but decreases with age. Primary cilia are observed protruding through the central region of some endothelial cells into the anterior segment but subsurface structures resembling cilia suggest that these features may be more common. The ultrastructure of the corneal components reveals a range of functional adaptations that reflect the amphibious lifestyle of this seabird. © 2021 Anatomical Society

ABSTRACT: The expansion of human activities in offshore maritime regions has outpaced the development of scientific knowledge and cooperative governance across these areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ). In this context, current negotiations by the United Nations aim for an international legally-binding instrument to improve governance and sustainable use of biodiversity in ABNJ. Penguins are among the most threatened seabird groups today, notably at sea from fisheries and oiling. Here, we examine the available information on penguins’ movements and evaluate their use of ABNJ across species and life-cycle stages. We highlight that in most of the 18 extant penguin species, the birds may undertake spectacular migrations, seasonally or throughout life-cycle stages. Long-range movements were reported in 16 species, with trans-jurisdictional distribution in 14 species, including 13 in ABNJ. Species richness in ABNJ varied extensively according to oceanic region, and also varied according to season. Transboundary movements, notably to ABNJ, are thus remarkably prevalent among penguin species. Consequently, provisions of the treaty under negotiation may crucially benefit penguin conservation, notably by creating a uniform legal framework to designate protected areas in ABNJ, and by promoting the precautionary approach to extraction activities. However, the seasonally-dynamic utilisation of ABNJ by penguins supports the pertinence of adding innovative protection tools, such as mobile Marine Protected Areas, to the negotiations for a more adequate protection of marine biodiversity. Underlining penguins’ remarkable connectivity to the high seas can thus further strengthen this instrument aiming to protect a global ocean commons heritage of mankind. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) migrate to the continental shelf of southern-southeastern Brazil during austral winter. Stranded penguins are directed to rehabilitation centers, where they occasionally develop fungal diseases. Aspergillosis, a mycosis caused by Aspergillus spp., is one of the most important diseases of captive penguins, while Candida sp. has been detected in penguins undergoing rehabilitation. Nevertheless, their occurrence in the wild is poorly understood. This study surveyed the occurrence of mycoses in free-ranging Magellanic penguins wintering in southeastern Brazil. These penguins were either found dead or stranded alive and died during transport to a rehabilitation center. Overall, 61 fresh to moderate autolyzed carcasses were necropsied. Upon necropsy, three juvenile males (4.9%) presented mycotic-consistent gross lesions. Histopathology and panfungal PCRs confirmed the mycoses. Major microscopic findings were marked chronic necrotizing multifocal to coalescent pneumonia, airsacculitis, and esophageal/gastric serositis with two types of intralesional fungal structures: (a) septated acute-angled branching hyphae (n = 2) and (b) yeast structures (n = 1), both PAS- and Grocott-positive. Sequences identical to Aspergillus sp. were retrieved in two cases, while the third had sequences identical to Candida palmioleophila. This study describes two cases of aspergillosis and one of candidiasis in free-ranging Magellanic penguins, confirming the species’ susceptibility in the wild. These mycoses could be associated with the animals’ poor body condition, and/or impaired immunity, and natural and anthropogenic challenges related to migration. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report of aspergillosis in free-ranging Magellanic penguins in the Atlantic Ocean and of candidiasis in penguins worldwide. © 2021, Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia.

ABSTRACT: Long-term observation of penguin abundance and distribution may warn of changes in the Antarctic marine ecosystem and provide support for penguin conservation. We conducted an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) survey of the Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) colony on Inexpressible Island and obtained aerial images with a resolution of 0.07 m in 2018. We estimated penguin abundance and identified the spatial extent of the penguin colony. A total of 24,497 breeding pairs were found on Inexpressible Island within a colony area of 57,507 m2. Based on historical images, the colony area expanded by 30,613 m2 and abundance increased by 4063 pairs between 1983 and 2012. Between 2012 and 2018 penguin abundance further increased by 3314 pairs, although the colony area decreased by 1903 m2. In general, Adélie penguins bred on Inexpressible Island at an elevation <20 m, and >55% of penguins had territories within 150 m of the shoreline. This suggests that penguins prefer to breed in areas with a low elevation and close to the shoreline. We observed a retreat of the shoreline on Inexpressible Island between 1983 and 2018, especially along the northern coast, which may have played a key role in the expansion of the penguin colony on the northern coast. In sum, it appears that retreating shorelines reshaped penguin distribution on the island and may be an emerging risk factor for penguins. These results highlight the importance of remote sensing techniques for monitoring changes in the Antarctic marine ecosystem and providing reliable data for Antarctic penguin conservation. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Mercury (Hg) is a pervasive environmental contaminant that accumulates in the organs and tissues of seabirds at concentrations capable of causing acute or long-term adverse health effects. In the present study, Hg concentrations in Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) egg membranes and chick feathers served as a proxy for Hg bioavailability in the marine environment surrounding the northern Antarctic Peninsula. Stable isotopes were measured in conjunction with Hg to infer information regarding feeding habits (δ15N, diet/trophic level; δ13C, foraging habitat). The Hg concentrations were low relative to toxicity benchmark values associated with adverse health effects in birds and ranged between 0.006 and 0.080 µg g–1 dry weight (n = 65) in egg membranes and 0.140 to 1.05 µg g–1 fresh weight (n = 38) in feathers. Egg membrane δ15N signatures suggested that females from different breeding colonies had similar diets consisting of lower and higher trophic prey prior to arrival to breeding grounds. In contrast, δ15N signatures in feathers indicated that chick diet varied by colony. The Hg concentrations demonstrated significant positive relationships with δ15N, providing support for the hypothesis of Hg biomagnification up the food chain. The δ13C signatures in both tissue types provided evidence of foraging habitat segregation among populations. The differences in Hg exposure and foraging ecology suggest that each colony has localized foraging behaviors by breeding adults that warrant additional investigation. Environ Toxicol Chem 2021;40:2791–2801. © 2021 SETAC. © 2021 SETAC

ABSTRACT: Penguins are adapted to underwater life and have excellent swimming abilities. Although previous motion analyses revealed their basic swimming characteristics, the details of the 3D wing kinematics, wing deformation and thrust generation mechanism of penguins are still largely unknown. In this study, we recorded the forward and horizontal swimming of gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) at an aquarium with multiple underwater action cameras and then performed a 3D motion analysis. We also conducted a series of water tunnel experiments with a 3D printed rigid wing to obtain lift and drag coefficients in the gliding configuration. Using these coefficients, the thrust force during flapping was calculated in a quasi-steady manner, where the following two wing models were considered: (1) an ‘original’ wing model reconstructed from 3D motion analysis including bending deformation and (2) a ‘flat’ wing model obtained by flattening the original wing model. The resultant body trajectory showed that the penguin accelerated forward during both upstroke and downstroke. The motion analysis of the two wing models revealed that considerable bending occurred in the original wing, which reduced its angle of attack during the upstroke in particular. Consequently, the calculated stroke-averaged thrust was larger for the original wing than for the flat wing during the upstroke. In addition, the propulsive efficiency for the original wing was estimated to be 1.8 times higher than that for the flat wing. Our results unveil a detailed mechanism of lift-based propulsion in penguins and underscore the importance of wing bending. © 2021 Company of Biologists Ltd. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: To evaluate the effect of prophylactic anti-malarial chloroquine treatment, and its cessation, on electroretinographic (ERG) responses of captive African penguins. Methods: A brief ERG protocol (“QuickRetCheck”) was recorded under mesopic conditions with manual restraint and no sedation or pupil dilation. Birds were recorded on two separate occasions, first while being treated with a daily chloroquine dose of 10 mg/kg for 12 days (n = 15, treatment group) and second after 4 months without chloroquine treatment (n = 6, off-treatment group). Three birds were recorded on both occasions. Three other birds from the flock that died were studied histopathologically. Results: Scotopic responses were unmeasurable in either recording and therefore were not analyzed. Mean a- and b-wave amplitudes of the mixed rod-cone responses to standard (3 cd·s/m2) and high (10 cd·s/m2) intensity flashes were higher in the off-treatment group. No difference in implicit times was observed. Sex, age, and number of previous chloroquine treatments did not affect ERG responses. Histopathology revealed Plasmodium spp.in the lungs, liver, and brain, but not in the eyes, of the necropsied birds, and there were no signs of retinitis or retinopathy. Conclusions: Daily chloroquine treatment was associated with attenuated ERG responses in penguins, which improve following cessation of treatment. Further work is warranted to establish a chloroquine dose that is efficacious yet has minimal adverse effects. Our results suggest that ERG responses of captive penguins undergoing ERG for any indication (such as prior to cataract surgery), must be evaluated in light of the birds' anti-malaria treatment status. © 2021 American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists

ABSTRACT: Fiordland crested penguins Eudyptes pachyrhynchus Gray are thick-billed, crested penguins endemic to New Zealand that breed in small colonies in inaccessible places. They are assessed as Vulnerable by the IUCN. This is the first report of helminth parasites from this penguin species. Herein a new species of Diomedenema is described (Spiruromorpha, Desmidocercidae) from the lungs of Fiordland crested penguins. Diomedenema dinarctosn. sp. has only two congeners and is closest morphologically to D. tavaresi. It differs from D. tavaresi in overall larger size, longer buccal cavity and oesophagus, in the distance of the excretory pore and nerve ring from the anterior end, and the ratio of spicule sizes. Eggs are twice the size reported for D. tavaresi. The only other species, D. diomedeae, is far larger in body size, with a shorter buccal cavity and oesophagus and a reduced body length to oesophagus ratio. The position in the body length of the vulva and the spicule ratio also differ strongly. We provide a DNA sequence for the 18S rDNA gene. Species of Diomedenema have been reported as causing death in albatross, so any deceased Fiordland crested penguins should be examined specifically for this worm to enable evaluation of this potentially damaging parasite in the population. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

ABSTRACT: King penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) are an iconic Southern Ocean species, but the prey distributions that underpin their at-sea foraging tracks and diving behaviour remain unclear. We conducted simultaneous acoustic surveys off South Georgia and tracking of king penguins breeding ashore there in Austral summer 2017 to gain insight into habitat use and foraging behaviour. Acoustic surveys revealed ubiquitous deep scattering layers (DSLs; acoustically detected layers of fish and other micronekton that inhabit the mesopelagic zone) at c. 500 m and shallower ephemeral fish schools. Based on DNA extracted from penguin faecal samples, these schools were likely comprised of lanternfish (an important component of king penguin diets), icefish (Channichthyidae spp.) and painted noties (Lepidonotothen larseni). Penguins did not dive as deep as DSLs, but their prey-encounter depth-distributions, as revealed by biologging, overlapped at fine scale (10s of m) with depths of acoustically detected fish schools. We used neural networks to predict local scale (10 km) fish echo intensity and depth distribution at penguin dive locations based on environmental correlates, and developed models of habitat use. Habitat modelling revealed that king penguins preferentially foraged at locations predicted to have shallow and dense (high acoustic energy) fish schools associated with shallow and dense DSLs. These associations could be used to predict the distribution of king penguins from other colonies at South Georgia for which no tracking data are available, and to identify areas of potential ecological significance within the South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands marine protected area.

ABSTRACT: Species with similar ecological requirements that overlap in range tend to segregate their niches to minimize competition for resources. However, the niche segregation possibilities for centrally foraging predators that breed on isolated Subantarctic islands may be reduced by spatial constraints and limitations in the availability of alternative prey. In this study we examined spatial and trophic aspects of the foraging niches of two sympatrically breeding penguin species, macaroni (Eudyptes chrysolophus; MAC) and chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarcticus; CHIN) penguins, at Bouvetøya over two breeding seasons. To measure at-sea movements and diving behaviour, 90 MACs and 49 CHINs were equipped with GPS loggers and dive recorders during two austral summer breeding seasons (2014/15 and 2017/18). In addition, blood samples from tracked birds were analysed for stable isotopes to obtain dietary information. CHINs displayed marked interannual variation in foraging behaviour, diving deeper, utilizing a larger foraging area and displaying enriched values of δ15N in 2014/15 compared to the 2017/18 breeding season. In contrast, MACs dove to similar depths and showed similar δ15N values, while consistently utilizing larger foraging areas compared to CHINs. We suggest that low krill abundances in the waters around Bouvetøya during the 2014/15 season resulted in CHINs shifting toward a diet that increased their niche overlap with MACs.

ABSTRACT: There are two pygoscelid penguins, the Gentoo (Pygoscelis papua Forster, 1781) and Adélie (P. adeliae Hombron and Jacquinot, 1841) penguins, breeding sympatrically on Ardley Island, Fildes Peninsula region, South Shetlands, Antarctica. Whether the two closely related penguin species with similar dietary habits possess compositional similarity in gut microbiota remains unknown. DNA barcoding of feces is an emerging approach for gut microbiota analysis of protected animals. In the present study, the 16S rRNA gene from penguin feces was sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform to investigate the gut microbiota of the two pygoscelid penguin species. The fecal community of Gentoo penguins has higher diversity indices and OTU (operational taxonomic unit) richness compared to Adélie penguins. Besides unclassified bacteria, sequences fell into 22 major lineages of the domain Bacteria: Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Armatimonadetes, Bacteroidetes, Chlamy-diae, Chloroflexi, Cloacimonetes, Cyanobacteria, Deinococcus-Thermus, Fibrobacteres, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, Ignavibacteriae, Planctomycetes, Proteobacteria, Tenericutes, Verrucomicrobia, and candidate divisions BRC1, SR1, WPS-2, and Saccharibacteria. Among these, Firmicutes (37.7%), Proteobacteria (23.1%, mainly Gamma-and Betaproteobacteria), Fusobacteria (14.3%), Bacteroidetes (7.9%), and Actinobacteria (6.6%) were dominant in the fecal microbiota of the two penguin species. At the same time, significantly higher abundances of Actinobacteria and Cyanobacteria were detected in Gentoo penguins than in Adélie penguins (p < 0.05). Overall, there was a clear difference in the composition of gut microbiota between the Adélie and Gentoo penguins. The results suggested that both the phylogeny of penguin species and the diet could be responsible for the differences in the gut microbiota of the two pygoscelid penguins breeding in the same area. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Defining the impact of anthropogenic stressors on Antarctic wildlife is an active aim for investigators. Telomeres represent a promising molecular tool to investigate the fitness of wild populations, as their length may predict longevity and survival. We examined the relationship between telomere length and human exposure in Adélie penguin chicks (Pygoscelis adeliae) from East Antarctica. Telomere length was compared between chicks from areas with sustained human activity and on neighboring protected islands with little or no human presence. Adélie penguin chicks from sites exposed to human activity had significantly shorter telomeres than chicks from unexposed sites in nearby protected areas, with exposed chicks having on average 3.5% shorter telomeres than unexposed chicks. While sampling limitations preclude our ability to draw more sweeping conclusions at this time, our analysis nonetheless provides important insights into measures of colony vulnerability. More data are needed both to understand the proximate causes (e.g., stress, feeding events) leading to shorter telomeres in chicks from human exposed areas, as well as the fitness consequences of reduced telomere length. We suggest to further test the use of telomere length analysis as an eco-indicator of stress in wildlife among anthropized sites throughout Antarctica. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Phenological shifts may ameliorate negative effects of climate change or create carryover effects and mismatches that decrease fitness. Identifying how phenological shifts affect performance is critical for understanding how individuals and populations will respond to climate change, but requires long-term, longitudinal data. Using 34 yr of data from the Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) colony at Punta Tombo, Argentina, we examined the consequences of the delayed onset of breeding (i.e., arrival and egg-laying dates) that has occurred at the colony since 1983. To understand how the delay propagates through the rest of the reproductive cycle, we identified phenological trends in hatch and fledge dates. Median hatch dates were 0.29 d later each year, amounting to a 10-d shift over the course of the study. Median fledge dates did not shift over the 34-yr period, however, thus shortening the median nestling period duration by 14%. We tested several predictions regarding performance outcomes of the compressed nestling period, finding that later-hatched chicks fledged significantly younger than earlier-hatched chicks, and that younger fledglings left the colony with smaller bills and with more chick down. Interestingly, although younger chicks fledged significantly lighter and in worse body condition than older fledglings early in the study, this trend reversed over time, with younger chicks actually fledging heavier and in better body condition in more recent years. Smaller and lighter fledglings were less likely to recruit to the colony as adults. We find that delayed breeding has significantly compressed nestling periods at Punta Tombo, influencing chick growth and fledgling condition. These findings highlight the importance of studying phenology across multiple life events to understand the consequences of phenological shifts for organismal fitness. © 2021 by the Ecological Society of America

ABSTRACT: Contaminant levels are lower in Antarctica than elsewhere in the world because of its low anthropogenic activities. However, the northern region of the Antarctic Peninsula, is close to South America and experiences the greatest anthropogenic pressure in Antarctica. Here, we investigated, in two Antarctic Peninsula islands, intra and interspecific factors that influence the concentrations of 17 trace elements (TEs) in blood and feathers of three penguin species breeding sympatrically in relation to their trophic ecology assessed via a stable isotopic approach (C, N and S). Geographical location, foraging zone (δ13C and δ34S) and diet influences the interspecific difference, and sex and maturity stage diet influence the intraspecific difference of Pygoscelis penguins. Penguins from Livingston showed higher values (mean, ng. g−1, dry weight - dw) of Zn (103), Mn (0.3), and Fe (95) than those from King George Island (Zn: 80, Mn: 1.9, and Fe: 11). Gender-related differences were observed, as males showed significantly higher values (mean, ng. g−1, dw) of Rb (3.4) and δ15N in blood of gentoo, and Ca (1344) in Adélie feathers. Chicks of gentoo and Adélie presented higher Zn, Mg, Ca, and Sr and lower 13C values in blood than adults. The highest concentrations (mean, ng. g−1, dw) of Cd (0.2) and Cu (26), and the lowest δ15N values were found in chinstrap. Geographical, intraspecific (i.e., ontogenetic and gender-related) and interspecific differences in feeding seemed to have influenced TE and stable isotope values in these animals. The TE bioaccumulation by penguins may have also been influenced by natural enrichment in environmental levels of these elements, which seems to be the case for Fe, Zn, and Mn. However, the high level of some of the TEs (Mn, Cd, and Cr) may reflect the increase of local and global human activities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: In birds, possible explanations for a bias in brood sex ratio include differential cost of rearing nestlings of different sexes, and different parental fitness returns related to offspring sex. We studied brood sex ratio of Magellanic penguins, Spheniscus magellanicus, in Puerto Deseado for 3 years. Our objectives were to compare the growth curves and energetic costs of rearing nestlings of different sexes, and to evaluate the possible implications of environmental and parental condition in the establishment of a bias in the brood sex ratio. We also investigated the relationship between hatching order and sex, and its impact on brood survival. Asymptotic mass was 11.41% higher for males than for females. The energetic cost of feeding male nestlings was slightly higher than for feeding females, but the difference in energy requirements was only 2.6% of the total energy budget. During the 3 years, brood sex ratio was 0.53, and almost constant within years over the raising period, showing no sex allocation during feeding. Sea surface temperature, which is linked to higher prey abundance when colder, explained brood sex ratio at fledging. The sex ratio was male-biased during the coldest year. Parental body condition was not an important variable explaining brood sex ratio. There was no bias in nestling sex with respect to hatching order and nestling survival was not related to nestling sex. We conclude that, even though the cost of feeding male offspring is higher, it only involves a small fraction of total cost of raising nestlings and might not be responsible for an adaptive bias in the sex ratio of nestlings for this species. However, during good oceanic conditions, females might bias their brood sex ratio towards males, thereby potentially gaining an advantage by raising good-quality males. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) increased during the last decade worldwide and in the pristine wilderness of the Antarctic continent. They are used by scientists from diverse fields, television and film crews, tourists, and station personnel. To protect Antarctic wildlife from potential disturbance, policy makers and national authorities require scientific information on the vulnerability of such species. Our study provides knowledge on the behavioural reaction to UAV overflights of emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) during crèche and fledge phase. We investigated three main questions: what is the influence of flight height, do two different UAV models (a quadcopter and a fixed-wing UAV) have different effects, and what is the influence of different times during the season. For adult penguins we found no differences between flight heights of 70 m or higher and control situations when flying with the quadcopter. Such a flight height without significant change in reactions in comparison to control could not be found for neither chicks (with both UAV models tested) nor adults during fixed-wing flights. In general, the behavioural reaction to the quadcopter was higher than to the fixed-wing UAV regarding proportions of individuals. The comparison of two times revealed a stronger reaction on the later time (end of December) than on the earlier (mid of November). In general, the reaction was not very intense with only small proportions of individuals changing their behaviour. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Penguins dominate the Antarctic avifauna. As key animals in the Antarctic ecosystem, they are monitored to evaluate the ecological status of this pristine and remote region and specifically, they have been used as effective bioindicators suitable for long-term monitoring of metals in the Antarctic environment. However, studies about the role of this emblematic organism could play in the recycling of trace metals (TMs) in the Antarctic ecosystem are very limited. In this study we evaluate, using the peer review research articles already published and our own findings, the distribution of metals (i.e., Ca, Fe, Al, Na, Zn, Mg, Cu, K, Cd, Mn, Sr, Cr, Ni, Pb, Hg, V, Ba, Co, La, Ag, Rb, Hf, Sc, Au and Cs) and metalloids (As and Sb), measured in different biotic matrices, with emphasis on guano, of the Chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarcticus), Adélie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and Gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) penguins. Regarding bioactive metals, the high concentrations (μg g−1 dry weight) of Cu (2.0 ± 1.4) x 102, Fe (4.1 ± 2.9) x 102, Mn (30 ± 34) and Zn (210 ± 90) reported in the guano from all the penguin species studied including our data, are of the same order of magnitude as those reported for whale feces (μg g−1 dry weight): Cu (2.9 ± 2.4) x 102, Fe (1.5 ± 1.4) x 102, Mn (28 ± 17) and Zn (6.2 ± 4.3) x 102, and one order of magnitude higher than the metal contents in krill (μg g−1 dry weight) of Cu (10.2 ± 5.5), Fe (24 ± 29) and Zn (13.5 ± 1.7). This suggest that penguin's excretion products could be an important source of these essential elements in the surface water, with an estimated annual release on a breeding season for Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn respectively of 28, 56, 4 and 29 tons, for the Chinstrap, Adélie and Gentoo penguins. The results provide evidence on the potential influence of penguins recycling TMs in the surface layer of the water column. © 2021 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Seabird foraging activities are constrained by the heterogeneous distribution of prey, intra-specific competition, and the varying energy requirements throughout their life history. Investigations of intra-seasonal variation in foraging habitat will, therefore, provide clues to understand how predators respond to changes in the marine environment. As an abundant, central-place foraging mesopredator, we selected to examine this with Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) breeding in the Prydz Bay region where the sea-ice environment is heterogeneous and the largest populations in East Antarctica occur. In the summer of 2011/12, using GPS tracks, we calculated First Passage Time to extract Area Restricted Search (ARS) zones to indicate foraging intensity, and classified the ARS zones by K-means clustering. In total, 47, 64, 23 and 10 ARS zones were detected during early and late incubation, chick-guard and crèche stages (n = 4, 11, 6 and 3 birds). Higher and more stable sea-ice concentration and increased distance from the nearest major colony had positive effects on foraging intensity. The ARS zones were classified into nearshore, offshore and open water habitats. Birds used offshore areas and avoided open water during early incubation and crèche, when birds returned less frequently. During late incubation and chick-guard, when birds frequently returned, they used nearshore and open water areas as expected from the proportion of available habitats. Our results suggest that the pack ice and reduced intra-specific competition for prey were the preferred foraging condition for Adélie penguins, and highlight the importance of seasonal changes in sea-ice environment to their foraging habitat selectivity. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: We evaluated annual and regional variation in the dietary niche of Pygoscelis penguins including the sea ice-obligate Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae), and sea ice-intolerant chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarcticus) and gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) penguins, three species that nest throughout the western Antarctic Peninsula (AP) to test the sea ice trophic interaction hypothesis, which posits that penguin breeding populations with divergent trends, i.e., declining or increasing, are reliant on differing food webs. Our study relies on values of naturally occurring carbon (13C/12C, δ13C) and nitrogen (15N/14N, δ15N) stable isotopes as integrated proxies of penguin food webs measured over three years at three different breeding colonies. At Anvers Island in the north, where reductions in sea ice and changes in breeding population trends among sympatric sea ice-obligate (Adélie) and sea ice-intolerant (chinstrap and gentoo) penguins have been most notable, our analyses show that all three species of Pygoscelis penguins became more similar isotopically over the reproductive period. By late chick-rearing at Anvers Island, crèched chicks at 5-weeks-old for all species occupied similar trophic positions. Isotopic mixing models indicated that the proportions of prey provisioned by adult penguins to 5-week-old chicks at Anvers Island were generally similar across species within years, consisting primarily of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Crèched Adélie chicks had higher δ13C and δ15N values at Avian and Charcot Islands, southern breeding colonies where sea ice is more prominent and populations of Adélie penguins have increased or remain stable. Trophic position increased with latitude, while the proportions of prey provisioned by Adélie penguin adults to chicks at southern breeding colonies included species typical of high Antarctic marine food webs, especially crystal krill (Euphausia crystallorophias). A Bayesian metric for dietary niche width, standard ellipse area (SEA-B), indicated that Pygoscelis penguins with greater population changes in the north had more variability in dietary niche width than stable populations further south. Our results lend insight on marine food web drivers of Pygoscelis penguin reproduction at the regional scale and question the long-standing paradigm that Antarctic krill are the only food web component critical to penguin reproductive survival in this region of the Southern Ocean. © Copyright © 2021 Gorman, Ruck, Williams and Fraser.

ABSTRACT: Studying the magnetic fabric in volcanic edifices, particularly lava flows from recent eruptions, allows us to understand the orientation distribution of the minerals related to the flow direction and properly characterize older and/or eroded flows. In this work, the magnetic fabric from recent (Quaternary) lava flows (slightly inclined in seven sites and plateau lavas in two sites), pyroclastic deposits (two sites from a scoria cone) and volcanic cones, domes and plugs (three sites) from Penguin and Bridgeman islands, located in the Bransfield backarc basin, are presented. The volcanism in the two islands is related to rifting occurring due to the opening of the Bransfield Strait, between the South Shetlands archipelago and the Antarctic Peninsula. The direction of flow of magmatic material is unknown. Rock magnetic analyses, low temperature measurements and electron microscope observations (back-scattered electron imaging and Energy Dispersive X-ray analyses) reveal a Ti-poor magnetite (and maghemite) as the main carrier of the magnetic fabric. Hematite may be present in some samples. Samples from the centre of the lavas reveal a magnetic lineation either parallel or imbricated with respect to the flow plane, whereas in the plateau lavas the magnetic lineation is contained within the subhorizontal plane except in vesicle-rich samples, where imbrication occurs. The magnetic lineation indicates a varied flow direction in Bridgeman Island with respect to the spreading Bransfield Basin axis. The flow direction in the plateau lavas on Penguin Island is deduced from the imbrication of the magnetic fabric in the more vesicular parts, suggesting a SE-NW flow. The volcanic domes are also imbricated with respect to an upward flow, and the bombs show scattered distribution.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

ABSTRACT: Plumage colour variation occurs widely among bird species and is often associated with individual fitness. More specifically, colouration can affect thermoregulatory ability, mate selection and conspicuousness during foraging. Colour aberrations can be caused by genetic mutations, dietary imbalances, environmental conditions or disease and are rare. Plumage variations have previously been noted in Adélie penguins, although without any follow-up to measure implications for behaviour or fitness. To assess how this low-frequency condition affects breeding in Adélie penguins, we monitored the breeding of several colour-aberrant Adélie penguins during the 2019-2020 nesting season at the large Cape Crozier, Ross Island colony (> 300,000 pairs). In total, we found 12 individuals with unusual plumage for a frequency of 1:50,000 breeding penguins. There were seven dark brown Adélie penguins, three progressive greying Adélie penguins, one dilute Adélie penguin and one brown Adélie penguin, of which five were female, three male and four of unknown sex. Six colour aberrants initiated breeding with a normal-coloured mate, and five raised at least one chick to crèche. The likelihood of breeding and breeding success of colour aberrants were similar to those of normal-coloured Adélie penguins, suggesting that colour aberrations do not negatively affect breeding.

ABSTRACT: The use of UAVs has greatly increased in recent years, worldwide and in the Antarctic. Their use has recently increased even in very remote and pristine regions of the Antarctic. There is, however, very little information on the sensitivity of Antarctic species to such disturbance. In particular, there is nothing on the emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri), a flagship species of the region. We therefore, during November 2019, tested the responses of emperor penguins at the Atka Bay colony (Queen Maud Land). We video recorded the behaviour of adults and chicks during multirotor UAV activity and human approach. There were, in general, only moderate responses with distinct reactions in fewer than 20% of individuals observed. Chicks increased vigilance behaviour during UAV activity but both adults and chicks did so during human approach. We saw the greatest reaction in chicks during vertical UAV approach. Adults showed intermediate reactions to vertical UAV approach but only very few reactions to horizontal flights. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Seabirds allocate different amounts of energy to reproduction throughout the breeding season, depending on the trade-off between their own needs and those of their chicks and/or changes in environmental conditions. Provisioning parents therefore modulate their foraging behaviour and diet accordingly. However, for diving seabirds, many studies have extrapolated from individuals monitored over a short period and then assumed the observed patterns were representative of the birds’ foraging activity over the entire breeding stage/season. To address this shortcoming, we monitored continuously the diving performance of ten male little penguins from incubation to chick fledging. Simultaneously, isotopic composition was examined using δ15N and δ13C values from whole blood samples collected every 3 weeks. Birds dived more frequently but performed shallower and shorter dives as the season progressed. The guard period was especially different, with birds spending a consistently smaller proportion of time at the bottom and performing fewer prey pursuits, compared to other periods. Isotopic composition varied less within the season, although there was a slight tendency for δ15N values to decrease through time. Finally, isotopic values were highly repeatable within individuals, suggesting that individuals specialized on different prey and in different areas. Diving was less repeatable within individuals but still explained a small but significant part of the variance in blood isotopic values. Our results suggest that it is important to take into account individual variability over the course of the breeding season, as well as timing of bio-logger deployment within a stage when designing bio-logging studies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Scleral ossicles and other bony elements are present in the eyes of many vertebrates, including birds. In this study, the skeletal elements present in the penguin eye and orbit were imaged using macro photographs and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), to help elucidate their function and significance. A total of 36 scleral rings and three whole skulls were imaged. King (Aptenodytes patagonicus), Fiordland crested (Eudyptes pachyrhynchus), Snares crested (Eudyptes robustus), royal (Eudyptes schlegeli) and yellow-eyed (Megadyptes antipodes) penguins had between 12 and 14 elements in their scleral ring while the gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) had 14 and 17; little penguins (Eudyptula sp.) consistently had between 10 and 12 elements. All had at least two elements that overlapped, usually totally, each neighbour, and two that were overlapped by each neighbour. The interior structure of all ossicles revealed a lattice-like arrangement of struts typical of cancellous bone, the whole being surrounded by thick cortical bone. The scleral ring of a 10 week gentoo chick was not completely ossified but rather had multiple small holes within it on micro-CT. A large os opticus was present in one king penguin but in another bird of the same age and gender there was no such bone. Much smaller accessory bones were found in the posterior pole of one Snares crested and one little penguin. We conclude that the penguin scleral ring not only maintains the shape of the eye but also provides protection and a site of insertion for rectus muscles. However, the extreme variability in the os opticus suggests that it is not essential to normal function. © 2021 The Authors. Journal of Morphology published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT: Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) are a global threat, but impacts of these chemicals upon remote areas such as Antarctica remain unclear. Penguins can be useful species to assess the occurrence of POPs in Antarctic food webs. This work's aim was the evaluation of polychlorodibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in eggs of two penguin species, chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarticus) and gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua), breeding in the South Shetland Islands. Results showed a common pattern in POP levels regardless of the species, characterized by a major abundance of PCBs (98 %), followed by PBDEs (1–2%) and PCDD/Fs (<1 %). Concentrations of POPs in chinstrap and gentoo penguin eggs were 482 and 3250 pg/g l.w., respectively. PCBs, PBDEs and PCDD/Fs were found at higher concentrations in chinstrap penguin eggs, being these differences significant for PBDEs. Interspecies differences in POP levels agree well with potential trophic position differences among species due to changes in prey composition and foraging areas. POP profiles were dominated by congeners with a low degree of halogenation. Our results therefore suggest similar sources of POPs in the food webs exploited by both species and in both cases attributable to the long-range transportation rather than to the presence of local sources of POPs. TEQs were found between 1.38 and 7.33 pg/g l.w. and followed the pattern non-ortho dl-PCBs > PCDFs > PCDDs > mono-ortho dl-PCBs. TEQ values were lower than the threshold level for harmful effects in birds of 210 pg/g WHO-TEQ/g l.w. © 2021 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Animals living near urban habitats face many pressures linked with human disturbance. While individuals vary in their ability to cope with disturbance, it is predicted that individuals in highly disturbed environments will be bolder and more aggressive than those in less disturbed environments. Using little penguins, Eudyptula minor, we investigated whether individual aggressiveness was consistent across trials and whether aggressiveness was greater in colonies that experience higher levels of unregulated human disturbance. We scored aggressiveness at the nest, based on the penguins’ response to a standardized nest intrusion experiment, across four penguin colonies in South Australia. Nest defence scores were significantly repeatable over two trials, suggesting that it was a good indicator of personality in little penguins. Island was a significant predictor of nest defence score, with little penguins on Granite Island (the island with the greatest amount of unregulated human disturbance) being more aggressive than those on Troubridge Island (the island with the lowest amount of human disturbance). Considering that humans increasingly interact with animals, whether directly or indirectly, understanding the mechanisms behind nonrandom distribution of behaviours may have important implications for population management and conservation. © 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ABSTRACT: Research on immune response in polar fauna is gaining great importance due to different scenarios of environmental change. Total leukocyte counts in blood smears are one of the most widespread practices and provide useful information about the health status of individuals. However, there is no methodological agreement for these analyses. Total leukocyte counts can be performed at ×400 magnification in optical microscopy using 10,000 erythrocytes for standardizing. However, counting such number of erythrocytes is costly and time-consuming. Here, we describe a new technique to simplify leukocyte counts in blood smears from Antarctic wildlife based on the number of microscope fields instead of the number of erythrocytes which reduces considerably the time spent. We have counted total leukocytes using both methods in the three penguin species of the genus Pygoscelis—Adélie (P. adeliae), gentoo (P. papua), and chinstrap penguin (P. antarcticus)—and four Antarctic mammal species: crabeater seal (Lobodon carcinophaga), leopard seal (Hydrurga leptonyx), weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii), and southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina) for validation. Our results show a high correlation between the total leukocyte counts using 10,000 erythrocytes or 10 microscope fields for standardizing. These results show the reliability of the latter method for counting the total number of leukocytes in different species of birds and mammals saving time and effort. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: In colonial seabirds, differences in the nesting or fledging success have been associated with differences in nest position within the breeding aggregation (subcolony): less successful nests are located on the periphery, with more successful nests closer to the center. For Pygoscelid penguins, central nests tend to be larger, with nest size being an indicator of individual quality because stones must be gathered singly, so more stones reflect more individual effort. Competition for nest materials, including the collection of materials from another’s nest, has also frequently been described in penguins and other colonial seabirds. We used the data collected during the incubation stage from a total of 20 subcolonies at two separate breeding colonies of Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) on Ross Island (Antarctica) to test the influence of nest position on breeding success. We also investigated how competition for nest stones could occur at different intensities depending on size of the subcolony, nest position, and quality within a subcolony. We found that peripheral nests experienced lower breeding success and higher number of individuals attempting to remove stones with higher removal success rates than from nests toward the center. The higher costs associated with maintaining and defending nests that incur higher removal pressure could be an additional factor involved in the lower breeding success of peripheral nests. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The Palmer Deep canyon along the West Antarctic Peninsula is a biological hotspot with abundant phytoplankton and krill supporting Adélie and gentoo penguin rookeries at the canyon head. Nearshore studies have focused on physical mechanisms driving primary production and penguin foraging, but less is known about finer-scale krill distribution and density. We designed two acoustic survey grids paired with conductivity–temperature–depth profiles within adjacent Adélie and gentoo penguin foraging regions near Palmer Station, Antarctica. The grids were sampled from January to March 2019 to assess variability in krill availability and associations with oceanographic properties. Krill density was similar in the two regions, but krill swarms were longer and larger in the gentoo foraging region, which was also less stratified and had lower chlorophyll concentrations. In the inshore zone near penguin colonies, depth-integrated krill density increased from summer to autumn (January–March) independent of chlorophyll concentration, suggesting a life history-driven adult krill migration rather than a resource-driven biomass increase. The daytime depth of krill biomass deepened through the summer and became decoupled from the chlorophyll maximum in March as diel vertical migration magnitude likely increased. Penguins near Palmer Station did not appear to be limited by krill availability during our study, and regional differences in krill depth match the foraging behaviors of the two penguin species. Understanding fine-scale physical forcing and ecological interactions in coastal Antarctic hotspots is critical for predicting how environmental change will impact these ecosystems. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Wild penguins are facing increased threats to their populations and their welfare as a consequence of human activities. Understanding the perception of animal welfare is essential to identify ethical concerns related to the negative impact of anthropogenic factors on wild species and to guide conservation efforts that reflect societal values. Since penguin conservation is of general interest, we examined the human dimension of welfare assessment across a range of interest groups concerned with penguins, seabird biology and wildlife conservation. We provided participants with a Penguin Welfare Assessment Tool (PWAT) based on the five domains model. The PWAT supports consideration of the impact of four physical aspects on welfare-relevant mental states. Bibliometric analysis of keywords from 347 scientific articles indicated that penguins around the world face five main types (themes) of anthropogenic factors and we then developed five hypothetical scenarios, each related to one theme. Seventy-five participants scored the overall impact of the events described in the scenarios on penguin welfare as negative using the PWAT. Participants rated short-duration, high-intensity events (i.e., being trapped in a ghost fishing net) as having a significantly more severe impact on penguin welfare than low-intensity, long-duration events (P < 0.0001). Scores provided by participants for each domain for each scenario were largely as expected and we found good correlation (all P < 0.0001) between the physical domains and “mental state” for all scenarios, indicating that the tool was facilitating the participants' assessment of welfare. No evidence was found that experience of working or studying penguins, or indeed any other demographic factor investigated, influenced the assessments of welfare. We found little agreement between participants in the scores provided (unalike scores mostly between 0.7 and 0.8), and agreement between participants with experience of working with penguins was no better than between participants without such experience. We discuss the possibility that low agreement within different interest groups may be improved by providing more scientific information to support the evaluation of penguin welfare. We conclude that scientific knowledge of penguin biological responses to anthropogenic factors is vital to support the evaluation of wild penguin welfare by the public and other stakeholders. © Copyright © 2021 Freire, Massaro, McDonald, Trathan and Nicol.

ABSTRACT: The distribution of emperor penguins is circumpolar, with 54 colony locations currently reported of which 50 are currently extant as of 2019. Here we report on eight newly discovered colonies and confirm the rediscovery of three breeding sites, only previously reported in the era before Very High Resolution satellite imagery was available, making a total of 61 breeding locations. This represents an increase of ~20% in the number of breeding sites, but, as most of the colonies appear to be small, they may only increase the total population by around 5–10%. The discoveries have been facilitated by the use of Sentinel2 satellite imagery, which has a higher resolution and more efficient search mechanism than the Landsat data previously used to search for colonies. The small size of these new colonies indicates that considerations of reproductive output in relation to metabolic rate during huddling is likely to be of interest. Some of the colonies exist in offshore habitats, something not previously reported for emperor penguins. Comparison with recent modelling results show that the geographic locations of all the newly found colonies are in areas likely to be highly vulnerable under business-as-usual greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, suggesting that population decreases for the species will be greater than previously thought. © 2020 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: We report the discovery of a dead Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) found on Juquehy Beach (23°46′S 45°44′W), municipality of São Sebastião, Brazil, on September 9th 2020. Following necropsy, we noted the presence of an adult size PFF-2 protective mask within the stomach of the penguin which we inferred as the cause of death. As far as we are aware, this is the first recorded instance of marine animal mortality by protective face mask ingestion. Whilst concerns have been raised relating microplastic contamination in marine environments from Covid-19 related waste, there has been relatively less attention paid to the potential risk of macro-scale contaminants, such as protective face coverings. We suggest that Covid-19 related macro contaminants be considered in coastal marine risk assessments and urge further research on this topic. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Multi-tissue trace elements (TEs), C, N concentrations and stable isotopes (δ13C, δ15N) of chick carcasses and eggs of Adélie and Emperor penguins were studied to i) provide reference data before the recent institution of the Ross Sea Marine Protected Area (Antarctica), and ii) provide conversion factors that allow estimating C, N, δ13C and δ15N in edible tissues from non-edible ones, thus improving the use of stable isotopes in contamination and trophic transfer studies. Higher concentrations of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn and Pb were found in chick carcasses than in eggs, suggesting increasing contamination in recent decades and high toxicity risks for penguin consumers. Isotopic conversion factors highlighted small differences among body tissues and conspecifics. These values suggest that chick carcasses are reliable indicators of the energy pathways underlying the two penguin species, their trophic position in the food web and their exposure to TEs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is an important transcription factor that plays a key role in melanogenesis, cell proliferation, survival and immune defense in vertebrate. However, its function and function mechanism in bivalve are still rarely known. In this research, first, a Mitf gene was characterized from Pteria penguin (P. penguin). The PpMitf contained an open reading frame of 1,350 bp, encoding a peptide of 449 deduced amino acids with a highly conserved basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLH-LZ) domain. The PpMITF shared 55.7% identity with amino acid sequence of Crassostrea gigas (C. gigas). Tissue distribution analysis revealed that PpMitf was highly expressed in mantle and hemocytes, which were important tissues for color formation and innate immunity. Second, the functions of PpMitf in melanin synthesis and innate immunity were identified. The PpMitf silencing significantly decreased the tyrosinase activity and melanin content, indicating PpMitf involved in melanin synthesis of P. penguin. Meanwhile, the PpMitf silencing clearly down-regulated the expression of PpBcl2 (B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 gene) and antibacterial activity of hemolymph supernatant, indicating that PpMitf involved in innate immunity of P. penguin. Third, the function mechanism of PpMitf in immunity was analyzed. The promoter sequence analysis of tyrosinase (Tyr) revealed two highly conserved E-box elements, which were specifically recognized by HLH-LZ of MITF. The luciferase activities analysis showed that Mitf could activate the E-box in Tyr promoter through highly conserved bHLH-LZ domain, and demonstrated that PpMitf involved in melanin synthesis and innate immunity by regulating tyrosinase expression. Finally, melanin from P. penguin, the final production of Mitf-Tyr-melanin pathway, was confirmed to have direct antibacterial activity. The results collectively demonstrated that PpMitf played a key role in innate immunity through activating tyrosinase-mediated melanin synthesis in P. penguin. © Copyright © 2021 Yu, Lu, Zhong, Qu, Wang, Yu and Chen.

ABSTRACT: Rapid environmental changes can dramatically and durably affect the animal's foraging behavior. In the Ross Sea (Antarctica), calving of the Nansen Ice Shelf in 2016 opened a newly accessible marine area of 214 km2. In this study, we examined the foraging behavior of Adélie penguins from the nearby Inexpressible Island in December 2018, by tracking 27 penguins during their at-sea trips using GPS, depth and video loggers. The penguins mainly foraged within 88.2 ± 42.9 km of their colony, for 23.4 ± 6.8 h. Five penguins headed south to the newly exposed habitat along the Nansen Ice Shelf, whereas 22 penguins exploited previously available foraging areas. There was no significant difference in any of the foraging trip or diving parameters between the two penguin groups; however, in the calved region the penguins were diving into shallow areas more often than did the other penguins. These results show that Adélie penguins on Inexpressible Island had explored the newly exposed area after calving. We conclude that the penguins respond to newly available habitat following stochastic environmental events, either through information sharing at the colony, and/or by balancing prey availability per capita across the foraging sites. Considering that this penguin breeding area is under investigation for the establishment of an Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA), the results of this study may provide insights for evaluating the ecological importance of this area and formulating an ASPA management plan for conservation. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Microplastics (< 5 mm in size) are known to be widespread in the marine environment but are still poorly studied in Polar Regions, particularly in the Antarctic. As penguins have a wide distribution around Antarctica, three congeneric species: Adélie (Pygoscelis adeliae), chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarcticus) and gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) were selected to evaluate the occurrence of microplastics across the Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia Sea. Scat samples (used as a proxy of ingestion), were collected from breeding colonies over seven seasons between 2006 and 2016. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), present in scat samples, contributed 85%, 66% and 54% of the diet in terms of frequency of occurrence to the diet of Adélie, gentoo and chinstrap penguins, respectively. Microplastics were found in 15%, 28% and 29% scats of Adélie, chinstrap and gentoo penguin respectively. A total of 92 particles were extracted from the scats (n = 317) and 32% (n = 29) were chemically identified via micro-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (μ-FTIR). From all the particles extracted, 35% were identified as microplastics, particularly polyethylene (80%) and polyester (10%). It was not possible to ascertain the identification of the remaining 10% of samples. Other anthropogenic particles were identified in 55% of samples, identified as cellulose fibres. The results show a similar frequency of occurrence of particles across all colonies, suggesting there is no particular point source for microplastic pollution in the Scotia Sea. Additionally, no clear temporal variation in the number of microplastics in penguins was observed. Overall, this study reveals the presence of microplastics across Antarctica, in three penguin species and offers evidence of other anthropogenic particles in high numbers. Further research is needed to better understand the spatio-temporal dynamics, fate and effect of microplastics on these ecosystems, and improve plastic pollution policies in Antarctica. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Background: Avian malaria has caused mortalities in captive penguins worldwide and it is a conservation threat for some wild penguins. The experience of staff working on penguins is highly valuable for the improvement of captivity conditions. Methods: An online questionnaire was designed to collect avian malaria information in penguins in the UK. Volunteers with diverse experience reviewed it for scientific value and clarity, and it was supported by the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums. Results: Forty-two institutions were contacted by email, obtaining 27 complete and five partial responses. Eighteen institutions reported avian malaria in 38 suspected and 37 confirmed outbreaks in the past 20 years, mainly occurring in the summer and recent years. Proportional risk was higher in the south east region of England. Humboldt and African penguins were more commonly affected, and prevalence was mostly low or medium, but lethality was high. Different treatment protocols were reported with inconsistent outcomes. Conclusions: Penguins’ susceptibility, their translocation across institutions, and the wide distribution of avian malaria make this disease a constant threat. Preventive and control measures are recommended, including testing for early diagnosis and treatment, avoiding prolonged stressful events in penguins, and monitoring and controlling mosquito vectors. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: A novel actinobacterium NJES-13T was isolated from the gut of Antarctic emperor penguin Aptenodytes forsteri. The new isolate produces bioactive gephyromycin metabolites and exopolysaccharides (EPS). Cells were Gram-negative, motile with the peritrichous flagella, and with a faint layer of extracellular slime. Colonies were yellow when grown on marine agar, ISP1, 2, 4 and TSA media. The strain developed clusters of coccoid, and divided by binary fission in the early phase of growth. The cell clusters were gradually disrupted during the stationary phase and formed short rod-shape cells which were interconnected by viscous EPS showing a three-dimensional net-like morphology, and contained polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) granules inside the cells. Growth of strain NJES-13T was observed at 15–45 °C, at pH 6.0–9.0 with 0.5–9.0% (w/v) NaCl. The complete genomic size of strain NJES-13T was 3.45 Mb with a DNA G + C content of 67.0 mol%. The combined polyphasic taxonomic characterizations presented in this study unequivocally separated strain NJES-13T from all known genera in the family Dermatophilaceae. Thus, strain NJES-13T represents a novel species of a new genus, for which the name Gephyromycinifex aptenodytis gen. nov., and sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is NJES-13T (= CCTCC 2019007T = KCTC 49281T). Genetic prediction of secondary metabolite biosynthesis revealed a 44.5 kb-long biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) of type III polyketide synthase (PKS) as well as four other BGCs, indicating its great potential to produce novel bioactive metabolites derived from the gut microbiota of animals living in the extreme habitats in the Antarctica. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

ABSTRACT: Remotely estimating prey-capture rates in wild animals is key to assess foraging success. In diving animals, accelerometers have been particularly useful to remotely detect prey captures and have been shown to be more precise than traditional estimates relying on depth-derived measures (e.g., wiggles). However, validations of the accelerometry technique using a gold standard (i.e., with supervision) have been mostly restricted to shallow diving species, which can be equipped with camera-loggers for visual validation of prey-capture events. In species diving near the euphotic limit (150–200 m), accelerometers remain mostly untested due to the difficulty of validating such methods in darkness at extreme depth in the wild. In addition, prey-pursuits in low-light conditions might not result in intense and long-duration acceleration signatures, as predator–prey perception likely occurs at close-range in the dark (i.e., the “visual-interactions hypothesis”). We combined accelerometers with beak-opening sensors (for validation) and depth recorders on a wild deep-diving seabird, the king penguin Aptenodytes patagonicus, to describe prey captures at depth and create predictive models using accelerometers. Surprisingly, prey pursuits and captures were similar in duration (3.9 ± 3.5 s) and intensity (0.78 ± 0.31 g) as shallow-diving species reported by similar studies. As accelerometry signatures were distinct, accelerometry-derived variables were almost twice as accurate (Mean-squared error = 8.6) at predicting prey-capture events as depth-derived variables (“wiggles”, Mean-squared error = 16.0). As in the shallow-diving species, accelerometry outperforms traditional depth-derived models at measuring the foraging intake in deep-diving animals, highlighting the usefulness of accelerometers for measuring animal behavior. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: In this research, a new approach has been suggested for providing an optimization bidding strategy in the day-ahead market for case research in China. This research uses a newly developed version of Emperor Penguin Optimizer (CEPO) to govern the fitness function of all individuals based on the Market Clearing Price (MCP) probability function. The resemblance amounts between each day and the next day are used for clustering. The clustering is performed based on the well-known subtractive clustering methodology. A simulation model using the probability function in MCP estimates the fitness function of the generated strategies. The results indicate that this method proposed is a statistically effective bidding design in China's day-ahead market related to two other plans from the literature. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Growing animals should allocate their limited resources in ways that maximize survival. Seabird chicks must balance the growth of features and fat reserves needed to survive on land with those needed to successfully fledge and survive at sea. We used a large, 34-year dataset to examine energy allocation in Magellanic penguin chicks. Based on the temporal trends in the selective pressures that chicks faced, we developed predictions relating to the timing of skeletal feature growth (Prediction 1), variation in skeletal feature size and shape (Prediction 2), and responses to periods of high energetic constraint (Prediction 3). We tested our predictions using descriptive statistics, generalized additive models, and principal component analysis. Nearly all of our predictions were supported. Chicks grew their feet first, then their flippers. They continued to grow their bill after fledging (Prediction 1). Variance in feature size increased in young chicks but declined before fledging; this variance was largely driven by overall size rather than by shape (Prediction 2). Chicks that died grew slower and varied more in feature size than those that fledged (Prediction 2). Skeletal features grew rapidly prior to thermoregulation and feet and flippers were 90% grown prior to juvenile feather growth; both thermoregulation and feather growth are energetically expensive (Prediction 3). To avoid starvation, chicks prioritized storing mass during the first 10 days after hatching; then, the body condition of chicks began to decline (Prediction 3). In contrast to our prediction of mass prioritization in young chicks, chicks that were relatively light for their age had high skeletal size to mass ratios. Chicks did not show evidence of reaching physiological growth limits (Prediction 3). By examining energy allocation patterns at fine temporal scales and in the context of detailed natural history data, we provide insight into the trade-offs faced by growing animals. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: To identify the dietary composition and characteristics of both Adélie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and Emperor (Aptenodytes forsteri) penguins at four breeding sites, we performed stable carbon (δ13 C) and nitrogen (δ15 N) isotope analysis of down samples taken from penguin chicks. Adélie Penguin chicks at Cape Hallett mostly fed on Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba; 65.5 ± 3.5%), a reflection of the prevalence of that species near Cape Hallett, and no significant differences were noted between 2017 and 2018. However, Adélie Penguin chicks at Inexpressible Island, located near Terra Nova Bay, fed on both Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarctica; 42.5%) and ice krill (Euphausia crystallorophias; 47%), reflecting the high biomass observed in Terra Nova Bay. Meanwhile, no significant difference was noted between the two breeding sites of the Emperor Penguin. Emperor Penguin chicks predominantly fed on Antarctic silverfish (74.5 ± 2.1%) at both breeding sites (Cape Washington and Coulman Island), suggesting that diet preference represents the main factor influencing Emperor Penguin foraging. In contrast, the diet of the Adélie Penguin reflects presumed regional differences in prey prevalence, as inferred from available survey data. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Seabirds often engage in coordinated, cooperative foraging to improve detection and capture of prey. An extreme example of such coordinated behavior is synchronicity, whereby the movements of individuals are aligned temporally and spatially. Synchronous diving among penguins has been reported, but simultaneous observations of predation by synchronously diving individuals have not. We instrumented chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarcticus) during their incubation period in December 2019 from Cape Shirreff, Livingston Island, Antarctica (60.79°W, 62.46°S) with video and depth recorders to monitor predator foraging behavior and prey consumption rates. Serendipitously, two instrumented individuals, accompanied by a third, banded individual, engaged in synchronous foraging activities on Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) for 9.25 h. This group formed ashore, transited together to their foraging area, remained in close visual contact after dives, synchronously timed diving behavior, and foraged at similar depths. Prey capture rates were positively correlated across dives and total consumption estimates were equivalent for the two instrumented birds during the video observation period. Video loggers confirmed that synchronous diving and foraging behavior are among the behavioral repertoire of chinstrap penguins and demonstrated equivalent prey capture rates by synchronously foraging predators. The results further suggest that group formation while ashore and group cohesion during a foraging trip may facilitate shared foraging success among group members. © 2021, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.

ABSTRACT: Rehabilitation of sick or injured wildlife supports wild populations of threatened species by improving the health of individuals. Post-release assessment of the efficacy of rehabilitation relies on re-sighting and identification of both rehabilitated and comparable wild individuals. For species or age classes with naturally low survival rates and re-sighting probabilities, evaluating the long-term success of rehabilitation is challenging. We use a rehabilitation database in conjunction with a long-term monitoring database to determine rehabilitation outcomes for yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes) chicks across 10 breeding seasons. Although rehabilitated chicks fledged at a higher mass, their post-fledging survival probability was lower (0.23 ± 0.10—0.47 95% CI) than that of healthy (>5 kg) wild-fledging conspecifics (0.38 ± 0.26—0.51 95% CI), or even of underweight (<5 kg) chicks fledging naturally (0.28 ± 0.11—0.53 95% CI). Removing underweight chicks for rehabilitation did not improve parent survival to the following season nor did it influence future breeding propensity; c. 100% of parents subsequently attempted to breed regardless of previous breeding outcome or interventions. Most wildlife rehabilitation programmes assume that efforts are improving the conservation status of the species, but longer-term implications must be tested to ensure that scarce resources are expended on the best possible conservation outcomes. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Accurate sensing of the environmental temperature is crucial for the survival and wellbeing of organisms. In vertebrates, the cold- and menthol-activated ion channel TRPM8 acts as the prime molecular sensor of cool temperatures. By comparing TRPM8 in vertebrates with different habitat temperatures, from elephants to penguins, Yang et al. identify key residues within the pore domain that determine the channel's cold sensitivity. Strikingly, mice engineered to express penguin TRPM8 show a remarkable tolerance to cold. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Concentrations of 29 elements were analyzed in the marginal area and central area of the shell nacreous layer of the winged pearl oyster Pteria penguin using a laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. Color of the two shell areas was determined using the color parameter values of lightness, greenness/redness, and blueness/yellowness. It is shown that the concentrations of the elements and the nacreous color are different in the marginal area and central area. The concentrations of Mg, P, B, Li, Cu, and Mo are significantly correlated with lightness and differently distributed in the two shell areas (P < 0.05). The concentration of Na and Mg is significantly related to greenness/redness and differently distributed in the two shell areas (P < 0.05). The concentration of Na, Mg, P, B, Li, and Mo is significantly related to blueness/yellowness and differently distributed in the two shell areas (P < 0.05). The concentration of Mg significantly related to lightness, greenness/redness, and blueness/yellowness and differently distributed in the two shell areas (P < 0.05). This study provides a new perspective to illustrate the mechanism of color change between the marginal and central areas. © 2020 National Shellfisheries Association. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: At fledging, juvenile king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) must overcome the tremendous energetic constraints imposed by their marine habitat, including during sustained extensive swimming activity and deep dives in cold seawater. Both endurance swimming and skeletal muscle thermogenesis require high mitochondrial respiratory capacity while the submerged part of dive cycles repeatedly and greatly reduces oxygen availability, imposing a need for solutions to conserve oxygen. The aim of the present study was to determine in vitro whether skeletal muscle mitochondria become more 'thermogenic' to sustain heat production or more 'economical' to conserve oxygen in sea-acclimatized immature penguins (hereafter 'immatures') compared with terrestrial juveniles. Rates of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation were measured in permeabilized fibers and mitochondria from the pectoralis muscle. Mitochondrial ATP synthesis and coupling efficiency were measured in isolated muscle mitochondria. The mitochondrial activities of respiratory chain complexes and citrate synthase were also assessed. The results showed that respiration, ATP synthesis and respiratory chain complex activities in pectoralis muscles were increased by sea acclimatization. Furthermore, muscle mitochondria were on average 30-45% more energy efficient in sea-acclimatized immatures than in pre-fledging juveniles, depending on the respiratory substrate used (pyruvate, palmitoylcarnitine). Hence sea acclimatization favors the development of economical management of oxygen, decreasing the oxygen needed to produce a given amount of ATP. This mitochondrial phenotype may improve dive performance during the early marine life of king penguins, by extending their aerobic dive limit. © 2020. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd

ABSTRACT: In the Southern Ocean and adjacent waters, early stages of cephalopods play an important role in food webs as prey to top predators, but few is known regarding their biology and availability. Snares Penguin, Eudyptes robustus, is a top predator endemic to Snares Islands (New Zealand) that feed on cephalopods. As historical data on diet are rare for this species, Snares Penguins were used as biological samplers to evaluate the cephalopod component of its diet, where habitat and trophic level of cephalopods around the Snares Islands was assessed through stable isotope analysis. Moreover, ontogenic changes of juvenile squid were evaluated. Data collection were carried out during the breeding season 1986–87 and its analysis revealed that penguins fed on three juvenile cephalopod species: two squids (Nototodarus sloanii and Moroteuthopsis ingens) and one octopod (Octopus campbelli). Nototodarus sloanii was the most important species in frequency of occurrence and mass, whereas M. ingens was the most important in number. Juvenile squid species showed similar δ13C values, suggesting both occupied similar habitats on the Snares shelf, whereas juvenile O. campbelli showed lower δ13C values. Moreover, O. campbelli fed on higher trophic level (δ15N) prey relative to squid species. Lower diversity and larger sizes of cephalopods were found when compared with data from 2002. This study shows that Snares Penguin can be a good local biological sampler of juvenile cephalopods during their breeding season, providing both essential biogeographic information of cephalopod diversity and relevant historical information for the conservation of this endemic penguin species. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The impact of climate and weather on penguin ecology has attracted much research attention. To reconstruct the history of the penguin population, penguin carcasses on the surface and three ornithogenic sediment profiles were collected in a ditch area beneath abandoned penguin subcolonies on a high terrace to the northwest of the modern colony in Seaview Bay, on Inexpressible Island, East Antarctica. A rapid increase in penguin-derived element contents in the sediment profiles at ~1700 Common Era (CE) indicates an increase in the penguin population of research area at the end of the Little Ice Age. However, surficial carcasses, geochemical characteristics of the sediment profiles, and field evidence indicate the subsequent abandonment of these penguin subcolonies. A period of intensified streamflow activity resulting from meltwater is a possible explanation for the colony abandonment. The dating results of the carcasses and sediment profiles constrain this event to around the late nineteenth century. The meltwater streams can be attributed to the interaction between enhanced moist air mass transport to the coastline of Victoria Land, rising temperatures, and the sloping topography. Comparisons with other regional records suggest that this type of event is common across East Antarctica and has significant impacts on penguin ecology. ©2020. American Geophysical Union.

ABSTRACT: Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) are seabirds that live exclusively in Antarctica, one of the planet's last pristine areas. However, this remote region is experiencing a continuing expansion of human activities that may affect Antarctic fauna. Trace metals constitute a menace to seabirds because they can adversely affect their health. There is a lack of studies relating to metals' levels in feathers with morphological parameters of seabirds. Trace metal levels were measured in Adélie penguin feathers and their body condition through the relative condition factor (ReCF) in adult individuals from two South Shetland Islands locations and two from Graham Land. Consequently, we determined the levels of some metals in feathers to see any relationship with morphological parameters linked to the bird's health. Our results showed significant differences in metals among locations studied and a significant relationship between ReCF with Cu and Zn in one of the South Shetland Islands. Also, penguins exhibited a significantly lower weight. We found a positive correlation between non-essential with essential metals, indicating that Cu acts as a detoxifying agent for Cr, Cd, and Pb. In contrast, Se could be for V and Pb. Although the relationship between most metals with ReCF was not significant, some site-specific factors may be influencing it, whereas metals may be affecting the organisms at low biological levels. Molecular, biochemical, and genetic studies are required to elucidate this issue. © 2020, Escuela de Ciencias del Mar. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Aim: We hypothesized that regional spatial organization of Antarctic penguin breeding populations was affected by social factors, that is, proximity and size of adjacent colonies, and by physical factors, that is, availability of breeding habitat and proximity of polynyas and submarine canyons where prey is abundant. The hypothesis of Furness and Birkhead (1984), that forage competition and density-dependence affect geographic structure of seabird populations, was tested previously for Antarctic penguins when biologging to quantify colony foraging areas was less common and when assessments of colony size reflected a compendium of historical counts. These data on foraging areas and colony size are now available following 20 years of frequent biologging and real-time satellite data on colony locations and sizes. Location: Antarctica. Major taxa studied: Penguin species. Time period: Present day. Methods: We prepared a literature summary on the basis of biologging studies to improve assessment of foraging ranges. We collated colony sizes from recent sources and integrated them with data on submarine canyon systems and polynyas. We used geospatial models to assess the relationships of the latter features to colony size, clustering, and distribution around Antarctica. Results: The equal spacing of emperor penguin colonies was constant, with spacing a function of foraging range. In contrast, colonies of other penguin species were clustered, with small colonies adjacent to one another and within the outer edge of the foraging area of large colonies. Colonies and especially clusters occurred near polynyas and canyons around Antarctica. Main conclusions: Density-dependent processes and geography explained penguin colony distribution. We conclude that inter- and intraspecific trophic competition affects the geographic structuring of colony distribution and size, although not necessarily in the same way among species. Results are relevant to assessing effects of climate, ecosystem dynamics, fisheries and other factors on penguin population trends at regional scales. We suggest that considering penguin colony distribution and abundance at the regional or cluster level is necessary to understand changes in these attributes. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

ABSTRACT: AIM: Management of competition with predators is an important consideration for fisheries, particularly within marine protected areas (MPAs) where conservation is a primary objective. We aimed to test whether static no-take zones within a large, sustainable-use MPA prevented overlap between gentoo penguins and a krill fishery during two winters with contrasting prey fields. LOCATION: South Georgia, Southwest Atlantic Ocean. METHOD: We used satellite tracking (N = 16, June–September 2018) to describe gentoo penguin movements and distribution and quantified their overlap with the MPA’s no-take zone (NTZ) and the krill fishing grounds. DNA metabarcoding of scats (N = 220, April–September 2018) was used to quantify diet. RESULTS: When krill were at moderate densities and evenly distributed in 2001, gentoo penguins would have spent all of their time within the 12 NM NTZ, but when availability was low in 2018, they spent 46.3% of their time outside the NTZ and 9.6% within the krill fishing grounds. The extension of the NTZ to 30 km in response to this finding would have produced a 14.9% increase in protection for penguins and displaced 4% of fishery hauls. Gentoo penguin diet comprised 25.8% krill, which is lower than in the late 1980s but more than in 2009. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Gentoo penguins extend their foraging range when krill is scarce, which increases the potential for spatial overlap with the krill fishery during periods of nutritional stress. Current regulations allow for expansion of both extent and catches by the krill fishery and, should this occur, gentoo penguins may face heightened risks from competition. A dynamic ocean management framework, that extends closed areas in response to near real-time data on penguin movements and krill density estimates, may reduce the potential for competition in this sustainable-use MPA while allowing a profitable krill fishery. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Elephant Island sits on the front lines of ecological change in the Scotia Arc region, but most of the island has remained unsurveyed for nearly 50 years. As a result, there has been no way to establish whether changes on the island reflect those to the south along the Western Antarctic Peninsula or whether, in contrast, populations have remained stable, as on the more northerly South Sandwich Islands. At the core of the Chinstrap Penguin (Pygoscelis antarcticus) breeding range, at the southern edge of the Macaroni Penguin (Eudyptes chrysolophus) and (very recently) King Penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus) ranges, at the northern limit of the Adélie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) range, and in an area where Gentoo Penguin (Pygoscelis papua) populations are expanding southward, Elephant Island is situated at a unique ecological crossroads, hosting both sub-Antarctic and Antarctic seabirds, the former of which may be responding favorably to the very same climate changes that imperil the latter. Fortunately, an exhaustive census of the island in 1970–71 provides a rigorous baseline against which to document ecological change. Here, we report on the first complete survey of the island since 1970–71, conducted from January 9–20, 2020. Results indicate a decrease in Chinstrap Penguin populations, a doubling of Gentoo Penguins, a stable number of Macaroni Penguins, continuing occupancy by a few Adélie Penguins, and evidence of King Penguin breeding expansion. Our findings demonstrate that Elephant Island’s seabird community has changed dramatically over the past five decades and that these changes appear to be ongoing. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Previously, we isolated jacalin-related lectins termed PPL2, PPL3 (PPL3A, 3B and 3C) and PPL4 from the mantle secretory fluid of Pteria penguin (Mabe) pearl shell. They showed the sequence homology with the plant lectin family, jacalin-related β-prism fold lectins (JRLs). While PPL3s and PPL4 shared only 35%–50% homology to PPL2A, respectively, they exhibited unique carbohydrate binding properties based on the multiple glycan-binding profiling data sets from frontal affinity chromatography analysis. In this paper, we investigated biomineralization properties of these lectins and compared their biomineral functions. It was found that these lectins showed different effects on CaCO3 crystalization, respectively, although PPL3 and PPL2A showed similar carbohydrate binding specificities. PPL3 suppressed the crystal growth of CaCO3 calcite, while PPL2A increased the number of contact polycrystalline calcite composed of more than one crystal with various orientations. Furthermore, PPL4 alone showed no effect on CaCO3 crystalization; however, PPL4 regulated the size of crystals collaborated with N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and chitin oligomer, which are specific in recognizing carbohydrates for PPL4. These observations highlight the unique functions and molecular evolution of this lectin family involved in the mollusk shell formation. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: As humans are present in Antarctica only for scientific and tourism-related purposes, it is often described as a pristine region. However, studies have identified measurable levels of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), such as organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), in the Antarctic region. These are highly toxic anthropogenic compounds with tendency to travel long distances and reach remote environments, where they can bioaccumulate in the biota. Penguins are exposed to POPs mainly through their diet, which they partially eliminate via feathers. Species of the genus Pygoscelis occur around Antarctic continent and its surrounding regions, and can act as indicators of contaminants that reach the continent. Here, we report OCP and PCB levels in feathers of male and female penguins of P. adeliae, P. antarcticus and P. papua from King George Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. Interspecific, sex- and body-size-related differences were investigated in the contamination profiles of PCBs and OCPs. Feather samples were collected from adult penguins (n = 41). Quantification of compounds was performed by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The three Pygoscelis species presented similar contamination profiles, with higher concentrations of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (∑DDT; 1.56–3.82 ng g−1 dw), lighter PCB congeners (∑PCB: 11.81–18.65 ng g−1 dw) and HCB (hexachlorobenzene: 1.65–4.06 ng g−1 dw). Amongst the three penguin species, P. antarcticus had lower and P. papua higher concentrations of most of the compounds identified. We found interspecific differences in POPs accumulation as well as sex differences in POP concentrations. Our data indicate a small but significant positive correlation between body size and the concentrations of some compounds. Despite the overall low concentrations found, this study increases knowledge of the occurrence of POPs in Antarctic penguins, thereby reinforcing concerns that Antarctica, although remote and perceived to be protected, is not free from the impact of anthropogenic pollutants. This is the first report of PCB levels in Pygoscelis penguin feathers and presents original data on the accumulation of POPs in Antarctic penguins. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Mortality data for Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) housed in zoos and aquariums in the United States has not previously been published. Necropsy and histopathology records were examined for Magellanic penguins housed at 12 Association of Zoos and Aquariums institutions from 2008 through 2018. If birds lived through the first year, the mean longevity was found to be 18.9 years of age (standard deviation: 7.9). Prefledge chicks and geriatric penguins experienced the highest mortality rates. Aspergillosis was a major cause of death in this species. There was no significant difference in mortality between males and females. Based on these data, recommendations for the husbandry and veterinary care of captive Magellanic penguins can be made. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC

ABSTRACT: The effect of low salinity levels on byssal re-attachment behavior in Pteria penguin juveniles was observed in the laboratory. Juvenile pearl oysters were submerged in seawater blended to 8.0, 12.0, 16.0, 20.0, 24.0, 28.0, and 32.0 salinity levels for a period of 48 hr. The sub-lethal salinity level was greater than 20.0 psu. Although salinity levels of 20.0 and 24.0 psu did not affect the oyster survival, the observed byssogenesis activity was significantly reduced and locomotion activity was delayed. Description of the effects of low salinity levels on the byssal re-attachment behavior of P. penguin juveniles provides a foundation for the design of more complex experiments and approaches to further the exploration and development of improved pearl production techniques. © 2020 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The Macaroni penguin Eudyptes chrysolophus is a small crested penguin. In this study, the complete mitochondrial genome of E. chrysolophus is revealed for the first time. The mitogenome sequence is circular and 17,059 bp in length. It contains 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, and two ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes similar to other Spheniscidae species. The total nucleotide composition is 30.53% (A), 32.86% (C), 13.96% (G), and 22.66% (T), and 46.81% for overall GC contents. The phylogenetic analysis shows a close relationship between E. chrysolophus and E. schlegeli. Our findings would be useful for further studies on phylogenetics and evolutionary history of the genus Eudyptes. © 2021 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: We compared the osteology of the late Eocene to early Miocene penguin-like Plotopteridae from the North Pacific Basin with that of Paleocene stem group representatives of the Sphenisciformes and identified previously unrecognized similarities and differences. New data on the osteology of plotopterids, like the shape of the caudal end of the mandible, support a position of plotopterids outside the Suloidea, the clade formed by Sulidae, Phalacrocoracidae, and Anhingidae. However, as assumed by previous authors, the diving adaptations of plotopterids and sphenisciforms are likely to have evolved independently, and the resemblances in different parts of the postcranial skeleton therefore constitute one of the more striking examples of parallelism among tetrapods. We note that close relatives of both plotopterids and penguins forage by plunge diving. Whereas underwater locomotion of diving birds with a swimming ancestor is usually driven by the feet, we hypothesize that plotopterids and other wing-propelled divers are more likely to have had volant ancestors that initiated diving by shallow plunges into the sea. © 2020 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

ABSTRACT: The National Zoological Gardens (NZG) is a facility of the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) and the largest zoo in southern Africa. Among the 9000 captive animals kept by the NZG, is the endangered African penguin (Spheniscus demersus). There have been several post-mortem reports on deaths of penguins in the NZG due to haemosporidian infections, however, the haemosporidian lineages involved and possible insect vector are unknown. Haemosporidians are apicomplexan parasites that infect vertebrates through blood-sucking dipteran insects. Therefore, the current study aimed to identify mosquitoes that are potential vectors found within the African penguin enclosure as well as to detect the haemosporidian parasites from these insects using nested-PCR and real-time PCR (qPCR) analyses. Mosquito samples were collected using an overnight UV-light trap setup for 3 months. From the 65 pooled samples representing 325 mosquitoes, morphological and molecular analysis showed that Culex pipiens (52.31%) was the dominant species followed by Cx. theileri (30.77%) and Cx. quinquefasciatus (16.92%). Nested-PCR detected parasite DNA of Leucocytozoon sp. and Plasmodium sp. The Cx. pipiens had the highest minimum infection rate (MIR) of 5.88% by nested-PCR and 9.41% by qPCR whilst Cx. quinquefasciatus had MIR of 3.64% in both assays and no haemosporidian parasites were detected from Cx. theileri. One Cx. pipiens sample had a co-infection of both Plasmodium sp. and Leucocytozoon sp. detected by nested-PCR. These findings suggest that effective control measures for blood-sucking dipteran insects is required at the NZG and more studies should be conducted to determine the actual prevalence of these haemosporidian parasites among other bird species within NZG. © 2020 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Breeding Adélie penguins forage at sea and return to land to provision their chicks, adjusting their foraging behaviour in response to environmental fluctuations over time. At Béchervaise Island, a nesting site in an East Antarctic population, Adélie penguin diving behaviour remains undocumented. This represents a key area of uncertainty in efforts to understand and predict foraging success at this colony. We compiled a multi-year telemetry dataset from time−depth recorders deployed from 1992 to 2004 on 64 birds at Béchervaise Island. We examined diving activity at multiple scales, ranging from foraging trips (n = 125) to dive bouts (n = 3461) to individual dives (n = 84 521), and then characterised the stage- and sex-specific variation in diving behaviour of chick-rearing Adélie penguins using linear mixed effect models. Total foraging trip effort (trip duration, number of dives, vertical distance travelled and number of wiggles [a proxy for prey ingestion]) substantially increased as the chick-rearing period progressed (guard through crèche), consistent with increasing chick provisioning and self-maintenance requirements over time. Foraging activity was predominantly structured in periods of sustained diving bouts, indicating sustained foraging effort over the course of the foraging trip. Diving behaviour (dive-level depth, duration, bottom time and attempts of catch per unit effort) varied in relation to sex and chick-rearing stage. Dives were performed more frequently during high and low levels of solar light, which is likely linked to visual predation strategies or prey activity. Our findings advance our understanding of this population's foraging behaviour, which is ultimately required to underpin the conservation and management of this breeding colony. © Inter-Research 2020.

ABSTRACT: Variation in the foraging strategies used among species is a key factor in determining the trophic structure of ecological communities. Moreover, foraging niche differentiation could be driven by inter-specific competition and/or variation within species due to seasonal, age, sex and/or individual factors. Using stable isotope analysis, we assessed inter- and intra-specific differences in the foraging niches of female Southern Rockhopper penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome; SRP) and male and female Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus; MP) at Isla de los Estados, Argentina. We sampled whole blood and feathers from breeding adults, representing the breeding and pre-moult periods over two consecutive years (2012 and 2013). We also compared stable isotope values between tissue to test for consistency in individuals foraging niches and the potential for foraging niche specialisation and segregation within breeding pairs. We observed clear foraging niche segregation between species that persisted during both breeding and pre-moult periods. SRP foraged in more oceanic/pelagic waters (lower δ13C values) while MP used coastal/benthic foraging habitats (higher δ13C values). In addition, SRP fed on lower trophic level prey (low δ15N values) relative to MP during both time periods. The isotopic foraging niches of MP highly overlapped between sexes at the population level and there was little to no evidence of niche segregation within breeding pairs or individual consistency in the seasonal foraging niche of both species. The results suggest that inter-specific foraging niche segregation is likely a more important factor influencing the trophic ecology and foraging behaviours of these species, relative to intra-specific factors. Even so, the persistence of inter-specific foraging niche segregation outside the breeding season suggests that either the potential for competition for food resource or foraging habitats remain high during this time or that the ultimate factors responsible for foraging niche segregation among these two species may be unrelated to these proximate factors. © 2020, Deutsche Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.

ABSTRACT: Theoretical models on the movement of colonial animals predict that neighbouring colonies may segregate their foraging areas, and many seabird studies have reported the presence of such segregations. However, these studies have often lacked the appropriate null model to test the effect of neighbouring colonies on foraging areas, especially in small colonies or in short-ranging species. Here, we examined the foraging areas of Adélie Penguins Pygoscelis adeliae from two neighbouring (2 km apart) colonies by using bird-borne GPS loggers. The field study was conducted at Hukuro Cove colony (104 pairs) and Mizukuguri Cove colony (338 pairs) in Lützow-Holm Bay, East Antarctica. We obtained GPS tracks for 504 foraging trips from 48 chick-rearing Adélie Penguins and quantified the degree of overlap in the foraging areas between two colonies. We also produced simulated movement tracks by using correlated random-walks assuming no inter-colony competition and quantified the degree of overlap in the simulated foraging areas. Finally, we compared the results from real GPS tracks with those from simulated tracks to examine the effect of neighbouring colonies on Adélie Penguin movement. The results indicate that the degree of overlap was significantly smaller in real tracks than in simulated tracks. In real tracks, the foraging area of the smaller Hukuro Cove colony extended to the other side of the larger Mizukuguri Cove colony, unlike in simulated tracks. Consequently, we suggest that Adélie Penguins from two neighbouring colonies segregated their foraging areas and that the larger colony appeared to affect the foraging area of the smaller colony. © 2020 British Ornithologists' Union

ABSTRACT: Theory predicts that sympatric predators compete for food under conditions of limited resources. Competition would occur even within the same species, between neighboring popula-tions, because of overlapping foraging habits. Thus, neighboring populations of the same species are hypothesized to face strong competition. To test the hypothesis that intra-specific competition is more intense than inter-specific competition owing to a lack of niche partitioning, we estimated the foraging area and diving depths of two colonial seabird species at two neighboring colonies. Using GPS and time-depth recorders, we tracked foraging space use of sympatric breeding Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins at Ardley Island (AI) and Narębski Point (NP) at King George Is-land, Antarctica. GPS tracks showed that there was a larger overlap in the foraging areas between the two species than within each species. In dive parameters, Gentoo penguins performed deeper and longer dives than Chinstrap penguins at the same colonies. At the colony level, Gentoo penguins from NP undertook deeper and longer dives than those at AI, whereas Chinstrap penguins did not show such intra-specific differences in dives. Stable isotope analysis of δ13C and δ15N isotopes in blood demonstrated both inter- and intra-specific differences. Both species of penguin at AI exhibited higher δ13C and δ15N values than those at NP, and in both locations, Gentoo penguins had higher δ13C and lower δ15N values than Chinstrap penguins. Isotopic niches showed that there were lower inter-specific overlaps than intra-specific overlaps. This suggests that, despite the low intra-specific spatial overlap, diets of conspecifics from different colonies remained more similar, resulting in the higher isotopic niche overlaps. Collectively, our results support the hypothesis that intra-specific competition is higher than inter-specific competition, leading to spatial segregation of the neighboring populations of the same species. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Penguins face a major thermal transition when returning to land in a hypothermic state after a foraging trip. Uninsulated appendages (flippers and feet) could provide flexible heat exchange during subsequent rewarming. Here, we tested the hypothesis that peripheral vasodilation could be delayed during this recovery stage. To this end, we designed an experiment to examine patterns of surface rewarming in fully hypothermic (the cloaca and peripheral regions (here; flippers, feet and the breast) < 37 °C) and partially hypothermic (cloaca at normothermia ≥ 37 °C, but periphery at hypothermia) king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) when they rewarmed in the laboratory. Both groups rewarmed during the 21 min observation period, but the temperature changes were larger in fully than in partially hypothermic birds. Moreover, we observed a 5 min delay of peripheral temperature in fully compared to partially hypothermic birds, suggesting that this process was impacted by low internal temperature. To investigate whether our laboratory data were applicable to field conditions, we also recorded surface temperatures of free-ranging penguins after they came ashore to the colony. Initial surface temperatures were lower in these birds compared to in those that rewarmed in the laboratory, and changed less over a comparable period of time on land. This could be explained both by environmental conditions and possible handling-induced thermogenesis in the laboratory. Nevertheless, this study demonstrated that appendage vasodilation is flexibly used during rewarming and that recovery may be influenced by both internal temperature and environmental conditions when penguins transition from sea to land. © 2020, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Despite the importance of ecotourism in species conservation, little is known about the industry’s effects on wildlife. In South Africa, some African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) colonies have become tourist attractions. The species is globally endangered, with population sizes decreasing over the past 40 years. As African penguin chicks are altricial and unable to move away from anthropogenic stressors, it is important to evaluate the effect of tourist activities on baseline glucocorticoid levels as a measure of potential disturbance. Chicks at three study sites within two breeding colonies (Robben Island, Stony Point), with varying levels of exposure to tourism (low/moderate/high) were monitored. Urofaecal samples were collected to determine urofaecal glucocorticoid metabolite (ufGCM) concentrations as an indication of baseline stress physiology. Morphometric measurements were taken to compare body condition between sites. Penguin chicks experiencing low, infrequent human presence had significantly higher mean (± standard deviation) ufGCM levels [1.34 ± 1.70 μg/g dry weight (DW)] compared to chicks experiencing both medium (0.50 ± 0.40 μg/g DW, P = 0.001) and high levels of human presence (0.57 ± 0.47 μg/g DW, P = 0.003). There was no difference in chick body condition across sites. These results suggest that exposure to frequent human activity may induce habituation/desensitization in African penguin chicks. Acute, infrequent human presence was likely an important driver for comparatively higher ufGCM levels in chicks, though several other environmental stressors may also play an important role in driving adrenocortical activity. Nevertheless, as unhabituated chicks experiencing infrequent anthropogenic presence showed significantly higher ufGCM levels, managers and legislation should attempt to minimize all forms of activity around important breeding colonies that are not already exposed to regular tourism. Although the results of this study are crucial for developing enhanced conservation and management protocols, additional research on the long-term effect of anthropogenic activities on African penguin physiology is required. © The Author(s) 2021.

ABSTRACT: Members of the First German South Polar Expedition (1901–1903) encountered emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) near their wintering station in the sea ice of Posadowsky Bay, East Antarctica. The penguins appeared to be generally less of scientific interest, but more of a useful resource. Despite the presence of chicks, the men were uncertain about the existence of a breeding colony, and did not record the position of the penguin aggregation they encountered. In later years, only a few sightings confirmed the existence of a colony, and the last ground visit took place in 1960. Based on satellite imagery, a colony appears to exist even now. This paper examines what impact the expedition may have had on this colony, and whether it still exists. © The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press.

ABSTRACT: Environmental conditions can strongly influence the growth performance of pearl oysters and affect pearl farm production schedules. Growth and condition index (CI) of two age cohorts of Pteria penguin were measured for 13 months to investigate differences in growth performance between four culture sites within the northern (Vava’u) and southern (Tongatapu) island groups of the Kingdom of Tonga. Environmental conditions were also measured at culture sites and used to explore potential effects on oyster growth and condition. Between island groups, growth performance of P. penguin was superior at northern sites and was most strongly related to higher water temperatures at these sites. Within the southern island group, growth performance varied significantly between sites and may be driven by differences in wave energy. Monthly growth rates (GM) of P. penguin also showed significant temporal variation related to age and environmental conditions. This study demonstrated significant variation in the growth performance of P. penguin at latitudinal and local scales and suggests that in oligotrophic marine environments with minimal terrestrial inputs, such as Tonga, water temperature and wave exposure may be the primary environmental conditions influencing the growth performance of P. penguin. This study therefore recommends that optimal culture sites for P. penguin in Tonga are characterized primarily by warmer water temperatures (25–30°C) and low wave exposure (<15 joules m2 day–1). Culture of P. penguin at sites with more suitable environmental conditions enables pearl production to begin up to 34.2 % (6.5 months) earlier than at less-suitable sites and this may greatly influence mabé pearl farm profitability and feasibility. © Copyright © 2021 Gordon, Wingfield, Smallhorn-West, Malimali, Halafihi, Schoeman and Southgate.

ABSTRACT: In October 2019, an expedition to the subantarctic Bounty Islands provided the opportunity to conduct comprehensive ground counts of erect-crested penguins to assess population size and compare numbers to previous surveys. The entirety of Proclamation Island, an erect-crested penguins’ stronghold, was surveyed and number of active penguin nests was determined via ground counts. Drone surveys aiming at assessing seal numbers, provided high-resolution aerial photography allowing spatial analysis of penguin nest densities on four islands, i.e. Proclamation, Tunnel, Spider, and Ranfurly Islands. A total of 2,867 penguin nests were counted on Proclamation Island between 24 and 29 October. Adjusting for the earlier timing of the survey compared to counts conducted since 1997, nest numbers were only marginally lower (~2.4%) than in 1997 and 2004 suggesting that the penguin population has remained stable for the past 20 years; a ~10% reduction in penguin numbers in 2011 seems to be related to warmer than average ocean temperatures that year. Density analysis from drone imagery showed highly heterogenous distribution of penguin nests, with birds preferring areas sheltered from prevailing south-westerly winds. This also means that a previous estimate from 1978 which relied on uniform extrapolation of nest densities to what was assumed to suitable breeding areas substantially overestimated the true population size, thereby contributing to the species current ‘endangered’ threat ranking. © The Ornithological Society of New Zealand Inc.

ABSTRACT: Avian malaria is a parasitic disease of birds caused by protozoa belonging to the genus Plasmodium, within the order Haemosporida. Penguins are considered particularly susceptible, and outbreaks in captive populations can lead to high mortality. We used a multidisciplinary approach to investigate the death due to avian malaria, occurred between 2015 and 2019, in eight African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) kept in two Italian zoos located in central Italy, and situated about 30 km apart. We also provided information about the presence and circulation of Plasmodium spp. in mosquitoes in central Italy by sampling mosquitoes in both zoos where penguin mortalities occurred. In the eight dead penguins, gross and histopathological lesions were consistent with those previously observed by other authors in avian malaria outbreaks. Organs from dead penguins and mosquitoes collected in both zoos were tested for avian malaria parasites by using a PCR assay targeting the partial mitochondrial conserved region of the cytochrome b gene. Identification at species level was performed by sequencing analysis. Plasmodium matutinum was detected in both dead penguins and in mosquitoes (Culex pipiens), while Plasmodium vaughani in Culex pipiens only. Parasites were not found in any of the PCR tested Aedes albopictus samples. Based on our phylogenetic analysis, we detected three previously characterized lineages: Plasmodium matutinum LINN1 and AFTRU5, P. vaughani SYAT05. In Culex pipiens we also identified two novel lineages, CXPIP32 (inferred morphospecies Plasmodium matutinum) and CXPIP33 (inferred morphospecies P. vaughani). Significantly, LINN1 and AFTRU5 were found to be associated to penguin deaths, although only LINN1 was detected both in penguins (along the years of the study) and in Culex pipiens, while AFTRU5 was detected in a single penguin dead in 2017. In conclusion, in our study Plasmodium matutinum was found to cause avian malaria in captive penguins kept in Europe, with Culex pipiens being its most probable vector. Our results are in agreement with previous studies suggesting that Culex pipiens is one of the main vectors of Plasmodium spp. in Europe and the Northern Hemisphere. Zoos maintaining captive penguins in temperate areas where Culex pipiens is abundant should be well aware of the risks of avian malaria, and should put every effort to prevent outbreaks, in particular during the periods when the number of vectors is higher. © Copyright © 2021 Iurescia, Romiti, Cocumelli, Diaconu, Stravino, Onorati, Alba, Friedrich, Maggi, Magliano, Ermenegildi, Carfora, Caprioli, De Liberato and Battisti.

ABSTRACT: Data regarding helminth communities can provide insights into health, feeding interactions, behaviour and evolution of their host organisms. Penguins (Spheniscidae) are important components of marine food webs and tracking their helminth communities can be indicative of ecosystem health. New Zealand is home to 5 of the world's 19 penguin species and little is known about their gastrointestinal helminths. Here, we provide the first study on the gastrointestinal helminths of little blue penguins from south-eastern South Island, New Zealand. The helminth community consisted of two species of tapeworm; Tetrabothrius lutzi and Tetrabothrius sp.; three nematode species, Contracaecum eudyptulae, Capillaria sp. and Stegophorus macronectes; two acanthocephalans, Andracantha sigma and Bolbosoma balaenae; and one trematode, Galactosomum otepotiense. The most prevalent parasites were T. lutzi, A. sigma, and C. eudyptulae. This work includes three new host records and five new geographic records. This is the first report of B. balaenae occurring in a host other than a marine mammal. This study adds to our knowledge about the helminth community of New Zealand little blue penguins, and includes new genetic data on helminth species, providing a baseline against which future studies may be compared. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Though climate change is widely known to negatively affect the distribution and abundance of many species, few studies have focused on species that may benefit. Gentoo Penguin (Pygoscelis papua) populations have grown along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), a region accounting for ~ 30% of their global population. These trends of population growth in Gentoo Penguins are in stark contrast to those of Adélie and Chinstrap Penguins, which have experienced considerable population declines along the WAP attributed to environmental changes. The recent discovery of previously unknown Gentoo Penguin colonies along the WAP and evidence for southern range expansion since the last global assessment in 2013 motivates this review of the abundance and distribution of this species. We compiled and collated all available recent data for every known Gentoo Penguin colony in the world and report on previously unknown Gentoo Penguin colonies along the Northwestern section of the WAP. We estimate the global population of Gentoo Penguins to be 432,144 (95th CI 338,059 – 534,114) breeding pairs, with approximately 364,359 (95th CI 324,052 – 405,132) breeding pairs (85% of the population) living in the Atlantic sector. Our estimates suggest that the global population has increased by approximately 11% since 2013, with even greater increases (23%) along the WAP. The Falkland Islands population, which comprises 30% of the global population, has remained stable, though only a subset of colonies have been surveyed since the last comprehensive survey in 2010. Our assessment identifies South Georgia and sub-Antarctic islands in the Indian Ocean as being the most critical data gaps for this species. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Foraging behaviour is crucial to breeding success for marine predators, including seabirds. Yellow-eyed penguins Megadyptes antipodes are central-place, predominantly benthic foragers around mainland New Zealand. The northern (mainland) population of this Endangered species is declining, with changes in the marine environment a suspected cause, particularly warming water and poorer foraging success. We undertook a detailed foraging study of the datadeficient subantarctic population, which is distinct from the northern population. Over 2 breeding seasons, we collected 91 GPS foraging logs from 69 breeding yellow-eyed penguins from Enderby Island, Auckland Islands, New Zealand. The mean foraging distance was 24 km from shore (max 47 km). Foraging area size was greater for females and for pelagic foragers, although benthic foragers travelled further from shore on average. Diving plasticity was evident both in diving behaviour and foraging area use. Foraging area and distance from shore were greater for all birds in a year of greater breeding effort and fledging success (2016). Foraging occurred over continental shelf waters, similar to the mainland, and in areas up to 150 m deep, so any differences in foraging behaviour compared to those reported for the northern population are likely influenced by local bathymetry, environmental conditions, and individual preference. Despite comparable bathymetry in some areas, the southern population showed greater foraging plasticity, with 62% of foraging trips categorised as pelagic, implying that subantarctic foraging conditions may differ from the predominantly benthic mainland foraging. Variable foraging conditions may therefore have implications for future breeding success in the subantarctic. © 2021 Inter-Research. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: As bio-indicators, seabirds across the globe help us understand how our environment is changing, and how this is affecting our wildlife. Little Penguins (Eudyptula minor) in Australia are a key species in understanding the changes to the Australian environment. However, studies generally focus on the effects of oceanic changes without always accounting for the potential interactions with the environmental conditions experienced on land during breeding. This study examined the relationships between both marine and terrestrial environmental variables and breeding success in South Australian Little Penguins, observing 10 colonies over a nonconsecutive 28-yr time period. Our results showed that South Australian Little Penguins had a lower breeding success (fewer fledglings produced per pair) when sea surface temperatures were higher in the 3 mo before breeding and when high winds occurred during the breeding season. We also observed local variation between the colonies: breeding success was only influenced by environmental variables for colonies located near open waters and not for colonies located in enclosed bays. These results confirm the idea that future oceanographic warming is expected to reduce the breeding success (and population size) of some Australian seabirds, including Little Penguins. ©  Copyright © American Ornithological Society 2021.

ABSTRACT: Context: Wildlife tourism is expanding and can detrimentally affect taxa such as penguins, if not managed carefully. The yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes) is an endangered species, with mainland populations projected to decline to extinction in the next 40 years, despite conservation interventions. Their nesting sites are exposed to increasing numbers of human visitors, which contributes to reduced reproductive success. Aims: We evaluated the effectiveness of a breeding colony (Boulder Beach) closure to the public, which was implemented to reduce visitor disturbance. Methods: We compared reproductive success 5 years before and 5 years during the closure with success at an adjacent site (Sandfly Bay) that experiences high human disturbance, over the same time periods. Key results: Beach closure did not result in an increase in chick mass or survival at Boulder Beach; however, trends at adjacent Sandfly Bay suggested that, without the closure, chick survival at Boulder Beach would likely have declined. Chick survival decreased at Sandfly Bay across the two 5-year periods, whereas chick survival at Boulder Beach did not decline, but remained constant during the closure years. Conclusions: The beach closure was beneficial because it appeared to buffer environmental factors, so that mean chick survival remained constant rather than declining. Implications: Beach closures might be difficult to implement because of public expectations regarding free access to coastal land in New Zealand, but they should be considered at sites where increasing numbers of visitors are likely to have detrimental impacts on wildlife. Without urgent action, these culturally important animals will likely be extinct on mainland New Zealand within the next few decades. Beach closures may represent an effective management measure to increase population resilience by decreasing the detrimental impacts of visitors on breeding success. © 2020 CSIRO.

ABSTRACT: Seabird feathers are effective indicators of heavy metal contamination. To propose a biological detection method suitable for the long-term monitoring of heavy metals in the Antarctic environment, eight heavy metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn) in Adélie penguin feathers from different body parts, years, and molting grounds in the Antarctic were investigated in this study. It is found that the concentrations of heavy metals in the feathers showed differences among the body part of origin. The levels of the eight elements in the abdomen and back feathers were approximately the same, but some elements of them were significantly higher than those in the tail feathers. The Hg and Cd concentrations in the abdomen and back feathers increased from root to tip, regardless of the sampling year or molting ground. Based on a structural analysis of the feathers, Hg and Cd were mainly distributed in the feather vane rather than the shaft. The methylmercury content accounted for 83%–97% of the total mercury content in all feather samples, regardless of location, year, or body part, thereby supporting the assumption that mercury entering the feather was predominantly methylated and indicating that a relatively toxic form of Hg is excreted through the feathers. The heavy metals in feathers from the same molting ground showed significant differences over the sampling years. The average concentrations of As, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Zn increased significantly from 2015 to 2019, whereas those of Cd, Hg, and Pb tended to decrease. The concentrations of the eight elements in Adélie feathers from three molting grounds varied greatly, possibly in relation to their living areas and dietary structures. Feathers from the Ross Sea site had the highest Cd, Cu, Hg, Ni, and Zn concentrations, the highest As and Cr concentrations were detected in feathers from the Zhongshan site, and feathers from the Great Wall site showed higher Pb concentrations than those from the other two sites. This study established a long-term, nondestructive, and efficient method for monitoring heavy metal contamination in the polar environment in the future. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: This paper describes an assessment of the Impact of weather changes and human visitation on behavior and activity level of Humboldt penguin (Spheniscus humboldti) in captivity. The study is based on activity time-budgets from a flock of over 20 birds at Fota Wildlife Park, Cork, Ireland, gathered during daytime observations over a six month period. The results show that penguins spent most of the daytime in stationary, terrestrial locomotion, preening and swimming modes of behavior, and swimming activity increased on rainy days. Peak activity took place from 16:00 to 17:00 hours, especially before and after feeding. The behavior of penguins was significantly affected by the number of visitors, and locomotion, preening, feeding and attention to visitors were positively correlated with the number of visitors. There is further interaction with visitation levels under different weather conditions. Visitors offer another positive environmental enrichment for this group of penguins and in turn, these penguins at Fota Wildlife Park are considered to have a high educational potential. Some suggestions about captive management and future research are also proposed. Copyright © 2021 Zoological Society of Pakistan

ABSTRACT: The Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) is the most abundant penguin species in Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic islands due to its generalist foraging ecology. Previous studies indicate that the broad diet in Gentoo penguins mainly result from sexual niche segregation caused by its foraging ecology. However, differences in food metabolism and absorption between Gentoo penguins of different genders have been ignored. Gut microbiota of animals plays a vital role in the digestion, absorption, and metabolism of nutrients from diets. Here, captive Gentoo penguins were used to reveal the sexual niche segregation of gut microbiota. The results showed that both the composition and function of gut microbiota composition between male and female Gentoo penguins were significantly distinct. Moreover, a higher degree of individual differences in gut microbiota were found in female Gentoo penguins than in males and a greater impact of sexual maturity on gut microbiota was also observed in females. The family of Lachnospiraceae and C5-branched dibasic acid metabolism were more abundant in the gut microbiota of male Gentoo penguins, indicating a higher carbohydrate metabolic capacity in males. In contrast, Fusobacteriaceae and the d-alanine pathway were enriched in females, suggesting that female Gentoo penguins have a greater capacity to metabolize proteins. Because the captive Gentoo penguins were living in the same environment and feeding on consistent diets, the gender-related differences in gut microbiota observed in the present study could be a genetic characteristic of this species. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Ornithogenic soils in Antarctica provide a biological archive of the occupation history and trophic ecology of penguins and other marine species over geological timescales. Hard prey remains and predator tissues, which are well preserved in ornithogenic soils, can act as paleoecological proxies of past environmental conditions. Here we examine ornithogenic soils from an active colony of Pygoscelis spp. penguins on Platter Island in the Danger Islands Archipelago along the northeastern side of the Antarctic Peninsula. We radiocarbon dated penguin tissues from excavated ornithogenic soils and parameterized an age-depth model of penguin occupation history. Hard prey remains were enumerated and recovered Pygoscelis spp. penguin and Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) tissues were analyzed for stable isotopes carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) analysis. The oldest recovered ornithogenic soils at Platter Island date to 502–653 years BP and coincide with the start of a period of increased warming and glacial discharge in the northeastern Antarctic Peninsula. Penguin tissues δ15N values increased between the oldest and youngest dated ornithogenic soils but seal tissues did not. This may indicate that the trophic level of penguins, but not seals, has increased over time, a hypothesis supported by the concurrent increase in the hard prey remains of fish and squid taxa common to penguin diets recovered from ornithogenic soils. Future studies of ornithogenic soils in the Danger Islands Archipelago are warranted to test this hypothesis and assess the potential confounding effects of varying ecosystem isotopic baselines and penguin species composition over time. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Primaquine is an 8-aminoquinolone drug commonly used for the chemoprophylaxis and treatment of avian malarial infections in managed penguin populations worldwide. Little is known about its pharmacokinetic properties in avian species. The objective of this study was to describe the disposition of primaquine phosphate after a single oral dose in 15 healthy African penguins (Spheniscus demersus). A single tablet containing 26.3 mg of primaquine phosphate (equivalent to 15 mg primaquine base) was administered orally to each bird in a herring fish. Blood samples were collected prior to drug administration and at predetermined timepoints through 144 hr postadministration. Plasma was analyzed for drug concentration by high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. Mean maximum plasma concentration of primaquine phosphate was 277 96 ng/ml at approximately 3.1 hr following oral administration. The mean disappearance half-life was 3.6 1.6 hr. Plasma concentrations were below detectable limits in all but one penguin by 36 hr. A single oral administration of 26.3 mg of primaquine phosphate in African penguins resulted in a pharmacokinetic profile comparable to those attained in human studies. These results suggest that a dosing interval similar to human regimens may be of potential use in the prevention and treatment of avian malaria in penguins. Additional clinical studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of this regimen.  © Copyright 2021 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Adenoviruses are medium size non-enveloped viruses with a trend of coevolution with their hosts. We surveyed South American fur seals (Arctocephalus australis) and Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) for adenoviruses at two sites from 2009 to 2012. Despite the common pattern of host specificity, some of the adenovi-ruses in our study were present in samples from unexpected host species. We identified mastade-noviruses, aviadenoviruses, and siadenoviruses in A. australis from Peru and Chile and in S. humboldti from Peru. The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) significantly reduces the productivity of the Humboldt upwelling system, which can change trophic and other ecological interactions, facilitating exposure to new patho-gens. One aviadenovirus was detected in both the penguins and the fur seals, an interclass distance. This finding occurred only during the 2009 ENSO and not in 2010 or 2012. Further studies of viral diversity in sites with high-density mixed species populations are necessary to better understand viral evolution and the effect of environmental change on viral evolution and host specificity. © Wildlife Disease Association 2021.

ABSTRACT: Seabirds are suitable biomonitors for several persistent organic pollutants (POP), such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), although scarce studies of PAHs in seabirds are available, especially in South American populations. Therefore, this study aimed to assess OCPs, PCBs and PAHs, through gas chromatography-electron capture detector (GC-ECD) and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analyses, in liver (n = 9) and muscle tissue (n = 13) from juvenile Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) found stranded on the coast of Rio de Janeiro, Southeastern Brazil. DDT-related compounds were the most frequently detected OCP, and 4,4′-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), the main DDT metabolite found in penguin tissues. OCP concentrations in liver were two-fold higher than in muscle tissues. Compound specific ratios identified recent exposure of penguins to some OCPs as well as evidence of legacy pollution associated with industrial sources. The predominant PCB congeners were PCB 8/5, PCB 138/160 and PCB 153/132, with concentrations ranging from <LOQ and 1500 ng g−1 dry weight. This study comprises one of the few PAHs reports in penguin tissues, and, although most compounds were detected at very low levels or below the limit of quantitation (LOQ), the concentrations reported herein were up to 100-fold higher than in previous studies in penguins. Therefore, considering penguin vulnerability to marine oil spills during migration routes, further assessments are required in different tissues in order to assess potential environmental health risks to these sentinel species. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: At fledging, king penguin juveniles undergo a major energetic challenge to overcome the intense and prolonged energy demands for thermoregulation and locomotion imposed by life in cold seas. Among other responses, sea acclimatization triggers fuel selection in skeletal muscle metabolism towards lipid oxidation in vitro, which is reflected by a drastic increase in lipid-induced thermogenesis in vivo. However, the exact nature of skeletal muscle thermogenic mechanisms (shivering and/or non-shivering thermogenesis) remains undefined. The aim of the present study was to determine in vivo whether the capacity for non-shivering thermogenesis was enhanced by sea acclimatization. We measured body temperature, metabolic rate, heart rate and shivering activity in fully immersed king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) exposed to water temperatures ranging from 12 to 29°C. Results from terrestrial pre-fledging juveniles were compared with those from sea-acclimatized immature penguins (hereafter 'immatures'). The capacity for thermogenesis in water was as effective in juveniles as in immatures, while the capacity for nonshivering thermogenesis was not reinforced by sea acclimatization. This result suggests that king penguins mainly rely on skeletal muscle contraction (shivering or locomotor activity) to maintain endothermy at sea. Sea-acclimatized immature penguins also exhibited higher shivering efficiency and oxygen pulse (amount of oxygen consumed or energy expended per heartbeat) than pre-fledging juvenile birds. Such increase in shivering and cardiovascular efficiency may favor a more efficient activity-thermoregulatory heat substitution providing penguins with the aptitude to survive the tremendous energetic challenge imposed by marine life in cold circumpolar oceans. © 2020.

ABSTRACT: It is currently unknown if current guidelines for collecting and interpreting blood corticosterone in flying birds can be extrapolated to penguins. It is also difficult to collect blood quickly without causing stress to a penguin. Therefore, immunoreactive fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGCMs) may be the most practical and minimally invasive way of monitoring the stress levels of penguins. This study investigated the reliability of FGCMs for monitoring stress levels in captive Humboldt Penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) at Jurong Bird Park, Singapore. Humboldt Penguin feces were randomly sampled and pooled from the exhibit for 2 months. The penguins were restrained and transported on three separate occasions to simulate stressful events. The feces were analyzed using an enzyme immunoassay to measure corticosterone levels. There were significant increases lasting 3 to 7 days in the FGCM levels after a stressful event. This method was then used to test whether accelerometer vests used for behavior quantification caused stress responses in these birds. There was no significant difference in FGCMs between time periods with and without the accelerometer vests. The results indicated that FGCMs can be an accurate indication of capture-, restraint-, and transport-related stress in Humboldt Penguins, and that accelerometer vests do not appear to cause stress. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Interspecific feeding refers to behavior where an adult of one species feeds the young of another species, with the exclusion of brood parasitism. In birds, most of observed cases concern passerines and this behavior has so far never been described among seabirds. We report on interspecific feeding provided by an adult gentoo penguin Pygoscelis papua to an Adélie penguin P. adeliae chick on the Antarctic Peninsula. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The Magellanic Penguin Spheniscus magellanicus is one of the main seabird predators in the western South Atlantic. This species presents an opportunist feeding behaviour and its diet, as well as its parasite fauna, varies geographically depending on available prey and intermediate hosts. Despite thousands of Magellanic Penguins being found dead every year in southern Brazil, little attention has been given to their parasite–host interactions in this area. In this context, the aim of the present study was to assess the relationship between Magellanic Penguin diets and gastrointestinal helminth fauna at different age classes and body conditions in southern Brazil. To this end, the gastrointestinal tracts of 63 Magellanic Penguins found dead in 2013 and 2014 were examined. All individuals were parasitized by at least one species and only one penguin did not contain any food remains. A total of 138,209 helminths comprising eight species were found. Moreover, 12 prey species were recorded, including six fish and six cephalopod taxa. The helminth component community composition of juvenile penguins was similar to that of adults but the structure differed according to penguin age class. Cephalopod and crustacean prey species were significantly more frequent in juveniles compared to adults. Adults preyed mainly upon fishes. It was evident that lean individuals, both juveniles and adults, are more intensely infected in southern Brazil. Therefore, the high abundance of helminth parasites and the consumption of less energy-efficient prey cannot be ruled out as contributory factors to the high mortality of this species, mainly lean juveniles, in this area. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: There is growing interest in uncovering the viral diversity present in wild animal species. The remote Antarctic region is home to a wealth of uncovered microbial diversity, some of which is associated with its megafauna, including penguin species, the dominant avian biota. Penguins interface with a number of other biota in their roles as marine mesopredators and several species overlap in their ranges and habitats. To characterize the circular single-stranded viruses related to those in the phylum Cressdnaviricota from these environmental sentinel species, cloacal swabs (n = 95) were obtained from King Penguins in South Georgia, and congeneric Adélie Penguins, Chinstrap Penguins, and Gentoo Penguins across the South Shetland Islands and Antarctic Peninsula. Using a combination of high-throughput sequencing, abutting primers-based PCR recovery of circular genomic elements, cloning, and Sanger sequencing, we detected 97 novel sequences comprising 40 ssDNA viral genomes and 57 viral-like circular molecules from 45 individual penguins. We present their detection patterns, with Chinstrap Penguins harboring the highest number of new sequences. The novel Antarctic viruses identified appear to be host-specific, while one circular molecule was shared between sympatric Chinstrap and Gentoo Penguins. We also report viral genotype sharing between three adult-chick pairs, one in each Pygoscelid species. Sequence similarity network approaches coupled with Maximum likelihood phylogenies of the clusters indicate the 40 novel viral genomes do not fall within any known viral families and likely fall within the recently established phylum Cressdnaviricota based on their replication-associated protein sequences. Similarly, 83 capsid protein sequences encoded by the viruses or viral-like circular molecules identified in this study do not cluster with any of those encoded by classified viral groups. Further research is warranted to expand knowledge of the Antarctic virome and would help elucidate the importance of viral-like molecules in vertebrate host evolution. © 2020 MDPI AG.

ABSTRACT: Penguins in Antarctica occupy high trophic levels, thus accumulating high amounts of mercury (Hg) through bioaccumulation and biomagnification. Blood reflects the current levels of contaminants circulating in the body, while feathers are known as the main route of Hg elimination in birds. Studies sampling chicks and adults can provide a comprehensive picture of bioaccumulation and local contamination. Three pygoscelid species (Pygoscelis adeliae, Pygoscelis antarcticus and Pygoscelis papua) have circumpolar distributions being the ideal sentinels of Antarctic environmental pollution. This study aimed to assess Hg contamination of the pristine Antarctic region using non-destructive penguin samples. Fieldwork was carried out during the austral summer of 2013/2014 in the South Shetland Islands, off the north-west Antarctic Peninsula. Concentrations of total Hg (ng.g−1 dw) in blood ranged from 39 to 182 in chicks and 45 to 581 in adults, while concentrations in feathers ranged from 73 to 598 in chicks and 156 to 1648 in adults. Most Hg in feathers (about 70%) is accumulated in the form of methylmercury. Differences were demonstrated in mercury bioaccumulation were related to species and age, but not to sex. To our knowledge this is the first study to report MeHg levels in both juvenile and adult pygoscelid penguins. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Monitoring Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) populations on the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) provides information about the health of the species and the WAP marine ecosystem itself. In January 2017, surveys of Adélie penguin colonies at Avian Island and Torgersen Island off the WAP were conducted via unoccupied aircraft systems (UAS) collecting optical Red Green Blue (RGB), thermal, and multispectral imagery. A semi-automated workflow to count individual penguins using a fusion of multispectral and thermal imagery was developed and combined into an ArcGIS workflow. This workflow isolates colonies using multispectral imagery and detects and counts individuals by thermal signatures. Two analysts conducted manual counts from synoptic RGB UAS imagery. The automated system deviated from analyst counts by −3.96% on Avian Island and by 17.83% on Torgersen Island. However, colony-by-colony comparisons revealed that the greatest deviations occurred at larger colonies. Matched pairs analysis revealed no significant differences between automated and manual counts at both locations (p > 0.31) and linear regressions of colony sizes from both methods revealed significant positive relationships approaching unity (p < 0.0002. R2 = 0.91). These results indicate that combining UAS surveys with sensor fusion techniques and semi-automated workflows provide efficient and accurate methods for monitoring seabird colonies in remote environments. © 2020 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Environmental variability drives Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) population dynamics through its effects on vital rates (e.g., survival, dispersal, or breeding success) resulted in penguin abundance changes with time delays. The lagged effects of environmental changes on penguin abundance are still not well defined. We divided the Ross Sea region into six areas to investigate the effects of environmental changes on penguin abundance from 1982 to 2013. Time lagged analysis of 1–6 years between penguin abundance and environmental factors were conducted in our study. We found that penguin abundance was significantly correlated with environmental factors at different lag times (p < 0.05). The relationship between penguin abundance and environmental factors might differ among regions. Generalized additive model results showed that sea surface temperature negatively affected penguin abundance in most regions of the Ross Sea. In mid-Victoria Land, the relationship between sea-ice concentration and penguin abundance was quadratic. Penguin abundance peaked when sea-ice concentration was approximately 40%. Optimal ranges of environmental factors for Adélie penguin population might exist. Our study highlighted the lagged response of penguin abundance to environmental factors to further understand the effects of climate changes on the Antarctic biosphere. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: New Zealand is a globally significant hotspot for seabird diversity, but the sparse fossil record for most seabird lineages has impeded our understanding of how and when this hotspot developed. Here, we describe multiple exceptionally well-preserved specimens of a new species of penguin from tightly dated (3.36-3.06 Ma) Pliocene deposits in New Zealand. Bayesian and parsimony analyses place Eudyptes atatu sp. nov. as the sister species to all extant and recently extinct members of the crested penguin genus Eudyptes. The new species has a markedly more slender upper beak and mandible compared with other Eudyptes penguins. Our combined evidence approach reveals that deep bills evolved in both crested and stiff-tailed penguins (Pygoscelis) during the Pliocene. That deep bills arose so late in the greater than 60 million year evolutionary history of penguins suggests that dietary shifts may have occurred as wind-driven Pliocene upwelling radically restructured southern ocean ecosystems. Ancestral area reconstructions using BioGeoBEARS identify New Zealand as the most likely ancestral area for total-group penguins, crown penguins and crested penguins. Our analyses provide a timeframe for recruitment of crown penguins into the New Zealand avifauna, indicating this process began in the late Neogene and was completed via multiple waves of colonizing lineages.  © 2020 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Several standard descriptions of the avian male and female reproductive tract have been reported, including effects of age, stage of reproductive maturity and gonadal hormone concentrations. Limited information on penguin reproductive biology and a lack of information on the African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) necessitated a detailed description of salient structural features of this species and provided an opportunity to evaluate seasonal changes in gonadal steroid hormone concentrations. Tissues from 36 males (adults and juveniles) and 29 females (adults and juveniles) were used for macro-anatomical descriptions and histology of the testes and ovaries. In addition, concentrations of gonadal steroid hormones for eight captive African penguins (four females and four males) were quantified during two breeding and one non-breeding season. The testes were asymmetrical, with the right testis having smaller dimensions compared to the left testis. Marked spermatogenic cellular associations and spermatid developmental stages were present in adult testes only during the breeding season. There was variation in the dimensions of the single ovary during follicular development related to the age and breeding status of the females. Testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and estradiol concentrations fluctuated during the breeding and non-breeding periods, with males and females having similar steroid concentrations. The results from this study confirm that the breeding status in African penguins can be deduced based on testicular and ovarian histological structures. The results from the present study focused on African penguin reproductive biology should be considered in management strategies for the conservation of the species. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Fifty-eight frozen postmortem lung and air sac samples were collected from penguins housed at 21 zoological collections throughout the United Kingdom, from 2007 to 2018. Aspergillus fumigatus, a significant respiratory pathogen of penguins in captivity, was isolated from 15 of the 22 penguins with gross lesions. Of the penguins with gross lesions of aspergillosis at postmortem examination, the pathogen was cultured from 63.6% (15 of 22) of frozen samples. Aspergillus fumigatus was cultured from 2.7% (1 of 36) of tissues collected from penguins without gross lesions at postmortem. Additionally, of 18 fresh samples that cultured A. fumigatus at the time of postmortem, 15 samples (83%) yielded isolates that were successfully cultured from frozen tissue. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) data demonstrated that all isolates were susceptible to terbinafine and voriconazole, and all were resistant to itraconazole, using published MIC cutoff values. Comparison isolates from fresh tissues had identical antimicrobial susceptibility to isolates from the same tissues after being frozen. This study demonstrates that A. fumigatus can be isolated from frozen respiratory tissues of penguins, even after freezing for more than 10 yr. © Copyright 2020 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Cryptosporidium spp. are parasitic intracellular protozoa that infect the digestive, respiratory, and urinary tracts of vertebrates. The disease affects many different avian species across all continents, and >25 species and genotypes of Cryptosporidium have been documented infecting birds. We report on an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in African penguin Spheniscus demersus chicks admitted to a rehabilitation center in South Africa from February 2012 to October 2013. Eighteen cases were confirmed through histopathology. The most frequent clinical signs were regurgitation (78%), dyspnea (72%), decreased weight gain or weight loss (72%), and lethargy (50%). Clinical signs began 8.46 d after hatching or admission (median: 13 d), and death followed 1.41 d after the onset of clinical signs (median: 13.5 d). The most frequent necropsy findings were stomach distended with undigested food or gas (78%), mildly reddened lungs (56%), spleen petechial hemorrhage (44%), and kidney congestion (39%). The most frequent histopathological findings were necrotic bursitis (89%), necrotic enteritis (83%), and bursal atrophy (67%). Small round or oval basophilic bodies (3.5 μm diameter) consistent with Cryptosporidium sp. were closely associated with the surface of the epithelial cells or in the lumen of the bursa (89%), large intestine (61%), small intestine (44%), trachea (22%), and ventriculus (6%). Transmission electron microscopy of 1 case confirmed that these organisms were Cryptosporidium sp. To our knowledge, this is the first report of cryptosporidiosis in penguins, raising concern of the potential implications for the conservation of these species.  © 2020 Inter-Research.

ABSTRACT: Populations of the macaroni penguin Eudyptes chrysolophus and the eastern rockhopper penguin E. filholi breeding at Marion Island (Prince Edward Islands) in the sub-Antarctic Indian Ocean decreased from 1994 to 2018. We examined their diets when rearing chicks during this period. There was substantial overlap in the diets of the two species, with crustaceans, dominated by the euphausiids Thysanoessa vicina and Euphausia vallentini, making up >80% of the diets by number and >60% by mass over the study period. The lanternfishes Krefftichthys anderssoni and Protomyctophum tenisoni were the most-commonly consumed fish in the diet of breeding macaroni penguins and dominated in their diet in three of the 25 years (1994, 1998 and 2014); they were also the most commonly consumed fish by eastern rockhopper penguins. Macaroni penguins consumed more of the amphipod crustacean Themisto gaudichaudii and the lanternfish Electrona carlsbergi as well as a greater diversity of and larger-sized fish than did eastern rockhopper penguins. The horsefish Zanclorhynchus spinifer was found in substantial amounts in the diet of eastern rockhopper penguins in 1996 and 1997. Despite annual variations in relative prey contributions to the diets, there were no significant long-term changes in the diet of either penguin species over the study period or when compared with an earlier assessment in 1982. We conclude that changes in the relative proportions of prey in the diets of these penguin species during breeding are unlikely to account for the recent declines in these penguin populations. © 2021 NISC (Pty) Ltd.

ABSTRACT: A 21-year-old male southern rockhopper penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome) was presented with a chronic history of intermittently decreased appetite, lethargy, and regurgitation. On the external physical examination, the bird was determined to be in fair-to-thin body condition with the complete blood count and plasma chemistry panel being largely unremarkable. Full-body radiographic images were considered normal, and gastroscopy showed only mild gastritis and duodenitis. The penguin was euthanatized shortly thereafter due to acute onset of respiratory distress. During the gross necropsy examination, the bird had severe airsacculitis with thick, yellow-to-tan, moist granular plaques adhering to the surface of many air sacs, as well as regional contiguous pneumonia. Intralesional acid-fast bacilli were observed in histologic sections of air sac tissue, and polymerase chain reaction of the affected air sacs was positive for Mycobacterium fortuitum. This clinical case study describes mycobacteriosis in a sub-Antarctic penguin and to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first reported isolation of M fortuitum from a penguin.  ©

ABSTRACT: Age is known to affect the gut microbiota in various animals; however, this relationship is poorly understood in seabirds. We investigated the temporal succession of gut microbiota in captive chinstrap penguins of different ages using high-throughput sequencing. The gut microbiota exhibited a significant age succession pattern, reaching maturity in adults and then declining with increasing age. Only 15 amplicon sequence variants were shared among the gut microbiota in chinstrap penguins at all studied ages, and these contributed to most of the age-related variations in total gut microbiota. Co-occurrence networks found that these key bacteria belonged to the genera Acinetobacter, Clostridium sensu stricto, and Fusobacterium, and more species interactions were found within the same taxonomy. Functional prediction indicated that most of the metabolic functions were more abundant in the gut microbiota in adult chinstrap penguins, except for carbohydrate metabolism, which was significantly more abundant in older individuals. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Synopsis Despite longstanding interest in convergent evolution, factors that result in deviations from fully convergent phenotypes remain poorly understood. In birds, the evolution of flightless wing-propelled diving has emerged as a classic example of convergence, having arisen in disparate lineages including penguins (Sphenisciformes) and auks (Pan-Alcidae, Charadriiformes). Nevertheless, little is known about the functional anatomy of the wings of flightless auks because all such taxa are extinct, and their morphology is almost exclusively represented by skeletal remains. Here, in order to re-evaluate the extent of evolutionary convergence among flightless wing-propelled divers, wing muscles and ligaments were reconstructed in two extinct flightless auks, representing independent transitions to flightlessness: Pinguinus impennis (a crowngroup alcid), and Mancalla (a stem-group alcid). Extensive anatomical data were gathered from dissections of 12 species of extant charadriiforms and 4 aequornithine waterbirds including a penguin. The results suggest that the wings of both flightless auk taxa were characterized by an increased mechanical advantage of wing elevator/ retractor muscles, and decreased mobility of distal wing joints, both of which are likely advantageous for wingpropelled diving and parallel similar functional specializations in penguins. However, the conformations of individual muscles and ligaments underlying these specializations differ markedly between penguins and flightless auks, instead resembling those in each respective group's close relatives. Thus, the wings of these flightless wingpropelled divers can be described as convergent as overall functional units, but are incompletely convergent at lower levels of anatomical organization-a result of retaining differing conditions from each group's respective volant ancestors. Detailed investigations such as this one may indicate that, even in the face of similar functional demands, courses of phenotypic evolution are dictated to an important degree by ancestral starting points. © 2020 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2020.

ABSTRACT: The Gentoo Penguins Pygoscelis papua has been classified into two subspecies, Northern P. papua papua and Southern P. papua ellsworthi. In Japan, where a breeding program exists for Gentoo Penguins, the Japanese Association of Zoos and Aquariums (JAZA) has recognized three categories of species in its pedigree ledger: Northern (from the islands of South Georgia), Southern (from the South Shetland Islands), and Unknown (when their origins are not clear). Phylogenetic analyses of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) D-loop region of Gentoo Penguins in their natural habitat have differentiated them as belonging to the Kerguelen Islands (Indian Ocean), Falkland Islands (Atlantic Ocean), and South Georgia (Atlantic Ocean), and categorized some as Northern and others as Southern subspecies. However, the identification of a third subspecies has been suggested. Therefore, reclassification of captive Gentoo Penguins using phylogenetic analysis is necessary for domestic subspecies pedigree management. In this study, we determined five mtDNA haplotype sequences using seven Gentoo Penguins (considered morphologically as three Northern, three Southern, and one Unknown) and characterized their phylogenetic relationships among subspecies and among geographical distributions including 56 published mtDNA sequences. The phylogenetic tree showed three major lineages, Kerguelen Islands, Falkland Islands, and Scotia Arc/Antartica. The five haplotype sequences of the seven captive Gentoo Penguins were classified unexpectedly to one lineage, the Scotia Arc/Antartica, which contains the nucleotide sequences derived from Southern P. papua ellsworthi. Therefore, the mtDNA phylogeny of the seven captive penguins suggests that all captive Gentoo Penguins in Japan belong to the Southern subspecies. If so, then more comprehensive genetic testing of Gentoo Penguins in Japanese aquariums and zoos is required for the management of successful breeding programs. © 2021 The Ornithological Society of Japan.

ABSTRACT: While globally distributed throughout the world's ecosystems, there is little baseline information on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in marine environments in Australia and, more broadly, the Southern Hemisphere. To fill this knowledge gap, we collected baseline information on POPs in migratory short-tailed shearwaters (Ardenna tenuirostris) from Fisher Island, Tasmania, and resident little penguins (Eudyptula minor) from Phillip Island, Victoria. Levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs) were determined from blood samples, with total contamination ranging 7.6-47.7 ng/g ww for short-tailed shearwaters and 0.12-46.9 ng/g ww for little penguins. In both species contamination followed the same pattern where PCBs>OCPs>BFRs. BFR levels included the presence of the novel flame retardant hexabromobenzene (HBB). These novel results of POPs in seabirds in southeast Australia provide important information on the local (penguins) and global (shearwaters) distribution of POPs in the marine environment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Terrestrial and aquatic birds have been proposed as sentinels for the spread of antimicrobial resistant bacteria, but few species have been investigated specifically in the context of AMR in the marine ecosystem. This study contrasts the occurrence of class 1 integrons and associated antimicrobial resistance genes in wild and captive little penguins (Eudyptula minor), an Australian seabird with local population declines. PCR screening of faecal samples (n = 448) revealed a significant difference in the prevalence of class 1 integrons in wild and captive groups, 3.2% and 44.7% respectively, with genes that confer resistance to streptomycin, spectinomycin, trimethoprim and multidrug efflux pumps detected. Class 1 integrons were not detected in two clinically relevant bacterial species, Klebsiella pneumoniae or Escherichia coli, isolated from penguin faeces. The presence of class 1 integrons in the little penguin supports the use of marine birds as sentinels of AMR in marine environments. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Enterococci are commensals that proliferated as animals crawled ashore hundreds of millions of years ago. They are also leading causes of multidrugresistant hospital-acquired infections. While most studies are driven by clinical interest, comparatively little is known about enterococci in the wild or the effect of human activity on them. Pharmaceutical pollution and runoff from other human activities are encroaching widely into natural habitats. To assess their reach into remote habitats, we investigated the identity, genetic relatedness, and presence of specific traits among 172 enterococcal isolates from wild Magellanic penguins. Four enterococcal species, 18 lineage groups, and different colonization patterns were identified. One Enterococcus faecalis lineage, sequence type 475 (ST475), was isolated from three different penguins, making it of special interest. Its genome was compared to those of other E. faecalis sequence types (ST116 and ST242) recovered from Magellanic penguins, as well as to an existing phylogeny of E. faecalis isolated from diverse origins over the past 100 years. No penguin-derived E. faecalis strains were closely related to dominant clinical lineages. Most possessed intact CRISPR defenses, few mobile elements, and antibiotic resistances limited to those intrinsic to the species and lacked pathogenic features conveyed by mobile elements. Interestingly, plasmids were identified in penguin isolates that also had been reported for other marine mammals. Enterococci isolated from penguins showed limited anthropogenic impact, indicating that they are likely representative of those naturally circulating in the ecosystem inhabited by the penguins. These findings establish an important baseline for detecting the encroachment of human activity into remote planetary environments. © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.

ABSTRACT: Difficulties quantifying in situ prey patch quality have limited our understanding of how marine predators respond to variation within and between patches, and throughout their foraging range. In the present study, animal-borne video, GPS, accelerometer and dive behaviour data loggers were used to investigate the fine-scale foraging behaviour of Macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus) in response to prey type, patch density and temporal variation in diving behaviour. Individuals mainly dived during the day and utilised two strategies, targeting different prey types. Subantarctic krill (Euphausia vallentini) were consumed during deep dives, while small soft-bodied fish were captured on shallow dives or during the ascent phase of deep dives. Despite breeding in large colonies individuals seemed to be solitary foragers and did not engage with conspecifics in coordinated behaviour as seen in other group foraging penguin species. This potentially reflects the high abundance and low manoeuvrability of krill. Video data were used to validate prey capture signals in accelerometer data and a Support Vector Machine learning algorithm was developed to identify prey captures that occurred throughout the entire foraging trip. Prey capture rates indicated that Macaroni penguins continued to forage beyond the optimal give up time. However, bout-scale analysis revealed individuals terminated diving behaviour for reasons other than patch quality. These findings indicate that individuals make complex foraging decisions in relation to their proximate environment over multiple spatio-temporal scales. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Due to considerable global decline in wildlife population numbers and species diversity, because of various anthropogenic activities, conservationists increasingly rely on captive and managed populations as important reservoirs to ensure the survival of endangered and vulnerable species. However, very few of these facilities implement robust, non-invasive monitoring techniques to confirm the effectiveness of their management practices to address animal welfare challenges. This study assessed adrenocortical activity as an indication of environmental stress by investigating the effects of both natural (climate, life-history stages) and anthropogenic (visitor presence) factors on captive-housed African penguins. Seven male–female African penguin breeding pairs were housed in a large, naturalistic outside enclosure at the National Zoological Garden (NZG), South Africa. Weekly urofaecal samples were collected from all individuals over one-year to measure urofaecal glucocorticoid metabolite (ufGCM) concentrations. General linear mixed model analysis determined that visitor presence (for males) and rainfall (for females) were the two factors which best explained the variation in ufGCM concentrations of the study population; however, none of the environmental and anthropogenic factors monitored were found to be significant. A posthoc graphical analysis showed considerable individual variation in terms of ufGCM concentrations within and between sexes when comparing life-history stages. This study confirms that non-invasive steroid monitoring can be an effective tool set for defining and assessing environmental stressors for African penguins and potentially other captive seabirds. However, conservationists and wildlife managers should also consider that individual-, sex-, and population-specific differences in the response to environmental stressors can exist. As such, a generalized management protocol for a specific species may not be sufficient and should be customized according to the specific captive population and/or individual. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Emerging viral diseases have become a significant concern due to their potential con-sequences for animal and environmental health. Over the past few decades, it has become clear that viruses emerging in wildlife may pose a major threat to vulnerable or endangered species. Diphtheritic stomatitis, likely to be caused by an avipoxvirus, has been recognised as a significant cause of mortality for the endangered yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes) in New Zealand. However, the avipoxvirus that infects yellow-eyed penguins has remained uncharacterised. Here, we report the complete genome of a novel avipoxvirus, penguinpox virus 2 (PEPV2), which was derived from a virus isolate obtained from a skin lesion of a yellow-eyed penguin. The PEPV2 genome is 349.8 kbp in length and contains 327 predicted genes; five of these genes were found to be unique, while a further two genes were absent compared to shearwaterpox virus 2 (SWPV2). In comparison with penguinpox virus (PEPV) isolated from an African penguin, there was a lack of conservation within the central region of the genome. Subsequent phylogenetic analyses of the PEPV2 genome positioned it within a distinct subclade comprising the recently isolated avipoxvirus genome sequences from shearwater, canary, and magpie bird species, and demonstrated a high degree of sequence similarity with SWPV2 (96.27%). This is the first reported genome sequence of PEPV2 from a yellow-eyed penguin and will help to track the evolution of avipoxvirus infections in this rare and endangered species. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Fiordland crested penguins (tawaki; Eudyptes pachyrhynchus) lack sexually dimorphic plumage so behavioural cues or bill size have traditionally been used to determine sex in the field. We aimed to identify morphological characters that can be quickly and reliably be measured in the field to accurately sex adult tawaki, and validated these with genetics. We measured five morphological parameters in tawaki (n = 32) from three colonies (Jackson Head, Milford Sound/ Piopiotahi, and Codfish Island/Whenua Hou) on the New Zealand South Island. We confirmed sex with a PCR-based molecular assay. Male tawaki are larger in all parameters measured and recursive partitioning trees correctly classify 94% of penguins sampled. In line with Warham (1974) and Murie et al. (1991), we propose using bill length (males > 44.5 mm) and bill depth (males > 25.5 mm) but in combination with foot length (males > 113.5 mm) to determine tawaki sex in the field. These morphological parameters are independent of body condition and are easily obtained in the field. © 2021 Ornithological Society of New Zealand. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Understanding the factors that drive the dynamics of populations of long‐lived species presents a unique challenge for conservation management. Here, we investigated long-term change in the body condition of adult northern rockhopper penguins Eudyptes moseleyi at Amsterdam Island, southern Indian Ocean, which hosts 5–10% of the global population of this endangered species. Analysis of a long‐term dataset (1994–2016), concurrent to the population's rapid decline, revealed no trend in adult northern rockhopper penguin body condition over time at the stages considered in this study, i.e. breeding and moulting. However, body condition varied between years and sexes and part of this variation was explained by environmental factors. Males were on average in better condition than females whatever the stage and individuals on average were in better condition during the moulting compared to the breeding period. The environmental conditions [sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTa), Subtropical Indian Ocean Dipole (SIOD) and Southern Annular Mode (SAM)] appeared to impact non-linearly the body condition. Overall, females were in better condition for negative values of SAM, SIOD and SSTa. The body condition of males exhibited similar but less complex and more significant patterns, with decreasing body condition for increasing SAM, SIOD and SSTa. The absence of long-term trends in male and female body condition suggests that the very low reproductive output and declining population since 1997 is probably not the result of environmental conditions during pre-breeding and pre-moult and necessitates further research into possible drivers during the breeding season. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Context. Diet variability is a significant driver of seabird decline; however, data on seabird diet composition and trends have been affected by changes in precision and resolution owing to the evolution of different sampling methods over time. We investigated the effectiveness of applying a passive molecular diet method using faeces obtained from the endangered yellow-eyed penguin. Aims. To assess the feasibility of applying DNA metabarcoding methods to yellow-eyed penguin faeces to evaluate diet, and to compare the reliability of diet results derived from adults and chicks, and from latrine versus fresh faecal samples. Methods. We collected 313 faecal samples from yellow-eyed penguins resident on the Otago coast of New Zealand from October 2016 to August 2017. We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with mitochondrial 16S cephalopod and chordate primers to amplify prey DNA present in the faecal samples, and tested the completeness of our assembled reference databases based on previous diet research. Amplified prey DNA sequences were then assigned to taxa from our reference databases by using QIIME2. Key results. Mitochondrial 16S chordate PCR primers were effective at identifying 29 fish taxa, with 98.3% of amplified sequences being identified to species or genus level in 193 samples (61.7% collected). There was no significant difference in the number, occurrence or proportion of ray-finned fish prey DNA sequences derived from fresh samples or latrines. Mitochondrial 16S cephalopod PCR primers classified 1.98% of amplified DNA sequences as targets, with 96.5% of these target sequences being identified to species or genus level in 48 samples (15.3% collected), and five taxa identified. Conclusions. We recommend the collection of latrine samples to enable long-term monitoring of the diet of yellow-eyed penguins, which will optimise the trade-off between wildlife disturbance and dietary resolution. Further refinement is needed to identify cephalopod dietary components for yellow-eyed penguins, because our cephalopod primers were not as specific as those used for ray-finned fishes, amplifying a large number (>98%) of non-cephalopod species. Implications. DNA metabarcoding offers a robust and comprehensive alternative to other, more intrusive, seabird diet-assessment methods, but still requires parallel studies to provide critical information on prey size, true diet composition and diet quality. © 2020 CSIRO.

ABSTRACT: A 9-yr-old female black-footed African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) was presented for necropsy after a history of reproductive abnormalities, paresis of limbs, weakness, and sudden death. Postmortem examination revealed soft keel, collapsed rib cage with beading of the ribs, and bilateral parathyroid enlargement. Classic histologic lesions of fibrous osteodystrophy with osteomalacia were observed in the ribs, vertebrae, and to a lesser extent in the femur and tibiotarsus associated with hyperplasia of parathyroid glands. This represents the first report of nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism in birds of the order Spheniciformes, most likely caused by low levels of calcium supplementation during egg laying. The reproductive abnormalities observed in this penguin and others from the same group (asynchronous egg-laying cycles, abnormal breeding behavior) were most likely exacerbated by the lack of an adequate photoperiod mimicking the natural daylight pattern. © 2021 American Association of Avian Pathologists.

ABSTRACT: Although many penguin species migrate during the non-breeding period, Gentoo Penguins Pygoscelis papua are year-round residents. Despite being characterized as inshore feeders, the at-sea spatial usage of Gentoo Penguins during the non-breeding period, when central place foraging constraints are relaxed, is poorly understood. Here, we tracked the movements of Gentoo Penguins from five breeding colonies at the Falkland Islands, globally one of the largest Gentoo Penguin breeding populations. Gentoo Penguin movement patterns during the non-breeding period were complex, which likely reflects a high degree of foraging plasticity. Specifically, considerable individual variation existed in foraging trip distance, duration and fidelity to deployment location. For example, maximum foraging trip distance for individual penguins ranged from 64 to 600 km from the colony location (or 480 km from the nearest point on land), and maximum foraging trip duration ranged from 5.7 to 24.8 days. Gentoo Penguin foraging trip distance and duration at the Falkland Islands far exceeded those reported at other locations during the non-breeding period, and challenge the inshore, diurnal feeding stereotype. Gentoo Penguins also frequently moved between breeding colonies within the Falkland Islands archipelago, but typically returned to their respective colonies, although not necessarily on consecutive foraging trips. Extended movements highlight Gentoo Penguin breeding dispersal capability, which might play a crucial role in population dynamics and gene flow. © 2020 British Ornithologists' Union

ABSTRACT: Anthropogenic activity is a major driver of seabird injury and mortality in the 21st century. Although most seabirds perish within the natural environment as a result of human activities, some are rescued and admitted to rehabilitation centres. Despite the considerable number of admissions, little is known regarding the physiological response seabirds have to specific admission reasons and the rehabilitation process. In this study, we aimed to determine the effect of injury, emaciation, oiling, individual removal from the natural environment and the rehabilitation process on the physiological stress response of the African penguin (Spheniscus demersus). Urofaecal samples were collected from African penguins throughout a three-stage rehabilitation process and quantified for glucocorticoid metabolites (ufGCM). The three stages included an initial ICU crate stage (Stage 1), an ICU pen stage (Stage 2) and a rehabilitation stage (Stage 3). Data were analysed using a generalised linear model in order to determine the effect of admission reason, age and rehabilitation stage (Stage 1, 2 and 3) on ufGCM levels. Although the model indicated that only Stage 1 was a significant driver of adrenocortical activity in the study population, ufGCM levels of injured and emaciated animals within Stage 1 were considerably higher than those of birds with any other admission reason across all stages. This is the first study examining the causes and effect of rehabilitation on the physiological stress response in African penguins. Enhanced care and attention should be given to rescued individuals, especially during the first stage of rehabilitation, to reduce perception of additional stressors and thus increase the chance of full recovery. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Captive animal welfare is important for establishments that exhibit species for education, conservation, and research. However, captive animals are often exposed to a number of potential stressors, such as visitors and anthropogenic noise. We aimed to identify the impact of a concert series on the behaviour of Fiordland penguins (Eudyptes pachyrhynchus; n = 2), and solitary-(n = 1) or group-(n = 4)-housed collared peccaries (Pecari tajacu). Animal behaviour, visitor density, and visitor behaviour was monitored pre-concert (afternoons; 16:00–19:00), during the concert (evenings; 19:00–21:00), and post-concert (nights; 21:00–00:00) on concert days (penguin n = 7 days; peccary n = 8 days) and in the same periods on days when there was no concert (penguin n = 8 days; peccary n = 6 days). Fiordland penguins spent more time surface swimming and diving in the pool on concert afternoons and evenings (all p < 0.001), more time in the nest on concert nights (p < 0.001), preened less on concert afternoons and nights (p = 0.019), and engaged with their habitat less on concert evenings and nights (p = 0.002) compared to these periods on days without a concert. The group-housed peccaries slept more in the afternoon and evening (p ≤ 0.01) and were more vigilant at night (p = 0.009) on concert days compared to no-concert days. The solitary-housed peccary slept more on concert nights (p = 0.035), rested more frequently across all time periods on concert days (p < 0.001), and used the front of the enclosure more across all concert time periods (p < 0.001) compared to no-concert days. We provide evidence that behaviour was altered on event days; however, we cannot determine the nature of these changes. Further research is needed to understand the impact of music concerts on zoo animal welfare. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: An animal's ability to recognize another individual by matching their image to their voice suggests they form internal representations of other individuals. To what extent this ability, termed cross-modal individual recognition, extends to birds other than corvids is unknown. Here, we used an expectancy violation paradigm to determine whether a monogamous territorial seabird (Spheniscus demersus) can cross-modally recognize familiar conspecifics (partners or colony-mates). After pairs of penguins spent time together in an isolated area, one of the penguins was released from the area leaving the focal penguin alone. Subsequently, we played contact calls of the released penguin (congruent condition) or a different penguin (incongruent condition). After being paired with a colony-mate, focal penguins' response latency to the auditory stimulus was faster in the incongruent compared to congruent condition, indicating the mismatch violated their expectations. This behavioural pattern was not observed in focal penguins after being paired with their partner. We discuss these different results in the light of penguins' natural behaviour and the evolution of social communication strategies. Our results suggest that cross-modal individual recognition extends to penguins and reveals, in contrast with previously thought, that social communication between members of this endangered species can also use visual cues. © 2021 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Fast climate changes in the western Antarctic Peninsula are reducing krill density, which along with increased fishing activities in recent decades, may have had synergistic effects on penguin populations. We tested that assumption by crossing data on fishing activities and Southern Annular Mode (an indicator of climate change in Antarctica) with penguin population data. Increases in fishing catch during the non-breeding period were likely to result in impacts on both chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarcticus) and gentoo (P. papua) populations. Catches and climate change together elevated the probability of negative population growth rates: very high fishing catch on years with warm winters and low sea ice (associated with negative Southern Annular Mode values) implied a decrease in population size in the following year. The current management of krill fishery in the Southern Ocean takes into account an arbitrary and fixed catch limit that does not reflect the variability of the krill population under effects of climate change, therefore affecting penguin populations when the environmental conditions were not favorable. © 2020, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

ABSTRACT: Southern Ocean ecosystems are rapidly changing due to climate variability. An apparent beneficiary of such change in the western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is the gentoo penguin Pygoscelis papua, which has increased its population size and expanded its range southward in the last 20 years. To better understand how this species has responded to large-scale changes, we tracked individuals during the non-breeding winter period from five colonies across the latitudinal range of breeding sites in the WAP, including from a recently established colony. Results highlight latitudinal gradients in movement; strong associations with shallow, coastal habitats along the entire Antarctic Peninsula; and movements that are independent of, yet constrained by, sea ice. It is clear that coastal habitats essential to gentoo penguins during the breeding season are similarly critical during winter. Larger movements of birds from northern colonies in the WAP further suggest that leap-frog migration may influence colonization events by facilitating nest-area prospecting and use of new haul-out sites. Our results support efforts to develop a marine protected area around the WAP. Winter habitats used by gentoo penguins outline high priority areas for improving the management of the spatioorally concentrated krill (Euphausia superba) fishery that operates in this region during winter. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Antarctica presents one of the most severe environmental conditions for life. Under these circumstances, cryptogams are the dominant photosynthetic organisms, among which we find a great richness of lichens. In Antarctic environments, lichens can grow on rocks or in this case on fossil remains, among the few available substrates. In the present contribution, we examined all fossil penguins of the Antarctic collection of the Museo de La Plata, as a significant sample of fossil vertebrates. The selected materials here described come from the Submeseta Formation (Eocene) on Seymour/Marambio Island, located northeast of the Antarctic Peninsula on the Weddell Sea. Given the scarcity of lichenological studies on this island, and the results presented here add significantly to our knowledge of the lichen species that occur there with the recognition of 11 taxa with a crustose morphology (epilithic and endolithic), the sampling of lichens growing on fossil bones acquired an evident importance. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Inter-annual variations in the diets of seabirds are often a reflection of resource availability, with population dynamics and community structure implications. We investigated the trophic niche of Magellanic penguins Spheniscus magellanicus during the pre-molt stage in 6 years (2009 and 2013−2017) at Martillo Island, Beagle Channel, Argentina, using carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis of feathers. We found higher values in 2009 compared to the other years for both isotopes and estimated different proportions of prey in the diet of Magellanic penguins throughout the years. In 2009, penguins consumed mainly a mixture of benthic and benthopelagic fish, whereas from 2013 to 2017, the proportion of the pelagic form of squat lobster Munida gregaria, considered a key species in the Beagle Channel, increased over time and nearly dominated diets in 2017. Our results confirm that Magellanic penguins act as sentinels, reflecting shifts in the marine community of the Beagle Channel via inter-annual variation in their trophic niche and diet composition. © Inter-Research 2020 · www.int-res.com

ABSTRACT: The process of hybridization between closely related species plays an important role in defining the genetic integrity and overall genetic diversity of species. The distribution range of Magellanic (Spheniscus magellanicus) and Humboldt (Spheniscus humboldti) penguins is predominantly allopatric; however, the species share a region of sympatry where they may hybridize. We analyzed four types of genetic markers (including nuclear and mitochondrial markers) to assess their utility in detecting hybridization events between Magellanic and Humboldt penguins. Genetic assessment of non-introgressed reference samples allowed us to identify three types of informative markers (microsatellites, major histocompatibility complex, and mitochondrial DNA) and detect positive evidence of introgressive hybridization in the wild. Four out of six putative hybrids showed positive evidence of hybridization, revealed by the detection of Humboldt mitochondrial DNA and Magellanic species-specific alleles from nuclear markers. Bayesian Structure analysis, including samples from the sympatric region of the species in the southern Pacific Ocean, confirmed the use of nuclear markers for detecting hybridization and genetic admixture of putative hybrids, but revealed relatively low levels of genetic introgression at the population level. These findings provide insights into the role of hybridization in regions of species sympatry and its potential consequences on the levels of genetic introgression, genetic diversity, and conservation of these penguin species. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

ABSTRACT: Estimating when and where survival bottlenecks occur in free-ranging marine predators is critical for effective demographic monitoring and spatial planning. This is particularly relevant to juvenile stages of long-lived species for which direct observations of death are typically not possible. We used satellite telemetry data from fledgling Adélie, chinstrap and gentoo penguins near the Antarctic Peninsula to estimate the spatio-temporal scale of a bottleneck after fledging. Fledglings were tracked up to 106 days over distances of up to 2140 km. Cumulative losses of tags increased to 73% within 16 days of deployment, followed by an order-of-magnitude reduction in loss rates thereafter. The timing and location of tag losses were consistent with at-sea observations of penguin carcasses and bioenergetics simulations of mass loss to thresholds associated with low recruitment probability. A bootstrapping procedure is used to assess tag loss owing to death versus other factors. Results suggest insensitivity in the timing of the bottleneck and quantify plausible ranges of mortality rates within the bottleneck. The weight of evidence indicates that a survival bottleneck for fledgling penguins is acute, attributable to predation and starvation, and may account for at least 33% of juvenile mortality.  © 2020 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Optimal foraging theory predicts that diving predators should maximise their energy intake while minimizing the costs of their foraging activities at depth. This hypothesis was tested in two breath-hold divers that foraged in the pelagic waters off Kerguelen Island, southern Indian Ocean. Macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus) feed predominately on crustaceans at moderate depths (ca. 50 m), while king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) feed on mesopelagic fish at deep depths (ca. 100–150 m). We instrumented 22 penguins with time-depth recorders during the breeding season of the 2014 southern summer, just before they went to sea. Birds were recaptured after one to five foraging trips and the dive data were analysed on the level of single dive cycles and entire dive bouts. Both species adjusted their diving behaviour and modulated their foraging activity in accordance with their experience in their previous dives. Foraging activity during a dive (in terms of number of wiggles per dive) was greater if birds targeted the same depth as the previous dive. The penguins spent less time at the surface between two prey capture attempt dives than when a prey capture attempt dive was preceded by a non-prey capture attempt dive. Dive bout analyses showed that foraging activity increased with bout duration, while transit time during dives decreased with bout duration. Our findings are in general agreement with predictions based on optimal foraging models. The results suggest that penguins anticipated the depth of their next dive based on their encounter of a prey patch in the previous dive and optimized their chances of feeding success by spending minimal time at the surface and in transit to the patch depth. Once penguins detected a prey patch, these behavioural adjustments allowed them to rapidly return to that patch, increasing their chances of feeding again before the prey disperses. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: In coastal waters, nutrient supplies originate principally from allochthonous sources, such as inputs from rivers, estuaries or oceanic waters. Recently, it has been suggested that marine life contributes to the nutrient load, with penguin colonies being the largest contributor worldwide. This study aimed to quantify the nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) produced by the largest colony of African penguins Spheniscus demersus, which is located in South Africa, using a bioenergetics model (GUANO). We modelled the fate of N excreted and measured potential effects on the physicochemical parameters of the waters surrounding St Croix Island, Algoa Bay, as well as on local primary and secondary productivity. A total of 58.66 (SD 14.99) tonnes (t) of N and 4.35 (SD 1.20) t of P were estimated to be produced by penguins annually, a magnitude comparable to that exported by permanently open estuaries in Algoa Bay. However, only 8% of penguin-produced N washed into the ocean (after moderate to heavy precipitation) as total ammoniacal N, while 58% of N was excreted as volatilised ammonia. Consequently, penguin excreta appeared to have limited influence on productivity in the waters surrounding St Croix Island, at both proximate (200 m) and distant (2 km) locations. Additional experiments should confirm whether the input of N excretion in coastal waters was too ephemeral to be detected at the monthly scale, or whether the effects were restricted to intertidal communities. Regardless, sources of nutrients other than penguins, such as coastal upwelling and runoff, are likely to have a greater influence on the physicochemical dynamics and productivity of Algoa Bay nearshore waters. © 2021 NISC (Pty) Ltd.

ABSTRACT: King penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) are a circumpolar sub-Antarctic species inhabiting most of the major sub-Antarctic island chains of the Southern Ocean, the Falkland Islands, and regions of Patagonia. Despite early suggestions to the contrary, there is no conclusive historical evidence of King penguin inhabitation of the Antarctic Peninsula or the South Shetland Islands until the past decade. After a near-complete survey of Elephant Island, we report widespread presence of this species, including documented incubation at one site and molting at another. While we found no evidence of King penguins successfully fledging a chick at any of the sites where individuals were found, their presence across numerous sites suggests the potential for future range expansion in response to warming conditions. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Seabirds often have wide distribution ranges and may travel relatively long distances to breeding grounds, often crossing jurisdictional boundaries. When engaged in foraging behaviour, seabirds are prone to interact with different fisheries and suffer incidental mortality. We assessed the spatial use of foraging Magellanic penguins Spheniscus magellanicus breeding at 3 colonies within the Patagonia Austral Marine Park (San Jorge Gulf, Argentina) in relation to different jurisdictions. We also quantified their spatial overlap with 3 trawl fisheries and bycatch (incidental mortality), an interaction previously reported in the region. Breeding Magellanic penguins mainly used waters under provincial jurisdiction within the gulf, with some use of federal waters depending on the breeding season and colony location. Spatial use by breeding penguins resulted in a variable but relatively low overlap with the operations of the 3 fishing fleets in 2014−2016 (1.1−26.3%). Changes in the spatial distribution of fishing operations in recent years resulted in a lower overlap than in 2005−2007 (12.1−60.8%). Incidental mortality during 2008−2014 was also variable and relatively low (0.0−0.363 birds per haul). Breeding Magellanic penguins foraged outside protected area boundaries where they can spatially overlap with and face potential threats from different fishing fleets that operate in waters of provincial and/or federal jurisdiction. Despite the current low spatial overlap, the relatively fast changes in fishing patterns in the recent past draw attention to the need for continuous monitoring. Data obtained in this study may prove valuable in case the implementation of spatial and temporal closures of fishing operations is needed. © Inter-Research 2021.

ABSTRACT: A 7-month-old, male Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus), housed in an outdoor exhibit, developed acute neurologic signs that progressed to death over 2 days. On gross examination, the bird had congested, edematous lungs, and cerebellar hemorrhage. Histologic examination identified granulomatous pneumonia and encephalitis, with thrombosis and eosinophilic, branching fungal hyphae that had invaded the meningeal vessel walls. Polymerase chain reaction identified the fungus in the brain as Rhizomucor pusillus, an uncommon cause of mucormycosis. This organism has previously been reported in respiratory, skeletal, and sino-orbital lesions of avian species.

ABSTRACT: Wildlife species are often host to a diversity of parasites, but our knowledge of their diversity and ecology is extremely limited, especially for reptiles. Little is known about the host-parasite ecology of the Australian lizard, the King's skink (Egernia kingii). In spring of 2015, we carried out a field-based study of a population of King's skinks on Penguin Island (Western Australia). We documented five species of parasites, including two ectoparasitic mites (an undescribed laelapid mite and Mesolaelaps australiensis), an undescribed coccidia species, and two nematode species (Pharyngodon tiliquae and Capillaria sp.). The laelapid mite was the most abundant parasite, infesting 46.9% of the 113 captured lizards. This mite species increased in prevalence and abundance over the course of the study. Infection patterns of both mites varied with lizard life-stage; sub-adults were more commonly infested with laelapid mites than adults or juveniles, and sub-adults and adults were infested by more laelapid mites than juveniles. By contrast, adults had a higher prevalence of M. australiensis than juveniles or sub-adults. Among the gastrointestinal parasites, P. tiliquae was relatively common among the sampled lizards (35.3%). These results give new important information about reptiles as parasite hosts and what factors influence infection patterns.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2020.

ABSTRACT: In the Antarctic Peninsula, during the chick-rearing period Adélie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and gentoo (P. papua) penguins feed primarily on Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), which is also exploited by the commercial fishery. Krill length and proportion of juvenile krill consumed by these predators that breed at Stranger Point, South Shetland Islands (from 2007/2008 to 2015/2016), and those collected by the krill fishery in the Mar de la Flota/Bransfield Strait (from 2009/2010 to 2015/2016) were compared to evaluate the potential of each data source as an indicator of changes in the size composition and so, in the demographic structure of the krill population. Overall, the mean krill size taken by gentoo penguins was larger than that ingested by Adélie penguins, which consumed higher proportions of juvenile (≤ 35 mm) and one-year-old (≤ 25 mm) krill. Although the krill size caught by the fishery was statistically similar to that taken by both penguin species, there were differences in the frequency distributions of krill size among the three databases. Furthermore, when only adult krill (> 35 mm) was considered, the three sources of krill data showed a similar inter-annual variation in the availability of adult krill cohorts. Our findings suggest that each database analysed here can potentially provide different information (although complementary) about krill size composition. In addition, inter-annual fluctuations in the smaller size classes of krill likely reflect their first year of recruitment and, therefore, may be used as an indicator of shifts in local krill availability. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: In long-lived marine predators such as penguins, foraging behaviour is related to breeding success. Yellow-eyed penguins Megadyptes antipodes are thought to be predominantly benthic foragers around mainland New Zealand, with previous dive studies showing little variation in diving behaviour and minimal change by year or breeding status. This apparent absence of foraging flexibility may be linked to local prey availability and therefore also to foraging success, factors believed to contribute to the current population decline. Here, we undertook the first detailed study of yellow-eyed penguin diving and foraging behaviour in the subantarctic Auckland Islands, part of the original ancestral range of the species that colonised mainland New Zealand. We collected dive logs from 134 foraging trips made by 73 breeders from Enderby Island, Auckland Islands, in the New Zealand subantarctic. Pelagic dives and foraging trips were recorded in the subantarctic population-a foraging strategy not previously published in dive studies on this species. Changes between benthic and pelagic foraging were recorded for individuals within foraging trips, within a breeding season, and between years. Differences in diving behaviour between the subantarctic and that reported for mainland New Zealand are likely influenced by local bathymetry and environmental conditions, and prey availability. However, the subantarctic population shows a greater use of pelagic foraging not evident in the northern population, even in areas that have a similar depth to some mainland foraging areas. This observed foraging flexibility may have implications for breeding success and potentially the long-term population trends of these 2 genetically similar populations. © 2020 Inter-Research.

ABSTRACT: A ground survey of Fiordland crested penguins (tawaki; Eudyptes pachyrhynchus), breeding between Lee Bay and White Rock Point, northeast Stewart Island was carried out from 1-6 September 2019, to obtain a population estimate for the area. A total of 128 nests was found along the ~40 km of coast, 107 of which were located in caves on the cliffy shoreline rather than in the forest as is typical of South Westland breeding areas. Access along this coast is often difficult; however, the confinement of most nests to caves allows for a more accurate search than in forest colonies such as those in South Westland and Milford Sound. The results of this survey suggest that a significant breeding population is present on mainland Stewart Island and needs to be considered in future management plans for the species. Additional surveys of the remaining ~700 km of coastline should be conducted to obtain a better estimate of the entire population. © The Ornithological Society of New Zealand Inc.

ABSTRACT: Some marine birds and mammals can perform dives of extraordinary duration and depth. Such dive performance is dependent on many factors, including total body oxygen (O2) stores. For diving penguins, the respiratory system (air sacs and lungs) constitutes 30-50% of the total body O2 store. To better understand the role and mechanism of parabronchial ventilation and O2 utilization in penguins both on the surface and during the dive, we examined air sac partial pressures of O2 (PO2) in emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) equipped with backpack PO2 recorders. Cervical air sac PO2 values at rest were lower than in other birds, while the cervical air sac to posterior thoracic air sac PO2 differencewas larger. Pre-dive cervical air sac PO2 values were often greater than those at rest, but had a wide range andwere not significantly different from those at rest. The maximum respiratory O2 store and total body O2 stores calculated with representative anterior and posterior air sac PO2 data did not differ from prior estimates. The mean calculated anterior air sac O2 depletion rate for dives up to 11 min was approximately one-tenth that of the posterior air sacs. Low cervical air sac PO2 values at rest may be secondary to a low ratio of parabronchial ventilation to parabronchial blood O2 extraction. During dives, overlap of simultaneously recorded cervical and posterior thoracic air sac PO2 profiles supported the concept of maintenance of parabronchial ventilation during a dive by air movement through the lungs. © 2021.

ABSTRACT: Penguins (Sphenisciformes) have arguably the most complete and continuous fossil record of any avian clade, offering an ever-improving understanding of penguin phylogeny, biogeography, and the evolution of wing-propelled diving. Yet, our knowledge of the precise body proportions of stem-group penguins remains poor due to a dearth of articulated specimens. Here, we describe Kairuku waewaeroa sp. nov., a new giant penguin species from the Glen Massey Formation (Whaingaroan stage, 34.6–27.3 Ma). The holotype skeleton, discovered in Kawhia Harbour, North Island, New Zealand, is one of the most complete skeletons of a giant penguin yet uncovered. Our phylogenetic analysis recovers a clade uniting the New Zealand endemics Kairuku waewaeroa, Kairuku waitaki, and Kairuku grebneffi, which is supported by synapomorphies including a stout femoral shaft and tibiotarsi with a distinctly convex medial condyle. Kairuku waewaeroa is unique among stem penguins in having elongate tibiotarsi, revealing a new long-legged stem penguin body plan. The discovery of Kairuku waewaeroa contributes yet another penguin species to an Oligocene avifauna for Zealandia that is replete with giant birds. © 2021, by the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology.

ABSTRACT: Nest design and characteristics can influence the microclimatic conditions in the nest. Nest-dwelling ectoparasites are sensitive to temperature and moisture and as such the conditions in the nest can influence parasite infestations. The endangered African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) breeds in different nest types and as yet little is known with regard to the microclimate and parasite infestation within these nests. This study characterized the microclimatic conditions in natural open, natural covered (with vegetation) and artificial nests, and assessed the relationship between nest characteristics (type, age, distance from the coast, orientation and entrance opening) and in-nest ectoparasite infestations and the health of African penguins in Stony Point, South Africa. Penguins (50 adults and 192 chicks) and their nests (n = 308) were sampled in 2016 and 2017. Soil temperature was higher in artificial than in natural nests, and soil and nest material moisture was lower in artificial and natural covered nests than natural open. Ectoparasite infestations were higher under warmer and drier conditions, in artificial nests and nests near the coastline. Penguin (adult and chick) body mass and chick body condition were lower in warmer nests and total plasma protein (in adults and checks) was lower in drier nests. Given the potential adverse effects of ectoparasites on host species, it is recommended that conservation agencies implement a monitoring programme to assess the ectoparasite infestation in artificial nests across multiple colonies. This information will facilitate a more holistic penguin conservation management plan that may prevent further detrimental effects on this endangered penguin species. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Ecologically similar marine species inhabiting the same areas compete for food resources. Such competition is reduced by resource-partitioning strategies that may affect physiology. For instance, diet and feeding strategies may affect the antioxidant defences or the production of reactive oxygen species. Oxidative stress is defined as the imbalance between pro-oxidants and antioxidant defences. If such an imbalance favours the former, this can lead to oxidative damage, and oxidative stress increases. However, to our knowledge, how free-ranging animals adjust their oxidative status in relation to their foraging habitats, diet and dietary antioxidants has not yet been studied. Penguins are an interesting biological model for such a comparison because their diet, based on krill, fish and/or cephalopods, presents strong variation in dietary antioxidant content. We therefore examined trophic level (δ15N), foraging habitat (δ13C), dietary antioxidants (retinol, α-tocopherol and astaxanthin) and oxidative status (plasma non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity and oxidative damage) in pygoscelid penguins (chinstrap Pygoscelis antarcticus, gentoo P. papua and Adélie P. adeliae) breeding in Antarctica. We found interspecific differences in all variables analysed except α-tocopherol. Gentoo penguins exploited more cephalopods and fish in coastal and benthic habitats, Adélies showed an intermediate position, whereas chinstraps foraged more on krill and fish in pelagic waters. Dietary antioxidant levels showed specific patterns resulting in relationships with prey items. However, we did not find any clear relationships between dietary antioxidants and species-specific antioxidant capacity, suggesting the importance of endogenously produced antioxidants. Oxidative status appeared to be differently related to foraging strategy and antioxidant capacity in each species. © Inter-Research 2021.

ABSTRACT: Mabé pearl (half-pearl) culture provides rural livelihood opportunities in the South Pacific and is a low-tech alternative to capital and labor-intensive round pearl culture. The Kingdom of Tonga is unique among the pearl-producing countries of the South Pacific in focusing on mabé pearl culture using the winged pearl oyster Pteria penguin. The Tongan mabé pearl sector is developing rapidly and stimulated by routine supply of spat to mabé pearl farmers, from the government hatchery at no cost. It is likely that some level of cost recovery for spat supply will be considered as the sector strengthens, but information on hatchery production costs is limited. This study determined the costs of operating the government pearl oyster hatchery in Tonga and developed an economic model to assess the production cost of juvenile oysters. Modeling was based on a single annual hatchery run generating 6,600 oysters from the ocean-based nursery for delivery to commercial pearl farms. Estimated capital cost was USD 19,079 (excluding government buildings and chattels), and the major production costs were hatchery labor (37%), capital purchase and replacement (20%), and nursery labor (10%). Total annual costs for the pearl oyster hatchery were USD 13,263, equating to a cost of USD 2.01 per oyster supplied to farmers in Tonga. Given significant annual profits of around USD 9,338 that can be generated from 100 harvested oysters, there is justification for cost recovery. Results will be valuable to key stakeholders and have regional relevance for hatchery production of high-value aquaculture commodities. © 2020 National Shellfisheries Association.

ABSTRACT: Understanding energy use is central to understanding an animal's physiological and behavioural ecology. However, directly measuring energy expenditure in free-ranging animals is inherently difficult. The doubly labelled water (DLW) method is widely used to investigate energy expenditure in a range of taxa. Although reliable, DLW data collection and analysis is both financially costly and time consuming. Dynamic body acceleration (e.g. VeDBA) calculated from animal-borne accelerometers has been used to determine behavioural patterns, and is increasingly being used as a proxy for energy expenditure. Still its performance as a proxy for energy expenditure in free-ranging animals is not well established and requires validation against established methods. In the present study, the relationship between VeDBA and the at-sea metabolic rate calculated from DLW was investigated in little penguins (Eudyptula minor) using three approaches. Both in a simple correlation and activity-specific approaches were shown to be good predictors of at-sea metabolic rate. The third approach using activityspecific energy expenditure values obtained from literature did not accurately calculate the energy expended by individuals. However, all three approaches were significantly strengthened by the addition of mean horizontal travel speed. These results provide validation for the use of accelerometry as a proxy for energy expenditure and show how energy expenditure may be influenced by both individual behaviour and environmental conditions. © 2021 Company of Biologists Ltd.

ABSTRACT: When successive stages of an organism's life-history overlap, conflicts and trade-offs can emerge due to competition among physiological pathways. For example, long periods of sustained locomotion in migrating birds are supported by the androgenic up-regulation of aerobic factors, such as new red blood cell production and hematocrit. However, towards the end of migration, many female birds begin up-regulating 17ß-estradiol (E2) to support vitellogenesis and egg production, but E2 secretion is known to have suppressive effects on red blood cell production (anti-erythropoiesis). We explored potential trade-offs between factors related to aerobic performance (hematocrit, reticulocyte index) and the expression of factors related to E2-mediated vitellogenesis (i.e. yolk precursor production) in female macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus), a species in which the physiologies controlling egg production and migratory activity run simultaneously (e.g. females experience a migratory conflict). We collected blood samples from penguins immediately upon their return to the colony, prior to egg laying. Hematocrit was elevated when the penguins returned to the colony (50.05% ± 3.40 SD), which is similar to pre-laying values observed in other migratory bird species. Furthermore, mean reticulocyte levels were elevated (34.87% ± 2.34), which is the highest level yet recorded in birds. Similarly, both plasma vitellogenin and yolk-targeted very low density lipoprotein levels were upregulated (2.30 ± 0.06 μg Zn ml−1, and 9.70 ± 0.19 mmol l−1, respectively), indicating that penguins were reproductively active and producing eggs during migration and upon arrival on land. As predicted, a negative relationship between hematocrit and plasma vitellogenin was found, but we found no evidence to suggest that birds were experiencing reproductive anemia. Alternatively, we attribute the negative relationship to a hemodilution effect of yolk precursor secretion into circulation. It appears that female macaroni penguins are able to preserve hematocrit levels and new red blood cell production when migratory activity overlaps with reproductive processes. © 2020

ABSTRACT: Gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) are found across the Southern Ocean with a circumpolar distribution and notable genetic and morphological variation across their geographic range. Whether this geographic variation represents species-level diversity has yet to be investigated in an integrative taxonomic framework. Here, we show that four distinct populations of gentoo penguins (Iles Kerguelen, Falkland Islands, South Georgia, and South Shetlands/Western Antarctic Peninsula) are genetically and morphologically distinct from one another. We present here a revised taxonomic treatment including formal nomenclatural changes. We suggest the designation of four species of gentoo penguin: P. papua in the Falkland Islands, P. ellsworthi in the South Shetland Islands/Western Antarctic Peninsula, P. taeniata in Iles Kerguelen, and a new gentoo species P. poncetii, described herein, in South Georgia. These findings of cryptic diversity add to many other such findings across the avian tree of life in recent years. Our results further highlight the importance of reassessing species boundaries as methodological advances are made, particularly for taxa of conservation concern. We recommend reassessment by the IUCN of each species, particularly P. taeniata and P. poncetii, which both show evidence of decline. © 2020 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Global targets for area-based conservation and management must move beyond threshold-based targets alone and must account for the quality of such areas. In the Southern Ocean around Antarctica, a region where key biodiversity faces unprecedented risks from climate change and where there is a growing demand to extract resources, a number of marine areas have been afforded enhanced conservation or management measures through two adopted marine protected areas (MPAs). However, evidence suggests that additional high quality areas could benefit from a proposed network of MPAs. Penguins offer a particular opportunity to identify high quality areas because these birds, as highly visible central-place foragers, are considered indicator species whose populations reflect the state of the surrounding marine environment. We compiled a comprehensive dataset of the location of penguin colonies and their associated abundance estimates in Antarctica. We then estimated the at-sea distribution of birds based on information derived from tracking data and through the application of a modified foraging radius approach with a density decay function to identify some of the most important marine areas for chick-rearing adult penguins throughout waters surrounding Antarctica following the Important Bird and Biodiversity Area (IBA) framework. Additionally, we assessed how marine IBAs overlapped with the currently adopted and proposed network of key management areas (primarily MPAs), and how the krill fishery likely overlapped with marine IBAs over the past five decades. We identified 63 marine IBAs throughout Antarctic waters and found that were the proposed MPAs to be adopted, the permanent conservation of high quality areas for penguin species would increase by between 49 and 100% depending on the species. Furthermore, our data show that, despite a generally contracting range of operation by the krill fishery in Antarctica over the past five decades, a consistently disproportionate amount of krill is being harvested within marine IBAs compared to the total area in which the fishery operates. Our results support the designation of the proposed MPA network and offer additional guidance as to where decision-makers should act before further perturbation occurs in the Antarctic marine ecosystem. © Copyright © 2021 Handley, Rouyer, Pearmain, Warwick-Evans, Teschke, Hinke, Lynch, Emmerson, Southwell, Griffith, Cárdenas, Franco, Trathan and Dias.

ABSTRACT: Mixed-species colonies occur frequently, especially among seabirds, and may provide mutual benefits among associated species including antipredator advantages. The “protector” species in such associations may provide early warning signals or by aggressively defending their own nests, may expel predators from the area. We explored costs and benefits to Rockhopper Penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome) in relation to offspring production in both monospecific colonies and those mixed with Imperial Cormorants (Phalacrocorax atriceps) at Saunders Island (Falkland Islands), emphasizing differences in predation pressure. We considered behavioral responses of chicks (in crèches), as well as differences in their nutritional condition, morphometric measurements, and survival compared among different breeding colonies. Our study revealed a paradox: High-quality adult penguins, those arriving early and occupying lower-elevation sites closer to the coast, produced better-nourished chicks earlier in the season. However, they averaged half the number of chicks fledged, compared to breeders that arrived later in the season. Late breeders were forced by unavailability of optimal habitat to nest in more elevated areas, forming mixed colonies with cormorants, which, in turn, provided them with protection from nest predators. This study provides an example of the role of luck in nature, and how it may compensate for differences in individual fitness. © 2020 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Penguins are considered among the most popular animals for zoo and aquarium visitors to observe. Swimming is considered a desirable activity, both for the visitor experience and the welfare of the penguins. However, little is known about the amount of time exhibited penguins spend swimming, or how such swimming is related to regular feeding events. We examined the effects of introducing live prey in the form of trout on 22 Humboldt penguins living at the Woodland Park Zoo. Of primary interest was how the live feeds changed (1) daily and hourly swimming activity, and (2) variability in enclosure use. We hypothesized that the live feedings would increase swimming activity prior to and during the delivery of the live trout, as well as create an overall increase in total swimming activity for live feed days compared to non-live feed days. We also predicted that the penguins would be more likely to use the entire exhibit around these live feeds, since they are likely to chase fish throughout the exhibit. Penguins did show an increase in swimming activity in the hour prior to and during the live feed, with a small decrease in swimming activity following the live feed when compared to non-live feed days. There was also a more than 30% increase in the total swimming activity for live feed days when compared to all other non-live feed days. In addition, a single measure of variability in enclosure use (entropy) showed greater overall enclosure use for the live feed days compared to the non-live feed days. These results demonstrate that live fish can be a useful way of enriching the behavioural welfare of Humboldt penguins. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Here, we report on two tarsometatarsi assignable to relatively small-sized Eocene Antarctic penguins, housed in the palaeozoological collections of Naturhistoriska riksmuseet, Stockholm. The Priabonian fossils were collected by museum staff during two joined Argentinean and Swedish expeditions from the Submeseta Formation on Seymour Island, Antarctic Peninsula. One specimen represents a new early sphenisciform, Marambiornopsis sobrali gen. et sp. nov., the sixth small-sized tarsometatarsus-based penguin species known from the Antarctic Eocene. Micro-CT scanning revealed the presence of quite large and essentially empty metatarsal medullary cavities. The second fossil can unequivocally be assigned to Mesetaornis polaris. The specimen represents only the second record of this species and supposedly a relatively young bird. Micro-CT scanning showed that in M. polaris the metatarsal medullary cavities are less developed than in M. sobrali–the cortical and trabecular bone tissues left rather little room for significant hollow spaces. Both specimens also differ in overall density of their trabecular networks.Genus name: LSIDurn:lsid:zoobank.org:act:604F02AA-DD0C-4789-B4D6-85EA68A39A68 Species name: LSIDurn:lsid:zoobank.org:act:477F0FC5-D07B-4A92-97FD-3C4805BAF503. © 2021 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Many types of animal tissues are increasingly being used for stable isotope analysis, with their application dependent on the time frame they reflect and their availability for collection. Here, we investigated the isotopic values (δ13C and δ15N) of four tissues (feather, skin, toenail, and bone) collected from fledgling-period chick carcasses of three species of pygoscelid penguins to compare the variability and accuracy of the data among tissues. Samples were collected at 25 de Mayo/King George Island during the 2017/18 austral summer. Chick carcasses are commonly found at active penguin colonies, and “opportunistic sampling” can easily be performed without disturbing nesting penguins. A total of 25–36 carcasses per species were sampled at active colonies of Adélie Pygoscelis adeliae, Gentoo P. papua, and Chinstrap P. antarcticus penguins. A linear mixed model showed that δ13C values varied significantly between tissues, presumably due to tissue-specific isotopic discrimination. In contrast, the only tissue with significantly different δ15N values was toenail. Stable isotope data revealed dietary differences among species, with Gentoo Penguins having higher average isotopic values in tissues compared to Adélie and Chinstrap penguins. In addition, Chinstrap Penguins showed a consistent, but not statistically significant, trend in having higher δ13C values compared to Adélie Penguins. Gentoo Penguins displayed the highest isotopic variability of any species for all tissues. Isotopic composition was most variable in skin in all three species, making skin the least reliable tissue for isotope analysis, whereas isotopic values were least variable in toenails. Comparison of isotopic values between two bones (tibiotarsus and coracoid) showed no significant differences in isotopic values, indicating that when the same bone is not available for sampling from carcasses, sampling of any major skeletal element is likely to provide a meaningful comparison. These results allow for more informed opportunistic sampling to accurately estimate and compare penguin diet among species and between ancient and active colonies. © 2021, Marine Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: Penguins are popular tourist attractions, but where do people go to see them in the wild? Consulting a wide range of sources, we identified 295 breeding colonies and sites that are advertised as places to visit penguins. Antarctica had the greatest number of sites (n = 123), and Namibia the fewest (n = 1). Population estimates for the number of breeding pairs were available for over 90% of sites, but both the recentness and reliability of the estimates were highly variable. The number of annual visitors was tracked at only 50% of sites. The number of breeding pairs a destination had did not predict its visitors per year. The closer a site was to a city with an airport, the more visitors it received. Excluding sites in Antarctica and the Galápagos, where visits are more tightly regulated and more boat-based, less than half of sites had specific management plans. Entrance fees ranged from zero to several thousand U.S. dollars, but fees rarely were used to support conservation or research. In sum, penguin-related tourism operates in a black box, with substantial information gaps. Tourism to penguin colonies can be sustainable, but this requires 1) regulations and enforcement to keep penguins safe from excessive disturbance; and 2) funds to benefit the penguins, their ocean and coastal habitats, research, and the local community. Transparency in the number of visitors and how the revenue their visits generate is used is essential to assess the sustainability of tourism at any colony. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Age-related variation in reproductive performance in long-lived iteroparous vertebrate species is common, with performance being influenced by within-individual processes, such as improvement and senescence, in combination with among-individual processes, such as selective appearance and disappearance. Few studies of age-related reproductive performance have compared the role of these drivers within a metapopulation, subject to varying degrees of resource competition. We accounted for within- and among-individual changes among known-aged Adélie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae during 17 years (1997–2013), at three clustered colonies of disparate size, to understand patterns in age-related reproductive success during early and late adulthood. Age at first reproduction (AFR) was lowest, and number of breeding attempts highest, at the largest colony. Regardless of AFR, success improved with early post-recruitment experience. For both oldest and youngest recruitment groups, peak performance occurred at the end of their reproductive life span indicating a possible cost of reproduction. Intermediate recruitment groups reached peak performance in their mid-reproductive life span and with intermediate breeding experience, before decreasing. Breeding success was lowest for the initial breeding attempt regardless of AFR, but we observed subsequent variation relative to recruitment age. Gaining experience by delaying recruitment positively influenced reproductive performance early in the reproductive life span and was most evident for the youngest breeders. Oldest recruits had the highest initial and peak breeding success. Differences in AFR resulted in trade-offs in reproductive life span or timing of senescence but not in the overall number of breeding attempts. Patterns differed as a function of colony size, and thus competition for resources. Early life improvement in performance at the larger colonies was primarily due to within-individual factors and at the largest colony, AFR. Regardless of colony size late-life performance was positively related to the age at last reproduction, indicating selective disappearance of lower performing individuals. These results highlight that different life-history strategies were equally successful, indicating that individuals can overcome potential trade-offs associated with early- and late-life performance. These results have important implications for understanding the evolution of life-history strategies responsible for driving population change. © 2021 British Ecological Society

ABSTRACT: Migratory seabirds experience varying levels of both protection and threats as they travel across marine regions and countries’ jurisdictions. Studying their seasonal distribution provides insights into the full range of exploited habitats and potential gaps in conservation policy existing in the visited areas. Here we used light-based geolocation to examine the seasonal at-sea distribution of an endemic seabird from New Zealand, the Fiordland Penguin Eudyptes pachyrhynchus, with respect to Economic Exclusive Zones (EEZs). We show that the five birds successfully tracked from the remote Open Bay Islands exploited vast areas in the South Pacific Ocean and used contrasted habitats across seasons. During extensive periods at-sea before and after moulting, Fiordland Penguins reached cold oceanic waters across the Subantarctic Front (Subantarctic and Polar Frontal zones, 2–10 °C), ranging 1500–2000 km in the southwest of their colony. Across both these trips, all birds distributed extensively outside New Zealand’s EEZ (nearly 50% of time), into areas beyond national jurisdiction providing little tangible protection, and some temporarily entered Australia’s EEZ. This contrasted with previous results from the breeding season, when the Penguins distributed exclusively within New Zealand’s EEZ, in relatively shallow and warm (c. 12–20 °C) waters north of the Southern Subtropical Front. Annually, the tracked Penguins spent 102 days outside New Zealand waters, of which 79 days in the high seas. Our results provide new perspectives on pertinent conservation strategies for migratory “endemic” Penguins. Year-round approach on the at-sea ecology of species seems fundamental for adequate management of threatened marine biodiversity. © 2020, Deutsche Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.

ABSTRACT: Population connectivity is driven by individual dispersal potential and modulated by natal philopatry. In seabirds, high vagility facilitates dispersal yet philopatry is also common, with foraging area overlap often correlated with population connectivity. We assess the interplay between these processes by studying past and current connectivity and foraging niche overlap among southern rockhopper penguin colonies of the coast of southern South America using genomic and stable isotope analyses. We found two distinct genetic clusters and detected low admixture between northern and southern colonies. Stable isotope analysis indicated niche variability between colonies, with Malvinas/Falklands colonies encompassing the species entire isotopic foraging niche, while the remaining colonies had smaller, nonoverlapping niches. A recently founded colony in continental Patagonia differed in isotopic niche width and position with Malvinas/Falklands colonies, its genetically identified founder population, suggesting the exploitation of novel foraging areas and/or prey items. Additionally, dispersing individuals found dead across the Patagonian shore in an unusual mortality event were also assigned to the northern cluster, suggesting northern individuals reach southern localities, but do not breed in these colonies. Facilitated by variability in foraging strategies, and especially during unfavorable conditions, the number of dispersing individuals may increase and enhance the probability of founding new colonies. Metapopulation demographic dynamics in seabirds should account for interannual variability in dispersal behavior and pay special attention to extreme climatic events, classically related to negative effects on population trends. © 2020 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Sex ratios are commonly skewed and variable in wild populations, but few studies track temporal trends in this demographic parameter. We examined variation in the operational sex ratio at two protected and declining breeding colonies of Magellanic Penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) in Chubut, Argentina. Penguins from the two colonies, separated by 105 km, migrate north in the non-breeding season and have overlapping distributions at sea. Conditions during the non-breeding season can impact long-term trends in operational sex ratio (i.e., through sex-specific survival) and interannual variation in operational sex ratio (i.e., through sex-specific breeding decisions). We found an increasingly male-biased operational sex ratio at the two disparate colonies of Magellanic Penguins, which may contribute to continued population decline. We also found that the two colonies showed synchronous interannual variation in operational sex ratio, driven by variation in the number of females present each year. This pattern may be linked to sex-specific overwintering effects that cause females to skip breeding, i.e., to remain at sea rather than returning to the colony to breed, more often than males. Contrary to our predictions, colony-wide reproductive success was not lower in years with a more male-biased operational sex ratio. We did find that males showed more evidence of fighting and were less likely to pair when the operational sex ratio was more male biased. Our results highlight an indirect mechanism through which variation in the operational sex ratio can influence populations, through a higher incidence of fighting among the less abundant sex. Because biased sex ratios can reduce the size of the breeding population and influence rates of conflict, tracking operational sex ratio is critical for conservation. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America

ABSTRACT: For 11 breeding seasons, a colony of little penguins (Eudyptula minor) was monitored at South Bay, Kaikoura. The 106 breeding attempts from 86 pairings consisted of 68 single clutches, eight attempts made up four replacement clutches (an unsuccessful original clutch followed by a second clutch by a pair in one season), 26 attempts consisting of 13 double broods (a successful original clutch followed by a second clutch by a pair in one season), and one complex triple brood (three successful attempts by a penguin in one season, the triple brood, plus another successful attempt by its first mate after separation). The earliest laying date was 18 April for multiple brooders and 12 August for single clutch pairs. Single clutch pairs raised a mean of 1.42 fledglings/clutch. Four pairs with first clutch failures laid replacement clutches; one was successful. Seven of the 13 pairs of double brooders successfully raised the second clutch; the productivity of the 13 pairs was 2.69 fledglings/pair. The first record of a successful triple brood by little penguins was complex in that the female separated from her mate after the first brood chicks fledged, and then completed her second and third broods with a different male. Her original mate also produced a further brood with another female to complete his double brood. These four clutches laid eight eggs of which seven hatched and six chicks fledged. This may also be the first reported multiple brood with a change of mate after a successful first brood. On a colony-wide basis productivity per season was 2.36 eggs/pair, 1.80 chicks/pair, and 1.66 fledglings/pair. Previous research indicated Kaikoura birds belonged to the New Zealand Only (NZO) clade of little penguins. As double brooding and rafting are traits of the Australia and south east New Zealand (ASENZ) clade only, this classification is now questionable suggesting a mix of both clades and/or hybrids. © 2019 The Ornithological Society of New Zealand Inc.

ABSTRACT: Context: Tourism operations that provide the opportunity for wildlife viewing can support conservation management through public education, habitat protection, population management, research activities and revenue generation. However, alongside these potential benefits there can be negative effects on the species that include the possibility of reduced breeding success, survival and, subsequently, population growth. Aim: We sought to establish whether a tourism operation affected little penguins Eudyptula minor by comparing reproductive and survival parameters of two managed populations in Oamaru, New Zealand. One population was the focus of a tourism operation, whereas the other (located nearby) did not provide any public access. The tourism operation implemented strategies to reduce human disturbance, including the reduction of noise, light and movement from visitors during viewing, and by ensuring that visitors were restricted to designated viewing areas. Methods: Nesting boxes were installed at both colonies that facilitated weekly monitoring of the populations. The monitoring program (1993-2017) included weekly checks of every nesting box in the colony for the presence of eggs, chicks and adults. Chicks were weighed before fledging, and both fledglings and breeding adults were individually marked. Key results: Lay dates, breeding success, chick fledge mass and survival rates were not measurably different between the two populations, indicating that there was little evidence of negative effects on the penguins at the tourist site. Conclusions: The slight differences observed between the colonies during the time series were attributed to environmental damage sustained at the non-tourist site and a difference in the proportion of un-monitored nest sites available to the penguins when the study was initiated. Implications: Notwithstanding the present findings, long-term and consistent monitoring of wildlife populations facing increasing pressure from tourism is essential to ensure effects are detected and that management procedures implemented to reduce potential effects. © 2020 CSIRO.

ABSTRACT: We discuss the potential use of the mandibulosphenoidal joint structures to interpret the diet and trophic habits of penguins, albatrosses, and petrels. For this purpose, several species of these phylogenetically related groups, whose diet and feeding strategies are already known, were selected. After comparisons, we conclude that: 1 - the efficiency of the quadrate-articular primary articulation is decisive for the development of the secondary mandibulosphenoidal joint, 2 - the morphology of the mandibulosphenoidal joint is closely related to the trophic habits of specialist birds, and 3 - the use of the mandibulosphenoidal joint structures to infer dietary preferences has a limited use. © 2020 Senckenbergische Naturforschende Gesellschaft.

ABSTRACT: While persistent organic pollutant (POP) contamination within Antarctica is largely caused by long-range atmospheric transport (LRAT), Antarctic research bases have been shown to be local sources of POPs such as brominated flame retardants (BFRs). This study compared concentrations of seven polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) congeners and five novel flame retardants (NBFRs) found in Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) colony soils near the Australian research stations, Mawson and Davis, to assess the stations as local sources of these contaminants and provide a much needed baseline for contamination of BFRs in East Antarctica. Soil samples (n = 46) were collected from Adélie colonies at close proximity to the research stations as well as further afield during the 2016-17 austral summer. Samples were analysed using selective pressurised liquid extraction (S-PLE) and gas chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). PBDEs (BDE-28, -47, -99, -100, -153, -154 and -183) were detected in 45/46 samples with ∑7PBDE concentrations ranging from <0.01 to 1.63 ng/g dry weight (dw) and NBFRs (2,3,4,5,6-pentabromotoluene (PBT), 2,3,4,5,6-pentabromoethylbenzene (PBEB), hexabromobenzene (HBB), 2-ethylhexyl-2,3,4,5-tetrabromobenzoate (EH-TBB) and bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy) ethane (BTBPE)) detected in 20/46 samples, with a range of ∑5NBFR from not detected (ND) to 0.16 ng/g dw. Soils taken from around the Davis and Mawson research stations were more highly contaminated (n = 10) than penguin colonies (n = 27) and control areas not affiliated with breeding seabirds (n = 8). The most common congener detected was BDE-99, reflecting inputs from LRAT. However, the congener profiles of station soils supported the hypothesis that research stations are a local source of PBDEs to the Antarctic environment. In addition, the NBFR pentabromoethylbenzene (PBEB) was quantified for the first time in Antarctic soils, providing essential information for baseline contamination within the region and highlighting the need for ongoing monitoring as global regulations for the use of BFRs continuously change. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Background: The majority of penguins (Sphenisciformes) have evolved in areas with weak or absent transmission of haemosporidian parasites and are usually naïve to avian haemosporidian infections. Plasmodium parasites are transmitted by mosquitoes, and lethal avian malaria has been often reported in captive penguins in many countries. The related haemosporidian parasites belonging to Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon have also been detected in penguins but less often than Plasmodium infections. The majority of Haemoproteus infection reports in penguins are based solely on PCR-based diagnostics. It remains unclear if haemoproteids can complete their life-cycle and produce infective stages (gametocytes) in penguins or whether these infections are abortive in penguins, and thus dead ends for transmission. In other words, it remains unknown if penguins are competent hosts for Haemoproteus parasites, which cause disease in non-adapted birds. Methods: Two captive African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) and two Magellanic penguins (S. magellanicus) were found to be positive for Haemoproteus infection in two open-air aquariums in Japan, and the parasites were investigated using both PCR-based testing and microscopical examination of blood films. Samples from a black-tailed gull (Larus crassirostris) and previously tested gulls were used for comparison. Results: The lineage hSPMAG12 was detected, and gametocytes of Haemoproteus sp. were seen in the examined penguins and gull. Observed gametocytes were indistinguishable from those of Haemoproteus larae, which naturally parasitize birds of the genus Larus (Laridae). The detected sequence information and Bayesian phylogenetic analysis supported this conclusion. Additionally, morphologically similar gametocytes and closely related DNA sequences were also found in other gull species in Japan. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial cytb sequences placed the lineage hSPMAG12 of H. larae within the clade of avian haemoproteids which belong to the subgenus Parahaemoproteus, indicating that Culicoides biting midges likely transmit the parasites between penguins and gulls. Conclusions: This study shows that some species of Haemoproteus parasites complete their development and produce gametocytes in penguins, which may be source of infection for biting midges transmitting haemoproteosis. To prevent haemosporidiosis in zoos, we call for control not only of mosquitoes, but also biting midges.[Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2020 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to determine the layer thickness and the pearl quality of winged pearl oyster Pteria penguin under different culture duration in Palabusa waters, Buton Strait, Southeast Sulawesi. A total of 120 pearl oysters with dorso-ventral height of 95.70±9.42 mm, width of 115.45±10.05 mm width, thickness of 31.92±3.15 mm, and weight of 105.71±17.21 g were implanted with a hemispherical plastic nuclei (12 mm diameter and 10 mm height) in the left valve by using a glue without anaeshetized and then cultivated for 6 months. The pearls were harvested at different culture duration after implantation; 90 days (treatment A), 120 days (treatment B), 150 days (treatment C) and 180 days (treatment D). The thickest top layer was obtained in the treatment D (0.264±0.013 mm) while the thinnest top layer was obtained in the treatment A (0.156±0.011 mm). The thickest base layer was also obtained in the treatment D (0.543±0.011 mm) and the thinnest base layers was obtained in treatment A (0.199±0.015 mm). The highest quality of pearls at AAA grade was obtained from the treatment D (28.6%), followed by treatment C (13.0%), treatment B (4.5%), and treatment A (0%). The lowest grade, non commercial grade (NC), was highest in treatment A of 37.0% followed by treatments B 18.2% and treatment C of 17.4%, and the lowest in treatment A by 4.8%. This study suggests that the culture duration of 6 months increases the thickness and quality of winged pearl oyster P. penguin cultured in the Palabusa waters. © 2020, BIOFLUX SRL.

ABSTRACT: Recent studies have shown that many species of apparently monogamous birds engage in extra-pair copulation (EPC). Penguins have intense shared parental care for their young, and thus have been considered monogamous. The present study aimed to assess the reproductive system of the gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) on Elephant Island, Antarctica, by evaluating extra-pair paternity (EPP) and intraspecific brood parasitism (IBP). Our data revealed high rates of EPC, with approximately 48.75% of chicks originating from EPP, corresponding to 72.5% of nests. IBP was found for ~ 17% of the gentoo penguin nests, a behavior previously recorded only for Magellanic penguins (~ 6%). The reasons for these behaviors are not clear, as increased genetic diversity or sex bias of offspring was not found. Thus, social and ecological aspects could be more important for determining the costs and benefits of EPP. Other genetic and ecological aspects must be investigated in future studies, such as genetic compatibility of the immune system or fluctuations of the EPP rate due to environmental conditions. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Emperor penguins require stable fast ice, sea ice anchored to land or ice shelves, on which to lay eggs and raise chicks. As the climate warms, changes in sea ice are expected to lead to substantial declines at many emperor penguin colonies. The most southerly colonies have been predicted to remain buffered from the direct impacts of warming for much longer. Here, we report on the unusually early breakup of fast ice at one of the two southernmost emperor penguin colonies, Cape Crozier (77.5°S), in 2018, an event that may have resulted in a substantial loss of chicks from the colony. Fast ice dynamics can be highly variable and dependent on local conditions, but earlier fast ice breakup, influenced by increasing wind speed, as well as higher surface air temperatures, is a likely outcome of climate change. What we observed at Cape Crozier in 2018 highlights the vulnerability of this species to untimely storm events and could be an early sign that even this high-latitude colony is not immune to the effects of warming. Long-term monitoring will be key to understanding this species' response to climate change and altered sea ice dynamics. © Copyright Antarctic Science Ltd 2020.

ABSTRACT: Despite its isolation and extreme climate, Antarctica is home to diverse fauna and associated microorganisms. It has been proposed that the most iconic Antarctic animal, the penguin, experiences low pathogen pressure, accounting for their disease susceptibility in foreign environments. There is, however, a limited understanding of virome diversity in Antarctic species, the extent of in situ virus evolution, or how it relates to that in other geographic regions. To assess whether penguins have limited microbial diversity we determined the RNA viromes of three species of penguins and their ticks sampled on the Antarctic peninsula. Using total RNA sequencing we identified 107 viral species, comprising likely penguin associated viruses (n = 13), penguin diet and microbiome associated viruses (n = 82), and tick viruses (n = 8), two of which may have the potential to infect penguins. Notably, the level of virome diversity revealed in penguins is comparable to that seen in Australian waterbirds, including many of the same viral families. These data run counter to the idea that penguins are subject to lower pathogen pressure. The repeated detection of specific viruses in Antarctic penguins also suggests that rather than being simply spill-over hosts, these animals may act as key virus reservoirs. © 2020, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Clinical parameters of African penguins Spheniscus demersus have been recorded mostly from birds admitted to rehabilitation centres and are typically presented as mean values across a region. It is uncertain whether these values are representative of wild penguins and whether they are influenced by parasite infestations. We assessed general clinical parameters from 793 African penguins (210 adults and 583 chicks) at five South African colonies, in 2016 and 2017, and then established the relationship between those values and parasite infestations. Penguins at Dassen Island had indications of a different health status: lower body condition and total plasma protein, and higher haematocrit and ectoparasite richness. Overall, haematocrit values were lower for the mainland colonies than for the island colonies. All clinical parameters were significantly lower in spring than in autumn/winter. Both ectoparasite and haemoparasite taxon richness were negatively related to haematocrit values, while helminth taxon richness was positively related to body mass and haematocrit. At the Stony Point colony, tick abundance and ectoparasite and haemoparasite taxon richness were associated with lower haematocrit in adults and chicks. This study highlights intercolony variations in the health status of African penguins and potential factors (such as parasite infestations and/or food-resource accessibility) that might affect specific colonies, thereby helping to focus conservation efforts. © 2020 NISC (Pty) Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus), which have declined over the past two decades, are considered near threatened by the IUCN Red List. Virus research in this migratory population identified a diversity of virus pathogens within the free-living reproductive active population in Argentina and in the beached rescued population along the Brazilian Coast. Rehabilitating and releasing seabirds are important tools to minimize anthropogenic impacts in the sustainability of threatened species. Infectious diseases can be serious threats for the success of such initiatives, especially since knowledge on pathogens affecting those species in the wild is usually scarce. Avipoxvirus infection causing local cutaneous lesions was reported by Kane et al., (2012) in the Argentinian breeding colonies. A different avipoxvirus causing cutaneous and diphtheritic lesions in the oesophagus and bronchioli was reported by Niemeyer et al., (2013) in penguins housed in outdoor enclosures in a Rehabilitation Centre located at Florianópolis, Santa Catarina State, Brazil. By that time, the authors suspected of a spillover effect based on the divergence between the Brazilian penguinpoxvirus (Canarypox clade) and the avipoxvirus (Folwpox clade) described in the Argentinian breeding colonies. The Rehabilitation Centre kept monitoring and diagnosing based on clinical signs, histopathology, the use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing. The knowledge regarding the virus strain diversity was very important to avoid the introduction of a novel virus into the wild population by releasing rehabilitated infected birds. In 2011, a novel herpesvirus was identified in rescued oiled penguins that died within a respiratory outbreak at a Rehabilitation Centre located in the south of the Brazilian Coast (Niemeyer C., 2014). Sampling apparently healthy and reproductive active Magellanic penguins in Argentinian Patagonia, Niemeyer, C. (2014) identified a different herpesvirus. Meanwhile, different strains of coronavirus and herpesvirus were identified in asymptomatic rescued Magellanic penguins along the Brazilian Coast’s beaches. PCR identification and partial virus sequencing allow us to identify pathogens related to mortality and morbidity. The aim of this chapter was to contribute to the knowledge and identification of viruses capable of infecting both free-living apparently healthy penguins, and the pathogens that may be related to the release of rehabilitated penguins and the implication of these agents in the conservation of species. The knowledge about the occurrence of virus infection in the species is crucial to determine conservation policies and management of a population that deal with different threats across the oceans. © 2020 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Advances in high throughput genomic approaches are enabling the accurate appraisal of movements of diverse species, previously considered intractable. The impact of long-distance dispersal and distribution changes on species interactions (such as host-parasite interactions) is of particular importance as attempts are made to project how ecosystems will shift under environmental change. The sub-Antarctic region, comprising isolated islands separated by hundreds to thousands of kilometres of open ocean, presents an ideal model system for studying long-distance dispersal, distribution, and ecosystem change. Here we used genomic methods to determine the extent of movement of penguin ticks (Ixodes uriae) among different host species, and among penguin colonies at small (within an island) and large (among islands separated by >6000 km) scales, in the sub-Antarctic region. Our results suggest that I. uriae ticks may be readily shared between distantly related penguin species with similar phenology, but indicate that-as inferred by previous research-ticks are less likely to be shared between flighted and non-flighted seabirds. We also find evidence for small-scale movements of penguin ticks with their hosts, but no evidence for movements between islands separated by thousands of kilometers of open ocean. These inferred limitations to penguin tick movement could be the result of restricted host movements or the inability of penguin ticks to survive extended trips at sea. Our findings help elucidate parasite-host dynamics, with implications for host health and persistence in a region experiencing rapid environmental change. © the authors.

ABSTRACT: The ecological drivers underlying breeding performance are expected to differ across the geographical range of seabird species, but few studies have compared trade-offs between colonies with different local conditions. During chick-rearing (2000-01), we compared the foraging trips, diet and breeding parameters of two Adélie penguin colonies in the Ross Sea, at Edmonson Point (EdPo; ~2000 breeding pairs) and Inexpressible Island (InIs; ~24 000 breeding pairs). Penguins from InIs travelled farther and performed longer feeding trips. The quantity of food brought to the nest was the same for the two colonies, but penguins from InIs brought more fish and less krill. Eggs hatched earlier at EdPo. Breeding success did not differ, but chick weight during hatching-fledging was greater at InIs. Despite worse weather conditions at InIs, the larger proportion of high-energy food brought by penguins from InIs (i.e. fish) may explain their offspring's better performance. In addition, the persistence of fast ice at EdPo may have led to greater energy expenditure of breeding individuals, possibly reducing chick growth. The greater intraspecific competition expected at InIs may have been reduced by longer foraging trips and/or counteracted by the more nutritious diet. Our findings reveal complex trade-offs between foraging effort and environmental constraints in determining the breeding performance of Adélie penguins. © Copyright Antarctic Science Ltd 2020.

ABSTRACT: A common goal of captive animal institutions is to create environments that allow for the most naturalistic behavior from their animals. Behavioral data is often used as a measure of how an animal is thriving in its current environment. Obtaining this data can be very difficult and time-consuming. New technological advances, such as radio frequency identification (RFID) technology, may allow for data collection to be automated. RFID tags placed on the wingband of 16 little blue penguins housed at the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden, as well as 8 antennae placed in their habitat, continuously recorded individual penguin swimming behavior. The continuous data collected via the RFID system reveals individual patterns of swimming behavior among indoor and outdoor pool areas, as well as relationships between swimming and water temperature, and temporal factors. Additionally, the effectiveness of an enrichment item meant to increase swimming time is evaluated using the RFID system. The presence of the RFID system allows for continuous, reliable data collection that can provide valuable insight regarding the quantifiable relationship between little blue behavior, environment, and overall health. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Information compression is a general principle of human language: the most frequent words are shorter in length (Zipf’s Law of Brevity) and the duration of constituents decreases as the size of the linguistic construct increases (Menzerath–Altmann Law). Vocal sequences of non-human primates have been shown to conform to both these laws, suggesting information compression might be a more general principle. Here, we investigated whether display songs of the African penguin, which mediate recognition, intersexual mate choice and territorial defence, conform with these laws. Display songs are long, loud sequences combining three types of syllables. We found that the shortest type of syllable was the most frequent (with the shortest syllable being repeated stereotypically, potentially favouring signal redundancy in crowded environments). We also found that the average duration of the song’s constituents was negatively correlated with the size of the song (a consequence of increasing the relative number of the shortest syllable type, rather than reducing the duration across all syllable types, thus preserving the communication of size-related information in the duration of the longest syllable type). Our results provide the first evidence for conformity to Zipf’s and Menzerath–Altmann Laws in the vocal sequences of a non-primate species, indicating that these laws can coexist with selection pressures specific to the species’ ecology. © 2020 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: One slightly beige-white pigmented, Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped bacterium, strain I-STPP5bT, was isolated from the trachea of a Gentoo penguin chick individual (Pygoscelin papua) investigated in Fildes Bay, Chilean Antarctic (62° 12′ S, 58° 57′ W). I-STPP5bT consists of a 3.4 Mb chromosome with a DNA G+C content of 44.4 mol%. Of the 3056 predicted genes, 1206 were annotated as hypothetical proteins and 51 were tRNAs. Phylogenetic analysis based on nearly full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the isolate shared a 16S rRNA gene sequence identity to the type strains of Psychrobacter phenylpyruvicus (98.8%), Psychrobacter arenosus and Psychrobacter pasteurii (both 98.3%), Psychrobacter piechaudii (98.2%) and Psychrobacter sanguinis (98.1%), but 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities to all other Psychrobacter species were ≤98.0%. Partial gyrB nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarities among strain STPP5bT and the next related type strains were all below 81.8 and 92.9%, respectively. DNA–DNA hybridisation (DDH) with P. phenylpyruvicus LMG 5372T, P. arenosus DSM 15389T and P. sanguinis DSM 23635T also showed low values (all below 30%). The main cellular fatty acids of the strain were C18:1 ω9c and C16:1 ω7c and/or C16:1 ω6c. Based on phylogenetic, chemotaxonomic, genomic and phenotypic analyses we propose a new species of the genus Psychrobacter, with the name Psychrobacter pygoscelis sp. nov. and strain I-STPP5bT (=CIP 111410T= CCM 8799T=LMG 30301T) as type strain. © 2020 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Penguins are important top consumers in marine food webs and are one of the most threatened bird families, especially by climate change and food web alterations by marine fisheries. Yet, long-term population trends are lacking or are uncertain for many populations. Seven species of penguins breeding at the French Southern Territories in the southern Indian Ocean on the Crozet, Kerguelen, Saint-Paul–Amsterdam archipelagos and in Terre Adélie/Adelie Land, Antarctica are monitored regularly. This monitoring started in the early 1950s and most populations have been surveyed during the past four years, allowing assessments of population trends. King penguins increased at nearly all breeding sites within the Crozet and Kerguelen archipelagos. Emperor penguins have decreased at Terre Adélie/Adelie Land, with a partial recovery of the colony during the 2010s. Gentoo penguin populations at Crozet and Kerguelen are highly variable but stable. Adélie penguins have been increasing in Terre Adélie/Adelie Land. The trends in eastern rockhopper penguins vary between colonies and archipelagos. Northern rockhopper penguins have continuously decreased in numbers at Amsterdam Island, but appear to have increased at the nearby Saint-Paul Island. Macaroni penguins have first increased and then stabilized since the 2000s at Kerguelen and are stable at the Crozet Islands. Overall, most penguin populations breeding in the French Southern Territories increased or were stable over the past 30–60 years, with the exception of the northern rockhopper penguin, king and gentoo penguins on Crozet and the emperor penguin. The ecological reasons for these trends are poorly understood and require further investigation. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Microarray technology plays a significant role in cancer classification, where a large number of genes and samples are simultaneously analysed. For the efficient analysis of the microarray data, there is a great demand for the development of intelligent techniques. In this article, the authors propose a novel hybrid technique employing Fisher criterion, ReliefF, and extreme learning machine (ELM) based on the principle of chaotic emperor penguin optimisation algorithm (CEPO). EPO is a recently developed metaheuristic method. In the proposed method, initially, Fisher score and ReliefF are independently used as filters for relevant gene selection. Further, a novel population-based metaheuristic, namely, CEPO was proposed to pre-train the ELM by selecting the optimal input weights and hidden biases. The authors have successfully conducted experiments on seven well-known data sets. To evaluate the effectiveness, the proposed method is compared with original EPO, genetic algorithm, and particle swarm optimisation-based ELM along with other state-of-the-art techniques. The experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves better accuracy as compared to the state-of-the-art schemes. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F-measure. © 2020 Institution of Engineering and Technology. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Aspergillosis is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in captive penguins. Itraconazole, an antifungal drug, is commonly used to treat aspergillosis infections in avian species; however, commercially available human formulations are costly, and studies have shown the effectiveness of compounded formulations to be unreliable. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved a veterinary formulation of itraconazole, Itrafungol, for use in cats. This study provides preliminary results from limited sampling evaluating whether this veterinary formulation is suitable for future studies in the African penguin (Spheniscus demersus). A 20 mg/kg PO itraconazole dose was administered to 9 African penguins. Blood samples were taken over the course of 24 hours; each sample was collected from a different bird to minimize stress to the animals. Plasma was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography for concentrations of itraconazole. The drug was absorbed in all penguins, and plasma concentrations in 5 of 9 penguins (56%) were found to be greater than the established therapeutic dose of 1.0 μg/ mL. To our knowledge, this is the first study that has investigated a 20 mg/kg dose of itraconazole in a penguin species. The small sample size limits the conclusions that can be drawn from this preliminary study. Nonetheless, we demonstrate encouraging evidence that the FDA-approved formulation of oral itraconazole solution should be considered for future study as a cost-effective treatment for aspergillosis in African penguins and other avian species. © 2020 by the Association of Avian Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) have a widespread breeding distribution across the sub-Antarctic and Antarctic. Population trends vary across their range, with increases recorded in the Antarctic and Atlantic sectors of the Southern Ocean, while other sub-Antarctic populations are decreasing. Macquarie Island is the only breeding site for gentoo penguins in the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean and one of just two breeding sites within Australian territories. Eight island-wide censuses were undertaken between 1984 and 2017 to estimate the number of breeding pairs, with a follow-up chick census conducted in four years to calculate breeding success. The most recent census in 2017 recorded the fewest breeding pairs since counts began, with 2527 ± 66 gentoo pairs island wide. However, breeding success was the highest recorded at 0.99 chicks per nest. Trends in sub-populations around the island differed. However, island-wide breeding pairs have decreased by − 1.8 ± 0.4% per annum over the past 34 years, particularly driven by breeding colonies in the east-coast section of the island. This overall negative trend differs from the currently stable global trend, but mirrors what is happening in some other parts of the species’ sub-Antarctic range. We suggest based on a 50% decrease in breeding pairs over the species’ last three generations, and a lack of recent data from Heard Island, Australia’s other gentoo penguin breeding site, the species be considered for listing under the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Mabé pearl culture is an increasingly important rural livelihood in south Pacific countries as it offers a low-cost, low-tech alternative to round pearl culture. Mabé pearl production can be achieved by local people with appropriate training, and the products offer further livelihood opportunities through value-adding and local production of jewellery and handicraft items. The Kingdom of Tonga is unique among south Pacific pearl producing countries in focusing primarily on mabé pearl, not round pearl, culture using the winged pearl oyster, Pteria penguin. The Tongan mabé pearl sector has developed rapidly over recent years and is sustained by routine hatchery production of spat and recently improved pearl culture methods. This study determined establishment and operational costs of a subsistence-level mabé pearl farm in Tonga and developed an economic model to assess potential profitability of such operations. The representative mabé pearl farm modelled in this study targeted annual mabé pearl production from 100 oysters. Estimated capital cost (US dollars; USD) was USD 2,027 and major production costs were labour (29%), marketing (24%), and capital purchase and replacement (16%). Annual production of 231 saleable mabé pearls generated a net present value (NPV) of USD 107,101. The modified internal rate of return (MIRR) and benefit-cost ratio of the modelled mabé pearl farm were 20.46% and 4.86, respectively, with a payback period of 4 years. Given the average annual income in Tonga is USD 4,020, the modelled mabé pearl farm offers significant economic opportunity (USD 9,338 annual profit after all costs, including owner/operator wages) and supports additional socio-economic benefits for rural communities involved in downstream activities relating to handicraft and jewellery production, and tourism. The findings of this study assist stakeholder understanding of costs, risks and production levels required for profitable mabé pearl production. © 2020 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The plasticity in the trophic ecology, the breeding phenology, and the low nesting site fidelity would be the reasons why most of the gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) populations breeding in the western Antarctic Peninsula and islands of Scotia Arc remained stable or increasing, despite the changing environmental conditions. Regardless of the overall trend, recent studies revealed a decline in the abundance of some gentoo penguin populations at those regions. Therefore, it is highly valuable to update the population size of each colony in order to confirm the current trends of individual colonies and generate a comprehensive overview of the population status. We report the abundance and breeding performance of gentoo penguins at the Stranger Point/Cabo Funes colony from 2000/2001 to 2018/2019. During the last season, 5383 breeding pairs and 5545 chicks in crèche were counted. Despite there were considerable inter-annual fluctuations over the study period, the total number of gentoo penguin breeding pairs increased by 74.6% (+ 3.1% per annum), while the number of chicks crèched increased by 60.0% (+ 2.6% per annum). However, the index of breeding success remained relatively constant over time, varying between 0.74 and 1.23 chicks in crèche/breeding pairs. Gentoo penguins have life-history strategies that are advantageous to face the environmental variability, allowing the species to maintain their breeding performance stable over time and enhance their resilience, which can favour the population growth at Stranger Point. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: This study assessed the use of novel, locally made, protective culture cylinders as a means of improving pearl oyster Pteria penguin performance and standardizing culture methods used by mabé pearl farmers in Tonga. Cylinders were constructed from locally sourced wire mesh, for a cost of USD 12.1 each and were used to protect oysters grown on chaplets. Growth and survival of two age cohorts of oysters-"young" (0.7-y-old and 33.1 ± 0.7-mm dorsoventral height (DVH)) and "old" (2.7-y-old and 86.9 ± 0.8 mm DVH)-cultured using this system were determined every 3-5 wk over an 11-mo period. The DVH of "young" oysters increased by 74.6 mm, wet weight (WW) by 161.2 g, and shell thickness (ST) by 23.4 mm, whereas for "old" oysters, DVH, WW, and ST increased by 55.2 mm, 271.4 g, and 14.7 mm, respectively, over the same period. "Young" oysters held in culture cylinders reached the starting size of the "old" oyster cohort within seven months of growth and at less than half their age (1.2 and 2.7 y old, respectively). "Young" oysters held in culture cylinders also showed a 3-fold greater monthly growth rate than oysters cultured in trays (6.8 and 2.1 mm month-1, respectively). Survival of oysters in culture cylinders over the 11-mo culture period was 91.7% and 97.6% for "young" and "old" oysters, respectively, compared with 25% for oysters cultured in trays. The use of protective cylinders for P. penguin culture increases oyster survival and reduces the culture period required for P. penguin to reach minimum pearl production size by >50% relative to the current tray-based culture method, supporting improved mabé pearl farm profitability. © 2020 National Shellfisheries Association.

ABSTRACT: Twenty penguins, including the King penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus), Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua), and African penguin (Spheniscus demersus), housed at an aquarium in Hokkaido, Japan, underwent regular health screening via blood test, and five penguins with suspected aspergillosis were extracted. In cases 1 and 2, a thickened membrane and/or fluid level and/or calcification in the air sac were observed on both radiography and computed tomography (CT). These two penguins died after 19 and 43 days, respectively. At the time the radiographic changes were observed, the disease had likely progressed to a point at which it was too late for recovery. Aspergillus fumigatus infection was confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis in case 1. In case 3, infiltration in the pulmonary parenchyma was observed on CT, and the infiltration disappeared following oral administration of itraconazole as diagnostic therapy for 8 months. In case 4, defects in the pulmonary parenchyma were observed only on CT. These defects remained unchanged in size for 7 months despite the lack of any treatment, and were not considered clinically significant. However, the blood antigen level in case 5 was increased, both radiography and CT were unremarkable.

ABSTRACT: Because telomere length and dynamics relate to individual growth, reproductive investment and survival, telomeres have emerged as possible markers of individual quality. Here, we tested the hypothesis that, in species with parental care, parental telomere length can be a marker of parental quality that predicts offspring phenotype and survival. In king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus), we experimentally swapped the single egg of 66 breeding pairs just after egg laying to disentangle the contribution of prelaying parental quality (e.g., genetics, investment in the egg) and/or postlaying parental quality (e.g., incubation, postnatal feeding rate) on offspring growth, telomere length and survival. Parental quality was estimated through the joint effects of biological and foster parent telomere length on offspring traits, both soon after hatching (day 10) and at the end of the prewinter growth period (day 105). We expected that offspring traits would be mostly related to the telomere lengths (i.e., quality) of biological parents at day 10 and to the telomere lengths of foster parents at day 105. Results show that chick survival up to 10 days was negatively related to biological fathers’ telomere length, whereas survival up to 105 days was positively related to foster fathers’ telomere lengths. Chick growth was not related to either biological or foster parents’ telomere length. Chick telomere length was positively related to foster mothers’ telomere length at both 10 and 105 days. Overall, our study shows that, in a species with biparental care, parents’ telomere length is foremost a proxy of postlaying parental care quality, supporting the “telomere – parental quality hypothesis.”. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

ABSTRACT: Humeri have been useful bones in taxonomic determinations of extinct penguins. In the context of neontological taxonomic studies, however, their potential remains unsatisfactorily explored. Here, the variation of the overall closed-outline shape of 60 humeri, assignable to five genera of extant penguins, was investigated. A set of normalized outlines was quantified via elliptical Fourier analysis and subjected to linear discriminant analysis on principal component scores extracted from harmonic coefficients. These geometric representations proved to be a source of easily extractable genus-level taxonomic information. The constructed model provided meaningful discrimination between taxa: The first two linear discriminants captured almost 90% of between-group variance. A cross-validation method based on jackknifing yielded 93% correct identifications, and statistically significant differences between group centroids were also detected (multivariate analysis of variance, p < 0.05). Predictions of genus membership for the intentionally noisy test data (20 outlines) were accurate in 80% of cases. © 2020 P. Jadwiszczak.

ABSTRACT: Nineteen cases of physical deformities, colour aberrations, and unusual eggs were recorded in emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) and Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) from the Haswell archipelago in the Davis Sea, East Antarctica, during 1956-2016. Two very small eggs and one very large egg were recorded from emperor penguins, and two very small eggs from Adélie penguins. Physical deformities included beak deformities in two emperor penguin adults and two chicks, and two chicks had deformed spines. Colour aberrations included the ino mutation in a juvenile emperor penguin, and examples of dilution (two cases), progressive greying (two cases), and isabellinism in adult Adélie penguins. Feather-loss disorders were recorded in two downy emperor penguin chicks. Data on the occurrence of identified abnormalities and disorders are given. These cases provide a baseline for assessing changes in the frequency of physical abnormalities in these Antarctic penguin species. © 2019 The Ornithological Society of New Zealand Inc.

ABSTRACT: The salt gland is a well-developed osmoregulation organ in marine birds, and its relative size often reflects an individual’s feeding environment and osmoregulation capability. The development and functions of salt glands have been described for the Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae), but this information has been poorly documented in the other two pygoscelid species: gentoo (P. papua) and chinstrap penguins (P. antarcticus). To describe the growth-related changes in salt gland masses in relation to chick growth, we measured the wet mass of the salt glands collected from dead gentoo and chinstrap chicks during the early breeding period. The mass of the salt glands was linearly proportional to their body measurements, especially to body mass, in both species, and no significant difference was detected between the two species. Penguins are obligate marine dwellers throughout their life cycle, and the development of the salt gland in penguin chicks suggests that their ability to regulate dietary osmotic stress begins at an early stage of development after hatching. Furthermore, the linear relationship between the gland mass and body mass also suggests that the osmoregulation capability may continue to develop as penguin chicks grow. This descriptive note provides novel and quantitative information on the early developmental pattern of salt glands in gentoo and chinstrap penguins. © 2020 Y. Kim et al.

ABSTRACT: The ultrastructure of the nictitating membrane in the little penguin Eudyptula minor was studied using both scanning and transmission electron microscopy to improve our understanding of the function of ocular adnexa in diving birds. Following euthanasia, eyes were enucleated and immersion fixed in Karnovsky s fixative. The nictitating membrane and conjunctiva were embedded in araldite and semi- or ultra-thin sections were stained and photographed using compound and transmission electron microscopes, respectively. Ultrastructural dimensions were measured directly from digital photographs. Surface ultrastructure was examined using scanning electron microscopy. The transparent nictitating membrane consists of a dense stroma surrounded by epithelia on both the external (conjunctival) and internal (bulbar) surfaces. The conjunctival surface of the membrane near the leading edge is covered by microvilli, which transition to microplicae and finally to microridges in the periphery. Beneath the epithelial cells, there is a welldeveloped basement membrane. Scattered throughout this epithelium are a few goblet cells. The surface of the bulbar epithelium is covered by microvilli near the leading edge, which become denser peripherally. The stroma consists of densely-packed collagen fibrils, which are randomly oriented in bundles near the leading edge but are aligned in the same direction parallel with the epithelial and corneal surfaces and with the leading edge, when the membrane is extended. The ultrastructure of the nictitating membrane in the little penguin differs from other birds and its function is predominantly protective, while preserving clear vision in both water and air. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

ABSTRACT: The most western little penguin colony globally, and the most northern in Western Australia (WA) is found on Penguin Island, WA. The penguins use coastal bays that are also used extensively by recreational watercraft. These penguins have been found to either dive predominantly to shallow depths of 1–5 m or to depths >8 m. It is thus hypothesized that (a) both the shallow and deeper diving penguins can potentially be disturbed or injured by these watercraft but that the risk will differ between the two diving strategies, and (b) that risk of injury for both is greater during the summer and autumn, when people are more likely to use watercraft. This was tested by attaching data loggers to little penguins during chick rearing and by investigating necropsy records. Diving activity was studied for the very shallow and relatively deeper diving penguins separately, and we considered the penguins were vulnerable to interactions with watercraft when they were within the top 2 m of the water column or at the surface. Shallow-diving penguins executed >1,200 dives per day, 64% of dives occurred within the top 2 m, and they were vulnerable for approximately two-thirds of their time at sea. The deeper diving penguins executed fewer dives. Almost half of dives were to ≥10 m, yet they were vulnerable for almost one-third of their time at sea. Their post-dive recovery was also longer. Thus, the risk of interaction from watercraft differs depending on the diving behaviour. This study highlights the potential impact to little penguins throughout Australia and New Zealand. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Fossil penguins from late Neogene sediments are important for understanding the origins of modern penguins. Recent advances in penguin taxonomy and geometric morphometrics allow us to revisit previously described Pliocene fossils and potentially gain new insight into the evolutionary relationships of early crown penguin species. Here we re-evaluate the holotype of Tereingaornis moisleyi, a Pliocene fossil penguin discovered near Te Reinga Falls in the North Island of New Zealand. The holotype (hereafter referred to as the Te Reinga Falls fossil) does not possess any apomorphies that justify recognition as a distinct genus or species, and cannot be distinguished from the living crested penguins (Eudyptes spp.) or yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes) using discrete osteological characters or morphometric analysis. We propose that Tereingaornis moisleyi be considered a nomen dubium. The Te Reinga Falls fossil indicates that a penguin approximately the size of the extant tawaki (Fiordland crested penguin, Eudyptes pachyrhynchus) was present in New Zealand during the middle of the Pliocene (Waipipian Stage, 3.7–3.0 Ma), but a more complete specimen would be needed to confidently resolve the evolutionary relationships between this fossil and other penguins. © 2019 The Royal Society of New Zealand.

ABSTRACT: Although most dives of emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) are less than 100 m, penguins from the Cape Washington colony regularly perform deep dives > 400 m. To evaluate the significance and location of these deep dives of birds on foraging trips from Cape Washington, we report the satellite tracks of three birds. We also review the frequency of deep dives in the 35 of 42 birds that performed deep dives during seven research seasons over 22 years. Records included 83,314 dives, of which 1418 were > 400 m deep (deepest 552 m). Durations of these deep dives ranged from 7 to 13 min, up to more than twice the aerobic dive limit. Inter-deep-dive-intervals (IDDIs) between most deep dives were 10–20 min. The travel routes of satellite-tagged birds showed that all three spent time over Crary Bank, about 100 km from Cape Washington. Dives > 400 m only occurred over Crary Bank in the two satellite-tracked birds that were also equipped with dive recorders. The depths of the dives were consistent with the distribution of the most common, and energy-dense prey item found in their diet, Pleuragramma antarctica. We conclude that significant food resources are located over Crary Bank, accounting for the deep dives and success of birds from Cape Washington, the second largest, stable colony of emperor penguins known. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The Paris Agreement is a multinational initiative to combat climate change by keeping a global temperature increase in this century to 2°C above preindustrial levels while pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5°C. Until recently, ensembles of coupled climate simulations producing temporal dynamics of climate en route to stable global mean temperature at 1.5 and 2°C above preindustrial levels were not available. Hence, the few studies that have assessed the ecological impact of the Paris Agreement used ad-hoc approaches. The development of new specific mitigation climate simulations now provides an unprecedented opportunity to inform ecological impact assessments. Here we project the dynamics of all known emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) colonies under new climate change scenarios meeting the Paris Agreement objectives using a climate-dependent-metapopulation model. Our model includes various dispersal behaviors so that penguins could modulate climate effects through movement and habitat selection. Under business-as-usual greenhouse gas emissions, we show that 80% of the colonies are projected to be quasiextinct by 2100, thus the total abundance of emperor penguins is projected to decline by at least 81% relative to its initial size, regardless of dispersal abilities. In contrast, if the Paris Agreement objectives are met, viable emperor penguin refuges will exist in Antarctica, and only 19% and 31% colonies are projected to be quasiextinct by 2100 under the Paris 1.5 and 2 climate scenarios respectively. As a result, the global population is projected to decline by at least by 31% under Paris 1.5 and 44% under Paris 2. However, population growth rates stabilize in 2060 such that the global population will be only declining at 0.07% under Paris 1.5 and 0.34% under Paris 2, thereby halting the global population decline. Hence, global climate policy has a larger capacity to safeguard the future of emperor penguins than their intrinsic dispersal abilities. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

ABSTRACT: We sought to determine mercury (Hg) and other trace metal concentrations in Adélie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) breast feathers from the Ross Sea, Antarctica, and relate those concentrations to the trophic position and the habitats in which each of these species forage. Adélie penguin feathers from the southern Ross Sea colonies were higher in Hg than those sampled further north in the Ross Sea, potentially due to greater exposure to local sources, such as volcanism. Female Adélie penguins had lower feather total Hg concentrations than males. This may reflect female penguin's capacity to eliminate Hg through the egg development and laying process, or the larger and/or older prey items that male birds can consume, reflected by their higher trophic position. Emperor penguins have higher Hg concentrations than Adélie penguins which is also partially explained by Adélie penguins feeding at lower trophic levels than emperor penguins. © 2020 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Petrels and penguins form the clade Austrodyptornithes. The Add-my-Pet collection of referenced data and Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) parameters presently has 64 members of this clade. Adaptations to their wandering life style could now be studied; I here try to characterise this clade from an energy perspective. It turned out that petrels are in several respects extreme among birds, showing adaptations to life at low mean food levels. Penguins show the same tendency, but less extreme. Almost all petrel species show a weight-reduction well prior to fledging till the adult weight. This permanent weight reduction suggests that the mean adult feeding level is about 80% of the maximum one. This pattern is well-captured by the standard DEB model, in which (energy) reserve plays an important role. They also have relatively large eggs, and long incubation times and low reproduction rates. I argue that large eggs minimize the age at fledging, given that a particular maturity threshold needs to be reached for fledging. Austrodyptornithes have a high age at puberty, which, in combination with low reproduction rates, causes very low maximum population growth rates. The energy allocation to reproduction for petrels is typical among birds, so the low reproduction rates are the results of the large eggs. Another adaptation to low mean food levels is the large stomach/gut capacity, which appeared to be coupled to a high reserve capacity. This points to be an adaptation to a patchy occurrence of their food, probably in combination with spells of poor weather conditions for feeding. Petrels have a high supply stress and altriciality coefficient, compared to birds, while penguins are a very small altriciality coefficient. This reflects a very high maturity level at puberty for both taxa, in combination with high maturity level at birth for petrels and a typical one for penguins. They have a relatively long life span, compared to other birds, but not extreme. The relative egg size of penguins is typical for birds, to smaller than typical. Penguins combine small eggs with long foraging trips, while small young need frequent feeding. They evolved two adaptation for this: crop milk feeding and collecting lipid-rich food for their offspring. The energetic differences that have been found between petrels and penguins may directly relate to feeding in surface waters by petrels and in deeper waters by penguins; seasonal fluctuations in food density are more pronounced in surface waters. The higher clades Aequornithes and Aequorlitornithes are in many respect intermediate between Austrodyptornithes and other birds, demonstrating a clear taxonomic coherence in energy parameters. © 2020 The Author

ABSTRACT: The most plausible hypothesis for declining population trends of some marine top predators at the northern extent of their breeding ranges in the Southern Ocean is that it results from environmental change. Sub-Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus tropicalis are opportunistic and pelagic foragers that feed on a variety of fish, cephalopods, and crustaceans throughout their range. Penguins are also targeted, but to what extent remains uncertain, with only two records to date: Amsterdam Island, South Indian Ocean, where they kill and feed on northern rockhopper penguins Eudyptes moseleyi; and Gough Island, the southernmost island in the Tristan da Cunha archipelago, South Atlantic Ocean, where they are suspected to be significant predators of northern rockhopper penguins based on an unprecedented number of penguin carcasses (> 100) found floating at sea in 2011. We report the first documented records of such predations from the northern islands in the Tristan archipelago. Over three austral summers (2015–2017), northern rockhopper penguins with severe injuries were frequently observed at Nightingale Island. The cause of the wounds was unknown, but seal or shark attacks seemed probable. In January 2019, the first confirmed sighting of a sub-Antarctic fur seal, predating a healthy northern rockhopper penguin at sea off Nightingale Island was recorded. It remains uncertain whether the large A. tropicalis population at the Tristan da Cunha islands is significant predators of northern rockhopper penguins, but this could partly explain the significant recent decrease in northern rockhopper penguin population numbers. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: More than half of the world's 18 penguin species are declining. We, the Steering Committee of the International Union for Conservation of Nature Species Survival Commission Penguin Specialist Group, determined that the penguin species in most critical need of conservation action are African penguin (Spheniscus demersus), Galápagos penguin (Spheniscus mendiculus), and Yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes). Due to small or rapidly declining populations, these species require immediate scientific collaboration and policy intervention. We also used a pairwise-ranking approach to prioritize research and conservation needs for all penguins. Among the 12 cross-taxa research areas we identified, we ranked quantifying population trends, estimating demographic rates, forecasting environmental patterns of change, and improving the knowledge of fisheries interactions as the highest priorities. The highest ranked conservation needs were to enhance marine spatial planning, improve stakeholder engagement, and develop disaster-management and species-specific action plans. We concurred that, to improve the translation of science into effective conservation for penguins, the scientific community and funding bodies must recognize the importance of and support long-term research; research on and conservation of penguins must expand its focus to include the nonbreeding season and juvenile stage; marine reserves must be designed at ecologically appropriate spatial and temporal scales; and communication between scientists and decision makers must be improved with the help of individual scientists and interdisciplinary working groups. © 2019 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The largest population of Humboldt Penguins resides in a fertile archipelago of the north-central coast of Chile, formed by eight islands in proximity to upwelling centers of the Humboldt Current System. However, five of these islands lack legal protection. Here, we report the results of breeding Humboldt Penguins tracked while foraging from Tilgo Island. The average and maximum foraging radii around the colony were 22 km and 43 km, respectively. Our data indicate that trip ranges overlap areas proposed for industrial projects. Because Humboldt Penguins are sentinels of local ecosystem health, this underscores the value of expanding conservation zones in this unique marine location. © 2020, Marine Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: Until recently, Antarctic animal species were thought to be safely isolated from human-associated infections. However, recent studies have shown that Antarctic penguins carry microorganisms, some of which are potential human pathogens. We investigated one rookery of Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) and three rookeries of gentoo penguins (P. papua) for the presence of infectious diseases caused by non-indigenous microorganisms. Faecal samples were collected in the Argentine Islands (Wilhelm Archipelago, Graham Land), in the vicinity of the Ukrainian Antarctic Station "Akademik Vernadsky". Bacterial isolates obtained from the collected samples were identified as Serratia marcescens based on microscopic examination and biochemical studies. Additionally, partial sequences of the 16S rRNA gene were used to confirm the identity of the isolates. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA partial gene sequences showed that all the obtained isolates belong to S. marcescens (rod-shaped Gram-negative bacteria), a species which has never been detected in Antarctic penguin faeces before. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Understanding changes in abundance is crucial for conservation, but population growth rates often vary over space and time. We use 40 years of count data (1979–2019) and Bayesian state-space models to assess the African penguin Spheniscus demersus population under IUCN Red List Criterion A. We deconstruct the overall decline in time and space to identify where urgent conservation action is needed. The global African penguin population met the threshold for Endangered with a high probability (97%), having declined by almost 65% since 1989. An historical low of ~17,700 pairs bred in 2019. Annual changes were faster in the South African population (−4.2%, highest posterior density interval, HPDI: −7.8 to −0.6%) than the Namibian one (−0.3%, HPDI: −3.3 to +2.6%), and since 1999 were almost −10% at South African colonies north of Cape Town. Over the 40-year period, the Eastern Cape colonies went from holding ~25% of the total penguin population to ~40% as numbers decreased more rapidly elsewhere. These changes coincided with an altered abundance and availability of the main prey of African penguins. Our results underline the dynamic nature of population declines in space as well as time and highlight which penguin colonies require urgent conservation attention. © 2020 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Seabirds have been widely used for monitoring the health of the oceans in diverse marine regions. Among low-cost survey strategies, systematic surveys of seabirds beached on coasts have been developed since the 20th century. However, these studies do not always address blood aspects. The assessment of the health status of birds based on the analysis of hematological and plasma chemistry is crucial to evaluate the overall health status profile of live organisms. Here, the authors study the variability of blood parameters by sex, age class, and year of beached Magellanic Penguin during the nonreproductive period in northern Argentina. Of 44 penguins, 77% were categorized as younger juveniles and the rest as older juveniles, and were captured and studied in coastal areas of Buenos Aires Province during the summers of 2017 and 2018. The mean body weight of beached penguins was affected by the age class of the individuals; most of the younger juveniles showed poor condition in terms of body mass (1,761 6 235 g). No significant differences were observed in body weight between years and sex. Still, there were significant differences between years for alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values. Twelve of the 20 blood parameters analyzed differ significantly with the age class of the beached penguins; younger juveniles were in a state of inanition. Our results may serve as a necessary first step in improving the conservation status of the Magellanic Penguin in nonbreeding grounds of Argentina, and call for a better knowledge of the health status of the species along its annual cycle. © 2019 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Its isolation and extreme climate means Antarctica is one of the world's richest regions for untouched geoheritage. The potential of mining in Antarctica is often talked of in public discourse as a future threat to Antarctica even though the prohibition on mining is absolute and is likely to stay so indefinitely. As such mining does not pose a realistic threat to Antarctica's geoheritage. The impacts of scientific research and tourism pose more pressing challenges to Antarctica's geoheritage. This paper considers emerging debates in the Antarctic Treaty System on the need for further protection of Antarctica's geoheritage. After considering the concept of geoheritage the paper considers key threats to Antarctic geoheritage. The role of Antarctic Specially Protected Area system in the protection of Antarctica's geoheritage is then considered as is the draft code of conduct on geosciences field research currently being developed within the Antarctic Treaty System.

ABSTRACT: Aim: The conservation of biodiversity is hampered by data deficiencies, with many new species and subspecies awaiting description or reclassification. Population genomics and ecological niche modelling offer complementary new tools for uncovering functional units of phylogenetic diversity. We hypothesize that phylogenetically delineated lineages of gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) distributed across Antarctica and sub-Antarctic Islands are subject to spatially explicit ecological conditions that have limited gene flow, facilitating genetic differentiation, and thereby speciation processes. Location: Antarctica and sub-Antarctic area. Methods: We identify divergent lineages for gentoo penguins using ddRAD-seq and mtDNA, and generated species distribution models (SDMs) based on terrestrial and marine parameters. Results: Analyses of our genomic data supports the existence of four major lineages of gentoo penguin: (i) spanning the sub-Antarctic archipelagos north of the Antarctic Polar Front (APF); (ii) Kerguelen Island; (iii) South America; and (iv) across maritime Antarctic and the Scotia Arc archipelagos. The APF, a major current system around Antarctica, acts as the most important barrier separating regional sister lineages. Our ecological analyses spanning both the terrestrial (breeding sites) and marine (feeding sites) realms recover limited niche overlap among the major lineages of gentoo penguin. We observe this pattern to correspond more closely with regional differentiation of marine conditions than to terrestrial macroenvironmental features. Main conclusions: Recognition of regional genetic lineages as discrete evolutionary entities that occupy distinct ecological niches and also differ morphologically should be considered a priority for conservation. Gentoo penguins provide a good example of how conservation policy can be directly impacted by new insights obtained through the integration of larger genomic datasets with novel approaches to ecological modelling. This is particularly pertinent to polar environments that are among the most rapidly changing environments on earth. © 2020 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Autopsy imaging (Ai) was performed for a King Penguin. Ai-computed tomography (CT) revealed air sac membrane thickening, multiple nodules in the cranial air sac, suspected abscess, lung infiltration, and air sac contraction. Based on these findings, respiratory disorder was concerned. Aspergillosis, which is the highly observed in penguins, was considered as the primary differential diagnosis. The cultured sample showed characteristic conidial head of Aspergillus spp., the DNA of which was 100% identical to that of A. fumigatus. The cause of death was determined to respiratory failure due to aspergillosis. Ai-CT findings facilitated the dissection workflow and alerted the pathologist to potential hazards during the autopsy. Ai is useful to determine the cause of death and for readiness and safe pathological dissection. © 2020 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: Antarctica is the coldest and driest continent globally and has always been an exciting habitat to study extremophiles. The study reveals a monostromatic nitrophilic green alga Prasiola crispa (Trebouxiophyceae) growing on Adelie penguin guano at a penguin rockery, Larsemann Hills, Eastern Antarctica. This study is the first report of the barcode of this algal genus from Eastern Antarctica in general and the Larsemann Hills in particular. There are 35 species currently accepted in this genus, while four were reported from Antarctica. The present study relied on morphological diagnoses as well as the phylogenetic inference based on nuclear-encoded ITS gene and plastid-encoded tufA gene for species identification. The study generated phylogenetic reconstruction at the two selected loci for the first time for this species from Antarctica. © 2021 EMUNI Press. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Circoviruses infect a variety of animal species and have small (~1.8-2.2 kb) circular single-stranded DNA genomes. Recently a penguin circovirus (PenCV) was identified associated with an Adélie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) with feather disorder and in the cloacal swabs of three asymptomatic Adélie Penguins at Cape Crozier, Antarctica. A total of 75 cloacal swab samples obtained from adults and chicks of three species of penguin (genus: Pygoscelis) from seven Antarctic breeding colonies (South Shetland Islands and Western Antarctic Peninsula) in the 2015−2016 breeding season were screened for PenCV. We identified new variants of PenCV in one Adélie Penguin and one Chinstrap Penguin (Pygoscelis antarcticus) from Port Charcot, Booth Island, Western Antarctic Peninsula, a site home to all three species of Pygoscelid penguins. These two PenCV genomes (length of 1986 nucleotides) share > 99% genome-wide nucleotide identity with each other and share ~87% genome-wide nucleotide identity with the PenCV sequences described from Adélie Penguins at Cape Crozier ~4400 km away in East Antarctica. We did not find any evidence of recombination among PenCV sequences. This is the first report of PenCV in Chinstrap Penguins and the first detection outside of Ross Island, East Antarctica. Given the limited knowledge on Antarctic animal viral diversity, future samples from Antarctic wildlife should be screened for these and other viruses to determine the prevalence and potential impact of viral infections. © 2020 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Kojic acid has significant anti-melanogenic activity in mammals. However, few reports showed its function and mechanism in bivalves. In this study, by survival rate investigation and colour identification, 0.2–5 g/L kojic acid treatment for 24–48 hr was verified to be safe and effective to lighten shell colour of Pteria penguin (Röding; 1798). The liquid chromatograph–tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS) analysis showed that the content of PDCA (pyrrole-2, 3-dicarboxylic acid) and PTCA (pyrrole-2,3,5-tricarboxylic acid), main alkaline oxidation products of eumelanin, were significantly decreased from 651.0 to 275.7 ng/mg (by 57.7%) after kojic acid treatment. Consistent with decrease in melanin content, the tyrosinase activity was also significantly inhibited by up to 54.7% in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Different from the mammals, the qRT-PCR (quantitative real-time PCR) showed that kojic acid inhibited the expression of genes in tyrosinase pathway, including Tyr (Tyrosinase), Mitf (microphthalmia-associated transcription factor), Yel (Yellow) and Cdk2 (cyclin-dependent kinase 2), but had no effect on PpBcl2 (B-cell lymphoma 2). These data indicated that kojic acid changed shell colour by blocking tyrosinase activity and negatively regulating transcription of tyrosinase pathway genes in P. penguin. The effectiveness of kojic acid in modifying nacre colour suggested potential for its application in the aquaculture production of higher quality cultured pearls in P. penguin. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

ABSTRACT: Background: The astonishing variety of sounds that birds can produce has been the subject of many studies aiming to identify the underlying anatomical and physical mechanisms of sound production. An interesting feature of some bird vocalisations is the simultaneous production of two different frequencies. While most work has been focusing on songbirds, much less is known about dual-sound production in non-passerines, although their sound production organ, the syrinx, would technically allow many of them to produce "two voices". Here, we focus on the king penguin, a colonial seabird whose calls consist of two fundamental frequency bands and their respective harmonics. The calls are produced during courtship and for partner and offspring reunions and encode the birds' identity. We dissected, μCT-scanned and analysed the vocal tracts of six adult king penguins from Possession Island, Crozet Archipelago. Results: King penguins possess a bronchial type syrinx that, similarly to the songbird's tracheobronchial syrinx, has two sets of vibratory tissues, and thus two separate sound sources. Left and right medial labium differ consistently in diameter between 0.5 and 3.2%, with no laterality between left and right side. The trachea has a conical shape, increasing in diameter from caudal to cranial by 16%. About 80% of the king penguins' trachea is medially divided by a septum consisting of soft elastic tissue (septum trachealis medialis). Conclusions: The king penguins' vocal tract appears to be mainly adapted to the life in a noisy colony of a species that relies on individual vocal recognition. The extent between the two voices encoding for individuality seems morphologically dictated by the length difference between left and right medial labium. The septum trachealis medialis might support this extent and could therefore be an important anatomical feature that AIDS in the individual recognition process.  © 2020 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: We investigate the factors associated with the occurrence and abundance of external and blood parasites in African penguins (Spheniscus demersus), an endangered seabird that breeds exclusively on the coasts of Namibia and South Africa. External parasites were collected using the dust-ruffling method from 171 African Penguins admitted at a rehabilitation facility in the Western Cape, South Africa. Additionally, blood smears were obtained upon admission and weekly during rehabilitation and examined for blood parasites. Fleas Parapsyllus longicornis humboldti, ticks Ornithodoros capensis and lice Austrogoniodes demersus were recovered from 93, 63 and 40%, respectively, of the penguins upon admission to the centre. Rescue location and age group were identified as significant determinants of flea abundance, whereas month of admission was a significant determinant of tick abundance. Blood parasites were also common on admission, with Babesia being the most frequent (46% prevalence) whereas Borrelia was recorded sporadically (1.2%) and Plasmodium was recorded once. The prevalence and abundance of ticks on admission was positively associated with Babesia infection on admission. Our findings demonstrate the variability and contributing factor of parasite infections in an endangered species of penguin, and highlight the need for additional research on the parasite-host dynamics involving these potential disease vectors.

ABSTRACT: Understanding the scales at which environmental variability affects populations is critical for projecting population dynamics and species distributions in rapidly changing environments. Here we used a multilevel Bayesian analysis of range-wide survey data for Adélie penguins to characterize multidecadal and annual effects of sea ice on population growth. We found that mean sea ice concentration at breeding colonies (i.e., “prevailing” environmental conditions) had robust nonlinear effects on multidecadal population trends and explained over 85% of the variance in mean population growth rates among sites. In contrast, despite considerable year-to-year fluctuations in abundance at most breeding colonies, annual sea ice fluctuations often explained less than 10% of the temporal variance in population growth rates. Our study provides an understanding of the spatially and temporally dynamic environmental factors that define the range limits of Adélie penguins, further establishing this iconic marine predator as a true sea ice obligate and providing a firm basis for projection under scenarios of future climate change. Yet, given the weak effects of annual sea ice relative to the large unexplained variance in year-to-year growth rates, the ability to generate useful short-term forecasts of Adélie penguin breeding abundance will be extremely limited. Our approach provides a powerful framework for linking short- and longer term population processes to environmental conditions that can be applied to any species, facilitating a richer understanding of ecological predictability and sensitivity to global change. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

ABSTRACT: Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) are the most numerous flightless bird group breeding in coastal areas of Maritime and Continental Antarctica. Their activity leaves a mark on the land in the form of large guano deposits. This guano is an important nutrient source for terrestrial habitats of ice-free Antarctic areas, most notably by being the source of ammonia vapors which feed the surrounding grass, lichen and algae communities. Although investigated by researchers, the fate of the guano-associated microbial community and its role in decomposition processes remain vague. Therefore, by employing several direct community assessment methods combined with a broad culture-based approach we provide data on bacterial numbers, their activity and taxonomic affiliation in recently deposited and decayed Adélie penguin guano sampled at the Point Thomas rookery in Maritime Antarctica (King George Island). Our research indicates that recently deposited guano harbored mostly bacteria of penguin gut origin, presumably inactive in cold rookery settings. This material was rich in mesophilic enzymes active also at low temperatures, likely mediating early stage decomposition. Fresh guano colonization by environmental bacteria was minor, accomplished mostly by ammonia scavenging Jeotgalibaca sp. cells. Decayed guano contained 10-fold higher bacterial numbers with cold-active enzymes dominating the samples. Guano was colonized by uric-acid degrading and lipolytic Psychrobacter spp. and proteolytic Chryseobacterium sp. among others. Several spore-forming bacteria of penguin gut origin persisted in highly decomposed material, most notably uric-acid fermenting members of the Gottschalkiaceae family. © 2020

ABSTRACT: ABSTRACT The Ross Sea (Antarctica) is one of the most productive marine ecosystems in the Southern Ocean and supports nearly one million breeding pairs of Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) annually. There also is a well-preserved record of abandoned penguin colonies that date from before the Last Glacial Maximum (>45,000 14C yr B.P.) through the Holocene. Cape Irizar is a rocky cape located just south of the Drygalski Ice Tongue on the Scott Coast. In January 2016, several abandoned Adélie penguin sites and abundant surface remains of penguin bones, feathers, and carcasses that appeared to be fresh were being exposed by melting snow and were sampled for radiocarbon analysis. The results indicate the “fresh” remains are actually ancient and that three periods of occupation by Adélie penguins are represented beginning ca. 5000 calibrated calendar (cal.) yr B.P., with the last occupation ending by ca. 800 cal. yr B.P. The presence of fresh-appearing remains on the surface that are actually ancient in age suggests that only recently has snowmelt exposed previously frozen carcasses and other remains for the first time in ?800 yr, allowing them to decay and appear fresh. Recent warming trends and historical satellite imagery (Landsat) showing decreasing snow cover on the cape since 2013 support this hypothesis. Increased δ13C values of penguin bone collagen further indicate a period of enhanced marine productivity during the penguin “optimum”, a warm period at 4000–2000 cal. yr B.P., perhaps related to an expansion of the Terra Nova Bay polynya with calving events of the Drygalski Ice Tongue. © 2020 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Studies on the effects of visitors on zoo animals have shown mixed findings and as a result, the manner in which visitors affect zoo animals remains unclear for many species, including a rarely studied taxa such as penguins. Penguins are a common zoo-housed species and have been shown to display huddling, vigilance and avoidance towards zoo visitors which can be indicative of fear. Here, we examined the effects of covering one visitor viewing area window, out of four, on little penguin (Eudyptula minor) behaviours that may be indicative of fear. Two treatments were randomly imposed on different days: 1) The main visitor viewing area window, where most visitor-penguin interactions occurred, was uncovered (‘Main window uncovered’) and 2) The main visitor viewing area window was covered (‘Main window covered’). Penguin numbers and behaviour were recorded near the main visitor viewing area window and the three other visitor viewing area windows, as well as one area not visible to visitors (‘Corner’ area). Furthermore, visitor numbers and visitor behaviour were recorded at all four visitor viewing area windows. Covering the main visitor viewing area window reduced the proportion of visitors present at this window by about 85% (p < 0.001) and reduced potentially threatening visitor behaviours at this window such as tactile contact with the window, loud vocalisations and sudden movement (p < 0.05). When the main visitor viewing area window was covered, the proportion of penguins present increased by about 25% (p < 0.05), the proportion of visible penguins preening in the water increased by about 180% (p< 0.05) and the proportion of visible penguins vigilant decreased by about 70% (p < 0.05) in the area near this main window. A preference for the Corner area was also found whereby 59% and 49% of penguins were present in this area when the main window was uncovered and covered, respectively. These results provide limited evidence that the little penguins in this exhibit showed an aversion to the area near the main visitor viewing area window when it was uncovered based on the increased avoidance and vigilance and decreased preening in the water in this area. This suggests visitors may be fear-provoking for these little penguins. However, it is unclear whether visual contact with visitors per se or other aspects of visitor contact, such as visitor-induced sounds and vibrations, were responsible for this apparent aversion when this window was uncovered. © 2020 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Marine endotherms in the polar regions face a formidable thermal challenge when swimming in cold water. Hence, they use morphological (fat, blubber) adjustment and peripheral vasoconstriction to reduce demands for heat production in water. The animals then regain normothermia when resting ashore. In the king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus) metabolic rate is lower in fed than in fasted individuals during subsequent rewarming on land. This has been suggested to be a consequence of diversion of blood flow to the splanchnic region in fed birds, which reduces peripheral temperatures. However, peripheral temperatures during recovery have never been investigated in birds with different nutritional status. The aim of this study was, therefore, to measure subcutaneous and abdominal temperatures during the rewarming phase on land in fasted and fed king penguins, and investigate to which extent any different rewarming were reflected in recovery metabolic rate (MRR) after long term immersion in cold water. We hypothesized that fed individuals would have a slower increase of subcutaneous temperatures compared to fasted penguins, and a correspondingly lower MRR. Subcutaneous tissues reached normothermia after 24.15 (back) and 21.36 min (flank), which was twice as fast as in the abdomen (46.82 min). However, recovery time was not affected by nutritional condition. MRR during global rewarming (4.56 ± 0.42 W kg−1) was twice as high as resting metabolic rate (RMR; 2.16 ± 0.59 W kg−1). However, MRR was not dependent on feeding status and was significantly elevated above RMR only until subcutaneous temperature had recovered. Contrary to our prediction, fed individuals did not reduce the subcutaneous circulation compared to fasted penguins and did not show any changes in MRR during subsequent recovery. It seems likely that lower metabolic rate in fed king penguins on land reported in other studies might not have been caused primarily by increased circulation to the visceral organs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Abnormal molting, including partial or incomplete molt, arrested molt cycle, or inappropriate frequency of molt, is a primary concern for the managed African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) population and is documented across institutions. To identify factors associated with increased odds of abnormal molts and characterize intervention opportunities, a comprehensive survey evaluating numerous husbandry and medical parameters was created. Survey results represent 45 North American African penguin holding facilities and 736 unique animals. Of these individuals, 135 (18.3%) demonstrated an abnormal molt over the 5-yr study period (2012-2017). Increased odds ratios for abnormal molt included biologic (age, sex, etc.), geographic (elevation, latitude), and husbandry (exhibit design, diet, etc.) variables. The mean age of affected animals was 15.2 yr (1-45 yr, n=135) compared with 9.92 yr (4 mo-38 yr, n=601) for unaffected animals. In addition, although statistically insignificant, males were overrepresented in the affected cohort compared with a near even distribution among unaffected animals. Identified factors with increased odds for abnormal molting included advanced age and facilities using freshwater pools. Normally molting penguins were more commonly found with saltwater pool access and natural lighting exposure. Anecdotal medical intervention attempts are discussed, although further research is needed to define their use. Of attempted interventions, subcutaneous 5.4-mg melatonin implants placed in anticipation of environmental molting cues showed the most promise at inducing catastrophic molt, with 14 of 17 (82.3%) of affected individuals molting normally following this treatment. Survey analysis indicated that abnormal molt is a complex, multifactorial process, and modifiable factors that may predispose animals to abnormally molt exist. Addressing these factors in future exhibit design may mitigate the prevalence of this condition. Despite these efforts, it is likely that medical interventions will be required to aid in the treatment of abnormal molting in this species. © 2019 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: An 11-day-old little blue penguin (Eudyptula minor) died unexpectedly. Prior to hatching, the egg experienced trauma and resultant defects were repaired. The chick hatched without complication and was clinically normal prior to death. Necropsy revealed congested lungs. Histologic examination showed moderate nonsuppurative encephalitis with focally extensive neuronal necrosis and intranuclear inclusions in neurons within necrotic foci. Herpesvirus DNA was detected in brain tissue with a generic herpesvirus polymerase chain reaction. Sanger sequencing demonstrated 100% and 98% sequence homology to sphenicid alphaherpesvirus 1 and penguin herpesvirus 2, respectively. In situ hybridization demonstrated large amounts of herpesvirus nucleic acid in intranuclear inclusions and neuronal nuclei. Combined histology, polymerase chain reaction, Sanger sequencing, and in situ hybridization results were most consistent with herpesviral encephalitis, most likely caused by sphenicid alphaherpesvirus 1. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a herpesvirus infection causing encephalitis in a penguin and the first report of herpesvirus in this species. © The Author(s) 2020.

ABSTRACT: Bioavailability of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons on São Paulo state coast (southeastern Brazil) was evaluated through the analysis of biliary metabolites in Spheniscus magellanicus (n = 79). The animals analyzed in present study were either found dead during beach monitoring procedures or died at rehabilitation centers. Analyses of naphthalene (NAP), phenanthrene (PHE) and benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) metabolites were performed using a high-performance liquid chromatograph equipped with fluorescence detectors. Total metabolite (TM) concentrations ranged from below the method quantification limit to 270 μg g−1 of bile. TM concentrations were mainly composed of NAP metabolites, followed by PHE metabolites. BaP metabolites were detected in only two samples. This is the first study using PAHs metabolites in S. magellanicus to assess the bioavailability of these compounds in coastal regions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Diet studies of marine predators provide insights into the functioning and structure of marine ecosystems. Such studies have been greatly enhanced in recent years with technology enabling direct observation of feeding behaviour in the marine environment. We here report on observations of an interesting predation event involving Gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) at sub-Antarctic Marion Island. Through the deployment of an animal-borne miniaturised video data logger, we were able to document what is to our knowledge the largest recorded prey species consumed by a Gentoo penguin. A squid (probably Greater hooked squid, Onykia ingens) with an estimated mantle length of 240 mm was consumed whole after a period of competition over the prey item with another foraging Gentoo penguin. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The anatomy of the avian gastrointestinal (GI) tract is uniquely suited to each species' dietary requirements. African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) are charismatic and popular exhibit animals. As their prevalence grows, there is a need to understand their unique digestive tract to diagnose abnormalities. Reference material specific to the digestive tract of piscivores is scant, and knowledge of the GI tract of a healthy penguin is based on information from other birds. The purpose of this study is to determine the normal gross anatomy, transit time, and histopathologic structures of the penguin GI tract. Twelve clinically healthy penguins were selected for this study from the colony at the Maryland Zoo in Baltimore, which, at the time of this study, consisted of 55 birds. All penguins underwent a barium contrast study, and radiographic images were obtained until the entire GI tract was empty. Approximately 2 wk later, each penguin was anesthetized, and an endoscopic evaluation of the anterior GI tract was performed. Time from barium administration to defecation ranged from 17 to 70 min, and on average, barium clearance was 17.6 hr (range, 5-36 hr). Fluid from the ventriculus had an average pH of 2.75 and contained a mixed bacterial population. Koilin presence and thickness appreciated on endoscopy did not correspond with the thickness determined on histopathology. The results of this study provide a comparative baseline to use during diagnostic workups and help guide treatment decisions. © 2020 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Inter-individual differences in demographic traits of iteroparous species can arise through learning and maturation, as well as from permanent differences in individual ‘quality’ and sex-specific constraints. As the ability to acquire energy determines the resources an individual can allocate to reproduction and self-maintenance, foraging behavior is a key trait to study to better understand the mechanisms underlying these differences. So far, most seabird studies have focused on the effect of maturation and learning processes on foraging performance, while only a few have included measures of individual quality. Here, we investigated the effects of age, breeding experience, sex, and individual breeding quality on the foraging behavior and location of 83 known-age Adélie penguins at Cape Bird, Ross Sea, Antarctica. Over a 2 yr period, we showed that (1) high-quality birds dived deeper than lower quality ones, apparently catching a higher number of prey per dive and targeting different foraging locations; (2) females performed longer foraging trips and a higher number of dives compared to males; (3) there were no significant age-related differences in foraging behavior; and (4) breeding experience had a weak influence on foraging behavior. We suggest that high-quality individuals have higher physiological ability, enabling them to dive deeper and forage more effectively. Further inquiry should focus on determining the physiological differences among penguins of different quality. © Inter-Research 2020

ABSTRACT: In the krill-based ecosystem of the Antarctic, fluctuations in the distribution and abundance of Euphausia superba may have strong impacts on predator populations; thus, it is crucial to observe the feeding ecology of Antarctic predators, especially in the light of climate change and increasing human pressure. We determined the composition of euphausiid species in diet samples collected from Adélie (Pygoscelis adeliae), chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarcticus) and gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) penguins on King George Island (South Shetlands Islands) during a breeding season. For all three penguin species, euphausiids (mainly E. superba) represented almost the entirety of researched stomach samples (i.e. 99.9% in the case of Adélie and chinstrap penguins), while gentoo penguins also proved to feed on fish (99.4% krill; 0.5% fish). Analysed material differed in the size of eaten E. superba specimens, with the smallest crustaceans consumed by Adélie penguins. Furthermore, we found differences in the ratio of consumed krill and krill size. Such disparities may be a result of sex-based differences and slight differences in feeding areas between the birds. Additionally, we noted some fragments of plastic debris in the investigated penguin diet samples. © Antarctic Science Ltd 2020.

ABSTRACT: African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) are pursuit-diving seabirds endemic to the coast of southern Africa. In this study, we investigate the presence of seashells and anthropogenic debris (e.g. plastic, glass, nylon) in the stomach contents of adult African penguins, as determined from sampling of live penguins through the water off-loading technique (n = 4,793) and from post-mortem examination of penguin carcases (n = 159). Seashells were present in stomach contents sampled from 106 live (2.2%) and three dead (1.9%) penguins. Seashells originated from a variety of intertidal and subtidal organisms including molluscs, barnacles and bryozoans, and the eroded condition of the shell fragments suggests that they were picked up from shell deposits on the beach or in the surf zone. Seashell ingestion appears to be more frequent in the months of peak egg laying. A subset of stomach samples from known-sex individuals revealed that seashells were only present in the stomachs of adult females. In post-mortem examination, the presence of seashells in the stomach was accompanied by anatomical evidence that egg laying was imminent or had recently occurred. Anthropogenic debris was found in one (0.6%) and eight (0.2%) stomach content samples obtained from dead and live penguins, respectively. In some cases, the ingestion of anthropogenic debris co-occurred with that of seashells, and their size and shape were similar. Our findings demonstrate that adult female African penguins occasionally ingest seashells, possibly as a calcium supplementation strategy, and raise concern that in doing so they may also accidentally ingest anthropogenic debris. © 2019, © 2019 BirdLife Australia.

ABSTRACT: Penguin colonies in Antarctica offer an ideal “natural laboratory” to investigate ecosystem function and the nitrogen (N) cycle. This study assessed the spatial distribution of penguin-derived N from guano and quantitatively assessed its impact on plant N utilization strategies in Victoria Land, Ross Sea region, Antarctica. Soil, moss, and aquatic microbial mats were collected inside and outside an active Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) colony and analyzed for δ15N of total and inorganic nitrogen (NH4 +-N and NO3 −-N). The soil total nitrogen (TN), NH4 +-N, and NO3 −-N concentrations, as well as their δ15N values were significantly higher in guano-impacted areas than those in guano-free areas, verifying that guano is an important N source at and near penguin colonies. However, even far from the penguin colonies, soil δ15N values resembled those in penguin colonies, suggesting strong spatial impacts of penguin-derived N. The moss impacted by guano was more enriched in δ15N than in guano-free areas. The δ15N values of NH4 +-N and NO3 −-N in soils covered with moss revealed that the moss might prefer inorganic N in the absence of guano, while the dissolved organic N would become an important source for moss growing on ornithogenic soils. Aquatic microbial mat samples near penguin colonies were 15N-enriched, but 15N-depleted at upland sites. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The Penguins Cluster of fields are owned jointly (50:50) by Shell UK Ltd (Shell) and Esso Exploration and Production UK Ltd (Esso), with Shell as the operator. The cluster was discovered in 1974 and is composed of a combination of oil and gas condensate accumulations located 50–65 km north of the Brent Field, at the northern end of the North Viking Graben. Two main producing reservoirs are present: the Penguins West Field (Penguin A) consists of an Upper Jurassic Magnus Sandstone Member reservoir, while the Penguins East Field (Penguin C, D and E) consists of a Middle Jurassic Brent Group reservoir, underlain by currently undeveloped Statfjord and Triassic (Cormorant) reservoirs. The Magnus reservoir is composed of turbidite sands with an average porosity of 15% and permeabilities of 0.10–300 mD. The Brent reservoirs are composed of deltaic shoreface deposits with an average porosity of 14% and permeabilities of 0.01–1000 mD. The fields were brought on stream in 2003 as a subsea development via what at the time was the world’s longest comingled tieback to the Brent Charlie facility. A total of nine producing wells have been drilled from four subsea manifolds, producing c. 78 MMboe to date through depletion drive. © 2020 Shell UK Limited.

ABSTRACT: An articulated wing belonging to Palaeeudyptes gunnari containing mineralized skin was found in Lutetian (middle Eocene) sediments from Seymour Island, Antarctica. It shows the connective tissues, morphology and density of the feather follicles, and a groove pattern left by the feather calami resting on the skin. Analysis of the preserved surfaces indicates a composition of calcium phosphate. This is the most complete and only articulated wing described for this species and represents the first record of a neornithine bird preserving three-dimensional integument. Plumage density of the wing MLP 14-I-10-22, estimated by counting the follicles under a stereoscopic microscope, is lower than that of the modern Emperor penguin. © 2020 Lethaia Foundation.

ABSTRACT: Information on the extent of genetic differentiation among seabird populations is essential for conservation planning. Here we used, for the first time in little penguins (Eudyptula minor), a next generation sequencing approach to investigate population genetic structure, gene flow and inbreeding among eight colonies in South Australia. We found that Troubridge Island individuals were genetically distinct from the other sampled colonies, and that colonies on all islands were connected by moderate levels of gene flow possibly due to migration from the Kangaroo Island colonies. While further genetic sampling is needed, these data support the idea that South Australia may be a zone of subtle and rapid genetic change for little penguins. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

ABSTRACT: Biological hotspots along the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) are characterized by high phytoplankton productivity and biomass as well as spatially focused penguin foraging activity. While unique physical concentrating processes were identified in one of these hotspots, understanding the mechanisms driving the blooms at these locations is of high importance. Factors posited to explain the blooms include the upwelling of macronutrient- and micronutrient-enriched modified Upper Circumpolar Deep Water (mUCDW) and the depth of the mixed layer influencing overall light availability for phytoplankton. Using shipboard trace-metal clean incubation experiments in three different coastal biological hotspots spanning a north-south gradient along the WAP, we tested the Canyon Hypothesis (upwelling) for enhanced phytoplankton growth. Diatoms dominated the Southern region, while the Northern region was characterized by a combination of diatoms and cryptophytes. There was ample concentration of macronutrients at the surface and no phytoplankton growth response was detected with the addition of nutrient-enriched mUCDW water or iron solution to surface waters. For all treatments, addition of mUCDW showed no enhancement in phytoplankton growth, suggesting that local upwelling of nutrient-enriched deep water in these hotspots was not the main driver of high phytoplankton biomass. Furthermore, the dynamics in the photoprotective pigments were consistent with the light levels used during these incubations showing that phytoplankton are able to photoacclimate rapidly to higher irradiances and that in situ cells are low light adapted. Light availability appears to be the critical variable for the development of hotspot phytoplankton blooms, which in turn supports the highly productive regional food web. © 2019 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: King Penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) live in remote locations, in large colonies with asynchronous breeding. These three factors hinder the design and conduct of King Penguin censuses, and assessments of trend often require piecing together mismatched surveys of different demographic components. This study introduces a new method to remotely census these populations year-round and correct population estimates for the King Penguin’s unique breeding phenology. We combined in situ ground counts with estimates based on high-resolution satellite imagery to catalog the distribution of breeding colonies and estimate population abundance across the island of South Georgia, in the south Atlantic. While most King Penguin populations are forecast to decline significantly over the next century, South Georgia is expected to experience more favorable conditions and represents an important refugium for the species, though the challenges of surveying King Penguins have precluded a comprehensive census. Due to the variable timing of both in situ and remote counts, we developed a discrete time, age- and stage-structured population model that provides stage- and day-specific correction factors for standardization of census counts. We estimate the current population of King Penguins on South Georgia as 405,425 (95% CI 102,624–2,375,061) breeding pairs and find that population trends that do not account for phenological biases persistently underestimate the population growth rate. Correction factors are highly sensitive to annual egg mortality and the total breeding population is best estimated using nest counts of early-breeding pairs. Future efforts to census King Penguin populations may minimize uncertainty by capturing more precise estimates of egg survival and optimizing the timing of ground and satellite censuses to occur during the settlement of early breeders. Accounting for the error associated with current uncertainty in model parameters, 18–32 years of census data would be required to accurately detect trends of a population with a 10% growth rate. While asynchronously breeding species present a unique challenge to population monitoring, careful accounting of within-season dynamics can be used to assemble a self-consistent time series from heterogeneous survey data. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The Magellanic penguin Spheniscus magellanicus is a top predator and a major consumer of marine resources in the Patagonian Continental Shelf and worldwide. It is the most migratory of the Spheniscus penguins, but until recently, its migration route was only partially known. Our aims with regard to the Magellanic penguin breeding on Isla Quiroga, Argentina, were: 1) to compare the distribution during the winter period between sexes and 2) in case that habitat is segregated, to evaluate possible proximate causes like competitive exclusion and/or habitat specialization. In March 2017 and 2018, prior to migration, we equipped 26 penguins with MK3/4 geolocators, which were recovered in late September/early October. Penguins dispersed northwards up to 29°S and southwards up to 56°S, near the Beagle Channel, being distributed over 2158 ± 50 km of latitudinal range and showing a large-scale distribution pattern across longitudes in waters within the continental shelf. We found a longitudinal segregation between sexes in their winter grounds, with males closer to the 200-m isobath and further from the coastline than females. Morphological and physiological differences between sexes might allow males to dive deeper at a lower cost than females, which could result in a more offshore path for males. This spatial segregation was supported by bulk blood stable isotope values and estimated isotopic niche, which differed between males and females at their arrival from winter breeding grounds, but not while penguin breed and behave as central place foragers in the colony. For the first time in this species, we combined two independent tools, geolocation and stable isotope data, and find that sexual segregation in habitat use could potentially generate an optimal winter foraging strategy for both sexes, precluding potential intersex competition for food. © 2019 Nordic Society Oikos.

ABSTRACT: Sentinel species, like Adélie penguins, have been used to assess the impact of environmental changes, and their link with sea ice has received considerable attention. Here, we tested if foraging Adélie penguins from 2 colonies in East Antarctica target the distant sea-ice edge or take advantage of closer open waters that are readily available near their colony. We examined the foraging behaviour of penguins during the incubation trips of females in 2016 and males in 2017, using GPS tracking and diet data in view of daily sea-ice data and bathymetry. In 2016-2017, sea-ice cover was extensive during females' trips but flaw leads and polynyas were close to both study sites. Sea ice receded rapidly during males' trips in 2017-2018. Despite close open water near both colonies in both years, females and males preferentially targeted the continental slope and the sea-ice edge to forage. In addition, there was no difference in the diet of penguins from both colonies: all penguins fed mostly on Antarctic krill and males also foraged on Antarctic silverfish. Our results highlight the importance of the sea-ice edge for penguins, an area where food abundance is predictable. It is likely that resource availability was not sufficient in closer open water areas at such an early stage in the breeding season. The behaviours displayed by the penguins from both colonies were similar, suggesting a common behaviour across colonies in Terre Adélie, although additional sites would be necessary to confirm this hypothesis. © Inter-Research 2020.

ABSTRACT: Marine predators adapt their hunting techniques to locate and capture prey in response to their surrounding environment. However, little is known about how certain strategies influence foraging success and efficiency. Due to the miniaturisation of animal tracking technologies, a single individual can be equipped with multiple data loggers to obtain multi-scale tracking information. With the addition of animal-borne video data loggers, it is possible to provide context-specific information for movement data obtained over the video recording periods. Through a combination of video data loggers, accelerometers, GPS and depth recorders, this study investigated the influence of habitat, sex and the presence of other predators on the foraging success and efficiency of the endangered African penguin, Spheniscus demersus, from two colonies in Algoa Bay, South Africa. Due to limitations in the battery life of video data loggers, a machine learning model was developed to detect prey captures across full foraging trips. The model was validated using prey capture signals detected in concurrently recording accelerometers and animal-borne cameras and was then applied to detect prey captures throughout the full foraging trip of each individual. Using GPS and bathymetry information to inform the position of dives, individuals were observed to perform both pelagic and benthic diving behaviour. Females were generally more successful on pelagic dives than males, suggesting a trade-off between manoeuvrability and physiological diving capacity. By contrast, males were more successful in benthic dives, at least for Bird Island (BI) birds, possibly due to their larger size compared to females, allowing them to exploit habitat deeper and for longer durations. Both males at BI and both sexes at St Croix (SC) exhibited similar benthic success rates. This may be due to the comparatively shallower seafloor around SC, which could increase the likelihood of females capturing prey on benthic dives. Observation of camera data indicated individuals regularly foraged with a range of other predators including penguins and other seabirds, predatory fish (sharks and tuna) and whales. The presence of other seabirds increased individual foraging success, while predatory fish reduced it, indicating competitive exclusion by larger heterospecifics. This study highlights novel benthic foraging strategies in African penguins and suggests that individuals could buffer the effects of changes to prey availability in response to climate change. Furthermore, although group foraging was prevalent in the present study, its influence on foraging success depends largely on the type of heterospecifics present. Copyright 2020 Sutton et al.

ABSTRACT: Background: Penguin interaction with gillnets has been extensively reported in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and is considered a major conservation threat. Among penguin species, Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) are currently considered of great concern, particularly in Brazil, where they are highly susceptible to gillnet bycatch. Nevertheless, information about drowning-associated microscopic findings in penguins is limited. Results: We describe the anatomopathological findings of 20 Magellanic penguins that drowned after getting entangled in a drift gillnet while wintering along the Brazilian shelf and washed ashore still enmeshed in Santa Catarina, Brazil. All 20 birds (19 juveniles and 1 adult; 18 females and 2 males) were in good body condition. Major gross findings were abrasion, bruising, and local erythema and edema of the wings, multiorgan congestion, jugular vein engorgement, pulmonary edema and hemorrhage, splenomegaly and hepatomegaly, fluid in the trachea, serous bloody fluid in the lungs, gastrointestinal parasites (nematodes, cestodes and trematodes), and debris in the stomach. The most common histopathological findings were cerebral and pulmonary congestion, pulmonary edema, splenic histiocytosis, lymphoid splenic hyperplasia, acute splenitis, extramedullary hepatic hematopoiesis, and parasitic enteritis. Although unspecific, the observed multiorgan congestion and pulmonary edema are consistent with previous reports of drowning in birds and may be indicative of this process. Conclusions: Drowning may be a challenging diagnosis (e.g., carcass decomposition, predation), but must be considered as a differential in all beach-cast seabird postmortem examinations. To the authors' knowledge this is the largest anatomopathological study based on microscopic examination in drowned penguins. © 2020 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Detecting changes in marine food webs is challenging, but top predators can provide information on lower trophic levels. However, many commonly measured predator responses can be decoupled from prey availability by plasticity in predator foraging effort. This can be overcome by directly measuring foraging effort and success and integrating these into a measure of foraging efficiency analogous to the catch per unit effort (CPUE) index employed by fisheries. We extended existing CPUE methods so that they would be applicable to the study of generalist foragers, which introduce another layer of complexity through dietary plasticity. Using this method, we inferred species-specific patterns in prey availability and estimated taxon-specific biomass consumption. We recorded foraging trip duration and body mass change of breeding little penguins Eudyptula minor and combined these with diet composition identified via non-invasive faecal DNA metabarcoding to derive CPUE indices for individual prey taxa. We captured weekly patterns of availability of key fish prey in the penguins’ diet and identified a major prey shift from sardine Sardinops sagax to red cod Pseudophycis bachus between years. In each year, predation on a dominant fish species (~150 g/day) was replaced by greater diversity of fish in the diet as the breeding season progressed. We estimated that the colony extracted ~1,300 tonnes of biomass from their coastal ecosystem over two breeding seasons, including 219 tonnes of the commercially important sardine and 215 tonnes of red cod. This enhanced pCPUE is applicable to most central-placed foragers and offers a valuable alternative to existing metrics. Informed prey-species biomass estimates extracted by apex and meso predators will be a useful input for mass-balance ecosystem models and for informing ecosystem-based management.

ABSTRACT: Marine top predators living in sympatry tend to use their environment differentially, thereby reducing niche overlap. Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) and gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) coexist at Martillo Is., Argentina. During the 2014, 2015 and 2017 breeding seasons a total of thirty-one Magellanic and eleven gentoo penguins were equipped with GPS-TDR loggers to record foraging trips. Both species dove to similar maximum depths with analogous effort (dives per hour). Magellanics, however, undertook longer trips and travelled further away from the colony (25 h and 43 km vs. 10 h and 20 km on average, respectively). Gentoos on the other hand, performed longer dives, had a higher percentage of “U” shaped dives and spent more time during the bottom phase of the dive. Gentoos foraged exclusively within an area close to the colony and in waters not deeper than 80 m. Magellanics had more variability in their behaviors and were not associated to a specific depth or distance from the colony. The ecological circumstances of both species (targeted prey and surrounding environment) suffice to explain the particular behaviors of both species independently from the presence of the other. Gentoos seem to focus on benthic prey which remains stable in this environment throughout the year, and Magellanics behave more opportunistically searching for pelagic prey during early chick rearing. Competition may not be always shaping coexistence of species of similar trophic positions and behaviors. Particularly, if resources are not limited, both species can behave in ways they find optimal without factoring the coexistence of the other species. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: One of the most remarkable differences between Paleogene penguins and their living relatives is the shape and length of their beaks. Many of the Eocene and Oligocene penguins have a thin and elongated spear-like bill, which contrasts with the proportionally shorter and more robust bill of most living species. These differences suggest an important shift in their feeding strategies. This study explores the morphological disparity on the skull of penguins, emphasizing bill morphology and it relationship with feeding habits. For this, the skulls of 118 species of aquatic birds, including 21 fossil and living penguins, were analyzed using two-dimensional geometric morphometric. The results show that, unlike what has been reported for modern birds overall, in penguins and Aequornithes, bill elongation is related to a reduction of the braincase. The discriminant analysis shows that there are significant differences between penguins that feed near or far from the coast and between those that consume nectonic and planktonic prey, identifying Madrynornis as the only extinct form with a possibly planktonic diet. Additionally, it is clear that Paleogene penguins occupy a region of morphospace unexplored by most diving birds, with the western grebe being their closest modern analogue. This is consistent with the hypothesis that giant penguins hunted by harpooning and not by biting as living forms do, signaling a significant change in the habits of those birds leading to the emergence of their crown group. © 2020 The Paleontological Society.

ABSTRACT: Assessment of pododermatitis, osteoarthritis, and other causes of lameness in penguins can be challenging. Subjective gait analysis using visual observation and response to analgesic therapy can be affected by observer variation and caregiver placebo bias. A pressure-sensitive walkway (PSW), however, allows for objective gait analysis and assessment of analgesic therapeutic response. In this study, a 3-m-long PSW was used to analyze gait in 21 adult Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti). Medical record reviews and comprehensive examinations were performed on all penguins; five penguins were considered abnormal, with either right-sided (n = 3) or bilateral historical lameness-causing disease (n = 2) and were analyzed separately from the normal data set. All penguins walked across the PSW four times and gait parameters (step and stride distances and velocities, maximum force, impulse, and peak pressure) were calculated for each foot in each penguin. Statistical comparisons were made between right and left feet, sexes, and normal and abnormal penguins for each gait parameter. Among normal penguins, there were no significant differences between feet or sex. Left step width was shorter in abnormal penguins than that of normal penguins. Study results established baseline values for Humboldt penguins. This will allow objective monitoring of progression and response to therapy in penguin lameness cases, both current and future. The data also provide a foundation to compare gait parameters with other penguin populations and species. © 2019 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: The winged pearl oyster (Pteria penguin) is one of the most potential species used to produce large sized pearls. Waterless transport and nuclei implant process are two common handling practices for pearl oyster in aquaculture. These processes can cause air exposure stress. In order to investigate the physiological energetics and oxidative stress of pearl oysters exposed to air, live P. penguin were exposed to air for 6 h, 9 h and 12 h at different air temperatures (20 °C, 25 °C and 30 °C) before immediate re-immersing in seawater at 27 °C for their recovery. The air exposure time and temperature significantly affected the survival rates of P. penguin. Meanwhile, the optimum temperature was found to be 25 °C, in which the survival rate of P. penguin was >90 % after 9 h of air exposure. In addition, five parameters of physiological energetics, such as clearance rate (CR), ingestion rate (IR), absorption efficiency (AE), respiration rate (RR), and ammonia excretion rate (AR) were significantly influenced by air exposure. When the duration of air exposure increased, simultaneous decrease in CR, IR and AE, and increase in RR and AR were observed. After re-immersing into seawater, these parameters of P. penguin exposed to less time (6 h or 9 h) and suitable temperature showed normal level after 96 h or less. Further, the air exposure influenced the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and malondialdehyde (MDA) content in hepatopancreas and hemolymph. SOD activities increased after air exposure, and stabilized thereafter. After 6 h of air exposure, activities of CAT, T-AOC and GSH-Px rapidly increased, before gradually decreasing. There were no significant differences in the MDA content of hepatopancreas after 6 h and 9 h of air exposure, however, significant differences were observed after 12 h of air exposure. MDA contents in hemolymph showed significant increase after 9 h and 12 h of air exposure. In this study, it was demonstrated that the air exposure associated with common aquaculture practices strongly affected the physiological energetics and oxidative stress of P. penguin. This showed that excessive air exposure (unfavorable temperature and long duration) might lead to irreversible injures in P. penguin. © 2020 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Reproductive success of endangered Humboldt penguin (Spheniscus humboldti) colonies in Peru has been associated with nesting habitat type, presumably due to differences in environmental exposure and activity patterns that may affect energy demands and metabolism. Gas chromatography and mass spectrometry were used to determine serum concentrations of 19 saccharides from 30 Humboldt penguins nesting at Punta San Juan, Peru in order to evaluate differences in metabolic state between penguins nesting in a sheltered burrow or crevice (n = 17) and those in exposed surface nests (n = 13). Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses identified serum saccharides (arabinose, maltose, glucose-6phosphate, and levoglucosenone in particular) that were nest-dimorphic with substantial differences between surface- and sheltered-nesting penguins. Four sugars (arabinose, xylose, fructose-6-phosphate, and sucrose) had ≥ 2-fold difference in concentration between nest types. Seven saccharides were in the top five subsets generated by discriminant analysis; four of these are simple sugars (D-glucopyranose, α ↘ β; D-glucose; D-maltose; and D-mannose) and three are derivatives (glucose 6-phosphate, levoglucosenone, and N-acetylglucosamine). D-ribose had the highest information values (generated from weight-of-evidence values) followed by glucose 6-phosphate, levoglucosenone, and D-galactose. Sex was not a significant predictor of saccharide concentration. Levoglucosenone, which is a metabolite of the environmental contaminant levoglucosan, was significantly higher in surface-nesting penguins, reflecting a higher rate of exposure in non-sheltered penguins. Differences in the saccharide profiles of surface- and sheltered-nesting Humboldt penguins likely reflect increased metabolic requirements of surface-nesters at Punta San Juan. Conservation of appropriate sheltered-nesting habitat for penguins is essential for sustained reproductive success and colony health. © 2020 Schaeffer et al.

ABSTRACT: We describe a partial skeleton of a stem group penguin from theWaipara Greensand in New Zealand, which is tentatively assigned to Muriwaimanu tuatahi. The fossil includes the first complete wing of a Paleocene penguin and informs on previously unknown features of the mandible and tibiotarsus of small-sized Sphenisciformes from theWaipara Greensand. The wing is distinguished by important features from that of all geologically younger Sphenisciformes and documents an early stage in the evolution of wing-propelled diving in penguins. In particular, the wing of the new fossil exhibits a well-developed alular phalanx and the distal phalanges are not flattened. Because the wing phalanges resemble those of volant birds, we consider it likely that the wing feathers remained differentiated into functional categories and were not short and scale-like as they are in extant penguins. Even though the flippers of geologically younger penguins may favor survival in extremely cold climates, they are likely to have been shaped by hydrodynamic demands. Possible selective drivers include a diminished importance of the hindlimbs in subaquatic propulsion, new foraging strategies (the caudal end of the mandible of the new fossil distinctly differs from that of extant penguins), or increased predation by marine mammals. © 2020 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Accurate long-term monitoring of a threatened species' population size and trend is important for conservation management. The endangered yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes) is a non-colonial breeder. Population monitoring of the subantarctic population has focused on beach counts rather than nesting birds. Here, we combined intensive nest-searching and counts of transiting penguins on Enderby Island, Auckland Islands, over 3 years to establish the relationship between count numbers and breeding birds. Morning beach counts of transiting penguins were extrapolated to estimate breeding population for the entire Auckland Island group from 2012 to 2017. Breeding numbers varied considerably between years, but overall did not appear to be declining in the short term. Breeding birds at the Auckland Islands averaged 577 pairs annually over the three groundtruthed breeding seasons, similar to the lower estimate of 520-680 pairs from the last survey in 1989, but less than the higher estimate of 650-1,009 pairs generated from that survey. Direct comparison of beach counts indicated a large decline, but these may be more prone to uncertainty. Large variations between years indicated variable breeding effort. The Auckland Islands (particularly Enderby Island) represent 37-49% of the total breeding population for yellow-eyed penguins, indicating the importance of the subantarctic populations for the species. We recommend ongoing monitoring, including markrecapture methods, for future population estimates. At least 50% of the individuals in an area should be marked to reduce confidence intervals of estimates. © 2020 Ornithological Society of New Zealand. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Intraspecific competition for food can be especially high in colonial breeding seabirds. To minimize colony-induced or annual foraging challenges, diet may vary among individuals, but few studies have simultaneously investigated the effects of both extrinsic conditions (e.g. colony or year effects) and parameters of an individual (e.g. sex, age or individual quality) on diet in seabirds. Using stable isotope analyses, we studied the diet of 214 Adelie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae of known sex, age and breeding quality, nesting in 2 colonies on Ross Island, Antarctica, over 3 breeding seasons. During the study, δ15N and δ13C isotope values were lower in penguins breeding at Cape Crozier compared to those at Cape Bird, revealing a difference in prey proportions. Cape Bird penguins were estimated to consistently consume more energy-rich silverfish Pleuragramma antarctica, while birds at Cape Crozier ate more crystal krill Euphausia crystallorophias. We also found inter-annual differences in diet, with a higher dietary fish proportion in both colonies during 2011. Males had significantly higher δ15N values, indicating a higher fish consumption than females. This sexual segregation in diet was particularly pronounced at Cape Bird, where the overall isotopic niche was wider than at Cape Crozier. Differences in diet among adults of varying ages only existed at Cape Bird, where middle-aged penguins consumed more fish than old and young penguins. This study provides evidence that Adelie penguin diet is largely driven by annual, seasonal and local abundances of prey, with only some individuals selectively foraging for more nutritional prey if prey choices are present. © 2020 Inter-Research.

ABSTRACT: The designation of Marine Protected Areas has become an important approach to conserving marine ecosystems that relies on robust information on the spatial distribution of biodiversity. We used GPS tracking data to identify marine Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs) for the Endangered northern rockhopper penguin Eudyptes moseleyi within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic. Penguins were tracked through-out their breeding season from 3 of the 4 main islands in the Tristan da Cunha group. Foraging trips remained largely within the EEZ, with the exception of those from Gough Island during the incubation stage. We found substantial variability in trip duration and foraging range among breeding stages and islands, consistent use of areas among years and spatial segregation of the areas used by neighbouring islands. For colonies with no or insufficient tracking data, we defined marine IBAs based on the mean maximum foraging range and merged the areas identified to pro-pose IBAs around the Tristan da Cunha archipelago and Gough Island. The 2 proposed marine IBAs encompass 2% of Tristan da Cunha's EEZ, and are used by all northern rockhopper penguins breeding in the Tristan da Cunha group, representing ~90% of the global population. Currently, one of the main threats to northern rockhopper penguins within the Tristan da Cunha EEZ is marine pollution from shipping, and the risk of this would be reduced by declaring waters within 50 nautical miles of the coast as ‘areas to be avoided’. © 2020.

ABSTRACT: Textural ageing is a technique that recognizes the bone texture as a clear indicator of the post-natal ontogenetic stages in birds. Although it was only tested in a few groups of birds, the results obtained in the pioneer works were widely applied. Though convinced of the effectiveness of this technique, we also believe that given the variability that exists between birds, its application should be done using a reliable comparative scale. In this contribution, a post-natal ontogenetic series for Pygoscelis antarctica was built to analyze the textural ageing in penguins. We used the same descriptive terms to characterize each texture as in previous contributions, to make the scales comparable to each other. The variations were standardized, and a new comparative scale for penguins was proposed. © 2020 Senckenbergische Naturforschende Gesellschaft. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of additional nucleus insertion and its corresponding position on the shell growth of Pteria penguin as well as the thickness of the resulting mabé pearls. The treatment applied was the insertions of nucleus: A (one into the left shell), B (two into the left shell), and C (one into each sides of the shell). After 4 mo of culture, the growth and structure of the layers in the pearl were observed. The development of pearl layers was observed using scanning electron microscope. Results show that the number of nuclei implanted in the shell has no significant impact on shell growth or thickness as well as the number of aragonite layers of mabé pearls. Growth data show changes in oyster shell height, length, and thickness of 11.55-14.78, 18.48-22.05, and 2.59-6.14 mm, respectively, for all treatments. The average thickness of nacre was 0.29-0.33 and 0.19-0.22 μm for the base and top of resulting mabé pearls, respectively. In general, the addition of two nuclei in a single pearl oyster can be used to increase mabé pearl production in the coastal areas of Palabusa Bay, Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia, which is suitable for the growth of pearl oysters. © 2020 National Shellfisheries Association.

ABSTRACT: Sex identification is crucial for behavioral, ecological and conservation studies. In monomorphic bird species, traditional methods for sex assessment require potentially invasive sampling and manipulation of individuals, such as through cloacal examination. Thus, molecular methods involving non-destructive sampling are needed to reduce the stress of animals under study. In monomorphic Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae), the use of a penguin-specific primer pair (PL/PR) to identify sex has been evaluated through DNA extracted from nondestructive feather samples. With penguin-specific primers for the CHD1 gene found on the sex chromosomes, we efficiently identified the sex of all sampled individuals (n = 92, belonging to 46 complete nesting pairs in study colonies; n = 26 belonging to surveyed individuals in a control colony). DNA extraction and PCR protocols to improve amplification success are reported. Our results were also confirmed through Sanger sequencing used to determine the previously unpublished sequences of the CHD1 alleles in Adélie penguins, which were subsequently deposited in GenBank and used to compare to similar species. In phylogenetic reconstructions, CHD1Z and CHD1W sequences of the Adélie Penguin grouped together with other Pygoscelis and were the sister group of Spheniscus and Eudyptes genera. © 2020 The Waterbird Society.

ABSTRACT: Free-ranging Humboldt penguin (HP, Spheniscus humboldti) populations are under pressure from resource competition with industrial fisheries, habitat loss, and El Niño Southern Oscillation events. Foraging patterns for this top marine predator change during periods of aberrant oceanographic conditions and scarce fish stock numbers. These radical dietary fluctuations can lead to poor fertility, early embryonic death, poor hatchability, suppressed immune function, high chick mortality, and illness. To understand the variability of nutrient status in reproductive seasons, we measured select circulating nutrient concentrations (fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and carotenoids, fatty acids, amino acids, minerals, and electrolytes) of 105 HP at Punta San Juan, Peru during the first reproductive seasons of 2007 and 2008. We determined significant differences in nutrient status between sexes, years of sampling, and reproductive stages. Males (4.5 ± 0.38 kg) weighed more than females (4.0 ± 0.29 kg) and exhibited higher concentrations of vitamin A (0.71 ± 0.11 vs. 0.61 ± 0.12 µg/ml) and docosahexaenoic acid (6.70 ± 1.61 vs. 5.65 ± 1.59%). Males also displayed lower concentrations of β-carotene (0.01 ± 0.01 vs. 0.012 ± 0.001 µg/ml) and phosphorus (3.43 ± 0.83 vs. 4.40 ± 1.66 mg/dl). Comparison between the 2 years showed most circulating amino acid concentrations were higher in 2007. Significant differences in circulating amino acids and vitamins were also noted between different reproductive stages. These results demonstrate concentrations of nutrients can vary due to the physiological state of the animal, as well as the overall dynamics of their marine ecosystem habitat. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: This study analyzes the scientific literature published on penguins in Argentina between 1985 and 2019. It examines the characteristics and the temporal variation in the number of publications, the total number of authors, the percentage of participation of Argentine researchers, the species and region of study, as well as the research topics they address. The results show a tendency towards an increase in papers and studies of these birds, the total number of authors, and the participation of researchers belonging to Argentine research centers during the period analyzed. The most studied penguin species was the Magellanic Penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus), followed by the Southern Rockhopper Penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome) and the Gentoo Penguin (Pygoscelis papua). The most addressed research topics were foraging and diet, followed by reproduction and reproductive success, conservation and wildlife management, population dynamics and physiology and histology, which were carried out mainly in the Patagonian region and in the Malvinas Islands. The results help to understand the past, present and future state of scientific literature, which will strengthen decision-making on future research on penguins. © 2020, Association Ornitologica del Plata.

ABSTRACT: Vector-borne Plasmodium spp. infect a wide range of bird species. Although infections may be asymptomatic, certain genera, especially those that evolved in regions without endemic malaria, appear particularly susceptible to symptomatic disease, leading to morbidity and mortality. High mortalities associated with malaria infections have been documented in captive species of Sphenisciformes, Somateria, and Larosterna, all genera that evolved in climates with low mosquito exposure. To better characterize trends in Plasmodium-related mortality in a zoological collection in New York, necropsy reports for birds of all three genera that died between 1998 and February 2018 were analyzed; comparisons were made between birds that died with or without evidence of malaria infection. A seasonal peak in deaths was observed in birds regardless of their malaria status. There was no significant difference in the age of birds at death between malaria-positive and malaria-negative animals. These results suggest that age and season of death were not associated with malaria status. To investigate an association between parasite lineage and clinical outcome, polymerase chain reaction was used to identify parasite lineage in necropsied birds as well as healthy birds sampled as part of surveillance studies. Twelve different Plasmodium lineages were identified. The relative prevalence of parasite lineages was compared between necropsy and surveillance samples. A single parasite lineage, SGS1 (species: Plasmodium relictum), was significantly more likely to be found in surveillance samples; it was detected in a plurality of surveillance data but found in only one necropsy case. Other parasite lineages were more likely to be found in necropsies than in surveillance samples, most notably SEIAUR01 (species: Plasmodium cathemerium). These data may be consistent with a difference in virulence between parasite lineages. This investigation has implications for the monitoring and care of vulnerable avian species. © 2020 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: Cardiocephaloides is a small genus of strigeid digeneans with an essentially cosmopolitan distribution. Most members of Cardiocephaloides are found in larid birds, however, Cardiocephaloides physalis is an exception and parasitizes penguins in some coastal regions of South America and South Africa. No prior molecular phylogenetic studies have included DNA sequence data of C. physalis. Herein, we provide molecular phylogenetic analyses of Cardiocephaloides using DNA sequences from five species of these strigeids. Methods: Adult Cardiocephaloides spp. were obtained from larid birds and penguins collected from 3 biogeographical realms (Palearctic, Nearctic and Neotropics). We have generated sequences of the complete ITS region and partial 28S gene of the nuclear ribosomal DNA, along with partial sequences of the mitochondrial CO1 gene for C. physalis, C. medioconiger and the type species of the genus, C. longicollis and used them for phylogenetic inference. Results: Cardiocephaloides spp. appeared as a 100% supported clade in the phylogenetic tree based on 28S sequences. The position of C. physalis varied between the phylogenetic trees based on the relatively conservative 28S gene on one hand, and variable ITS1 and COI sequences on the other. Cardiocephaloides physalis was nested within the clade of Cardiocephaloides spp. in the 28S tree and appeared as the sister group to the remaining members of the genus in the ITS1 region and COI trees. We detected 0.4–1.6% interspecific divergence in 28S, 1.9–6.9% in the ITS region and 8.7–11.8% in CO1 sequences of Cardiocephaloides spp. Our 28S sequence of C. physalis from South America and a shorter sequence from Africa available in the GenBank were identical. Conclusion: Cardiocephaloides as represented in the currently available dataset is monophyletic with C. physalis parasitism in penguins likely resulting from a secondary host-switching event. Identical 28S sequences of C. physalis from South America and Africa cautiously confirm the broad distribution of this species, although comparison of faster mutating genes (e. g., CO1) is recommended for a better substantiated conclusion. © 2020, Witold Stefański Institute of Parasitology, Polish Academy of Sciences.

ABSTRACT: Mayr, G., De Pietri, V.L., Love, L., Mannering, A. & Scofield, R.P., 9 August 2019. Leg bones of a new penguin species from the Waipara Greensand add to the diversity of very large-sized Sphenisciformes in the Paleocene of New Zealand. Alcheringa 44, 194–201. ISSN 0311-5518 We describe a new large-sized species of the Sphenisciformes (penguins) from Paleocene strata of the Waipara Greensand in New Zealand. ?Crossvallia waiparensis, sp. nov. is represented by leg bones of a single individual as well as two tentatively referred proximal humeri and resembles Crossvallia unienwillia from the late Paleocene of Antarctica in size and morphology. The new species is the fifth published species of stem group Sphenisciformes from the Waipara Greensand and the fourth one, which has been formally named. It is distinguished from a recently reported tarsometatarsus of an unnamed large-sized penguin species from the Waipara Greensand and is the oldest well-represented giant penguin. ?C. waiparensis approaches the size of the Eocene taxa Anthropornis and Palaeeudyptes and provides further evidence that penguins attained a very large size early in their evolutionary history.

ABSTRACT: An active Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) colony has been established on Martillo Island, Beagle Channel (54°54´26” S; 67°22´58” W) since 1976. It is located in remnants of eroded drumlins placed in both ending and joined by gravel terraces of glaciofluvial and marine origin. Forest patches occupy the eastern side of the island while most of the island is covered by bushes, tussocks and grasses. This paper presents penguins as bio-erosion agents on glacial and marine landforms. An analysis of multiple criteria surveyed in the field was performed, using Quantum GIS® 3.2.1 with remote sensing images and a digital model terrain of 12 m resolution. The morphometric data and multicriterial evaluation were collected during 2016-2017 austral summer. Soils and sediments of each landform (drumlin, glaciofluvial terrace, raised beach and beach) were sampled for particle size analysis, to determine if there is any relationship between the morphometric parameters of the cave and the sediments. Four bio-erosion classes were defined based on the erosion features observed in the field. “Moderate” was the prevailing erosion class recorded, in the E-NE part of the island. Bio-erosion features are mainly developed on the N facing slope of the east of the island, where a natural gully drains rainfall water, and over the glaciofluvial and marine terrace surfaces. Erosive features such as caves and bridges are mainly developed in silty drumlins. Pedestals are developed on bare soils and tussocks. Trails and cracks were also described as bio-erosion. No erosive features were recorded in the W part of the island. The bio-erosion map is one of the inputs for environmental degradation analysis and population dynamic research which is being done in the Magellanic penguin colony on Martillo Island, Beagle Channel. © Universidad de La Rioja.

ABSTRACT: The effects of soil succession after glacial retreat and fertilisation by marine animals are known to have major impacts on soil greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes in polar terrestrial ecosystems. While in many polar coastal areas retreating glaciers open up new ground for marine animals to colonise, little is known about the combination of both factors on the local GHG budget. We studied the magnitude of GHG fluxes (CO2, CH4 and N2O) on the combined effect of glacial retreat and penguin-induced fertilisation along a transect protruding into the world's largest King Penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus) colony at Saint Andrews Bay on sub-Antarctic South Georgia. GHG production and consumption rates were assessed based on laboratory incubations of intact soil cores and nutrients and water additional experimental incubations. The oldest soils along the transect show significant higher contents of soil carbon, nutrients and moisture and were strongly influenced by penguin activity. We found a net CH4 consumption along the entire transect with a marked decrease within the penguin colony. CO2 production strongly increased along the transect, while N2O production rates were low near the glacier front and increased markedly within the penguin colony. Controlled applications of guano resulted in a significant increase in CO2 and N2O production, and decrease in CH4 consumption, except for sites already strongly influenced by penguin activity. The results show that soil microbial activity promptly catalyses a turnover of soil C and atmospheric methane oxidation in de-glaciated forelands. The methane oxidizers, however, may increase relatively slowly in their capacity to oxidise atmospheric CH4. Results show also that the increase of nutrients by penguins reduces CH4 oxidation whereas N2O production is greatly increased. A future expansion of penguins into newly available ice-free polar coastal areas may therefore markedly increase the local GHG budget. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Avian malaria is a mosquito-borne disease that affects multiple avian species and is caused by protozoans of the genus Plasmodium. An avian malaria infection caused by Plasmodium sp. in Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) with high mortality is described in a zoo in Southern Brazil. Clinically, three birds presented signs of inappetence, anorexia, pale mucosa, dyspnea, and opisthotonus, with death in a clinical course of 5–8 h. At the necropsy, all birds exhibited pale mucosa, marked splenomegaly and hepatomegaly, in addition to moderate leptomeningeal blood vessels ingurgitation in the brain. Microscopically, multiple exoerythrocytic meronts were observed in the cytoplasm of endothelial cells in the spleen, liver, heart, lungs, brain, kidneys, and pancreas. The spleen had a multifocal perivascular inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages, which also exhibited hemosiderosis and erythrophagocytosis. The liver had a multifocal periportal inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes, macrophages, and plasma cells, in addition to marked hemosiderosis in the hepatic sinusoids. Fragments of spleen, liver, brain, skeletal muscle, and lung were tested by the polymerase chain reaction technique for the detection of a fragment of the cytochrome B gene from haemosporidians, which resulted positive for Plasmodium spp. After sequencing, the samples were phylogenetically associated to Plasmodium sp. detected in Turdus albicollis (KU562808) in Brazil and matched to the lineage TURALB01 previously detected in T. albicollis. Avian malaria infections caused by Plasmodium sp. of lineage TURALB01 may occur in S. magellanicus with high mortality, and, thus, it is essential to detect and characterize the agent involved to obtain the differential diagnosis of the condition. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The emergence of islands has been linked to spectacular radiations of diverse organisms. Although penguins spend much of their lives at sea, they rely on land for nesting and a high proportion of extant species are endemic to geologically young islands. Islands may thus have been crucial to the evolutionary diversification of penguins. We test this hypothesis using a fossil-calibrated phylogeny of mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) from all extant and recently extinct penguin taxa. Our temporal analysis demonstrates that numerous recent island-endemic penguin taxa diverged following the formation of their islands during the Plio-Pleistocene, including the Galapagos (Galapagos Islands), northern rock-hopper (Gough Island), erect-crested (Antipodes Islands), Snares crested (Snares) and royal (Macquarie Island) penguins. Our analysis also reveals two new recently extinct island-endemic penguin taxa from New Zealand's Chatham Islands: Eudyptes warhami sp. nov. and a dwarf subspecies of the yellow-eyed penguin, Megadyptes antipodes richdalei ssp. nov. Eudyptes warhami diverged from the Antipodes Islands erect-crested penguin between 1.1 and 2.5 Ma, shortly after the emergence of the Chatham Islands (∼3 Ma). This new finding of recently evolved taxa on this young archipelago provides further evidence that the radiation of penguins over the last 5 Ma has been linked to island emergence. Mitogenomic analyses of all penguin species, and the discovery of two new extinct penguin taxa, highlight the importance of island formation in the diversification of penguins, as well as the extent to which anthropogenic extinctions have affected island-endemic taxa across the Southern Hemisphere's isolated archipelagos. © The Author(s) 2019.

ABSTRACT: Avian malaria is a mosquito-borne disease caused by Plasmodium spp. protozoa, and penguins are considered particularly susceptible to this disease, developing rapid outbreaks with potentially high mortality. We report on an outbreak of avian malaria in Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) at a rehabilitation center in Espírito Santo, southeast Brazil. In August and September 2015, a total of 89 Magellanic penguins (87 juveniles and 2 adults) received care at Institute of Research and Rehabilitation of Marine Animals. Over a period of 2 weeks, Plasmodium infections were identified in eight individuals (9.0%), four of which died (mortality = 4.5%, lethality = 50%). Blood smears and sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene revealed the presence of Plasmodium lutzi SPMAG06, Plasmodium elongatum GRW06, Plasmodium sp. PHPAT01, Plasmodium sp. SPMAG10, and Plasmodium cathemerium (sequencing not successful). Two unusual morphological features were observed in individuals infected with lineage SPMAG06: (a) lack of clumping of pigment granules and (b) presence of circulating exoerythrocytic meronts. Hematological results (packed cell volume, plasma total solids, complete blood cell counts) of positive individuals showed differences from those of negative individuals depending on the lineages, but there was no overarching pattern consistently observed for all Plasmodium spp. The epidemiology of the outbreak and the phylogeography of the parasite lineages detected in this study support the notion that malarial infections in penguins undergoing rehabilitation in Brazil are the result of the spillover inoculation by plasmodia that circulate in the local avifauna, especially Passeriformes. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Aim: Organisms with poor intrinsic dispersal capacity, such as parasites, often rely entirely on transport with host species that have a greater dispersal capacity. Penguins, for example, are exploited by terrestrial ectoparasites when they come ashore to breed. Recent research indicates that Little Penguin (Eudyptula minor and E. novaehollandiae) hard ticks (Ixodes eudyptidis and I. kohlsi) may be capable of surviving short periods (days) at sea with their hosts, but their capacity to survive longer voyages (weeks) is not known. We here aimed to assess whether phylogeographical patterns in Little Penguins and their ticks indicate that the terrestrial ectoparasites are able to disperse long distances at sea with their swimming hosts. Location: Southern Australia and New Zealand. Taxon: Ixodes eudyptidis and I. kohlsi ticks. Methods: We conducted a broad-scale genomic assessment of Little Penguin ticks from across their hosts’ ranges in Australia and New Zealand. Using genotyping by sequencing, we generated SNP data sets from ticks from 14 penguin colonies, and analysed phylogeographical structure. We included ticks from some sympatric flighted seabirds to verify host specificity. Results: We resolved two distinct lineages of Ixodes from Little Penguins, with one restricted to Australia, and the other found throughout New Zealand and in low numbers at some eastern Australian sites. Both lineages exhibited phylogeographical structure consistent with patterns observed in their hosts, with some evidence of occasional oceanic dispersal, including across the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand. Ticks from sympatric short-tailed shearwaters (Ardenna tenuirostris), which disperse aerially, were genetically distinct from those collected from Little Penguins, supporting prior evidence of host specificity in seabird ticks. Main conclusions: The most parsimonious explanation for our results is that ticks can travel at sea with Little Penguins. We infer that some terrestrial ectoparasites associated with aquatically dispersing hosts have evolved the capacity to survive oceanic voyages. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

ABSTRACT: Even today, an effective diagnostic test for aspergillosis in penguins is unknown, being the gold standard post-mortem examinations. The fungal antigen galactomannan (GM) has been used as a biomarker of disease in humans and is detected by the Platelia Aspergillus EIA (BioRad)®, a commercial kit based on the sandwich ELISA technique. It is standardized for use in neutropenic patients, however studies have demonstrated its usefulness also possible for birds. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness of Platelia Aspergillus EIA® test (BioRad-US) in the diagnosis of aspergillosis in Magellanic penguins, determining sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for different cut-off points. Were included in the study, blood serum samples (n = 29) Magellanic penguins in captivity that died by aspergillosis. Detection of GM was performed following manufacturer’s instructions and the GM index was obtained by dividing the average value of OD of the duplicate of the clinical sample by duplicate OD of the average value of the cut-off sample provided by the kit. Through information database results were obtained for the presence of anti-Aspergillus fumigatus antibodies detected by agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) for all serum samples. Results were analyzed using chi-square test and Kruskal-Wallis from SPSS 20.0, IBM®. ROC curve was obtained and from this, rates of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were also calculated based on four different cutoff points (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0). The serum GM index did not differ between animals of the case and control group (pkw=0.097). In determining the ROC curve for serum GM detection the value of area under the curve was 0.635. From the values determined by the coordinate of the curve, four different cut points (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0) were analyzed, resulting in sensitivity rates ranging from 86.2 to 34.5% % and specificity between 87% and 26.1%. By comparing the serum GM index in group case as the presence or absence of antibodies detected by AGID was found p=0.503. The detection of GM the Platelia Aspergillus EIA® test seems is not be useful for the diagnosis of aspergillosis in naturally infected penguins. © 2019 Associação Brasileira de Saúde Coletiv.

ABSTRACT: The African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) is a critically endangered species endemic to southern Africa. Limited information is available on the parasite diversity associated with the species in natural settings. This study explores the diversity and incidence of parasites associated with African penguins and their nests, and records the effect of host and environmental factors on parasite infestation. Ecto-, haemo- and helminth parasites were recorded from 210 adult birds, 583 chicks and 628 nests across five colonies (two mainland and three islands) along the south-western coast of South Africa, in 2016 and 2017. Mean nest density (total and active nests) and climate variables (temperature and precipitation) were obtained for each colony. Parapsyllus humboldti was the most abundant and prevalent ectoparasite on penguins and in nests (69.10 and 57.80%, respectively), while Piroplasmorida/ Haemospororida (33.51%) and Cardiocephaloides spp. (56.17%) were the most prevalent haemo- and helminth parasites of penguins, respectively. In general parasite abundance and prevalence was significantly affected by penguin age (chicks vs adults), location (mainland vs islands), nest density (total and active nests) and season (spring vs autumn/winter). It is concluded that parasite infestations are structured and that penguin chicks at mainland colonies are more susceptible to parasite infestations during spring. © Cambridge University Press 2019.

ABSTRACT: During the 2011 M/V Rena oil spill in Tauranga, New Zealand, 383 little blue penguins (LBP, Eudyptula minor) were oiled, rescued and rehabilitated, with 90.6% surviving to be released back to the wild. We monitored the post-release breeding success of rehabilitated LBPs to assess the effectiveness of the rehabilitation process. Breeding success was monitored during the first breeding season post-release (2012−13) to assess productivity for both rehabilitated and control penguins (breeding pairs of rehabilitated or non-oiled (control) birds). Egg laying, hatching and fledging success rates for pairs of rehabilitated and control penguins were both within ranges reported for other LBP colonies in Australia and New Zealand. The only significant difference between rehabilitated and control pairs was that hatching success was reduced in the first season after release for rehabilitated pairs. Overall, rehabilitation appeared to reverse most potential negative effects of oiling on the post-release breeding success of rehabilitated LBP. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: In order to understand and mitigate for the potential impacts of anthropogenic disturbance on marine predators, it is fundamental to gain insight into the drivers behind the temporal variation in their current distribution. With this in mind, we used platform terminal transmitter devices to track Adélie Pygoscelis adeliae and Chinstrap Penguins Pygoscelis antarctica breeding on the South Orkney Islands during the pre-moult phase of their annual cycles. We show that Adélie Penguins have an affinity to forage near and moult on sea-ice, and that Chinstraps remain over the shallower shelf waters during pre-moult, and return to the colony to moult. However, habitat models developed to predict the preferred foraging habitats of penguins during pre-moult had low predictive power. This indicates that predictive models may be insufficient to understand the distribution and foraging behaviour of penguins during certain stages of the life-cycle, and that collecting empirical data from individual colonies or archipelagos is vital if we are to understand the potential implications of future climate warming, or indeed the overlap with potentially competing fisheries. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Breeding in most species is timed to coincide with the greatest availability of food resources to support the increased energetic needs of reproduction. Correspondingly, the majority (76%) of seabird species in temperate and polar regions breed in spring/summer, matching the peak in ocean productivity. The Fiordland penguin Eudyptes pachyrhynchus is one of only 34 seabird species worldwide that have part of their breeding cycle during the winter, and its chicks fledge when the eggs of congeneric Eudyptes species in the same region are only starting to hatch. Little is known of the foraging ecology of this species and the factors that may influence its timing of breeding. In the present study, the foraging behaviour of breeding individuals from Taumaka/Open Bay Island, New Zealand, was investigated using GPS, dive recorder and tri-axis accelerometer data loggers. In total, 35 individuals (4 males, 31 females) were tracked at sea, revealing extensive use of continental shelf slope (200−1000 m) habitat within 42 ± 5 km of the colony. Individuals foraged mostly during daylight in the epi-pelagic zone (mean modal depth 22 ± 2 m) and prey encounter events occurred in 50% of dives. Blood isotopic signatures suggest a trophic level indicative of squid consumption, supporting previous findings that winter-spawning squid are the most important prey type. The results of the present study suggest that a winter-breeding strategy by seabirds can reflect locally abundant prey resources and suitable conditions at the time for breeding. © Inter-Research 2019.

ABSTRACT: We determined the primary structures of jacalin-related lectins termed PPL3s (PPL3A, 3B, and 3C, which are dimers consisting of sequence variants α + α, a α β, β + β, respectively) and PPL4, which is heterodimer consisting of α + β subunits, isolated from mantle secretory fluid of Pteria penguin (Mabe) pearl shell. Their carbohydrate-binding properties were analyzed, in addition to that of PPL2A, which was previously reported as a matrix protein. PPL3s and PPL4 shared only 35-50% homology to PPL2A, respectively; they exhibited significantly different carbohydrate-binding specificities based on the multiple glycan binding profiling data sets from frontal affinity chromatography analysis. The carbohydrate-binding specificity of PPL3s was similar to that of PPL2A, except only for Man3Fuc1Xyl1GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide, while PPL4 showed different carbohydrate-binding specificity compared with PPL2A and PPL3s. PPL2A and PPL3s mainly recognize agalactosylatedand galactosylated-type glycans. On the other hand, PPL4 binds to high-mannose-and hybrid-type N-linked glycans but not agalactosylated- and galactosylated-type glycans. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: This study aimed to compare the venous acid-base status of healthy awake versus anesthetized Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus). Ten nonanesthetized penguins were manually restrained, and a venous blood sample was collected. Six of these penguins were anesthetized by 2% isoflurane and, after an anesthetic stabilization period, both venous and arterial blood samples were simultaneously withdrawn. Using an i-STAT analyzer, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2), partial pressure of oxygen (PO2), pH, standard bicarbonate concentration (HCO3 -), total carbon dioxide (ctCO2), oxygen saturation (SO2), base excess (BE), Na+, and K+ levels were measured in venous blood samples of awake (G awake) penguins and in venous (G ven) and arterial blood (G art) samples of anesthetized penguins. There were no significant differences between groups in pH, BE, or Na+. Venous carbon dioxide pressure, HCO3 -, and venous ctCO2 were higher in G ven than G awake penguins, whereas PCO2 was higher in G ven than G art penguins. PO2 and SO2 were higher in the G art group than in the other groups. Both venous and arterial blood samples may be used to evaluate the acid-base profile of Magellanic penguins. © 2019 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: We performed stable carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) isotope analyses of 12 ancient Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) chick mummies recovered from abandoned colonies in the Ross Sea region, Antarctica, to investigate isotopic variation and fractionation over time. We also examined latitudinal variation in penguin diet to address if the modern dietary pattern (an increase in krill as dominant prey to the north) in this region has existed in the past or if this is a recent phenomenon. The ancient mummies range in age from > 48,000 14C years before present (BP) to ~ 500 calendar years BP. Feather, skin, bone, and toenail samples were analyzed from each individual where available. Identical analyses were performed on five modern mummified Adélie penguin chick carcasses and breast feathers of ten recently dead chicks from each of two active colonies, Cape Hallett and Adélie Cove. We found significantly lower δ15N values in Cape Hallett modern chicks as compared to those from Adélie Cove, indicating an entire trophic-level difference in modern diet that agrees with other studies in this region. The ancient mummies exhibited consistent isotopic fractionation of δ13C among the four different tissues through time. Variation in δ15N and δ13C values was greater in bone and skin than in feather or toenail, but δ15N in all four tissues indicated similar dietary trends with latitude as occurs in this region today. These results provide insight into the dietary variability of Adélie penguins across the Ross Sea region and a framework for similar analyses with other avian species. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Blood parameters (hematology and biochemistry) are useful in assessing the physiological, nutritional, and overall health status of both captive and free-ranging wildlife. In this study, we established baseline values for blood parameters (hematology, plasma biochemistry, and trace elements) of free-ranging adult Magellanic Penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) sampled at ten breeding colonies covering their full latitudinal distribution in Patagonia over two decades. Males had higher packed cell volume, heterophil and eosinophil relative counts, total solids, copper, and iron but lower magnesium than females. We also compared our results with those obtained in previous studies on both captive and free-ranging Magellanic Penguins and other Spheniscus species. Our study provides a baseline for ecological studies investigating the physiological responses of this species to natural and anthropogenic changes. Furthermore, our findings provide clinically relevant reference values for Magellanic Penguins under care at zoos, aquaria, and rehabilitation centers. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: This paper provides a demographic analysis of six years information collected on an African penguin (Sphenicus demersus) colony of Underwater World Langkawi (UWL) at Langkawi Island, Kedah, Peninsular Malaysia. These information include reproduction, sex ratio, seasonality, egg-laying date interval and age range of breeding. From the period of 2006 to 2011, 27 chicks survived while 16 chicks died within six years. The sex ratio favoured the female with 1.8:1 in 2006 and 1.38:1 in 2011, although the gender of about 14 second-generation individuals was unknown. Eggs were laid in all months of the year, but a higher frequency was observed between August and January or between autumn and winter (in the southern area). The calculated interval of egg-laying dates for each egg production was 6.719 ± 4.18 months. The mean intervals of egg-laying dates for identified females were 9.239 ± 4.26 months and 5.196 ± 3.34 months for rear infants and non-rear offspring, respectively. The age at first female egg production ranged between six and twenty years and the males that are actively involved in brooding at the age between three and twenty years. The age of the mother at first weaning of the offspring ranged from six and twenty years (n=43), while the males had first paternity between the ages of three and twenty three years (n=43). Monogamous breeding in the first two years (2006 and 2007) of this study was due to imbalance sex ratio between male and female (2:1) and respectively 1:1 or 1:2 between male to females. The captive colony grew at an average rate of 1.172 per individual per year. In 2011, the calculated rate was 1.15, indicating that the rate remained almost constant. Infant mortality in the first two months was 32.5%. This information is beneficial to increase the effectiveness of the management and conservation of African penguins in captivity. © 2019, Malaysian Society of Applied Biology. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Popular science writing has received increasing interest, especially in its relation to professional science. I extend the current scholarly focus from the nineteenth to the twentieth century by providing a microhistory of the early popular writings of evolutionary biologist John Maynard Smith (1920–2004). Linking them to the state of evolutionary biology as a professional science as well as Maynard Smith’s own professional standing, I examine the interplay between author, text and audiences. In particular, I focus on Maynard Smith’s book The Theory of Evolution (Penguin 1958) and show how he used it to both promote neo-Darwinism and advocate the utility of mathematics in biology. Following in the footsteps of Charles Darwin and David Lack, Maynard Smith was a science communicator blurring the lines between genres (popular, professional, textbook) and audiences (expert and non-expert) while contributing to ongoing discussions within and on the profession of evolutionary biology around the Darwin-Wallace centenary. © 2019, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The impacts of tourism on wildlife have long been a concern in areas where ecotourism is a major industry. The issue is especially pressing in Antarctica, which has a rapidly growing tourism industry largely concentrated around penguin colonies on the Antarctic Peninsula. Guidelines developed by both the Committee for Environmental Protection and the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators include measures to minimize wildlife impacts. In this study, we examined the relationship between physiologic stress in Gentoo Penguins (Pygoscelis papua) and tourism. Corticosterone is an adrenal glucocorticoid that has been shown in previous studies to increase in response to stressors such as low food availability, environmental conditions, as well as human visitation and proximity. Fecal glucocorticoids (FGM; primarily corticosterone and metabolites) were measured in Gentoo Penguin guano collected at 19 breeding colonies (n = 108, 3–10 samples per site) on the Antarctic Peninsula and the South Shetland Islands, representing a wide range of tourism visitation. We found a large degree of variation in FGM concentrations, and no relationship between FGM concentrations and number of tourists landed at that site. These results suggest that current tourism management guidelines on the Antarctic Peninsula are effective at preventing increased stress in Gentoo Penguins as measured by hormonal markers, and demonstrate the use of guano as a non-invasive, low-impact methodology for monitoring Gentoo Penguin stress. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Toxoplasmosis has been reported in many avian species, but little information is available from wild penguin populations. Leptospira can infects domestic and wild animals. Spheniscus magellanicus belong to the order Sphenisciformes, family Spheniscidae, and are colonial birds. These seabirds live in temperate waters along the Atlantic shores of South America, and their total population has been estimated to be 1,300,000 breeding pairs. Magdalena Island (Chile) hosts an important breeding colony but, over recent decades, a marked decline in the number of birds has been seen. The objective of this study was to determine occurrences of antibodies against T. gondii and Leptospira spp. in penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) on Magdalena Island, from where no previous data on these agents were available. Serum samples were collected from 132 penguins on Magdalena Island. Antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii were detected using the modified agglutination test (Titer ≥20), and anti-Leptospira spp. antibodies were detected using the microscopic agglutination test (Titer ≥100). T. gondii antibodies were detected in 57 (43.18%) of the 132 serum samples, with titers that ranged from 20 to 320. None of the penguins in this study was reactive to anti-Leptospira spp. antibodies. This is the first report of T. gondii seropositivity in free-living Magellanic penguins in Chile. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Traces of skeletal response to trauma are poorly documented for early (i.e. Paleogene, 66–23 Ma) penguins (Sphenisciformes) and infectious diseases that afflicted these seabirds have not been previously put on record. We report osteomyelitis (OM), typically a bacterial infection of bone, in a proximal pedal phalanx of a ‘giant’ penguin from the Eocene (56–34 Ma) of West Antarctica. Osteomyelitis had apparently complicated healing of a fracture. The injury left an oblique scar within the proximal aspect of the plantar surface, resulting in deformation of the articular surface. The recognised evidence of OM includes characteristic periosteal reaction as well as focal bone-loss and necrosis. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Antarctic seabirds well adapted to extreme environments often deal during their life cycle with sub-optimal conditions and occasionally with severe environmental stress. Climate changes, pollution, habitat loss, increasing human presence can all significantly affect organism’s health status from molecular to individual up to population level. In the present study, erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities (ENAs) and white blood cells (WBCs) differential were investigated in 19 adults of Adélie penguin (Pygoscelisadeliae) breeding at Edmonson Point, Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA n. 165) in the Ross Sea. Micronuclei (MN) accounted for 10.50% of observed abnormalities in penguin erythrocytes while kidney-shaped nucleus (KSN) was the most abundant (20.88%). Heterophils (HE) were the most common WBC (36.93%) in agreement with the generic avian leukocytes profile while eosinophils (EO) were the lowest (7.45%). A low number of lymphocytes were detected resulting in a higher heterophils to lymphocytes ratio. ENAs and H:L ratio are confirmed as reliable indexes of penguin’s health status since they reflect their individual adaptation during breeding season. These baseline data will be useful for future studies as indicators of penguin’s health status mainly as response to environmental changes. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Daily rhythms enable organisms to adapt to daily fluctuations in environmental factors. Do organisms still exhibit 24-h rhythms when living in habitats without obvious daily cycles in external signals? To answer this question, we measured the heart rates of six Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) chicks on Inexpressible Island during the polar day between 15 and 21 January 2019. Averaged heart rates were between 186 and 233 beats/min for individual chicks. Both fast Fourier transformation and autocorrelation were employed to assess the daily rhythmicity. Based on fast Fourier transformation, a significant contribution of daily rhythm in heart rate variation was found only in one individual. Small effect size of significant autocorrelation coefficients was found in two individuals, while there was no significant autocorrelation coefficient for 24-h time lag in four other individuals. In summary, no prevailing daily rhythm of heart rate was found in these Adélie penguin chicks. We propose that the lack of daily rhythm in Adélie penguin chicks could be an adaptation to the local environment in the polar regions, but that the adaptive value thereof remains to be investigated. © The Author(s), 2020.

ABSTRACT: Life-history stages such as reproduction and molt are energetically costly. Reproductive costs include those associated not only with offspring production, but also protecting and provisioning young. Costs typically associated with molting include decreased thermoregulatory and locomotive performance, and increased metabolic and nutritional costs. Energetic demands may disrupt homeostasis, particularly in terms of its maintenance (e.g., oxidative stress and immunity). Few investigators have explored the relationship between effort (increased metabolic rate) and oxidative status and stress by comparing life-history stages with different energetic demands. However, comparative studies are crucial for understanding the processes of energy allocation and their consequences for different physiological functions. Our objective was to determine how two highly demanding life-history stages, breeding and molting, affected oxidative balance in Chinstrap Penguins (Pygoscelis antarcticus), a species where these two activities do not overlap. We found that the heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratio was significantly higher during breeding than molting; oxidative damage was also higher during breeding. In contrast, we found no significant differences between these stages in total antioxidant capacity. We also found sex differences, with males having greater oxidative damage than females. Our results suggest that breeding is more stressful and more demanding for Chinstrap Penguins than molting, and provide further support for the relationship between effort, in terms of increased metabolic rate, and oxidative balance. © 2019 Association of Field Ornithologists

ABSTRACT: Picornaviridae family comprises single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses distributed into forty-seven genera. Picornaviruses have a broad host range and geographic distribution in all continents. In this study, we applied a high-throughput sequencing approach to examine the presence of picornaviruses in penguins from King George Island, Antarctica. We discovered and characterized a novel picornavirus from cloacal swab samples of gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua), which we tentatively named Pingu virus. Also, using RT-PCR we detected this virus in 12.9 per cent of cloacal swabs derived from P. papua, but not in samples from adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) or chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarcticus). Attempts to isolate the virus in a chicken cell line and in embryonated chicken eggs were unsuccessful. Our results expand the viral diversity, host range, and geographical distribution of the Picornaviridae.  © 2019 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Optimal foraging theory suggests that the environment (e.g. distribution of resource patches) will shape an individual's decision to exploit the resource available or explore other locations. Together with the environment and the social context, individual characteristics such as personality have been recently discovered to affect behaviour, offering new insights in the field of behavioural ecology. In many species, personality types differ in breeding success, and foraging behaviour could potentially mediate the influence of personality on reproductive output. A recent study conducted on African penguins, Spheniscus demersus, revealed that bold and shy individuals raised chicks with different growth rates. Here we investigated whether strategies of resource acquisition vary with personality, that is, boldness degree, which may explain the differences in breeding success previously observed in this endangered species. Over 3 years, we deployed GPS loggers, sometimes in conjunction with time–depth recorders, on chick-rearing penguins on Bird Island, Algoa Bay, South Africa, and recorded their boldness degree using a standard human approach protocol. Bolder females, but not males, foraged following a more sinuous path than shyer ones. Similarly, wiggle frequency and the total vertical distance travelled underwater increased with female boldness degree. These results suggest different resource acquisition strategies between personality types in female African penguins. However, none of the foraging or diving behaviour characteristics influenced breeding success. These findings suggest that personality may influence breeding success through other mechanisms (e.g. chick provisioning). Our study indicates that, in this species, some nest behaviours (i.e. proxy of personality) may link with foraging and diving behaviours more than others. Nevertheless, the sex-specific adaptation observed in foraging and diving behaviour may result from a differential investment in the breeding season and reduce intraspecific competition for food in this species. © 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ABSTRACT: Whole blood, serum, and feather samples from 29 Humboldt Penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) at the Punta San Juan Marine Protected Area, Peru, were analyzed for 55 toxic and essential elements by using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Mercury (Hg) was analyzed by cold vapor atomic fluorescence. Maximum Hg concentrations in serum (0.0056 mg/g), whole blood (0.297 mg/kg), and feathers (1.8 mg/kg dry weight) were at levels generally not considered to cause health impairment. Of the elements analyzed, only eight (aluminum, calcium, iron, Hg, potassium, magnesium, sodium, and zinc) were detected in serum. These elements, plus selenium and titanium, were also quantifiable in whole blood. Feather analysis detected quantifiable values for the elements found in serum, plus arsenic, boron, barium, copper, manganese, and titanium. Results indicate this important breeding population of endangered penguins did not appear to be exposed to environmental elemental contaminants at levels detrimental to health and reproductive success. However, identification of measurable concentrations of toxic elements at low levels underscores the need for continued environmental monitoring, particularly in the face of expanding regional human populations and industrial growth. These results provide important reference data for temporospatial monitoring of this and other penguin populations. © Wildlife Disease Association 2019.

ABSTRACT: Nest site selection in birds is expected to represent a trade-off between a suitable microclimate for thermoregulation and visual protection against predators or social disturbance. In this study, I examine the influence of different characteristics of the nesting habitat on breeding success, predation, and the nesting behaviours of Little Penguins (Eudyptula minor) in South Australia to help understand potential fitness benefits, costs or trade-offs associated with nesting habitat selection. I found that neither predation nor vigilance were influenced by the characteristics of the nest. However, nest type was an important factor for both breeding success and thermoregulation: birds nesting in rock nests had the highest hatching and breeding success, while individuals nesting in artificial nests engaged more in maintenance behaviours, suggesting that thermoregulation demands may be the most important factors for nest site selection in Little Penguins. © 2019, Deutsche Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.

ABSTRACT: A group of zoo-housed little penguins (Eudyptula minor) was diagnosed with mycobacteriosis. While undergoing multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) imaging for an unrelated research project, pulmonary lesions were detected in multiple individuals. In general, birds appeared healthy and free of outward signs of disease. After the loss of three individuals, polyclonal mycobacterial disease due to Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex was confirmed. Surviving birds were treated with rifampin (45 mg/kg), ethambutol (30 mg/kg), clarithromycin (10 mg/kg), and enrofloxacin (30 mg/kg) compounded into a single capsule administered once a day in food. After 3 mo of therapy, MDCT imaging documented a decrease in nodule size and number in all remaining birds, with further improvement documented after 13 mo of treatment. MDCT imaging was invaluable for diagnosing disease, documenting disease progression over time, and assessing response to therapy. Early initiation of therapy before the development of outward signs of disease led to resolution of mycobacterial pulmonary lesions in multiple penguins. Mycobacterial disease in this group of little penguins, as well as previously published reports, suggests that the species is at increased risk for developing mycobacteriosis. © 2019 Copyright 2019 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Summary Human disturbance can have behavioural, physiological and population-level consequences on wildlife. Unregulated tourism is having a negative effect on the endangered Yellow-eyed Penguin Megadyptes antipodes on mainland New Zealand. Subantarctic Yellow-eyed Penguins are exposed to tourism on Enderby Island in the Auckland Islands group, 450 km south of New Zealand. Restrictions and guidelines for tourism are in place on Enderby Island, but there has been little study on the efficacy of these. We quantified behavioural responses of the Yellow-eyed Penguin on Enderby Island to human presence by documenting movement patterns and behaviour of penguins in the presence and absence of humans, through both controlled approaches and monitoring penguin behaviour in the presence of tourists. We used these data to model the effective approach distances for reducing disturbance. Human presence caused a significant drop in the probability of a successful transit to or from their nest, and significantly increased the time penguins spent alert and decreased the time spent preening. Modelling showed the distance from a human to a penguin is a significant predictor of the likelihood of a bird displaying disturbance behaviour, with the current minimum approach guideline of 5 m not sufficient for preventing disturbance. Our results indicate that the minimum approach guideline needs to be revised if the probability of disturbance is to be reduced. Modelling the appropriateness of minimum approach guidelines by predicting the probability of disturbance is a useful technique that could be applied to other species and systems. Worldwide, management guidelines need to be scientifically evaluated to ensure efficacy and cater for the more sensitive species affected. © BirdLife International 2018.

ABSTRACT: Nature is an amazing source of inspiration for the design of thermal insulation strategies, which are key for saving energy. In nature, thermal insulation structures, such as penguin feather and polar bear hair, are well developed; enabling the animals’ survival in frigid waters. The detailed microscopy investigations conducted in this study, allowed us to perform microstructural analysis of these thermally insulating materials, including statistical measurements of keratin fiber and pore dimensions directly from high resolution Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images. The microscopy study revealed many similarities in both materials, and showed the importance of their hierarchically-organized porous structure. Finally, we propose the schematic configuration of a thermally-insulating structure, based on the penguin feather and polar bear hair. These optimized thermal-insulator systems indicate the road maps for future development, and new approaches in the design of material properties. Statement of significance: We present the first detailed comparison of microstructures of penguin feather and polar bear hair for designing optimum thermal insulation properties. This unique study involves the measurement of the sizes of pores and fibers of these two keratin-based materials, including the investigation of their 3D arrangements. We revealed porosity interconnection, especially in polar bear hair, which is one of the key designs exhibited by thermal insulation materials. © 2019 Acta Materialia Inc.

ABSTRACT: The African Penguin Spheniscus demersus is an endangered seabird endemic to southern Africa, and killing sprees by terrestrial predators have been one of the main threats for its mainland colonies. The methods employed to manage predators may differ depending on the species involved, therefore the implementation of strategies to limit the impacts of predation relies on the correct identification of the culprit predator. We report and quantify the lesions seen in African Penguins killed by four species of terrestrial predators: Caracal Caracal caracal (52 kills), Leopard Panthera pardus (27 kills), Domestic Dog Canis lupus familiaris (10 kills), and Cape Grey Mongoose Galerella pulverulenta (4 kills). We discuss patterns of necropsy findings that can be used to identify the predator species involved. Traditional forensic methods are useful tools to direct species-specific management actions for the conservation of the African Penguin and other seabirds so that effective mitigating measures can be deployed quickly to prevent further losses. It should be borne in mind, however, that the age, size and previous hunting experience of the predator are likely to influence the pattern of lesions that will be observed, and not all carcasses will have hallmark lesions or recognisable bite marks. © 2019, © 2019 NISC (Pty) Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Breeding seabirds must balance self-care and reproduction, especially once offspring have hatched and have to be fed regularly. Seabirds may selectively provision chicks with higher quality food than they consume themselves. In contrast, adults may prioritize their survival rather than their progeny by feeding chicks with lower quality prey items than they feed themselves. We examined the parental provisioning strategies of southern rockhopper penguins at Isla de los Estados in 2012 using nitrogen (δ15N) and carbon (δ13C) stable isotope analysis to determine if selective provisioning and foraging habitat differences exist between parents and their offspring. We found that chicks had higher δ15N values compared to both male and female penguins, and female had slightly higher δ15N values compared to male penguins. There was also a strong positive relationship in δ15N values between female penguins and their offspring, indicating that chicks’ diet resembles the female parent more than the male parent. Our results support the hypothesis of selective provisioning of chicks with higher trophic level (i.e., δ15N value) prey and the observation that females exclusively feed chicks during the guard stage. We did not find differences in δ13C values between adult and chicks suggesting no differences in the areas or habitats used to forage for self-provisioning and chick-provisioning. These findings likely have broader significance as provisioning rates and quality of food consumed by chicks is often strongly related to chick growth and survival. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: We evaluated the health status of Magellanic Penguins Spheniscus magellanicus inhabiting a region on the Valdés Peninsula (Patagonia, Argentina) that is subject to extensive tourism. We compared individuals nesting along tour trails with others inhabiting non-touristic zones. Hematocrits, blood cell counts, glucose, cholesterol, total proteins, and heterophil/lymphocyte were considered as stress indices. Most parameters were not affected by tourism. Adults and chicks tested positive for bacterial pathogens in both the touristic and control areas. These data complemented a long-term database of systematic physiological monitoring on penguins and will be useful tools for future comparative analyses. © 2019, Marine Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: Ehrlichia spp. are obligatory intracellular microorganisms that infect hematopoietic, endothelial or blood cells of mammals. Ticks are the only vectors of these agents in nature. To date, the role of birds and their associated ticks as reservoirs of ehrlichiae remains almost unexplored. In this study, we performed a molecular screening for bacteria of Anaplasmataceae family in samples of spleen (n = 72) and lung (n = 17), recovered from 72 carcasses of Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) in Brazil and Chile. One apparently unengorged tick (Ixodes uriae) was also collected while wandering upon one of the carcasses and submitted to molecular analyses as well. Through conventional and nested PCR protocols three genes (16S rRNA, dsb and groEL) of a new Ehrlichia sp. were partially characterized upon organs of three penguins and in the tick coming from Magdalena Island (Chile). First matches after BLASTn comparisons showed that our sequences share 99.4% (16S rRNA), 94.6% (groEL) and 79.3% (dsb) of identity with “Candidatus Ehrlichia ornithorhynchi”, Ehrlichia sp. NS101 and Ehrlichia canis CCZ, respectively. Matrixes of genetic distance including other representatives of the Ehrlichia genus point a 99.4%, 94.0%, and 80.0% of identity with 16S rRNA, groEL and dsb genes from Ehrlichia sp. It25, Ehrlichia sp. NS101, and Ehrlichia chaffeensis San Louis, respectively. A Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of Anaplasmataceae 16S rRNA gene places the detected Ehrlichia sp. into a group with Ehrlichia sp. BAT and Ehrlichia sp. Natal. Although depicting different topologies, Bayesian unrooted phylogenetic trees constructed for groEL and dsb genes position this Ehrlichia sp. into well-supported branches, which reinforces the finding of a new taxon. For the moment, any pathogenic effect of this new Ehrlichia sp. on penguins is still unknown. However, this fact becomes important to assess from a conservation point of view since populations of Magellanic penguins are currently threatened and in an ongoing decrease. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH

ABSTRACT: Three novel Avian avulavirus species were discovered and isolated during 2017 from Gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) at Kopaitic island in the Northwestern region of the Antarctic Peninsula. The viruses were officially named as Avian avulavirus 17 (AAV17), Avian avulavirus 18 (AAV18) and Avian avulavirus 19 (AAV19), collectively referred to as penguin avulaviruses (PAVs). To determine whether these viruses are capable of infecting the three species of Pygoscelis spp. penguins (Gentoo, Adelie and Chinstrap) and assess its geographical distribution, serum samples were collected from seven locations across the Antarctic Peninsula and Southern Shetland Islands. The samples were tested by Hemagglutination inhibition assay using reference viruses for AAV17, AAV18 and AAV19. A total of 498 sera were tested, and 40 were positive for antibodies against AAV17, 20 for AAV18 and 45 for AAV19. Positive sera were obtained for the penguin's species for each virus; however, antibodies against AAV18 were not identified in Adelie penguins. Positive penguins were identified in all regions studied. Positive locations include Ardley Island and Cape Shirreff at Livingston Island (Southern Shetland Region); Anvers Island, Doumer Island and Paradise Bay in the Central Western region; and Avian Island at Southwestern region of the Antarctic Peninsula. The lowest occurrence was observed at the Southwestern region at Lagotellerie Island, where all samples were negative. On the other hand, Cape Shirreff and Paradise Bay showed the highest antibody titres. Field samples did not evidence cross-reactivity between viruses, and detection was significantly higher for AAV19 and lower for AAV18. This is the first serologic study on the prevalence of the novel Avian avulaviruses including different locations in the white continent. The results indicate that these novel viruses can infect the three Pygoscelis spp. penguins, which extend across large distances of the Antarctic Peninsula. © 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

ABSTRACT: Background: The early life of marine apex predators is poorly known, particularly for diving species. The orientation and foraging skills are presumably less developed in juveniles than in adults, especially during their first year at sea when juveniles might disperse further than adults. Methods: Over two years of monitoring, we tracked the movements of 17 juvenile king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus, ~ 1 year old) using satellite relay tags from Crozet Archipelago (Southern Indian Ocean), starting when birds left their natal colony for the first time. For comparison we also tagged 6 non-breeding adults, which at that stage, similar to juveniles, are unhampered by reproductive constraints and might roam further than breeders. We used a combination of cluster analysis and habitat modelling to investigate and compare the movement patterns and habitat use of experienced (non-breeding adults) and non-experienced (juveniles) individuals. Results: While juvenile penguins and non-breeding adults followed similar routes, the movements by adults started later in the season and ranged over a considerably smaller area than juveniles. Net squared displacement analysis revealed that both groups did not move to a specific wintering area. Changes in direction of juveniles in respect to their departure island were similar and synchronous for both years. Habitat models revealed that foraging behaviour was affected by environmental variables such as wind or current speeds, sea surface temperature, or oceanic productivity, for both stages. Analysis of tracks revealed that birds moved predominately perpendicular or against the main direction of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the prevailing wind during austral summer (juveniles only) and autumn (juveniles and non-breeding adults). However, both juveniles and adults were more likely to move against the prevailing winds if productivity increased along their trajectories. Conclusions: The exceptional duration of our tracking study provided unprecedented insights into the distribution, habitat preferences and orientation of two poorly known life history stages of an expert avian diver. Our study suggests that juveniles might use both innate and learnt skills to reach profitable foraging areas during their first year at sea, which is critical in long-lived species. © 2019 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: This report describes an outbreak of erysipelas in a colony of captive Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti). The only previously reported case in a related species was of an individual little blue penguin (Eudyptula minor). Five Humboldt penguins in a mixed colony displayed non-specific signs of illness, including lethargy, inappetence and regurgitation after movement for exhibit upgrading. There was no improvement after 5 days of treatment with oral enrofloxacin (10 mg/kg q24h). Four Humboldt penguins, including two that were not part of the original five displaying signs of illness, died during this outbreak and Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae was cultured from organ samples collected post mortem. Oral clavulanic acid/amoxycillin (125 mg/kg q12h) was added to the treatment of the sick Humboldt penguins, as well as itraconazole (8.5 mg/kg q12h) and silymarin (10 mg/kg q24h) for 10 days (both per os), which resolved their clinical signs. The likely source of E. rhusiopathiae was the fish they were fed, but this could not be confirmed. Another contributing factor to the growth of E. rhusiopathiae in the exhibit pool was the increase in water temperature due to a fault in the water circulating system. The temperature of the pool water had increased to 29°C, which was rectified, and the water temperature decreased to 13°C. However, there was one further Humboldt penguin death after the decrease in water temperature. This episode suggests that E. rhusiopathiae infection should be high on the differential list of piscivorous avian species with non-specific clinical signs. A liver biopsy for bacterial culture and sensitivity may be required for definitive diagnosis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: A long-standing question in ecology is how predators interact with their environment when locating patchily distributed prey. There is some evidence to suggest that marine predators use environmental features as foraging cues at meso-scales (100−1000 km); however, the role of environmental structure at finer scales (1−100 km) is less well understood. To investigate how marine predators respond to fine-scale environmental variability, the movement patterns of 29 GPS-tagged little penguins Eudyptula minor from 3 colonies in the highly variable Storm Bay ecosystem in south-eastern Tasmania, Australia, were analysed using hidden Markov behavioural state modelling alongside high-resolution environmental data. Variability in at-sea behavioural states was observed between colonies correlating with differences in fine-scale environmental parameters. There were significant differences in trip metrics and time spent in each of the identified behavioural states between each of the study colonies. Additionally, transitions between behavioural states were associated with different environmental parameters at each site. This variability in foraging behaviour for conspecifics at similar temporal scales illustrates the significance of fine-scale environmental variability in determining at-sea predator behaviour and highlights how even subtle differences in fine-scale environmental parameters can lead to alternative foraging strategies. This flexibility suggests a capacity to behaviourally adapt to variable and changing environmental conditions, a necessary condition for persistence in a changing world. © The authors 2019.

ABSTRACT: Penguins globally are of conservation concern due to rapid decreases in many populations. Royal penguins (Eudyptes schlegeli) are endemic to Macquarie Island and its offshore islands and the current population status of this species is unknown. Here, we present a contemporary population estimate, undertaken in 2016 using precise global position system technology. Between August and December 2016, all royal penguin colonies were visited and the number of breeding pairs estimated by mapping the perimeters of colonies and applying a nest density estimate. The royal penguin population was estimated at 750,037 breeding pairs (range 669,538–830,154 pairs). The estimate is slightly lower than a previous estimate in 1984, but given the refined methods it was not possible to establish a significant difference or that a decrease in the population has not occurred. Future censuses utilising a consistent methodology are required to more accurately determine the current population trend. Establishing the current status of the royal penguin population will help assess the species vulnerability to several threats that are impacting similar species in the sub-Antarctic region, and inform conservation planning and management. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT:                              The time that penguins devote to aquatic behaviors likely has important implications for their welfare in zoos and aquariums. For decades, field researchers have used time-depth recorders (TDRs) to understand the behavior of penguins at sea. However, zoos and aquariums have rarely used these tools, and wearing devices can potentially affect animals negatively by causing discomfort or imposing energetic costs. We evaluated the long-term behavioral responses of 27 penguins (n = 8 king penguins, Aptenodytes patagonicus; n = 3 gentoo penguins, Pygoscelis papua ellsworthi; n = 8 macaroni penguins, Eudyptes chrysolophus; and n = 8 southern rockhopper penguins, Eudyptes chrysocome) before, during, and after wearing TDRs in an ABA study design. Our novel method involved affixing the TDRs to a custom-designed cradle and securing them on the penguins using flipper bands, which the penguins were accustomed to wearing for identification. The experiment was repeated four times, and we used a total of 399.5 h of behavioral observations to evaluate the effects of the TDRs on locomotor, comfort, and social behaviors. We also conducted observations with a second set of penguins (two of each species) naïve to wearing TDRs to evaluate their acute responses following application of the devices. Finally, we conducted validation tests to assess the accuracy of TDRs in a freshwater pool. Penguins observed immediately after the devices were applied to their flipper bands for the first time showed little device-directed behavior. However, there were some individual differences, suggesting that zoos and aquariums should carefully monitor initial behavioral responses to TDRs. In the long term, wearing TDRs had few effects on the behavior of the penguins. The penguins displayed almost no device-directed behavior, and there were few statistically significant differences in their behavior across the three study conditions. Seasonal changes and penguin weight likely explained the increase in movement king penguins demonstrated after wearing TDRs (F                             2,58                              = 4.34, p = 0.02). King penguins also showed a small increase in agonistic behavior while wearing TDRs (F                             2,73                              = 3.81, p = 0.03), a difference that may have been related to mating competition during the breeding season. Our results indicate that these flipper-mounted TDRs had few effects on the penguins, while providing valuable information about 24-hour use of aquatic resources in their freshwater habitats.                          © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Animal ambassador programs are increasingly prevalent in zoos, yet few studies have investigated their impact on animal welfare. We assessed the effects of an ambassador program on the behavior of a colony (N = 15) of zoo-housed African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) and evaluated whether individual characteristics were predictive of participation. Behavioral data were collected for 16 weeks and included 43 “penguin encounters”, during which zoo visitors entered a designated portion of the penguins’ enclosure. When comparing colony behavior following encounters to behavior during a matched control period lacking an encounter, we found no significant difference between affiliative or aggressive behaviors, suggesting that the encounters did not disrupt interactions in the colony. The same was true when comparing behavior preceding the encounter to a matched control period, indicating that any anticipatory period was similarly non-disruptive. Space use during encounters suggested comfort near visitors. We also measured penguin temperament on the shy-bold continuum by recording the birds’ response to novel objects and found that penguins’ temperament, sex, and age were predictive of participation. We concluded that this program had a neutral or positive impact on penguin welfare and considered the findings in relation to aspects of the ambassador program that provided penguins with control over their involvement. © 2019 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Establishing protected areas (PAs) ranks among the top priority actions to mitigate the global scale of modern biodiversity declines. However, the distribution of biodiversity is spatially asymmetric among regions and lineages, and the extent to which PAs offer effective protection for species and ecosystems remains uncertain. Penguins, regarded as prime bioindicator birds of the ecological health of their terrestrial and marine habitats, represent priority targets for such quantitative assessments. Of the world’s 18 penguin species, eleven are undergoing population declines, for which ten are classified as ‘Vulnerable’ or ‘Endangered’. Here, we employ a global-scale dataset to quantify the extent to which their terrestrial breeding areas are currently protected by PAs. Using quantitative methods for spatial ecology, we compare the global distribution of penguin colonies, including range and population size analyses, with the distribution of terrestrial PAs classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and generate hotspot and endemism maps worldwide. Our assessment quantitatively reveals < 40% of the terrestrial range of eleven penguin species is currently protected, and that range size is the significant factor in determining PA protection. We also show that there are seven global hotspots of penguin biodiversity where four or five penguin species breed. We suggest that future penguin conservation initiatives should be implemented based on more comprehensive, quantitative assessments of the multi-dimensional interactions between areas and species to further the effectiveness of PA networks. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

ABSTRACT: Worldwide, most crested penguin species (Eudyptes spp.) are in decline. New Zealand's subantarctic Antipodes Islands are of international significance for erect-crested (Eudyptes sclateri) and rockhopper (Eudyptes filholi) penguins. Between 1995 and 2011, a 23% decline was recorded in the two penguin species on the Antipodes Islands. In October 2014, nest abundance counts on Antipodes Island were undertaken to determine if this decline was continuing, particularly in light of a significant storm event that hit the Antipodes area in January 2014 causing massive landslides during the penguin breeding season. All penguin colonies ground counted in 2011 were preferentially ground counted in 2014 or, if time or weather did not allow, were checked with binoculars to confirm colony presence or absence. Seventy-three per cent of the colonies and the equivalent of 82% of all nests counted in 2011 were recounted in 2014. Overall, there was a 19% decline in erect-crested penguin nests between 2011 and 2014. Rockhopper penguins showed a slight increase (2.6%). Landslides affected 11% of the main islands’ land area and 44% of surveyed nesting colonies. Erect-crested penguin colonies with approximately 75% or greater of their area impacted by landslides showed a significantly greater decline than unaffected or only partially impacted colonies. Landslides showed a minimal effect on rockhopper nest numbers. There continues to be a significant decline of erect-crested penguins at the Antipodes Islands. An increasing occurrence of extreme weather events are predicted with climate change and have the potential to increase land-based flooding and landslides, adding additional impacts to terrestrial breeding marine species. Greater understanding of what is causing erect-crested penguin decline is needed to prevent this endangered species from extinction. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Spatiotemporal dynamics of ecosystems can challenge the pertinence of Marine Protected Area (MPA) planning. Seasonal environmental changes are extreme in polar regions, however MPA planning in East Antarctica relies mostly on species' summer distribution only. Thirteen Adélie penguins were tracked from Ile des Pétrels (Terre Adélie), and their seasonal distribution and behaviour were compared to the proposed “D'Urville Sea-Mertz” MPA. During the phase of high food-demand preceding moult, penguins used mostly (68.4%) this proposed area. However, following autumnal sea ice extension, penguins migrated north-westwards: overall, 73% of their locations were outside the MPA proposal, and this was up to >99% during winter (in July), the season when penguins maximized their dive depth and time (August and September, respectively). This study thus supports the proposal of implementing a “krill no-take zone” policy in this MPA, in line with the pre-moult foraging of these krill predators in this area. Further protection of the year-round habitats of migratory Adélie penguins could be achieved by inter-connecting the East Antarctic MPA proposals along the ice edge during winter, thereby mirroring the ecosystem's seasonal dynamics. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT:                              To address factors affecting genetic diversity and dispersal of ectoparasites, we compared mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) population genetic structures of the generalist soft tick Ornithodoros capensis to the more host-specific nest flea Parapsyllus humboldti. A total of 103 ticks and 92 fleas were sampled at five distinct South African island/mainland African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) colonies. With its wide host range, O. capensis showed no evidence of significant cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) mtDNA population differentiation among the five sampling sites (φ                             st                              = 0.00 ± 0.004; p = 0.80), as well as a higher level of genetic diversity (π = 0.8% ± 0.06%) when compared to P. humboldti. In contrast, the flea showed significant population structure among most of the same sampling sites (φ                             st                              = 0.22 ± 0.11; p ≤ 0.05) and a lower level of genetic diversity (π = 0.2% ± 0.01%). Our findings suggest that despite both parasites being mostly nest bound, O. capensis have few barriers to dispersal among island and mainland colonies. However, P. humboldti are more dependent on the African penguin for dispersal and thus have more impediments to gene flow among the same colonies. These findings broadly support the SGVH (specialist generalist variation hypothesis) and provide the first evidence for this hypothesis in parasites restricted to seabird colonies.                          © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Despite many studies on Adélie penguin breeding phenology, understanding the drivers of clutch initiation dates (CIDs, egg 1 lay date) is limited or lacks consensus. Here, we investigated Adélie penguin CIDs over 25 years (1991–2016) on two neighboring islands, Torgersen and Humble (<1 km apart), in a rapidly warming region near Palmer Station, Antarctica. We found that sea ice was the primary large-scale driver of CIDs and precipitation was a secondary small-scale driver that fine-tunes CID to island-specific nesting habitat geomorphology. In general, CIDs were earlier (later) when the spring sea ice retreat was earlier (later) and when the preceding annual ice season was shorter (longer). Island-specific effects related to precipitation and island geomorphology caused greater snow accumulation and delayed CIDs by ~2 days on Torgersen compared to Humble Island. When CIDs on the islands were similar, conditions were mild with less snow across breeding sites. At Torgersen Island, the negative relationship between CID and breeding success highlights detrimental effects of delayed breeding and/or snow on penguin fitness. Past phenological studies reported a relationship between air temperature and CID, assumed to be related to precipitation, but we found air temperature was more highly correlated to sea ice, revealing a misinterpretation of temperature effects. Finally, contrasting trends in CIDs based on temporal shifts in regional sea ice patterns revealed trends toward earlier CIDs (4–6 day advance) from 1979 to 2009 as the annual ice season shortened, and later CIDs (7–10 day delay) from 2010 to 2016 as the annual ice season lengthened. Adélie penguins tracked environmental conditions with flexible breeding phenology, but their life history remains vulnerable to subpolar weather conditions that can delay CIDs and decrease breeding success, especially on landscapes where geomorphology facilitates snow accumulation. © 2019 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The Humboldt Current System presents high interannual variability, influenced by the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), whose implications in wildlife are not fully understood. We studied the isotopic niche of wild Humboldt penguins at Punta San Juan (Peru) during the pre-moult foraging trip in 4 consecutive years (2008–2011) under known oceanographic (ENSO) conditions. Our results show that there is a clear isotopic niche segregation (on both δ13C and δ15N values) of wild Humboldt penguins among all years. Besides isotopic niche segregation, niche width also varied significantly among years. The larger isotopic niche displayed in 2008 reflected the opportunistic feeding behaviour of Humboldt penguins when oceanographic conditions were unfavourable (i.e. El Niño of strong intensity). In contrast, and despite strong segregation, penguins displayed a more specialist behaviour in years of mild environmental conditions (i.e. 2009 “warm-weak”, 2010 “neutral” and 2011 “warm-moderate”). No evidence of sexual segregation in wild Humboldt penguins during the pre-moulting foraging trip was found. This study highlights the coping mechanisms of an endangered species to changes in environmental conditions (i.e. overall, from strong to neutral El Niño events), which should have important ramifications in the management of the marine ecosystem in Peru, particularly the one related to the anchovy industry. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Adélie penguins are renowned for their natal philopatry on land-based colonies, requiring small pebbles to be used for nests. We report on an opportunistic observation via aerial survey, where hundreds of Adélie penguins were documented displaying nesting behaviours on fast ice ~3 km off the coast of Cape Crozier, which is one of the largest colonies in the world. We counted 426 Adélie penguins engaging in behaviours of pair formation, spacing similarly to normal nest distributions and lying in divots in the ice that looked like nests. On our first visit, it was noticed that the guano stain was bright pink, consistent with krill consumption, but had shifted to green over the course of ~2 weeks, indicating that the birds were fasting (a behaviour consistent with egg incubation). However, eggs were not observed. We posit four hypotheses that may explain the proximate causes of this behaviour and caution against future high-resolution satellite imagery interpretation due to the potential for confusing ice-nesting Adélie penguins with the presence of emperor penguin colonies. © 2019 Antarctic Science Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Sarcocystis falcatula is a well-known cause of fatal pneumonia in some birds, particularly Old World psittacines. Here we describe fatal sarcosystosis due to S. falcatula in 3 penguins (Family Spheniscidae) under managed care, including one African penguin (Spheniscus demersus), and two Southern rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome). Randomly distributed foci of necrosis, inflammatory cell infiltrates, edema, and variable numbers of round to elongated protozoal schizonts were observed in sections of lung. Protozoal organisms exhibited strong immunoreactivity for Sarcocystis sp. antigen by immunohistochemistry. Apicomplexan and Sarcocystis genus-specific PCR assays and sequence analysis confirmed S. falcatula as the etiologic agent. These cases of fatal pneumonia attributed to S. falcatula expand the list of aberrant intermediate avian hosts, with particular implications for penguins. © Copyright © 2019 Kirejczyk, Burns, Hyatt, Yabsley, Ter Beest, Gyimesi, Ossiboff, Waltman, Seimon and McManamon.

ABSTRACT: In the last few years, an increasing number of debilitated Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) has been rescued and taken to rehabilitation centers on Brazil's southern coast to be clinically treated and evaluated for re-introduction. This work aims to compare the viability of heparinized plasma with the viability of serum for biochemistry analyses under rehabilitation conditions. Blood sampled from 31 physically healthy rescued penguins was processed into serum/plasma-paired samples and analyzed for 12 biochemical parameters: alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), cholesterol (CHOL), creatine kinase (CK), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), glucose, (GLU) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total proteins (TP), triglycerides (TG), urea (UR), and uric acid (UA).The results showed that six paired samples presented visual signs of hemolysis (visual hemolytic score≥1), four of which occurred exclusively in the serum counterpart. Significant differences (P≤ 0.5) between sample types were found for CHOL (3%), GLU (6%) and TG (52%). Only TG was considered clinically relevant (>10%). All mean/median results fell within the available reference intervals by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (Penguin, 2014). In conclusion, we verified that heparinized plasma is a viable sample for the clinical biochemistry of rescued Magellanic penguins as it yields compatible results with serum, while providing practical benefits. The adoption of this practice favors a faster bird recovery, by minimizing blood sampling volume, and optimizes material resources, allowing use of the same collector tube as for hematology. © 2019 Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais.

ABSTRACT: The complete mitochondrial genome of the king penguin Aptenodytes patagonicus was firstly determined. The mitogenome is 17,477 bp in length and contains 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, 2 ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, and a control region. The total nucleotide composition is 31.0% A, 22.2% T, 33.1% C, and 13.8% G, with a total A + T content of 53.2%. The phylogenetic analysis demonstrates a close relationship between A. patagonicus and A. forsteri. These results provide fundamental information for further phylogeny and genetic studies on Aptenodytes genus. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: We argue the need to improve climate change forecasting for ecology, and importantly, how to relate long-term projections to conservation. As an example, we discuss the need for effective management of one species, the emperor penguin, Aptenodytes forsteri. This species is unique amongst birds in that its breeding habit is critically dependent upon seasonal fast ice. Here, we review its vulnerability to ongoing and projected climate change, given that sea ice is susceptible to changes in winds and temperatures. We consider published projections of future emperor penguin population status in response to changing environments. Furthermore, we evaluate the current IUCN Red List status for the species, and recommend that its status be changed to Vulnerable, based on different modelling projections of population decrease of ≥50% over the current century, and the specific traits of the species. We conclude that current conservation measures are inadequate to protect the species under future projected scenarios. Only a reduction in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions will reduce threats to the emperor penguin from altered wind regimes, rising temperatures and melting sea ice; until such time, other conservation actions are necessary, including increased spatial protection at breeding sites and foraging locations. The designation of large-scale marine spatial protection across its range would benefit the species, particularly in areas that have a high probability of becoming future climate change refugia. We also recommend that the emperor penguin is listed by the Antarctic Treaty as an Antarctic Specially Protected Species, with development of a species Action Plan. © 2019 The Authors

ABSTRACT: A fossil humerus coming from the Rocha Department coasts (Uruguay) is assigned here to Spheniscus cf. S. magellanicus (Aves, Sphenisciformes). This finding, located within the current migratory route of the species, potentially constitutes the northernmost fossil record of S. magellanicus, and the first report of a fossil penguin from Uruguay. Briefly comments about the features supporting its systematic, ontogenetic, and taphonomic assignment are also given. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: In the Antarctic ecosystem, leopard seals are known to be a main predator of penguins, while Weddell seals typically feed on fish and small crustaceans. In this study, we describe the observation of a Weddell seal that hunted juvenile Adélie Penguins on Inexpressible Island in the Ross Sea, Antarctica. The Weddell seal remained in the water near the edge of the sea ice and attacked young individuals. The penguins were in the late phase of molting and appeared to just venture into the water, which indicates that the individuals were unfamiliar with the water and had lower swimming ability than adults. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first video recording of Weddell seal predation on penguins and the first record on Adélie Penguins being attacked by the Weddell seals. Here, we discuss the possibility that Weddell seals could be an opportunistic predator of juvenile penguins when they are highly vulnerable. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: A paddle-shaped wing, the general morphology of the humerus, and the muscles involved in wing movement are among the most characteristic adaptations to diving in penguins. Particularly, the humeral fossa tricipitalis and the musculus humerotriceps are clear examples of muscular rearrangement accompanying skeletal changes. In extant Spheniscidae, we were able to identify two heads of this muscle attaching within a different compartment of the bipartite fossa. Since the partition of the fossa appeared as a novelty during the Miocene, we propose that this might have had implications for underwater flight contributing to wing-propelled diving efficiency. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: The arrival of humans in New Zealand around 750 years ago resulted in widespread faunal extinctions including the endemic Waitaha penguin (Megadyptes waitaha). Previously thought to have only bred on coastal South Island and Stewart Island, recent genetic reanalysis of prehistoric large penguin bones from the lower North Island indicates that the Waitaha penguin may have been a common resident. Here we synthesise previous studies and present new palaeontological and archaeological evidence to suggest that the Waitaha penguin was probably breeding in the lower North Island at the time of human arrival, and did not represent vagrant individuals from more southerly breeding colonies. The elimination of breeding Megadyptes from the North Island would add to the already significant avifaunal losses from New Zealand, of which the North Island suffered the greatest biodiversity loss after the arrival of humans. © 2018, © 2018 The Royal Society of New Zealand.

ABSTRACT: Southern Ocean ecosystems are extremely vulnerable to sea-ice changes occurring at different spatial and temporal scales. Variability in the sea-ice conditions strongly influence the survival and reproduction of animals that are synchronized with the seasonality of sea ice. Although the linkages between Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) and sea-ice conditions are well established, the spatial and temporal scales at which sea ice affects individuals and populations are poorly known. Using 23 years of penguin breeding success and remote-sensing data of sea ice, we investigate the spatial and temporal scales at which sea-ice changes best explain variations in the reproductive success of Adélie penguins at Pointe Géologie, East Antarctica. The best spatial scale encompassed all foraging areas exploited and all the sea-ice conditions encountered by penguins over a breeding season. There was a consistent influence of sea-ice concentration during the guard stage on the overall breeding success. We demonstrate the importance of considering sea ice at a fine temporal scale rather than using an average value over the breeding season to best explain reproductive success in Adélie penguins. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Some upper trophic level predators, such as marine mammals, seabirds and large predatory fish have been shown to be useful sentinels for marine ecosystems. Through their demography, diet and foraging behaviour, ecosystem changes associated with climate change can be monitored. The local marine ecosystem at the Prince Edward Archipelago in the Southern Indian Ocean is heavily influenced by the position of the dynamic sub-Antarctic front (SAF) that varies inter-annually in terms of its influence on the local environment. If the SAF migrates southwards, as climate change models have predicted, the abundance of autochthonous and allochthonous prey found within the vicinity of the archipelago will decrease and increase, respectively. We investigated the diet of an inshore forager at the archipelago, the gentoo penguin Pygoscelis papua, as a possible sentinel to the expected changes in the prey assemblages in local waters, due to the southward migration of the SAF. We collected stomach content samples from gentoo penguins, using the water off-loading technique, monthly over three years (1994–1996) and then annually during 2012, 2014 and 2015. Prey assemblages within the diet was found to coincide with the proximity of the SAF to the Prince Edward Archipelago as well as the annual life cycles of prey. Due to the plasticity these penguins exhibit in their diet and foraging behaviour, we suggest that they are important sentinel species for the local marine ecosystem of the Prince Edward Archipelago. Regular sample collection from these birds, albeit stomach content samples and/or tissues for stable isotope analysis, should be collected so that variability in the ecosystem can be easily monitored. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and aliphatic hydrocarbons (AHs), including petroleum biomarkers, were studied in four sediment cores collected around Deception and Penguin Islands, Antarctica. Total PAHs in Deception Island (DCP) samples ranged from 2.0 to 26.8 ng g−1, and in Penguin Island (PGI) varied between 13.2 and 60.3 ng g−1. Multiple sources of PAHs were verified in DCP, with petrogenic-derived compounds being predominant over the last 10 years. In PGI, PAHs related to natural contributions from the erosion of coal deposits were reported. Total AHs in DCP ranged from 4.5 to 19 μg g−1 and in PGI varied between 5.3 and 21.9 μg g−1. In DCP, the n-alkanes distribution pattern showed the presence of petroleum residues in the top sections and both terpanes and hopanes were detected, related to the use of fossil fuels for power generation and in different types of vessels. In PGI, the main source of n-alkanes was marine inputs and only terpanes were detected. The slight increase in hydrocarbon levels observed from 1980 onward in DCP was assumed to be due to the development of tourism in the region and to the scientific station activities. In PGI, anthropogenic-related hydrocarbons were detected in the recent sections and were linked to the development of tourism near the island, scientific activities and the increase in vessel traffic. In general, the concentrations of hydrocarbons found around both islands were comparable to those found in uncontaminated Antarctic regions. Evidences of hydrocarbons related to anthropogenic sources were reported in two Antarctica islands with an increase tendency in recent years. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The modern zoo has brought about two major advances in the behavioral welfare of their exhibited animals: (a) The use of environmental enrichment to promote naturalistic behaviors and (b) the use of training to improve voluntary husbandry care. Whereas training itself has been talked about as an effective enrichment strategy, little has been done to combine training procedures with enrichment. Typically, enrichment is treated as a trial and error process, where potential enrichment items or procedures are cycled through until successful enrichment is found. The use of shaping or other training techniques has seldom been documented to increase engagement with possible enrichment items or procedures. The following study examined the possibility of combining training and enrichment to produce continued interactions with enrichment devices. Two species of penguin, Magellanic and southern rockhopper penguins, were studied. Two measures were taken: Time spent swimming and contact with enrichment devices. The enrichment devices could be manipulated by placing fish within and hanging out of each device. During baseline sessions, no hits to either device were observed. During training sessions, several hits were recorded when fish were in the devices and overall swimming time increased during these conditions. When baseline was reintroduced without fish in the devices, contact with the enrichment devices rapidly declined and swimming time for the rockhopper penguins decreased. When the devices were reintroduced with fish but without training, the greatest number of enrichment device contacts and the highest percentage of time spent swimming were observed for the rockhopper penguins. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Brain and behavioral asymmetries (termed "lateralization"; e.g., preferential eye-use) have been mostly described in controlled laboratory conditions, although striking similarities of hemispheric brain control for specific behaviors have also been shown in the wild. Visual lateralization may provide ecological advantages by allowing complementary roles played by the left–right lateral and frontal visual field in distant or close motion detection of predators or other threats. In this study, we tested for lateralization in aggressive behavior in wild king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus), seabirds breeding in a context of strong colonial aggressiveness, and subject to on-land-based predation of their egg or chick. We show that males initiated more agonistic interactions when a congener was located in their right frontal visual field and in their left lateral visual field. The results obtained in females were the exact opposite for each subdivision of their visual fields. Complementary lateralization in male and female penguins may be part of a more general phenomenon, allowing partners to coordinate their behavior during reproduction. This may be especially true during the period of courtship, during which these seasonally monogamous and monomorphic seabirds engage in mutual mate choice based on a complex and ritualized display of ornaments located on the left and right lateral sides of the head. Those results open exciting questions as to whether hemispheric control of aggression is a commonly selected phenotypic trait across colonial seabirds. © 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

ABSTRACT: We examined the effects of regulating the viewing proximity of visitors and the intensity of visitor behaviour on behaviours indicative of fear and stress physiology of 15 zoo-housed little penguins (Eudyptula minor). A 2 × 2 factorial fully randomised design was used to examine the effects of regulating: 1) the viewing proximity of visitors to enclosure, ‘normal viewing distance’ and ’increased viewing distance’ (using a physical barrier set up 2 m away from the enclosure), and 2) the intensity of visitor behaviour, ‘unregulated visitor behaviour’ and ‘regulated visitor behaviour’ (using signage and uniformed personnel). In addition, a treatment consisting of closing the enclosure to visitors was included. Penguin behaviour, visitor numbers and visitor behaviour were recorded by CCTV video recordings and direct observations, respectively. Penguin faecal glucocorticoid metabolites were also analysed as a measure of stress physiology. We found that increased viewing distance reduced (p < 0.05) all visitor behaviours except for loud vocalisationsand tactile contact with penguins. However, there were no direct effects of signage and uniformed personnel on visitor behaviour (p > 0.05). As the regulation of viewing proximity increased from a closed exhibit to an open exhibit with increased viewing distance, and then to an open exhibit with normal viewing distance, this increased the proportion of penguins huddling (p = 0.0011), vigilant (p = 0.0060) and retreating (p = 0.00013), and decreased the proportion of penguins within 1 m of the visitor viewing area (p = 0.00066), surface swimming (p = 0.00091) and preening in the water (p = 0.042). There were also limited effects of regulating visitor behaviour on penguin behaviour. No treatment effects were found on faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (p > 0.05). These results indicate that regulating visitor viewing proximity affects penguin behaviours indicative of fear and visitor behaviour. This suggests that close visitor contact can be fear-provoking for little penguins but increasing the distance between visitors and penguins can reduce fear responses of penguins by regulating both viewing proximity and visitor behaviour. However, it is unclear whether these changes in penguin behaviour are due to the increased separation between visitors and penguins and/or specific visitor behaviours associated with close viewing proximity to the enclosure, such as leaning over the enclosure or tactile contact with the pool, which are impeded when visitors are further away. © 2019 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Molecular studies have shown that, although most avian species are socially monogamous, they can exhibit different reproductive strategies, such as extra-pair paternity (EPP) and intraspecific brood parasitism (IBP). We investigated the genetic mating system of the Magellanic Penguin, Spheniscus magellanicus, a species that is reported to be monogamous, with little or no evidence of extra-pair paternity, high partner faithfulness over the years and intense biparental care. Thus, we proposed that if EPP does occur, the rate will be low and could be related to increased genetic diversity among offspring or the body condition of parents. As a consequence, we hypothesize that offspring from EPP will exhibit faster growth than non-EPP offspring, thus increasing their survival probability. In contrast to expectations, EPP was detected in 31% of the offspring and 48% of the nests had at least one extra-pair young. In addition, 6% of chicks were not the offspring of the putative mother or either member of the social pair, indicating evidence of IBP. However, we did not find a difference in genetic diversity between nests with or without EPP, nor did we find differences in parent body condition. Offspring from EPP showed slightly faster growth than non-EPP offspring, although this difference was not statistically significant. These results reveal a high rate of EPP and a low rate of IBP, both of which were previously unknown for this species. Our findings demonstrate that the Magellanic penguin has a more complex social mating system than previously thought. © 2019, Deutsche Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.

ABSTRACT: The complete genome sequence of a novel megrivirus of the family Picornaviridae was determined from nucleic acid extracted from a pool of six faecal specimens of Adélie penguins. The samples were collected near Bellingshausen Station, King George Island of the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. Penguin megrivirus is the first megrivirus with a predicted L protein. It has an L-3-5-4 genome layout, a type IV IRES, and a long 3’ untranslated region of 668 nt. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The study of parasitism in penguins is relevant because it offers information on the biology and ecology of this host. This study reports the parasitism of 156 specimens of Spheniscus humboldti rescued from beaches of the south-central coast of Chile, between January 2006 and June 2015, describing their potential forms of transmission and pathogenicity. The parasitic infection was determined by coproparasitic methods in live specimens and by necropsy in dead penguins. The gastrointestinal helminths Tetrabothrius eudyptidis (Lönnberg, 1896), Cardiocephaloides physalis (Lutz, 1926), Contracaecum pelagicum (Johnston & Mawson, 1942) and Cosmocephalus obvelatus (Creplin, 1825) were identified by both methods. Parasitism was observed in 29.57% of live specimens and 51.76% of necropsied birds. All the parasites identified corresponded to genera already informed in S. humboldti. The richness of the S. humboldti parasitic fauna was lower than that reported for other species of penguins. The results demonstrate the participation of S. humboldti as a definitive host in the life cycles of the parasites reported in this study. Being S. humboldti a vulnerable species, it is necessary to continue with parasitological studies in this penguin to clarify the role of parasites in the health of these birds. © 2019, Escuela de Ciencias del Mar.

ABSTRACT: The emperor penguin, an iconic species threatened by projected sea ice loss in Antarctica, has long been considered to forage at the fast ice edge, presumably relying on large/yearly persistent polynyas as their main foraging habitat during the breeding season. Using newly developed fine-scale sea icescape data and historical penguin tracking data, this study for the first time suggests the importance of less recognized small openings, including cracks, flaw leads and ephemeral short-term polynyas, as foraging habitats for emperor penguins. The tracking data retrieved from 47 emperor penguins in two different colonies in East Antarctica suggest that those penguins spent 23% of their time in ephemeral polynyas and did not use the large/yearly persistent, well-studied polynyas, even if they occur much more regularly with predictable locations. These findings challenge our previous understanding of emperor penguin breeding habitats, highlighting the need for incorporating fine-scale seascape features when assessing the population persistence in a rapidly changing polar environment. © 2019.

ABSTRACT: Understanding responses by penguins to climate change in Antarctica is often complicated by other factors including microclimate and landscape effects. Here, we analyze an ornithogenic sediment profile to reconstruct penguin occupation history on the eastern side of Ardley Island, west Antarctic Peninsula, and synthesize the results from various studies on Ardley Island in the past 20 years. Penguins have inhabited the eastern side of this island since about 900 yr BP, with populations significantly increasing from ∼500 yr BP. On the western side, delineated by the Ardley Ridge Line, penguins began to abandon nest or molt sites at ∼1000 yr BP. By the time of 500 yr BP, the abandonment and population decline became a common tendency on the west side. This shift in occupation areas was likely driven by local microclimate and a change in wind patterns causing more snow to accumulate on the west side of the island. We found a linkage between this penguin movement and the Southern Westerly Winds, which became stronger at ∼1000 yr BP and impacted local conditions at Ardley Island, likely induced by more positive Southern Annular Mode (SAM). These results indicate that island topography, wind and snow patterns, combined with large-scale climate forcing can be just as important in determining penguin distribution as temperature and other environmental factors. This study provides a new perspective for investigating the possible impact of microclimate and site topography on penguin behavior. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Anisakid nematodes have a worldwide distribution and are associated with fishes, birds, and marine mammals from freshwater, brackish, and marine systems. The aims of this work are to report for the first time Contracaecum mirounga parasitizing the Magellanic penguin Spheniscus magellanicus, to report another Contracaecum species in the same host species, and to discuss the validity of Contracaeceum spheniscus. Several dead chicks, juveniles, and adults of S. magellanicus were collected along the Argentinean coast from 2002 to 2009. Nematodes were removed from digestive tracts and studied using both light and scanning electron microscopy. Nematode prevalences were 2.38% for C. mirounga and 12.5% for Contracaecum sp. Contracaecum mirounga was found in 1 penguin from Península Valdés, Chubut. This species is known as a specific parasite of marine mammals such as Pinnipedia, thereby suggesting that this nematode is not as specific as believed. Another species of Contracaecum sp. was found parasitizing 1 penguin from the Río de la Plata coast. It possessed an unusual interlabial morphology and arrangement of male caudal papillae. Despite the low prevalence, the distinct morphological features are convincing and support the presence of a new Contracaecum species. However, a formal description is not presented because sufficient male specimens are lacking. Finally, C. spheniscus is considered a junior synonym of Contracaecum pelagicum. Future molecular studies might be helpful to determine the real diversity of Contracaecum species parasitizing S. magellanicus considering the number of sibling species recognized among the anisakids. © American Society of Parasitologists 2019

ABSTRACT: Blue penguin (Eudyptula minor) pairs at Taiaroa Head were monitored during the 1993–94 and the 1994–95 breeding seasons. Sixty-nine breeding pairs were monitored over the 1993–94 season. Egg laying began in June. Eighty-seven pairs were monitored during the 1994–95 season, and egg laying began in August. Two of the monitored pairs produced a third clutch after two unsuccessful clutches. The earlier start of egg laying in the 1993–94 season may have contributed to the higher number of pairs (than in the 1994–95 season) that produced a second clutch. A minimum of 284 breeding pairs were found along the outer coast of the Otago Peninsula during the 1994–95 breeding season. Predation was evident at some sites. At one location, only 5% of the breeding pairs estimated in the 1993–94 season bred in the 1994–95 season. At some sites the number of breeding pairs of blue penguins had increased since 1992. © September 1997, Department of Conservation.

ABSTRACT: Prey use by male and female Magellanic Penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) was quantified during chick rearing in northern Golfo San Jorge, Argentina and the dietary niches and diet composition of each sex were assessed and compared. A total of 67 males and 45 females were flushed during the chick stages of 2011 and 2012. Argentine Anchovy (Engraulis anchoita) was the main prey in terms of importance by mass in males and females in all stages and years (52.4–86.6% and 83.8–88.7%, respectively), except during the old chick stage in 2011 when the main prey in males and females was the Shortfin Squid (Illex argentinus) (63.1% and 44.4%, respectively). Analyses of similarity showed that diet composition in terms of contribution by mass of the main prey species was similar between sexes. Based on the isotopic values of δ13C and δ15N corresponding to 38 males and 21 females, the Bayesian mixing model outputs showed that Argentine Anchovy was also the main prey. In both years and chick stages, the isotopic niche of males and females was similar. The similarity in the dietary niche between male and female Magellanic Penguins raising chicks may be due to the high availability of Argentine Anchovy during the study period and the consequent dominance of this forage species in the diet of both sexes. © 2019 Ecological Society of Australia

ABSTRACT: Adélie Penguins Pygoscelis adeliae live exclusively in Antarctica and commute between the sea for foraging and the land for breeding. During these movements, they must navigate various environments: underwater, on sea ice and on land; an unusual set of challenges among animals. Navigation mechanisms of this species were intensively studied about 50 years ago, but technological limitation at that time made it hard to fully understand movement patterns under experimental as well as natural conditions. Recent developments in animal-borne data loggers have enabled us to record movement paths and activities of such birds. In this paper, we report the results of displacement experiments combined with bio-logging on Adélie Penguins, conducted for the first time since initial experiments more than 50 years ago. Two chick rearing birds were caught at their nests and data loggers with GPS and accelerometers were deployed on their backs. The birds were artificially displaced and released approximately 1 km from the breeding colony. From the release point, their options to return to the nest were either walking over land or swimming in the sea. The birds successfully returned to the colony 6.0 h and 8.1 h after release, taking 44 min and 41 min, respectively, from the onset of homeward movement. Both individuals took what appeared to be the straightest and shortest course crossing over land. They spent most of the homing phase (51.2% and 66.2%) walking and only entered the water - in the same place - in the last stretch homewards. The results of our study demonstrate the homing ability of Adélie Penguins from a distant location after artificial displacement and the potential use of positional and acceleration data to study the navigation of penguins that travel by both land and sea. © 2019 ARDEA.

ABSTRACT: In a food-limited system, parents may have to allocate resources in ways that do not benefit all their offspring equally. We investigated food allocation and parent and chick behaviours in Magellanic penguins at their colony in Punta Tombo, Argentina, by observing feedings in one- and two-chick broods after the chicks were more than 20 days of age. Feeds lasted 21 min on average, and the length of a feed was not correlated either with the number of chicks in a brood, or with the amount of food the parents gave. Parents with two-chick broods distributed food evenly to both chicks. Although single chicks were fed more than chicks with siblings, as a proportion of a chick's start weight, both single chicks and lighter chicks in two-chick broods received significantly more food than heavier chicks. Chicks continued begging after the last feed in nearly half of the two-chick broods, suggesting they were not sated and so are food-limited. In linear mixed-effects models that considered, respectively, the absolute amount of food a chick received and the amount of food it received as a proportion of its start weight, chick begging was the most significant predictor of how much it was fed. Jostling behaviours between the chicks did not correlate with the amount of food either one received. Parental nonfeeding behaviours in two-chick broods (e.g. bending towards a chick and opening the bill but not regurgitating food) were more frequently directed at the lighter chick, but did not correlate with the amount of food a chick received. These results suggest (1) parents are motived to feed their chicks quickly, (2) parents try to allocate food equally to chicks of this age and (3) chicks devote most of their energy trying to get fed by the parent, rather than competing antagonistically with one another. © 2019 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

ABSTRACT: Avian feathers have the potential to accumulate trace elements originating from contaminated food and polluted environments. In fact, in feathers, metals bind to keratin, a sulphur-containing protein for which several metals have a strong affinity. Here, the concentrations of 18 essential and non-essential elements were investigated in a Humboldt penguin (Spheniscus humboldti) colony housed at the Acquario di Cattolica (Italy). This species is listed as vulnerable in the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature. According to the literature, there is usually a link between metal levels in the diet of birds and levels detected in their feathers. Thus, metals were also determined in the penguins’ food (capelin, Mallotus villosus). We hypothesize that the controlled conditions in which birds are kept in captivity, and the homogeneous diet that they follow could allow a better understanding of metal bioaccumulation (such as mercury) or bio-dilution (such as arsenic) in the marine food chain, indicated by penguins’ feathers. Moreover, comparisons with our previous investigations performed on an ex-situ African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) colony suggest that penguins living indoors have lower body burden of metals than those living outdoors. Indeed, environmental contaminants usually found in areas subjected to anthropogenic impact, where zoos and aquaria are often located, are not accumulated to levels of concern. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: We monitored the post-release survival of little penguins (Eudyptula minor) rehabilitated after the 2011 C/V Rena oil spill in New Zealand to assess the effectiveness of the rehabilitation process. Surveys were conducted over a 23-month period after the spill to assess whether survival differed between rehabilitated and control penguins. Survival probabilities from mark-recapture analyses were lower for both oiled and control penguins in the first six months of the study (monthly probability 0.92) but increased and remained high thereafter (monthly probabilities 0.97–1.0). Importantly, survival did not differ significantly between oiled and control birds throughout the study. Post-release survival of rehabilitated birds was not influenced by the degree of oiling, body mass (at admission or release), blood parameters (admission packed cell volume, total protein or blood glucose) or the duration of captivity. Rehabilitation therefore appeared to successfully reverse the negative effects of oiling on the post-release survival of treated penguins. © 2019

ABSTRACT: We measured mercury (Hg) concentrations in feathers from four penguin species collected on Macquarie Island, Southern Ocean, to 1) establish baseline Hg concentrations; and 2) compare Hg from samples collected in 2002 (“modern”) and from museum specimens collected between 1937 and 1976 (“historic”). Inter-specific differences in feather Hg reflected known differences in habitats and diversity of diets: benthic-foraging Gentoo penguins and Rockhopper penguins that foraged both inshore and offshore had significantly higher feather mercury than the more pelagic, specialist foraging King and Royal penguins. Hg significantly decreased between historic and modern samples in King and Royal penguins. This decrease could be due to changes in either diet, foodwebs, or atmospheric Hg input and sources in the Southern Hemisphere. Because Macquarie Island is home to 2.8 million marine animals, these data may indicate that other species that forage and breed in this region are also exposed to low Hg concentrations in this environment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Despite being the most numerous penguin species in South America, exposure of the Magellanic Penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) to pathogens has not yet been thoroughly assessed. We collected serum from 1,058 Magellanic Penguins at 10 breeding colonies along the entire latitudinal range of this species in Argentina. The work spanned 10 breeding seasons over 15 yr (1994–2008). Sera were tested for antibodies to select infectious agents. Antibodies reacting against 16 pathogens were detected (seroprevalence): Aspergillus sp. (15.1%), Chlamydia psittaci (6.5%), Salmonella Pullorum (3.1%), Salmonella Typhimurium (81.3%), Aviadenovirus sp. (18.1%), Duck atadenovirus A (23.6%), Anatid herpesvirus 1 (0.7%), Avian orthoreovirus (3.3%), Avian coronavirus M41 (43.5%), Avian coronavirus C46 (59.8%), Avian coronavirus A99 (37.4%), Avian coronavirus JMK (40.2%), Tremovirus A (0.3%), Avian avulavirus 1 (44.0%), Avian avulavirus 2 (43.8%), and Avian avulavirus 3 (46.6%). No antibodies were detected against nine infectious agents: Gallid alphaherpesvirus 1, Gallid alphaherpesvirus 2, Infectious bursal disease virus, Avastrovirus 2, West Nile virus, Eastern equine encephalitis virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Western equine encephalitis virus, and Influenza A virus. While restricted by limitations inherent to serological methods, our results provide baseline knowledge for a key species in the South Atlantic Ocean. This information is valuable for adaptive conservation management in a time of increasing environmental stressors affecting the Patagonian Sea, one of the world’s richest pelagic seabird communities. © Wildlife Disease Association 2020.

ABSTRACT: Marine ecosystems are experiencing substantial disturbances due to climate change and overfishing, and plastic pollution is an additional growing threat. Microfibres are among the most pervasive pollutants in the marine environment, including in the Southern Ocean. However, evidence for microfibre contamination in the diet of top predators in the Southern Ocean is rare. King Penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) feed on mesopelagic fish, which undergo diel vertical migrations towards the surface at night. Microfibres are concentrated in surface waters and sediments but can also be concentrated in fish, therefore acting as contamination vectors for diving predators feeding at depth. In this study, we investigate microfibre contamination of King Penguin faecal samples collected in February and March 2017 at South Georgia across three groups: incubating, chick-rearing and non-breeding birds. After a KOH digestion to dissolve the organic matter and a density separation step using a NaCl solution, the samples were filtered to collect microfibres. A total of 77% of the penguin faecal samples (36 of 47) contained microfibres. Fibres were measured and characterized using Fourier-Transform Infrared spectroscopy to determine their polymeric identity. Most fibres (88%) were made of natural cellulosic materials (e.g. cotton, linen), with only 12% synthetic (e.g. polyester, nylon) or semi-synthetic (e.g. rayon). An average of 21.9 ± 5.8 microfibres g−1 of faeces (lab dried mass) was found, with concentrations more than twice as high in incubating penguins than in penguins rearing chicks. Incubating birds forage further north at the Antarctic Polar Front and travel longer distances from South Georgia than chick-rearing birds. This suggests that long-distance travelling penguins are probably more exposed to the risk of ingesting microfibres when feeding north of the Antarctic Polar Front, which might act as a semi-permeable barrier for microfibres. Microfibres could therefore provide a signature for foraging location in King Penguins. © 2019 The Authors

ABSTRACT: In January 2019, high mortalities were reported among African Penguins (Spheniscus demersus) in a breeding colony on Halifax Island, Namibia, Africa. Analysis of samples by reverse transcription quantitative PCR indicated the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) subtype H5N8. Sequence analysis of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes confirmed the presence of the virus in the birds and its high similarity to HPAI subtype H5N8 identified in South Africa in 2017. There have been no previous reports of HPAI H5N8 in Namibia. © Wildlife Disease Association 2020.

ABSTRACT: Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) scans were performed in clinically healthy, nonanesthetized, standing little penguins (Eudyptula minor) to determine reference ranges for air-sac and lung volumes, as well as lung density. Five of 15 clinically healthy birds were diagnosed with pulmonary granulomas on initial MDCT scans. Granulomas were not readily apparent on radiographs, even in cases where the entire normal pulmonary parenchymal architecture was effaced on the MDCT scan. Serial MDCT scans after antifungal and antimycobacterial therapies demonstrated a response to treatment. MDCT scanning in nonanesthetized little penguins proved to be a well-tolerated, non-invasive imaging modality for respiratory diseases that are otherwise difficult to diagnose, including aspergillosis and mycobacteriosis. © 2019 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Understanding the causes of disease in Antarctic wildlife is crucial, as many of these species are already threatened by environmental changes brought about by climate change. In recent years, Antarctic penguins have been showing signs of an unknown pathology: A feather disorder characterised by missing feathers, resulting in exposed skin. During the 2018-2019 austral summer breeding season at Cape Crozier colony on Ross Island, Antarctica, we observed for the first time an Adélie penguin chickmissing down overmost of its body. A guano samplewas collected fromthe nest of the featherless chick, and using high-throughput sequencing, we identified a novel circovirus. Using abutting primers, we amplified the full genome, which we cloned and Sanger-sequenced to determine the complete genome of the circovirus. The Adélie penguin guano-associated circovirus genome shares <67% genome-wide nucleotide identity with other circoviruses, representing a new species of circovirus; therefore, we named it penguin circovirus (PenCV). Using the same primer pair, we screened 25 previously collected cloacal swabs taken at Cape Crozier from known-age adult Adélie penguins during the 2014-2015 season, displaying no clinical signs of feather-loss disorder. Three of the 25 samples (12%) were positive for a PenCV, whose genome shared >99% pairwise identity with the one identified in 2018-2019. This is the first report of a circovirus associated with a penguin species. This circovirus could be an etiological agent of the feather-loss disorder in Antarctic penguins. © 2019 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Bycatch in gillnet fisheries is one of the main threats to several penguin species. Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) are caught by gillnets during their wintering in southern Brazil. However, current information is based only on a small number of sets observed during a single fishing trip. This study assesses bycatch rates of bottom and drift gillnets operating in southern Brazil, and describes the sex and age classes of individuals captured. In 80 bottom gillnet sets, 33 penguins were captured (85% adults), 14 were sexed of which 13 were females. In 41 drift gillnet sets, four penguins were captured, three of which were juveniles. The mean bycatch rates, measured as number of penguins km−2 of net and number of penguins km−2 h−1, were significantly higher for the drift gillnets. Despite the lower bycatch rates, owing to the higher fishing effort in terms of number of boats, net length, net area, soak time and fishing season, the magnitude of penguin bycatch in the bottom gillnet fishery cannot be ignored. Despite based on small sample size, the predominance of adult and female Magellanic penguins as bycatch in gillnet fisheries in southern Brazil agrees with previous studies suggesting that females displace further north than males. In addition, such evidence contributes to the male-biased sex ratio in breeding grounds, and the long-term decline of major Patagonian colonies owing to higher female mortality during winter. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Between late austral autumn and early winter, some of the Magellanic penguin Spheniscus magellanicus population foraging on the Patagonian continental shelf move towards the southern Brazilian coast (22–32°S). Many of these vagrant birds wash ashore in very poor health condition. The Santos Municipal Aquarium, Brazil, takes in some of those stranded individuals and provides a programme of rehabilitation. The surviving birds are retained for public exhibition and environmental education. This study describes the husbandry practices and veterinary care for the penguins developed at the Aquarium, including data on survivorship, sex, ontogeny, death rates, reproduction and time in captivity. Most of the received penguins were found in Santos (23·9°S), but there were animals collected between Bertioga and Cananéia (23·7–25·3°S). The highest incidence of stranded animals was recorded in 2008. Most animals were collected during austral winter and no penguins were received in March and April. Most animals were juvenile on arrival at the institution. The average time rehabilitated birds remained in captivity (i.e. the quarantine period plus time on public exhibition) was 294 days, with a longest time of 3681 days. The most common diseases recorded in captivity were bumblefoot and aspergillosis, whereas helminth parasite infestations were the commonest ailment recorded in newly rescued birds. One individual hatched at the Aquarium in 2001 and two others in 2017. © 2019 The Zoological Society of London

ABSTRACT: The Southern African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds (Cape Town, South Africa) regularly receives African Penguins (Spheniscus demersus) for rehabilitation. The impact of life history and clinical parameters at admission of 3,975 chicks, 1,687 blues (chicks without downy plumage that are about to fledge or have recently fledged), and 850 fledged juveniles admitted over a 12 yr period (2002–13) were assessed in relation to rehabilitation outcomes using multivariate analysis. Younger chicks were more likely to die during rehabilitation compared with older chicks, and chicks admitted because they had been abandoned by their parents were more likely to die than those admitted preemptively (chicks that were removed when rangers considered their nests were in high-risk areas). Blues admitted because of injury and juveniles admitted because of debilitation, injury, and molt were more likely to die or be euthanized relative to the reference category oiling. Plasmodium infection contributed to natural death for all age groups and to the decision to euthanize chicks, whereas Borrelia infection contributed to both natural death and the decision to euthanize blues. Babesia infection was associated with decreased odds of euthanasia among juveniles. Low hematocrit at admission contributed to natural death of chicks and blues and euthanasia of blues. Low total plasma protein, on the other hand, contributed to natural death in chicks, blues, and juveniles, whereas high total plasma protein had a protective effect against natural death in chicks. These results indicate a need to focus on prevention and early intervention among compromised immature penguins in order to increase the rehabilitation success for this endangered species. © Wildlife Disease Association 2019.

ABSTRACT: The Berlese funnel method, and its variations, is commonly used for the extraction of arthropods from various substrates such as nest material. However, little is known about its effectivity in extracting ectoparasites from penguin nests. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of a modified Berlese funnel method in extracting ectoparasites from African Penguin Spheniscus demersus nests and to determine differences in extraction capacity across parasite taxa and life stages. African Penguin nests (n = 278) were sampled at five penguin colonies along the south-west coast of South Africa in 2017. Nest samples were subjected to a modified Berlese funnel method with naphthalene as a repellent. Thereafter, all remaining ectoparasites were removed by hand sorting. Ectoparasite abundance was positively correlated between the two extraction methods (Spearman’s r = 0.73–0.89). Compared to total counts, flea (combined life stages and larvae) and total ectoparasite abundance and prevalence were significantly lower with the modified Berlese funnel method. In addition, adult flea and tick prevalence (but not abundance) was significantly lower with the modified Berlese funnel method compared with total counts. The modified Berlese funnel method fails as a quantitative method and can only provide a crude indication of the incidence of ectoparasites in penguin nests. © 2019, © 2019 NISC (Pty) Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Understanding spatio-temporal variation in the abundance of species’ populations is an issue of central importance in ecology. Recent studies of decadal-scale change in Adélie penguin (Pygoscelisadeliae) populations around the Antarctic continent have led to insights into our understanding of the species’ population dynamics and to exploration of the ecosystem processes driving them. However, gaps in knowledge of population change still exist for many populations, especially at breeding sites distant from research stations. In this study, we estimate population change for the large Adélie penguin populations at the seldom visited and data-poor Scullin and Murray Monoliths in East Antarctica by critically assessing historical population data and extending the historical time series of population data to the present day with a recent survey. Unlike Adélie penguin populations studied elsewhere in East Antarctica, we find the Monolith populations have remained stable or decreased slightly over the past 3–4 decades. The results indicate that spatially divergent processes are driving Adélie penguin population dynamics, and that these factors may not be sufficiently represented in current explanatory or predictive population models for this species. The methods employed here provide a viable means of undertaking regular population monitoring of highly visible seabird species such as the Adélie penguin in remote and ecologically important areas such as Scullin and Murray Monoliths in the future. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: We report additional fossil evidence for pygoscelid penguins breeding on King George (25 de Mayo) Island, South Shetland Islands, in the Holocene beginning at ~7000 cal. yr BP. This evidence comes from a raised marine beach deposit formerly studied and described as Pingfo I at Stranger Point, Potter Peninsula. We relocated and exposed deposits at this site and recovered additional samples of penguin bones from five stratigraphic beds that are redescribed here. Most of these bones are from juvenile penguins and exhibit little or no wear indicating minimal transport to the beach deposits. Some of the bones are developed enough to be identifiable to Adélie (Pygoscelis adeliae), Gentoo (Pygoscelis papua), and Chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarctica) penguins, indicating that all three species were breeding at Stranger Point from ~7320 to 4865 cal. yr BP. This breeding occupation corresponds with the first warming and deglaciation that occurred in the northern Antarctic Peninsula by this time and ends with the onset of reglaciation of the Peninsula. At least 31 abandoned penguin mounds and ornithogenic soils also were located and sampled at Stranger Point and indicate that the current occupation of this area by all three pygoscelid penguins dates no older than ~535 cal. yr BP. The absence of ornithogenic soils from earlier Holocene breeding was probably due to glacial activity and soil solifluction during periods of warming in the mid to late Holocene. © The Author(s) 2019.

ABSTRACT: Conservation of yellow-eyed penguins (Megadyptes antipodes) on the New Zealand mainland requires accurate data on population trend, annual variation in survival, and several other parameters that can be estimated from banding data. We describe initial analyses using a newly constructed database of yellow-eyed penguin breeding and banding data, maintained by Manaaki Whenua. All known banding records of fledglings, juveniles and adults (n = 5894, 1972¬1994) are tabulated by year for 46 mainland breeding areas and three southern islands (Codfish, Enderby and Campbell). Annual survival and recruitment were analysed for the intensively studied Double Bay and Midsection areas on Otago Peninsula. Adult survival varied between 49% and 100% over the 1982/83 - 1992/93 period; excluding one year of extraordinarily high mortality (1989/90), the lowest annual adult survival rate was 80% in 1985/86 - 1986/87. The average adult survival rate (83 +/- 13%) did not differ significantly from that reported 45 years earlier. The proportion of banded fledglings resighted as adults varied between 1% and 38% in different cohorts, and almost half were resighted at an area other than their natal area. Mark-recapture estimates of total adult population showed no recovery from the 1989-90 catastrophe by the 1992-93 breeding season. We demonstrate that adult yellow-eyed penguins are likely to be male when the sum of head length and foot length exceeds 269 mm. The 14% error rate by this criterion may be further reduced to about 2% by measuring both birds of a definitely mated heterosexual pair and considering the larger to be the male. The proportion of adult-aged birds breeding in any year was extremely variable (30% - 90%); care must therefore be taken when applying Richdale's "60%" rule of thumb for extrapolating the total population from the number of nests. We are unable to estimate separately the non-breeding rates of males and females as prior to 1992 relatively few adults were measured for sexing. We propose a new system of paper record forms for use by field workers. © February 1996, Department of Conservation.

ABSTRACT: A maximum age of at least 17.7 years was recorded for a Galápagos Penguin Spheniscus mendiculus on Isabela Island during studies up until 2018. This individual was first captured as an adult of at least two years of age, as indicated by its plumage. In addition, we present records of other penguins, not quite as old, that were first captured as chicks. Longevity is affected by many different factors, making it useful in the design of conservation strategies. © 2019, Marine Ornithology. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Although many studies have documented the effects of demographic bottlenecks on the genetic diversity of natural populations, there is conflicting evidence of the roles that genetic drift and selection may play in driving changes in genetic variation at adaptive loci. We analyzed genetic variation at microsatellite and mitochondrial loci in conjunction with an adaptive MHC class II locus in the Galápagos penguin (Spheniscus mendiculus), a species that has undergone serial demographic bottlenecks associated with El Niño events through its evolutionary history. We compared levels of variation in the Galápagos penguin to those of its congener, the Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus), which has consistently maintained a large population size and thus was used as a non-bottlenecked control. The comparison of neutral and adaptive markers in these two demographically distinct species allowed assessment of the potential role of balancing selection in maintaining levels of MHC variation during bottleneck events. Our analysis suggests that the lack of genetic diversity at both neutral and adaptive loci in the Galápagos penguin likely resulted from its restricted range, relatively low abundance, and history of demographic bottlenecks. The Galápagos penguin revealed two MHC alleles, one mitochondrial haplotype, and six alleles across five microsatellite loci, which represents only a small fraction of the diversity detected in Magellanic penguins. Despite the decreased genetic diversity in the Galápagos penguin, results revealed signals of balancing selection at the MHC, which suggest that selection can mitigate some of the effects of genetic drift during bottleneck events. Although Galápagos penguin populations have persisted for a long time, increased frequency of El Niño events due to global climate change, as well as the low diversity exhibited at immunological loci, may put this species at further risk of extinction. © 2020 Arauco-Shapiro et al.

ABSTRACT: Two species of heterophyid trematodes were found in the Magellanic penguin, Spheniscus magellanicus (Forster), from Patagonia, Argentina. Ascocotyle (Ascocotyle) patagoniensis Hernández-Orts et al. (2012) is re-described based on new, properly fixed specimens (original material from South American sea lion, Otaria flavescens Shaw, was from frozen hosts). Metacercariae of this species are reported and described for the first time from the heart of the silversides, Odontesthes argentinensis (Valenciennes) and O. smitti (Lahille), from Patagonia. Ascocotyle (Phagicola) cameliae n. sp. is described from the intestine of S. magellanicus. The new species is placed into the subgenus Phagicola Faust, 1920 because of the presence of a single row of circumoral spines and uterine loops and vitelline follicles being confined posterior to the ventral sucker. However, it differs distinctly from other members of this subgenus by the number (19–24) and length (23–31 μm) of massive circumoral spines and by the morphology of the ventrogenital sac with a large, simple gonotyl devoid of refractile bodies. Molecular data (partial 28S rDNA sequences) for both species are also provided. Matching sequences from metacercarial and adult stages helped elucidate partially the life-cycle of A. (A.) patagoniensis. The interspecific relationships and phylogenetic position of Ascocotyle were further assessed on a broad phylogeny on the Opisthorchioidea Looss, 1899. Ascocotyle (P.) ornamentata Shalaby et al. (1993) described from decomposed worms (all circumoral spines were detached) found in a dog in Egypt, with no type-specimens of this species deposited in a repository collection, is considered to be species inquirenda. © 2018

ABSTRACT: A study was made comparing the success rate and nacre growth on half-pearl implantations in the Mabe pearl oyster (Pteria penguin, Roding, 1798). Implantations were made near the adductor muscle (#2), mantle edge (#3) and at an intermediate Position (#1). The rejection rate at Positions #1 and #2 (14.5 ± 4.9% and 14.0 ± 4.8% respectively), after 10 months were significantly lower (p < 0.05) than at Position #3 (19.0 ± 5.5%) (means ±95% conf. limits). The lowest mortality was found for oysters with an implant at Position #3 (26.0%) but this was also the position from which the oysters were most successful in rejecting the implant (19.0%). Oysters implanted at Positions #1 and #2 had higher final total mortalities that were not significantly different (35.0 ± 6.7% and 32.0 ± 6.5% respectively). Position #1 had the overall 10 month worst success rate (26.0 ± 6.1%), taking both rejection and mortality into account. About 15–20% of total losses were due to implantation failure and mortality in the first month: the average rate of loss of half-pearls was 3.33 ± 0.27% per month (n = 30). There is a trade-off between growth into larger half-pearls, overgrowth into heteromorphic pearls of no commercial value and relentlessly decreasing overall survival. A Profitability Index model shows that the best harvesting times are 8 to 10 months: losses of half-pearls offsets any gains from extra growth over this time. The Pearl farm was located in Sapum Bay, Muang, Phuket which is a well mixed bay on the east coast of Phuket island: the overall mean Secchi depth was 98.4 ± 2.8 cm, the air temperature was 28.3 ± 0.7 °C, the water temperature was 27.9 ± 0.9 °C and the salinity was 29.7 ± 0.2 ppt. Chlorophyll (Chl) content of the plankton (average total Chl a ≈ 2.23 ± 0.19 μg/l) tended to be higher during the Dry season (Dec–Mar) than in the Wet season (Apr–Nov) with no large changes in Chl ratios over the course of the study. One month had unusually high Chl values but this had no obvious effects on the oysters. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

ABSTRACT: The paleoecology of the Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) is controlled by multiple factors. In this study, we analyzed two millennial-scale ornithogenic sediment cores, RNL and RL, from the Vestfold Hills, East Antarctica. Using the Al-normalized phosphorus content of the bulk sediment and carbon/nitrogen fractions in penguin remains, we reconstructed relative changes in the penguin population size of each sub-colony and relative krill abundance in the summer Prydz Bay polynya. Both records are correlated to solar irradiance. At the centennial scale, the penguin population recorded in core RNL decreased from ~1120–860 yr BP, reached a peak from ~860–630 yr BP, remained at a low level from ~630–320 yr BP, and then increased with large fluctuations during the past ~400 years. These changes are all in-phase with the trend of solar irradiance. At the decadal scale, penguin population minima correspond to solar minima from ~490–400 yr BP (Spörer minimum), ~290–220 yr BP (Maunder minimum), and from ~160–120 yr BP (Dalton minimum; whereas population maxima correspond to solar maxima from ~1030–980 yr BP, ~350–290 yr BP, ~210–160 yr BP, ~120–70 yr BP. The population recorded in core RL exhibited the same changes as in RNL during the last 480 years. The reconstructed krill abundance also corresponds to these trends when data are available. This correspondence demonstrates a food-chain mechanism that is related to solar activity and light availability at the ocean surface, which influence the intensity of photosynthesis and phytoplankton productivity, and thus the abundance of krill and apex predators such as penguins. Our findings highlight the fact that despite the various climatic impacts on penguin populations, their effects on the base of the food chain are usually the direct drive. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Remote sensing of penguins gives a unique opportunity to observe ecosystem changes in the Antarctic and the Southern Ocean at a continent-wide scale. The extent of guano is the best proxy to the size of penguin populations but frequent cloud cover limits the number of available images. This study focuses on the correlation between guano coverage visible in aerial and satellite images and breeding pair numbers in the course of the breeding seasons 2016/17 and 2017/18 in a colony of Pygocelid penguins on Ardley Island (South Shetland Islands, Antarctica). Multitemporal UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) orthomosaics and high-resolution satellite images were collected of Ardley Island as well as data on breeding phenology, weather conditions and snow coverage. "Fresh" guano stains were classified using different methods of Geographical Object-based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) and differentiated from weathered guano stains. Analysis of this data shows that guano stains in an Antarctic Pygoscelid penguin colony undergo significant intraseasonal changes in extent, texture and spectral signature. Hence, the timing of image acquisition and the advance of snow melt during Antarctic spring matter when determining penguin populations and should be considered during the analysis. Our results show changes of up to 25&thinsp;% of the total guano covered surface due to individual weather events and changes up to 80&thinsp;% in the time between the peak of egg laying and the occurrence of the first crèche. © Authors 2019.

ABSTRACT: The study of systematics in wide-ranging seabirds can be challenging due to the vast geographic scales involved, as well as the possible discordance between molecular, morphological and behavioral data. In the Southern Ocean, macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus) are distributed over a circumpolar range including populations in Antarctic and sub-Antarctic areas. Macquarie Island, in its relative isolation, is home to a closely related endemic taxon — the royal penguin (Eudyptes schlegeli), which is distinguishable from E. chrysolophus mainly by facial coloration. Although these sister taxa are widely accepted as representing distinct species based on morphological grounds, the extent of their genome-wide differentiation remains uncertain. In this study, we use genome-wide Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms to test genetic differentiation between these geographically isolated taxa and evaluate the main drivers of population structure among breeding colonies of macaroni/royal penguins. Genetic similarity observed between macaroni and royal penguins suggests they constitute a single evolutionary unit. Nevertheless, royal penguins exhibited a tendency to cluster only with macaroni individuals from Kerguelen Island, suggesting that dispersal occurs mainly between these neighboring colonies. A stepping stone model of differentiation of macaroni/royal populations was further supported by a strong pattern of isolation by distance detected across its whole distribution range, possibly driven by large geographic distances between colonies as well as natal philopatry. However, we also detected intraspecific genomic differentiation between Antarctic and sub-Antarctic populations of macaroni penguins, highlighting the role of environmental factors together with geographic distance in the processes of genetic differentiation between Antarctic and sub-Antarctic waters. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Snow Hill Island is of particular importance because it is the site of the northernmost colony of Emperor Penguins Aptenodytes forsteri. The colony was first discovered and counted in 1997 and has been visited sporadically, with counts conducted in 2004, 2009, and 2013, ranging from 1 200–4 000 breeding pairs. In December 2018, we photographed the entire colony. From photos, we counted 2 679 chicks and 339 adult Emperor Penguins, corresponding to a population of at least 2 700 breeding pairs. Although the census took place late in the breeding cycle when some chicks had already left the colony, the population size is well above the censuses of 1997 and 2009 but significantly below counts from 2004 and 2013. Snow Hill Island, located off the Antarctic Peninsula coast, is in an area strongly influenced by recent climatic developments. The Dion Island colony on the west side of the Antarctic Peninsula is also among the northernmost colonies, but it disappeared in 2009, presumably due to the climatic factors. Therefore, monitoring this Snow Hill colony is crucial. © 2019, Marine Ornithology. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Rare earth elements (REEs), also called lanthanides, are emerging contaminants worldwide, due to their unique physical and chemical characteristics that make them essential in a variety of industrial applications. However, there is still a gap in the knowledge of occurrence and accumulation of REEs in biota, and no investigations have yet been performed in penguin feathers, which have already been widely utilized as a non-invasive tool for the biomonitoring of trace elements. The concentrations of 16 REEs were investigated in a colony of Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti)housed at the Acquario di Cattolica (Italy). Multielement determination of REEs was performed by an Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometer after a microwave digestion of feathers. As this colony lives indoors in a controlled environment, it was the ideal choice for studying lanthanide occurrence in penguin feathers. Since there is a strict link between metal levels in feathers and the diet of penguins, their food (capelin)was also tested for REEs. Chondrite normalized values revealed the same pattern for REEs in feathers and fish, but REE concentrations were an order of magnitude higher in penguin feathers, demonstrating the suitability of this tissue as a bioindicator of REEs. © 2019

ABSTRACT: An 8-year-old female Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) started to show epilepsy-like seizures. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations did not reveal any responsible lesions. The neurological symptoms worsened at the age of 10. This penguin became recumbent and died 6 months later after the apparition of the recumbency. At necropsy, only multiple yellowish necrotic lesions in the air sacs and lungs were found. Histopathological evaluation of the brain showed a marked loss of Purkinje cells and many hypertrophied parvalbumin-positive basket/stellate cells were seen in the cerebellar cortex. Calbindin immunohistochemistry demonstrated disrupted arrangement of dendrites in the Purkinje cells. This case was diagnosed as cerebellar cortical degeneration with a very late onset and a slow progression in a Magellanic penguin. © 2019, Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: Foraging strategies of penguin species can vary according to the quality of the marine environment, and this influences their abundance and breeding success. Little blue penguins (Eudyptula minor) are considered a candidate species for assessing near-shore marine productivity due to their usually limited foraging ranges and reliance on local resources, particularly while rearing chicks. Understanding the variability of little blue penguins diving behaviours will inform whether the species can be used as an environmental monitor. This research investigates diving behaviours and feather stable isotope values (as indicators of diet) of little blue penguins from Motuara Island, Marlborough Sounds, New Zealand, and compares them with little blue penguins from three other locations distributed across the country. The diving behaviour of little blue penguins, including dive depth and duration, were highly variable indicating that little blue penguins are an environmentally adaptable species. Because of the highly variable marine environments they inhabit, the use of little blue penguins as local monitors of New Zealand’s changing marine environment requires an understanding of area and population specific diving and foraging behaviour. © 2019 New Zealand Ecological Society.

ABSTRACT: Context: Locating cryptic animals is an important aspect of many wildlife management programs and research studies. However, this process can be inefficient, time-consuming and expensive. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) or drones fitted with a camera are increasingly being used for counting and monitoring wildlife∼ however, these are often not suitable for cryptic species. Very high-frequency (VHF) radio-tracking is commonplace∼ however, single-channel VHF receivers mean that animals must be tracked individually, or scanning receivers must be used∼ but this raises the possibility of signals being missed. Aims: We aimed to test the effectiveness of aerial VHF tracking using a multi-channel receiver for locating wildlife. Methods: We tracked wildlife fitted with VHF transmitters operating on individual frequencies, by means of a UAV with a multi-channel VHF receiver to simultaneously monitor all frequencies. This offered distinct advantages over traditional single-channel scanning receivers. To test and compare this novel method, yellow-eyed penguins (Megadyptes antipodes) were located on nests hidden under vegetation on Enderby Island in the New Zealand subantarctic, using manual ground searching, unassisted ground VHF tracking, as well as using location flights by the UAV Drone Ranger system. Key results: The UAV system allowed for faster nest location than did all other methods, with a higher cumulative success (number of nests found each day) and lower search effort required (person hours per nest). Conclusions: Aerial VHF tracking can greatly extend the search range and minimise search effort compared with ground VHF tracking or manual searching. Implications: This technology has applications for locating and tracking a wide range of wildlife, particularly cryptic species that may be difficult to find using other methods. © 2019 CSIRO.

ABSTRACT: To provide an easy and reliable work tool to identify the sex of Rockhopper Penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome) chicks, we weighed and measured 95 nestlings in the crèche phase during 24-31 January 2017 on the Falkland Islands, Argentina. Sex was subsequently determined using DNA analyses of blood from the same individuals. Significant differences were found in bill length (exposed culmen), bill depth and width, flipper length, and diagonal tarsus, but stepwise discriminant analysis showed bill length to be the best predictor for sex determination. Our model correctly classified 82.7% of males and 90.2% of females (overall correct classification 86.2%). Threshold bill length was 36.64 mm, with values above this point being males and values below being females. Therefore, it appears that measuring bill length is an easy, immediate, and accurate method to sex Rockhopper Penguins during the crèche phase. © 2019 The Waterbird Society.

ABSTRACT: Serological assays are commonly used in wildlife health studies to screen for exposure of an individual or a population to infectious agents. Such assays can therefore provide useful information regarding the health status of an individual or for determining the prevalence of a pathogen within a population. In this study, serological assays of three viral agents have been conducted on the Adélie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) on Ross Island, Ross Sea, Antarctica. We sampled adult Adélie Penguins during three consecutive summer breeding seasons (2010–2011, 2011–2012 and 2012–2013), and tested those samples for antibodies to avian influenza A virus, Newcastle disease virus, and infectious bursal disease virus. No antibodies were detected for avian influenza A virus in any season. Two samples in 2012–2013 were positive for Newcastle disease virus antibodies and a total of 10 samples were positive for infectious bursal disease virus antibodies during this study. This information establishes baseline data for these three viruses in Adélie Penguins at this location and can be used for future comparisons of disease prevalence in this population. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: As climate change, among other factors, is increasingly affecting Antarctic marine systems, competition for prey may increase between predators, particularly in the Antarctic Peninsula which has warmed more than elsewhere. Under such a context, we tested the feeding and trophic ecology of Gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) and Chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarctica) penguins breeding in sympatry at Livingston Island (Antarctic Peninsula) in a single season. We compared the diets of adults (from faecal samples, and stable isotopes in feathers and blood) and chicks (from stomach contents, and stable isotopes in down feathers, toenails and muscles of chicks that had died of unknown causes). Antarctic krill Euphausia superba dominated the diet of both species, although Gentoo Penguins fed on larger Antarctic krill than did Chinstrap Penguins. Stable isotope analyses of adult tissues revealed that both species fed at different niches in successive years, as depicted by the different levels δ13C in feathers (showing values from the previous breeding season) and whole blood (showing values from the current season). Tissues collected from chicks confirmed their diet over different time scales (i.e. days to weeks): Gentoo Penguins fed at a higher trophic level (possibly due to a more varied diet) and in different habitats than Chinstrap Penguins, providing evidence of isotopic niche separation of penguins. Our results may be relevant to the monitoring programmes of the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) and suggest that adult scats, and stomach contents and tissues of recently died chicks, can be used in such programmes. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Overwintering conditions often impact an individual animal’s breeding performance in the following season. These so-called carry-over effects have been demonstrated in birds, including penguins. We studied carry-over effects in Magellanic penguins Spheniscus magellanicus, a species of conservation concern, breeding at Punta Tombo, Argentina, and wintering from northern Argentina to southern Brazil. We characterized oceanographic conditions in the penguins’ wintering grounds from 1982 to 2012 using principal component analysis on weekly sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies. The first principal component represented a weak Rio de la Plata plume and warm SST. The Rio de la Plata plume carries cool, productive, low-salinity water north from the river mouth through the penguins’ wintering area. The plume is stronger (extends farther north) when winds blow from the southwest than when winds blow from the northeast. When the Rio de la Plata plume was weak in late winter, females arrived earlier to breed and were in better condition, likely because prey was concentrated in a smaller plume area closer to Punta Tombo. Females that arrived earlier laid eggs earlier, and females laid larger eggs when they arrived earlier and were in better condition. In contrast, body condition of breeding males did not vary with winter conditions. The effects on individual females varied, likely reflecting in part individual foraging ability. A weaker Rio de la Plata plume probably increased prey encounter rates closer to breeding colonies in winter, directly and indirectly improving female body condition, increasing egg size, and resulting in earlier arrival and egg laying. © Inter-Research 2018

ABSTRACT: Spatial subdivision, local extinction and recolonization influence the genetic variation of natural populations. Different levels of population structure can be identified in nature, from panmictic populations, in which high gene flow homogenizes diversity across localities, to metapopulations, where combinations of moderate to high levels of population differentiation and source-sink population dynamics are expected. Gene flow, dispersal and recolonization can be affected by changes in ecological conditions such as climate and resource distribution. Evaluating demographic history is crucial for understanding current population dynamics. We assessed a mitchondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region and microsatellite data for 210 Magellanic Penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) from 13 breeding colonies on the coastlines of Chile and Argentina, covering a great portion of the species’ distribution. We found high levels of genetic diversity and detected two genetic-geographic regions, Pacific and Atlantic, probably due to interruption of the connection between the oceans during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), when several parts of the Magellanic Channel were connected to the continent. The Atlantic ocean colonies showed a slight differentiation between the northern and southern colonies, and the Falkand/Malvinas one seems to be a mix of northern, southern and Pacific colonies. Magellanic Penguins showed intense gene flown among colonies, and exhibited low levels of genetic differentiation in each region. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the Magellanic Penguin experienced a population expansion around 17,500 years ago, which is in agreement with the timing of a decreased sea level and the exposure of the continental shelf along the coast of Argentina and the Falkland/Malvinas Islands at the end of the LGM. Thus, our results suggest that climate changes that affect the sea level in South America can play important roles in the migration of Magellanic Penguins. © 2018, Dt. Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.

ABSTRACT: The oldest fossil record of Antarctic penguins comes from Seymour Island (Antarctic Peninsula) and dates to the Paleocene and Eocene. The Paleocene bones are extremely rare, whereas specimens from the latter epoch are numerous. Despite the recent discoveries of incomplete skeletons assignable to the giant penguins from the Eocene of Antarctic Peninsula, the reliable systematics of their smaller contemporaneous relatives, known from isolated bones, have remained dependent on the tarsometatarsus. Here, new data on the skeleton of Delphinornis larseni, the most abundant among non-giant Eocene penguins, are reported. The specimen, collected from the Submeseta Formation on Seymour Island, comprises the incomplete pelvis and numerous bones from the hind-limb skeleton, including a well-preserved (diagnostic) tarsometatarsus. The acetabular foramen is, like in larger fossil penguins, clearly smaller than the elongated ilioischiadic foramen. The area of the latter opening, not occupied by the connective-tissue sheet, supposedly accounted for one-third of the foramen. We propose that the ischiadic artery was, unlike in present-day penguins, the main blood vessel supplying most of the hind limb. The proximal fovea of the femoral head is uniquely preserved, revealing an osteological aspect of the bone-ligament interface. We surmise that the individual was similar, in terms of body size, to extant Pygoscelis papua, but was characterized by more elongate feet. In our opinion, it was probably a young bird, up to several years old. © 2019 Paleontological Society.

ABSTRACT: Wildlife watching is an emerging ecotourism activity around the world. In Australia and New Zealand, night viewing of little penguins attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors per year. As penguins start coming ashore after sunset, artificial lighting is essential to allow visitors to view them in the dark. This alteration of the nightscape warrants investigation for any potential effects of artificial lighting on penguin behavior. We experimentally tested how penguins respond to different light wavelengths (colors) and intensities to examine effects on the colony attendance behavior at two sites on Phillip Island, Australia. At one site, nocturnal artificial illumination has been used for penguin viewing for decades, whereas at the other site, the only light is from the natural night sky. Light intensity did not affect colony attendance behaviors of penguins at the artificially lit site, probably due to penguin habituation to lights. At the not previously lit site, penguins preferred lit paths over dark paths to reach their nests. Thus, artificial light might enhance penguin vision at night and consequently it might reduce predation risk and energetic costs of locomotion through obstacle and path detection. Although penguins are faithful to their path, they can be drawn to artificial lights at small spatial scale, so light pollution could attract penguins to undesirable lit areas. When artificial lighting is required, we recommend keeping lighting as dim and time-restricted as possible to mitigate any negative effects on the behavior of penguins and their natural habitat. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Environmental changes often affect the persistence of species or populations at different spatial and temporal scales. Thus, species must either adapt to these changes or experience negative impacts at the individual or population levels. Southern Rockhopper Penguins Eudyptes chrysocome are distributed throughout the Southern Ocean and have experienced substantial declines in the past which were linked to various anthropogenic and environmental factors. The aim of this study was to investigate the foraging behavior of male Southern Rockhopper Penguins at Berkeley Sound, East Falkland, Falkland/Malvinas Islands, during incubation, a period at-sea which is crucial for replenishing body condition between two extended fasting periods ashore. Thus, birds are forced to forage efficiently during that time to balance their energy demands. We linked their at-sea distribution and foraging behavior to satellite-derived sea surface temperatures and temperature-depth profiles which were recorded by devices attached to the birds. While Southern Rockhopper Penguins usually travel several hundreds of km out into the open sea on multiple-day trips during incubation, we found in our study that most birds foraged close inshore, less than 9 km away from their colony, and regularly returned to their breeding site. We propose that this behavior occurred in response to the close proximity of the 8 °C SST isotherm and the vertical stratification of the waters therein. Also, while usually feeding pelagically in open waters, there are strong indications that Southern Rockhopper Penguins performed benthic or, at least, near-bottom dives to catch their prey during these short trips. The consequences of this behavioral plasticity in response to variations in sea temperatures and inferred prey availability are discussed, especially with regard to predicted global climate change. © 2018, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: King penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus Miller) are major consumers in the Southern Ocean. The colony at Ile aux Cochons, Iles Crozet, in the southern Indian Ocean was known in the 1980s as the largest king penguin colony and the second largest penguin colony in the world. However, there have not been any recent estimates of this colony. Aerial photographs taken from a helicopter, and satellite images were used to report on changes in the colony and population sizes over the past 50 years. The colony has declined by 88% over the past 35 years, from c. 500 000 pairs to 60 000 pairs. The possible causes of this decline were explored but no plausible explanation for such an unprecedented decrease in penguin populations was found. The study highlights the use of satellite imagery as a non-invasive technique for population monitoring, and stresses the need for further research on the causes of this alarming trend in this colony. © Antarctic Science Ltd 2018.

ABSTRACT: We developed a Hidden Markov mark–recapture model (R package marked) to examine sex-specific demography in Magellanic Penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus). Our model was based on 33 yr of resightings at Punta Tombo, Argentina, where we banded ~44,000 chicks from 1983 to 2010. Because we sexed only 57% of individuals over their lifetime, we treated sex as an uncertain state in our model. Our goals were to provide insight into the population dynamics of this declining colony, to inform conservation of this species, and to highlight the importance of considering sex-specific vital rates in demographic seabird studies. Like many other seabirds, Magellanic Penguins are long-lived, serially monogamous, and exhibit obligate biparental care. We found that the non-breeding-season survival of females was lower than that of males and that the magnitude of this bias was highest for juveniles. Biases in survival accumulated as cohorts aged, leading to increasingly skewed sex ratios. The survival bias was greatest in years when overall survival was low, that is, females fared disproportionality worse when conditions were unfavorable. Our model-estimated survival patterns are consistent with independent data on carcasses from the species’ non-breeding grounds, showing that mortality is higher for juveniles than for adults and higher for females than for males. Juveniles may be less efficient foragers than adults are and, because of their smaller size, females may show less resilience to food scarcity than males. We used perturbation analysis of a population matrix model to determine the impact of sex-biased survival on adult sex ratio and population growth rate at Punta Tombo. We found that adult sex ratio and population growth rate have the greatest proportional response, that is, elasticity, to female pre-breeder and adult survival. Sex bias in juvenile survival (i.e., lower survival of females) made the greatest contribution to population declines from 1990 to 2009. Because starvation is a leading cause of morality in juveniles and adults, precautionary fisheries and spatial management in the region could help to slow population decline. Our data add to growing evidence that knowledge of sex-specific demography and sex ratios are necessary for accurate assessment of seabird population trends. © 2018 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: In the d'Urville Sea in East Antarctica, a population of roughly 20,000 pairs of Adélie penguins of Iles des Pétrels (Terre Adélie) has experienced two massive breeding failures, with no chick surviving the 2013-14 and 2016-17 breeding seasons. In both seasons the extent of sea ice in front of the colony persisted throughout the breeding cycle of the birds. The timing of sea-ice recession differed greatly between seasons and the absence of polynya in a crucial phase of the cycle were paramount in driving these failures. The change in the icescape in front of Ile des Pétrels following the calving of the Mertz glacier in 2010, together with increase in precipitations and changes in sea-ice firmness explain this situation and are discussed in the present manuscript. To prevent additional future impacts on this colony, like competition with fisheries for instance, we strongly support a scientific research zone in the d'Urville Sea-Mertz area, one of the three zones of proposed Marine Protected Area in East Antarctica to the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. © 2018 Ropert-Coudert, Kato, Shiomi, Barbraud, Angelier, Delord, Poupart, Koubbi and Raclot.

ABSTRACT: Fildes Peninsula, with a high density of scientific stations, has been significantly impacted by anthropogenic activities. However, the contamination from penguins, a biovector that transports pollutants from ocean to land, has seldom been assessed. In this study, 32 lacustrine surface sediment samples on Fildes Peninsula and 8 lacustrine surface sediment samples on Ardley Island were collected to determine Cu, Zn, Pb, Ni, Cr, Cd, Co, Sb, Hg and P levels. The results showed that the heavy metal contents of lacustrine sediments on Ardley Island are significantly higher than those on Fildes Peninsula. The contaminants on Fildes Peninsula are mainly derived from anthropogenic activities, while the contaminants on Ardley Island are transported to the lacustrine sediments in the form of penguin guanos after a series of biomagnification in the food chain. The results indicated that the impact of penguin-transported contamination on Antarctic environment outweighs human activities near scientific stations in some areas. Therefore, more attention should be paid to the impacts of Antarctic animals on the Antarctic environment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: In a practical feeding trial at Ouwehand Zoo, plasma concentrations of vitamin A1, calcidiol (D3), α-tocopherol (E), and B1 in 17 Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) were measured before and after supplementation to gain insight into the effect of supplementing these vitamins in animals being fed thawed frozen-fish diets. None of the penguins received vitamin supplements for at least 6 mo before the supplementation trial, which was conducted prior to their normal nesting and molting period. During the trial period, eight penguins received daily vitamin A1, D3, tocopheryl acetate, and B1 supplementation placed in their fish immediately prior to feeding and nine control penguins received no supplementation. Concentrations of vitamins A1, D3, α-tocopherol, and B1 were also measured in the thawed ready-to-feed fish. Concentrations of vitamins B1 and α-tocopherol were below the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) recommendations for penguin diets, while concentrations of vitamins A1 and D3 were far above AZA recommendations. At the start of the study and after 70 days of supplementation, plasma concentrations were determined for these vitamins. Vitamin B1 concentrations in plasma increased significantly (P < 0.05) between Day 0 (mean 39.9 μg/L) and day 70 (mean 160.5 μg/L) in the supplemented group. Plasma vitamin D3 and α-tocopherol did not show a significant change. Vitamin A1 levels in the supplemented group decreased significantly from 1.65 mg/L on day 0 to 1.4 mg/L on day 70. In the control group no significant changes were observed. The results of the study support the necessity of supplementing vitamin B1 in penguins fed thawed frozen fish. Depletion of vitamin A and E concentrations in frozen food fish over time support recommendations to regularly measure vitamin concentrations in different batches of frozen fish. © 2018 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) have been reported to become stranded along the coasts of northern Argentina, Uruguay and southern Brazil during the austral winter [1–3]. This location is more than a thousand kilometers distant from their northernmost breeding colony in northern Patagonia. Curiously, females typically outnumber males at stranding sites (approximately three females per male) [2]. To date, no conspicuous sex differences have been reported in their migratory movements [3], although records are lacking during the peak stranding season. Consequently, the reason(s) for the female-biased stranding remain unknown, despite the growing necessity for understanding their behavior outside the breeding season [3]. We recorded at-sea distributions of Magellanic penguins throughout the non-breeding period using animal-borne data loggers and found that females reached more northern areas than males and did not dive as deep during winter (Figure 1). Such sexual differences in spatial domains might be driven by mechanisms related to sexual size dimorphism, such as the avoidance of intraspecific competition for food resources [4], differences in thermal habitat preference [5] or differences in the ability to withstand the northward-flowing ocean circulation [6]. Individual penguins that winter in northern areas are likely to be at greater risk of natural [7] and anthropogenic threats [8], and probably more so in females, as more females than males tend to frequent areas closer to the sites where penguins strand. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the spatial domains of each sex throughout the annual cycle that are associated with different mortality risks. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd
Yamamoto et al. report sex-related differences in the distribution and diving behavior of Magellanic penguins during the non-breeding period owing to sexual size dimorphism, and demonstrate that females tend to frequent areas closer to penguin stranding sites, which could be related to the well-known phenomenon of female-biased stranding in winter. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Penguins face a wide range of threats. Most observed population changes have been negative and have happened over the last 60 years. Today, populations of 11 penguin species are decreasing. Here we present a review that synthesizes details of threats faced by the world's 18 species of penguins. We discuss alterations to their environment at both breeding sites on land and at sea where they forage. The major drivers of change appear to be climate, and food web alterations by marine fisheries. In addition, we also consider other critical and/or emerging threats, namely human disturbance near nesting sites, pollution due to oil, plastics and chemicals such as mercury and persistent organic compounds. Finally, we assess the importance of emerging pathogens and diseases on the health of penguins. We suggest that in the context of climate change, habitat degradation, introduced exotic species and resource competition with fisheries, successful conservation outcomes will require new and unprecedented levels of science and advocacy. Successful conservation stories of penguin species across their geographical range have occurred where there has been concerted effort across local, national and international boundaries to implement effective conservation planning. © 2019 Ropert-Coudert, Chiaradia, Ainley, Barbosa, Boersma, Brasso, Dewar, Ellenberg, García-Borboroglu, Emmerson, Hickcox, Jenouvrier, Kato, McIntosh, Lewis, Ramírez, Ruoppolo, Ryan, Seddon, Sherley, Vanstreels, Waller, Woehler and Trathan.

ABSTRACT: Aim: To predict the at-sea distribution of chinstrap penguins across the South Orkney Islands and to quantify the overlap with the Southern Ocean krill fishery. Location: South Orkney Islands, Antarctica. Methods: Penguins from four colonies across the South Orkney Islands were tracked using global positioning systems (GPSs) and time depth recorders (TDRs). Relationships between a variety of environmental and geometric variables and the at-sea distribution of penguins were investigated using general additive models for the three main phases of the breeding season. Subsequently, the final models were extrapolated across the South Orkney archipelago to predict the at-sea distribution of penguins from colonies where no tracking data are available. Finally, the overlap between areas used by chinstrap penguins and the krill fishery was quantified. Results: The foraging distribution of chinstrap penguins can be predicted using two simple and static variables: the distance from the colony and the direction of travel towards the shelf-edge, while avoiding high densities of Pygoscelis penguins from other colonies. Additionally, we find that the chinstrap penguins breeding on the South Orkney Islands use areas which overlap with frequently used krill fishing areas and that this overlap is most prominent during the brood and crèche phases of the breeding season. Main conclusions: This is the first step in understanding the potential impacts of the krill fishery, for all colonies including those where no empirical tracking data are available. However, with the available data, it is not currently possible to infer an impact of the krill fisheries on penguins. With this in mind, we recommend the implementation of monitoring schemes to investigate the effects of prey depletion on predator populations and to ensure that management continues to follow a precautionary approach and is addressed at spatial and temporal scales relevant to ecosystem operation. © 2018 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: During the breeding season, seabirds must balance the changing demands of self- and off-spring provisioning with the constraints imposed by central-place foraging. Recently, it was shown that Northern Rockhopper Penguins at Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic Ocean switch diet from lower to higher trophic level prey throughout their breeding cycle. Here, we investigated if this switch is reflected in their foraging behaviour, using time-depth recorders to study the diving behaviour of 27 guard and 10 crèche birds during the breeding season 2010 at Tristan da Cunha and obtaining complementary stomach contents of 20 birds. While no significant effects of breeding stage were detected on any foraging trip or dive parameters, stage/prey had a significant effect on feeding dive parameters, with dive duration, bottom time, and maximum depth explaining the majority of the dissimilarity amongst categories. We verified the previously shown dietary shift from zooplankton and cephalopods during the guard stage to a higher-energy fish-based diet during the crèche stage, which was reflected in a change in dive behaviour from shorter, shallower to longer, deeper dives. This prey switching behaviour may reflect preferential selection to account for the increased physiological needs of chicks or simply mirror changes in local prey abundance. Nonetheless, we show that Northern Rockhopper Penguins demonstrate behavioural plasticity as a response to their changing energy requirements, which is a critical trait when living in a spatio-temporally heterogeneous environment. This ability is likely to be particularly important under extrinsic constraints such as long-term environmental change. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The position and arrangement of nuclei is the most important technical aspect of mabé pearl (half-pearl) production. This study examined the effects of nucleus arrangement, profile (height) and position, on quality, nacre thickness and shape of mabé pearls produced by Pteria penguin. Oysters implanted with three nuclei produced a greater proportion of saleable mabé pearls with more regular shapes than oysters implanted with five nuclei. Use of low profile nuclei resulted in mabé pearls with increased nacre thickness and produced mabé pearls of significantly higher quality, with more regular shapes than high profile nuclei. Nucleus position significantly influenced mabé pearl quality, nacre thickness and shape. The posterior-ventral position of the left shell valve produced mabé pearls of the highest quality with the thickest nacre and was the best location for mabé pearl culture. Based on the results of this study, it is recommended that P. penguin is implanted with a maximum of three nuclei to increase the production of regular-shaped mabé pearls, and that low profile nuclei are used to improve quality and nacre thickness of mabé pearls produced in less favourable nucleus positions. An optimal nucleus arrangement for P. penguin of 130–150 mm dorso-ventral height would include one high profile nucleus in the posterior-ventral position of the left shell plus additional low profile nuclei in both the anterior-ventral position of the left shell valve and, the center of the right shell. Based on the quality grading system used in this study, a minimum commercial nacre thickness of 0.25 mm is recommended for mabé pearl production using P. penguin. © 2018

ABSTRACT: Magellanic Penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) are common winter visitors of the Brazilian continental shelf. In this study we report the occurrence of discolored and worn-out plumage in juvenile Magellanic Penguins washed ashore during summer on the southeast and northeast coast of Brazil. In the affected individuals, the areas of the plumage that would normally be black or dark grey were discolored to tones ranging from brown to cream-white, especially on the head and dorsum. Upon close examination, the feathers were often brittle and appeared “old” and worn-out, at times leading to irregular and asymmetric patches of feather-loss in the lower back. We propose five factors that could be involved in causing this condition: (a) molt skipping, (b) sun exposure, (c) malnutrition, (d) insufficient preening, and (e) chewing lice. © 2018, Sociedade Brasileira de Ornitologia.

ABSTRACT: The Southern Ocean is currently experiencing major environmental changes, including in sea-ice cover. Such changes strongly influence ecosystem structure and functioning and affect the survival and reproduction of predators such as seabirds. These effects are likely mediated by reduced availability of food resources. As such, seabirds are reliable eco-indicators of environmental conditions in the Antarctic region. Here, based on 9 years of sea-ice data, we found that the breeding success of Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) reaches a peak at intermediate sea-ice cover (ca. 20%). We further examined the effects of sea-ice conditions on the foraging activity of penguins, measured at multiple scales from individual dives to foraging trips. Analysis of temporal organisation of dives, including fractal and bout analyses, revealed an increasingly consistent behaviour during years with extensive sea-ice cover. The relationship between several dive parameters and sea-ice cover in the foraging area appears to be quadratic. In years of low and high sea-ice cover, individuals adjusted their diving effort by generally diving deeper, more frequently and by resting at the surface between dives for shorter periods of time than in years with intermediate sea-ice cover. Our study therefore suggests that sea-ice cover is likely to affect the reproductive performance of Adélie penguins through its effects on foraging behaviour, as breeding success and most diving parameters share a common optimum. Some years, however, deviated from this general trend, suggesting that other factors (e.g. precipitation during the breeding season) might sometimes become preponderant over the sea-ice effects on breeding and foraging performance. Our study highlights the value of monitoring fitness parameters and individual behaviour concomitantly over the long-term to better characterize optimal environmental conditions and potential resilience of wildlife. Such an approach is crucial if we want to anticipate the effects of environmental change on Antarctic penguin populations. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

ABSTRACT: Interspecific competition can drive niche partitioning along multidimensional axes, including allochrony. Competitor matching will arise where the phenology of sympatric species with similar ecological requirements responds to climate change at different rates such that allochrony is reduced. Our study quantifies the degree of niche segregation in foraging areas and depths that arises from allochrony in sympatric Adélie and chinstrap penguins and explores its resilience to climate change. Three-dimensional tracking data were sampled during all stages of the breeding season and were used to parameterise a behaviour-based model that quantified spatial overlap of foraging areas under different scenarios of allochrony. The foraging ranges of the two species were similar within breeding stages, but differences in their foraging ranges between stages, combined with the observed allochrony of 28 days, resulted in them leapfrogging each other through the breeding season such that they were exploiting different foraging locations on the same calendar dates. Allochrony reduced spatial overlap in the peripheral utilisation distribution of the two species by 54.0% over the entire breeding season, compared to a scenario where the two species bred synchronously. Analysis of long-term phenology data revealed that both species advanced their laying dates in relation to October air temperatures at the same rate, preserving allochrony and niche partitioning. However, if allochrony is reduced by just a single day, the spatial overlap of the core utilisation distribution increased by an average of 2.1% over the entire breeding season. Niche partitioning between the two species by allochrony appears to be resilient to climate change and so competitor matching cannot be implicated in the observed population declines of the two penguin species across the Western Antarctic Peninsula. © 2018 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Plumage aberrations are rare in penguin species. Tracking their occurrence is helpful to understand the effects of these phenotypes on the life history of penguins, especially on mating, breeding, and foraging success. We registered a brown Adélie Penguin Pygoscelis adeliae at Turret Point, King George Island, Maritime Antarctica, during the middle of the 2017/2018 breeding season. The individual was brooding one chick in a nest located in the center of the colony and its partner was by its side. Both chick and partner showed normal plumage, reaffirming the recessive character of brown mutations. A breeding aberrant bird nesting in the center of the colony indicates that the brown coloration does not seem to affect mate selection, but we could not verify if it affects breeding success. This is the third published record for Adélie Penguins following a gap of 40 years. We stress, however, that possible misclassifications of brown aberrations in literature might be causing an underestimation of its occurrence rate in bird populations. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The Magellanic Penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) is the most abundant and widely distributed seabird breeding on the Patagonian Coast of Argentina. We combined conventional stomach content and stable isotope analysis to assess Magellanic Penguin diet during the chick rearing stage at the two northernmost colonies in an area subject to fisheries. In 2011 and 2013, Thornfish (Bovichtus argentinus) was the main prey by mass at Complejo Islote Lobos (63.0% and 32.3%, respectively) and Argentine Anchovy (Engraulis anchoita) at Estancia San Lorenzo (85.2 and 63.3%, respectively). Magellanic Penguins from both colonies showed low isotopic niche overlap in 2011 (36%) and no overlap in 2013, suggesting a different use of prey species and/or foraging areas. Stable isotope mixing models showed that Argentine Anchovy (52.8%) and Thornfish (65.9%) were the main prey at Complejo Islote Lobos in 2011 and 2013, respectively, while Patagonian Redfish (Sebastes oculatus) (46.4%) and Squat Lobster (Munida gregaria) (50%) were the main prey at Estancia San Lorenzo in 2011 and 2013, respectively. Results show that in addition to Argentine Anchovy, previously recognized as main prey for breeding Magellanic Penguins in northern Patagonia, other juvenile or small sized fish are important diet items. Diet results suggest different scenarios of food conditions for each colony, despite the relative short distance between breeding locations. The low contribution of Argentine Hake (Merluccius hubbsi) and Argentine Shortfin Squid (Illex argentinus) suggests a low trophic overlap with commercial fisheries. The information provided is key to understand changes in the marine ecosystem and potential penguin-fishery interactions. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Aspergillosis continues to be one of the most important causes of disease in captive penguins. As such, designing exhibits and holding areas that minimize the risk of aspergillosis is of great interest; however, very little has been published regarding this topic. The goal of this study was to assess total fungal spore loads as well as the loads of Aspergillus spp. encountered in multiple indoor and outdoor microenvironments around the exhibit for a large colony of African penguins (Spheniscus demersus). Air samples were collected via impaction at the microenvironments on a monthly basis over a 1-yr period. Results of this study indicated seasonal trends in both total fungal spore loads as well as Aspergillus spp. loads, with the lowest levels encountered during January through April. During the warmer, more humid spring, summer, and fall months when outdoor microenvironments experienced the highest fungal loads, the air-handling system and the pleated filters used indoors are thought to have reduced the fungal loads in the indoor microenvironments compared with the outdoor microenvironments. Additionally, surrounding planting beds were thought to contribute to the higher total fungal loads and Aspergillus spp. loads in the outdoor microenvironments. Results of this study are useful in understanding the factors that contribute to Aspergillus spp. loads in areas that house penguins, and can be used in guiding design, construction, and landscaping of penguin enclosures. © 2018 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Human impacts have substantially reduced avian biodiversity in many parts of the world, particularly on isolated islands of the Pacific Ocean. The New Zealand archipelago, including its five subantarctic island groups, holds breeding grounds for a third of the world's penguin species, including several representatives of the diverse crested penguin genus Eudyptes. While this species-rich genus has been little studied genetically, recent population estimates indicate that several Eudyptes taxa are experiencing demographic declines. Although crested penguins are currently limited to southern regions of the New Zealand archipelago, prehistoric fossil and archaeological deposits suggest a wider distribution during prehistoric times, with breeding ranges perhaps extending to the North Island. Here, we analyse ancient, historic and modern DNA sequences to explore two hypotheses regarding the recent history of Eudyptes in New Zealand, testing for (1) human-driven extinction of Eudyptes lineages; and (2) reduced genetic diversity in surviving lineages. From 83 prehistoric bone samples, each tentatively identified as ‘Eudyptes spp.’, we genetically identified six prehistoric penguin taxa from mainland New Zealand, including one previously undescribed genetic lineage. Moreover, our Bayesian coalescent analyses indicated that, while the range of Fiordland crested penguin (E. pachyrhynchus) may have contracted markedly over the last millennium, genetic DNA diversity within this lineage has remained relatively constant. This result contrasts with human-driven biodiversity reductions previously detected in several New Zealand coastal vertebrate taxa. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The present study describes the effects of various wavelengths of light on locomotion and byssal reattachment activities in the pearl oyster Pteria penguin, the most widespread cultured winged oyster for the production of valuable mabé pearls. Responses of pearl oysters to light have not yet been carefully observed and documented, despite the fact that light is known to influence the positioning of animals within the water column subject to local environmental conditions. To appropriately assess oyster movements and subsequent byssal reattachment, juveniles were filmed during unnatural light-dark cycles, alternating light and darkness every 6 h. Another experiment, to observe reactions to different light colors, was carried out by subjecting juveniles to either red or blue light during a continuous observation period of 24 h. Byssal reattachment for each juvenile was recorded at the end of each observation period. Light, independent of its color, strongly inhibited both locomotion and byssal reattachment activities in juveniles. Moreover, locomotion was observed to be unrelated to the shell size, but it is suggested that a large byssus may be responsible for inhibiting movement by preventing complete extension of the foot. High byssal reattachment rates to substrata under darkness in oyster juveniles is an important factor to take in consideration after detachment events during cleaning or when transplanting seeds to farm grounds. © 2018 National Shellfisheries Association.

ABSTRACT: In the context of sexual selection, animals have developed a variety of cues conveying information about the sex of an individual to conspecifics. In many colonial seabird species, where females and males are monomorphic and do not show obvious differences in external morphology, acoustic cues are an important signal for individual and sex recognition. Here, we study the vocal and morphological sex dimorphism in the King Penguin Aptenodytes patagonicus, a colonial, monomorphic seabird for which our knowledge about the role of vocalizations and morphology in mate choice is very limited. Data were collected at Possession Island, Crozet Archipelago, in a breeding colony consisting of about 16 000 breeding pairs. Using measurements of six morphological features and analysing acoustic parameters of call recordings of adult individuals, we show that King Penguins can be sexed based on a single morphological measurement of the beak with an accuracy of 79%. We found a sex-specific syntax in adult King Penguin calls that provided a 100% accurate method to distinguish between the sexes in our study population. To confirm the method at the species level, we analysed calls recorded from King Penguin adults in Kerguelen Island, 1300 km away from our study population and found the same accuracy of the sex-specific syntax. This sex-specific syllable arrangement is rare in non-passerines and is a first step in understanding the mate choice process in this species. Furthermore, it offers a cost-effective, non-invasive technique for researchers to sex King Penguins in the field. © 2018 British Ornithologists’ Union

ABSTRACT: Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been spreading to Antarctica for over half a century. Penguins are effective indicators of pelagic concentrations of POPs. We synthesized the literature on penguins to assess temporal trends of pelagic contamination in Antarctica, using fat and eggs to monitor changes from 1964 to 2011. DDT/DDE ratios suggest long-range atmospheric transport. Average DDT in fat (ww) increased from 44 ng g−1 in the 1960s, peaked at 171 ng g−1 in the mid-1980s, and then declined slowly to the present level of 101 ng g−1. Temporal trends in HCB contamination rose into the 1990s before declining. ∑HCHs in fat was ∼5 ng g−1 from 1960 to 1979, peaking at 33 ng g−1 during the period 1980–1989 before declining to ∼5 ng g−1 from 1990 to present. PCBs rose substantially from 1970 to 2009 in fat, varying more than DDTs and HCB in both fat and eggs. Antarctic penguins are good biological indicators of global DDT and HCB emissions, but the existing data are insufficient regarding HCHs and PCBs. Measurements of persistent organic pollutants in the fat and eggs of Antarctic penguins were synthesized to determine trends in the exposure of food webs in the Southern Ocean over the last half-century. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: We assessed whether the mass of Adélie penguin Pygoscelis adeliae fledglings at 3 colonies of markedly disparate size on Ross Island, Ross Sea, correlated with their eventual return as subadults. We compared our results with those from Anvers Island, Bellingshausen Sea. Colony sizes at Ross Island have been increasing, contrary to decreasing size at Anvers Island. At Ross Island, during the month prior to fledging, chick diet consisted equally of energy-dense Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarctica and less-caloric crystal krill Euphausia crystallorophias, while at Anvers Island the diet was principally Antarctic krill E. superba. At Ross Island, the mass of fledglings who subsequently returned (mean ± SE: 3.4 ± 0.0411 kg) exceeded that of those not seen again (3.2 ± 0.0251 kg), compared to Anvers Island (3.2 vs. 3.0 kg, respectively). At Ross Island, fledging mass was inversely related to colony size and, at the largest colony, fledging mass decreased as the colony grew. Average mass of returnees at the largest colony was less than the mass at Anvers Island for those fledglings that did not return. The mean proportion of fish in the chicks’ diet decreased at the largest Ross Island colony over time, as did fledging mass. We hypothesize that intraspecific competition increased along with colony size, decreasing the availability of fish. We further hypothesize that at the large Ross Island colony, post-fledging penguins must be finding adequate prey, and more energy-dense fish, just outside the colony’s foraging area to explain opposing trends in colony trajectories. © The authors 2018.

ABSTRACT: Mystic Aquarium has successfully maintained an active breeding population of African penguins since 1990. Between 1990 and 2015, 477 eggs were laid, 84 of which were recommended for rearing according to the SSP Breeding and Transfer Plan. Sixty-five percent hatched successfully, and total fertility ranged from 56% to 78%. Of the 55 hatchlings, 60% of chicks reached fledgling age (80 days). Of the 22 chicks that died before fledging, 59% died within 7 days of hatching, and 82% within 30 days of hatching. Categories of mortality were broken down into the following categories: failure to thrive (in the absence of a definitive cause of death) (41%), respiratory disease (32%), parent-associated trauma (13%), congenital defects (9%), and gastrointestinal disease (5%). Analysis of associated factors identified a significant correlation between the hatch weights of chicks that survived beyond day 7 (60.5–66.0 g), and those that did not (49.5–59.5 g). Further positive correlations were established between chick hatch weight and both dam body weight, and egg weight. While hand-reared chicks gained weight more slowly than their parent-reared counterparts, results showed that rearing method had no significant impact on survival. The findings of this study provide a baseline for assessing reproductive success and chick mortality, and supply prognostic indicators for evaluating chick success in managed African penguin populations. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Climate-induced range overlap can result in novel interactions between similar species and potentially lead to competitive exclusion. The West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is one of the most rapidly warming regions on Earth and is experiencing a poleward climate migration from a polar to subpolar environment. This has resulted in a range expansion of the ice-intolerant gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) and a coincident decrease in ice-obligate Adélie penguins (P. adeliae) near Palmer Station, Anvers Island, WAP. Ecologically similar species that share a limited prey resource must occupy disparate foraging niches in order to co-exist. Therefore, we determined the extent of foraging and dietary niche segregation between Adélie and gentoo penguins during the austral breeding season near Palmer Station. This research was conducted across six breeding seasons, from 2009 to 2014, which allowed us to investigate niche overlap in the context of interannual resource variability. Using biotelemetry and diet sampling, we found substantial overlap in the diets of Adélie and gentoo penguins, who primarily consumed Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba); however, our results showed that Adélie and gentoo penguins partitioned this shared prey resource through horizontal segregation of their core foraging areas. We did not find evidence that Antarctic krill were a limiting resource during the breeding season or that climate-induced sympatry of Adélie and gentoo penguins resulted in competition for prey or caused the subsequent differing population trajectories. This apparent absence of resource competition between Adélie and gentoo penguins throughout this study implies that current population trends in this region are governed by other biological and physical factors. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the mechanistic processes that influence top predator populations in the context of climate-driven ecosystem shifts. © 2018 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Migratory species often roam vast distances bringing them into contact with diverse conditions and threats that could play significant roles in their population dynamics. This is especially true if long-range travels occur within crucial stages of a species’ annual life-cycle. Crested penguins, for example, usually disperse over several hundreds of kilometres after completing the energetically demanding breeding season and in preparation for the costly annual moult. A basic understanding of crested penguins’ pre-moult dispersal is therefore paramount in order to be able to assess factors affecting individual survival. The Fiordland penguin, or Tawaki, the only crested penguin species breeding on the New Zealand mainland, is currently one of the least studied and rarest penguin species in the world. We successfully satellite tracked the pre-moult dispersal of 17 adult Tawaki from a single colony located in the species’ northern breeding distribution. Over the course of 8–10 weeks the penguins travelled up to 2,500 km away from their breeding colony, covering total swimming distances of up to 6,800 km. During outbound travels all penguins headed south-west within a well-defined corridor before branching out towards two general trip destinations. Birds leaving in late November travelled towards the Subtropical Front some 800 km south of Tasmania, whereas penguins that left in December headed further towards the subantarctic front. Using K-select analysis we examined the influence of oceanographic factors on the penguins’ dispersal. Water depth, surface current velocity and sea level anomalies had the greatest influence on penguin movements at the subantarctic Front, while sea surface temperature and chlorophyll a concentration were key for birds travelling to the subtropical front. We discuss our findings in the light of anthropogenic activities (or lack thereof) in the regions visited by the penguins as well as the potential consequences of Tawaki pre-moult dispersal for the species’ breeding distribution on the New Zealand mainland. © 2018 Mattern et al.

ABSTRACT: Adult emperor penguins Aptenodytes forsteri breed on fast ice and forage within sea ice in winter. However, it remains unknown whether juveniles exhibit similar foraging behavior during their early life at-sea movements, and how it links with the oceanographic conditions. We investigated the first at-sea odyssey of 15 juvenile emperor penguins from Terre Adélie in 2013−2014. The average tracking duration was 167 ± 110 d SD (range 86−344 d). After departing the colony in December/January, the juveniles traveled north up to 53.76° S before heading south in April/May to forage within the sea ice. The juveniles spent 49 ± 14% of their total recorded trips (n = 12) in the sea ice, over both the continental slope and deep ocean regions. The penguins dived primarily during daylight. Within sea ice, the juveniles performed both shallow and deep dives, with the proportion of each varying seasonally. The switch to primarily deep dives in the autumn and winter within sea ice may be a consequence of (1) a seasonal change in the krill distribution from surface to deep waters and/or (2) the presence of macrozooplankton at depth due to a reduced/absent diel migration. Furthermore, we showed for the first time that the diving behavior of juveniles was associated with the mixed layer depth. We suggest they feed on mesopelagic prey aggregating near the thermocline. This study provides insight into an important, but poorly understood, part of the emperor penguin life cycle, essential to predict their response to future climate change. © The authors 2019.

ABSTRACT: The mechanisms that determine patterns of species dispersal are important factors in the production and maintenance of biodiversity. Understanding these mechanisms helps to forecast the responses of species to environmental change. Here, we used a comparative framework and genomewide data obtained through RAD-Seq to compare the patterns of connectivity among breeding colonies for five penguin species with shared ancestry, overlapping distributions and differing ecological niches, allowing an examination of the intrinsic and extrinsic barriers governing dispersal patterns. Our findings show that at-sea range and oceanography underlie patterns of dispersal in these penguins. The pelagic niche of emperor (Aptenodytes forsteri), king (A. patagonicus), Adélie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and chinstrap (P. antarctica) penguins facilitates gene flow over thousands of kilometres. In contrast, the coastal niche of gentoo penguins (P. papua) limits dispersal, resulting in population divergences. Oceanographic fronts also act as dispersal barriers to some extent. We recommend that forecasts of extinction risk incorporate dispersal and that management units are defined by at-sea range and oceanography in species lacking genetic data. © 2018 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Breeding status directly affects the at-sea behaviour of seabirds, resulting in marked differences between breeding and non-breeding birds. In this study, we report for the first time the foraging and diving behaviour of coexisting incubating, courting and non-breeding King Penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) at a recently established colony in Tierra del Fuego, Chile, to determine differences in (1) the number and duration of the foraging trips, (2) time spent at sea and on land, and (3) diving performance and foraging success. We obtained data from four incubating, five courting and three non-breeding penguins equipped with time–depth recorders during November and December 2014. Incubating birds performed a single but long trip (8.1 ± 1.9 days), while courting birds performed one or two trips of intermediate duration (2.3 ± 0.8 days) and non-breeders made multiple short trips (0.6 ± 0.1 days). Courting birds spent a significantly greater proportion of their time on land than the other birds. Incubating birds performed the deepest and longest dives and had the highest diving efficiency, while non-breeders performed the shallowest and shortest dives and exhibited low diving efficiencies, suggesting that birds are utilising different foraging areas. These results indicate that incubating, courting and non-breeding King Penguins, although coexisting temporally at the same colony, differentially adjust their foraging and diving behaviour, most likely to accomplish their specific social and energetic demands. © 2018, © 2018 BirdLife Australia.

ABSTRACT: Vitamin A comprises vitamin A1 and vitamin A2; vitamin A1 is retinol and its fatty-acid esters and vitamin A2 is 3,4-didehydroretinol and its fatty-acid esters. Although vitamin A1 is generally recognized as the major vitamin A, vitamin A2 is found in some birds and mammals that eat fish containing vitamin A2. Plasma concentration of retinyl esters, but not retinol, is known to increase postprandially in humans. The objectives of this study were to confirm the presence of vitamin A2 in fish fed to penguins, and in penguin plasma, and the postprandial changes in vitamin A concentration in penguin plasma. Blood was collected from six male African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) before and after feeding on jack mackerels (Trachurus japonicus) along with a vitamin premix containing vitamin A1. Vitamin A1 concentration in fish was much higher than the requirement, and was 5-fold higher than the vitamin A2 concentration. Vitamin A2 was present in plasma but its concentration was at least 100-fold below that of plasma retinol, suggesting that vitamin A2 is much less bioavailable than vitamin A1 in penguins. Plasma retinol and retinyl palmitate concentrations were found to be stable after the meal. Plasma retinol concentration is suggested to be homeostatically controlled in penguins against the rapid flow of vitamin A1 after meal. The absorbed vitamin A1 is thought to be transported to the liver via the portal vein for storage in penguins, resulting in stable retinyl palmitate concentration in plasma after meal. ©2019 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: Information is needed on how anomalous environmental conditions affect important Antarctic ecological sentinels during the winter. Using a non-invasive method (scats), the diet of non-breeding gentoo penguins Pygoscelis papua at Bird Island, South Georgia, was examined during the winter of 2009 when local environmental conditions were abnormal (e.g. warmer sea surface waters). Scats were collected every 2 weeks from May until October 2009 (N = 168); the diet was dominated by the amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii by frequency of occurrence (77.5% of the samples) and by number (70.5% of the total individuals). By mass, different species of crustaceans (T. gaudichaudii and Antarctic krill Euphausia superba) and fish (Champsocephalus gunnari, Lepidonotothen larseni and Pseudochaenichthys georgianus) were the most important in different periods. Numerically, prey switching occurred at the end of winter, when E. superba became more abundant in the penguins’ diets in late September and early October (austral spring), when sea surface temperatures became colder. T. gaudichaudii is sub-optimal prey for gentoo penguins and its consumption most likely reflects a lack of E. superba in local waters. The consumption of T. gaudichaudii and fish, in place of E. superba, was probably insufficient for the penguins to maintain a body condition suitable for reproduction, contributing to the observed late commencement of breeding (i.e. 2–3 weeks) that year. Our results highlight the sensitivity of gentoo penguin populations to variations in environmental conditions, particularly in terms of how these conditions affect the availability of preferred dietary items and potential follow-on effects in the subsequent breeding season. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: In this study, the effect of ultraviolet (UV) light and dietary vitamin D on calcium metabolism in permanently indoor-housed gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) was investigated. The study consisted of three periods, each completed with blood samples to analyse plasma concentrations of 25-OH-D, 1,25-(OH)2-D, ionized (iCa) and total calcium (tCa). During the first study period (D), animals were housed under routine conditions without UV-light and fed a diet of different fish species, supplemented with 1,000 IU vitamin D per animal and day. The following study period (Baseline) of 28-day duration consisted of the same diet without any vitamin D supplementation and without UV-light. During the study period (UVB) artificial UV-light was added for 3 weeks. The vitamin D content of fish was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. It varied between fish species and between facilities, ranging from no measurable content in capelin (Mallotus villosus) to 7,340 IU vitamin D/kg original matter (OM) in herring (Clupea spp). The average dietary vitamin D content was 311 IU/kg OM at facility 1 and 6,325 IU/kg OM at facility 2, resulting in a vitamin D intake per animal and day without supplementation of 130 IU (25.5 IU/kg body weight BW) and 2,454 IU (438.2 IU/kg BW) respectively. The supplementation of vitamin D elevated significantly the plasma concentrations of 25-OH-D by an intraindividual difference of 15 (range −2 to 59) nmol/L and tCa by 0.1 (0.0–0.3) mmol/L only at facility 2. The exposure to UV-light raised the blood concentrations of tCa at facility 2 by 0.15 (0.1–0.2) mmol/L, and of iCa and tCa for females at facility 1 by 0.23 (0.13–0.41) mmol/L and 1.8 (1.1–2.5) mmol/L respectively. No significant influence of the study periods (D) and (UVB) was found for the concentrations of 1,25-(OH)2-D at both facilities. © 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

ABSTRACT: Wild populations of Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) on the coasts of Chile and Peru have been declining because of food scarcity caused by the El Niño Southern Oscillation and human interference. Part of conserving this vulnerable and threatened species is maintaining the health of penguins within zoo collections. A variety of cardiovascular diseases has been reported in individuals from the Spheniscidae family including ventricular septal defects, Dirofilaria immitis infection, pulmonary hypertension, and valvular dysplasia, ultimately resulting in congestive heart failure. An accurate clinical picture of cardiovascular disease in Humboldt penguins requires diagnostics tailored to this specific species. The aim of this study was to establish a routine methodology for evaluating the cardiac silhouette of clinically healthy Humboldt penguins using vertebral heart scale (VHS), cardiocoelomic width ratio (CCWR), and a novel cardiac silhouette-to-keel ratio (CKR). Ventrodorsal and right lateral radiographs were taken of 10 mature Humboldt penguins during routine health evaluations. An echocardiographic exam of each penguin was performed to confirm that there was no evidence of cardiac structural remodeling from disease. Two penguins were excluded on the basis of echocardiographic findings; therefore, data from eight penguins were used to calculate objective cardiac measurements for the clinically healthy population. Right lateral radiographs were used to determine VHS (7.4-10.4) and CKR (3.4-4.4). Ventrodorsal radiographs were used for calculating CCWR (0.45-0.59). The excluded penguins had CCWRs that were outside the 95% confidence interval for the range generated by this study. This initial work supports that standardizing radiographic views provides objective measures for cardiac silhouette evaluation in this species. Further research in larger populations and comparison with birds having confirmed cardiac disease is needed to determine the value of these three measurement techniques in Humboldt penguins. © 2018 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Avian malaria is one of the most important diseases of captive penguins. We employed morphometric techniques to evaluate hepatic hemosiderosis in rehabilitating wild Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) that were negative (n = 9) or naturally infected by different subgenera of Plasmodium spp. (n = 24), according with: Plasmodium subgenera (Haemamoeba, Huffia, Other lineages, and Unidentified lineages), severity of Plasmodium histopathological lesions, and concurrent diseases, age class (juvenile or adult plumage), sex (male, female or not determined), body score (emaciated, thin, good, excellent, not available), molt, presence or absence of oil contamination upon admission, iron supplementation, and rehabilitation center. The percentage of the area occupied by hemosiderin was called ‘Index of Hepatic Hemosiderosis (IHH)'. Plasmodium-positive females presented significantly higher IHH values (17.53 ± 12.95%) than males (7.20 ± 4.25%; p = 0.041). We observed higher levels of congestion (p = 0.0182) and pneumonia (p = 0.0250) severity between Unidentified lineages vs. Huffia. We believe that the hepatic hemosiderosis observed in this study was multifactorial, the result of pathological processes caused by malaria, molting, hemoglobin and myoglobin catabolism during migration, anemia, concomitant diseases, and iron supplementation, all possibly potentiated by decreased liver mass. Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms of these hypotheses. © 2019, Brazilain Coll Veterinary Parasitology. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Traditionally, research on mobile robot adaptability to damaging external stimuli has only focused on making individuals capable of surviving on their own, which is often very expensive and lacks robustness. In this paper, we present our initial work on an Emperor Penguin huddling-inspired group survival methodology for a multi-robot system exposed to a damaging directional external stimulus. Individuals on the stimuli side are able to relocate to the safest location on the leeward side of the group in turns without any communication requirements or prior knowledge of the group size or shape, for prolonged survival of the group as a whole. A distributed boundary movement method is proposed with Gaussian Processes machine learning that allows individuals to relocate to the robot health-loss-rate global minima around the group boundary only using stimuli measurements. Simulation results validate our proposed methodology of successfully relocating individuals. The robustness of the proposed method was tested under different formation sizes and shapes. In all cases, successful relocation was obtained. As an effect, significant improvement in survivability of the robot group as a whole was obtained. © 2018 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Tracking individual marine predators can provide vital information to aid the identification of important activity (foraging, commuting, rafting, resting, etc.) hotspots and therefore also to delineate priority sites for conservation. However, in certain locations (e.g. Antarctica) many marine mammal or seabird colonies remain untracked due to logistical constraints, and the colonies that are studied may not be the most important in terms of conservation priorities. Using data for one of the most abundant seabirds in the Antarctic as a case study (the Chinstrap Penguin Pygoscelis antarcticus), we tested the use of correlative habitat models (used to predict distribution around untracked colonies) to overcome this limitation, and to enable the identification of important areas at-sea for colonies where tracking data are not available. First, marine Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBA) were identified using a standardised, published approach using empirical data from birds tracked from colonies located in the South Orkney Islands. Subsequently, novel approaches using predicted distributions of Chinstrap Penguins derived from correlative habitat models were applied to identify important marine areas, and the results compared with the IBAs. Data were collected from four colonies over 4 years and during different stages of the breeding season. Results showed a high degree of overlap between the areas identified as important by observed data (IBAs) and by predicted distributions, revealing that habitat preference models can be used to identify marine IBAs for these penguins. We provide a new method for designating a network of marine IBAs for penguins in Antarctic waters, based on outputs from correlative habitat models when tracking data are not available. This can contribute to an evidence-based and precautionary approach to aid the management framework for Antarctic fisheries and for the protection of birds. © 2018, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Early life-history stages of cephalopods are known to play an important role as prey in food webs of the Southern Ocean, but little information is available about their biology and availability to predators. Top predators, such as penguins, are known to feed regularly on coastal juvenile/sub-adult cephalopods. Using eastern rockhopper penguins Eudyptes filholi as coastal biological samplers, we examined in detail the cephalopod component of their diet in Campbell Island (New Zealand) during two consecutive breeding seasons in order to evaluate (1) the relative importance of cephalopods (by frequency of occurrence, by number and by mass) to the diet of both adult and chick penguins, (2) the habitat and trophic levels of the cephalopods in the region and (3) the status of the juvenile/sub-adult cephalopod community in the waters around Campbell Island. Our results show that eastern rockhopper penguins feed on eight species of juvenile and sub-adult cephalopods, with Onykia ingens, Martialia hyadesi and Octopus campbelli being the most important species by frequency of occurrence, number and mass. Differences between the diets of adult and chick penguins and between breeding seasons were found. Habitat (δ13C) and trophic level (δ15N) information also showed that all cephalopod species (and all studied stages) occupy similar habitat on the Campbell shelf, with M. hyadesi showing lower δ15N values than O. ingens and O. campbelli. This study indicates that eastern rockhopper penguins can be valuable biological samplers of local juvenile/sub-adult cephalopods (including poorly known cephalopod species) around Campbell Island when breeding, that these cephalopods were likely to be caught naturally (not from fisheries), providing relevant information for the conservation of these penguins. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: A pair of juvenile emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) was observed in the northern coast of James Ross Island, the north-western sector of the Weddell Sea, Antarctica, in January 2017. The penguins originated from the colony located on Snow Hill Island, 120-130 km far from the observation area. Despite the emperor penguin´s ability to migrate over long distances, when they are well-known from different areas in Antarctica, this was the first observation of this species in the north of James Ross Island. In this short paper we discuss the environmental factors which allowed the penguins to reach James Ross Island northern coast, especially significant sea ice variability in this area during last decade. © 2018, Universidad de Valparaiso.

ABSTRACT: Little penguins (Eudyptula minor) readily breed and moult in nest boxes. The selective placement of nest boxes can enhance their use, improve breeding success and increase recruitment. I examined nest parameters for 171 nest boxes at Pilots Beach, southern New Zealand, in relation to their use for breeding and for moulting in the 2016 breeding season. Linear models to assess the relative importance of nest box parameters produced definitive results where a higher likelihood of use was interpreted to indicate a preference. The only preference for breeding or moulting was for shaded boxes that were free of vegetation at ground level. These trends were supported by comparisons of proportions of boxes used for breeding and moulting that indicated shaded boxes surrounded by bare ground were preferred to unshaded boxes surrounded by introduced grasses. Proportions also indicated that boxes on flat ground with a flat entrance were preferred to boxes on sloped ground or a sloped entrance for breeding and moulting. About half of the boxes between 61 and 90 m distance to the landing were used for breeding and moulting. Females nesting in shaded boxes had a higher breeding success than those in unshaded boxes but their chick masses were similar. To optimise nest box use by little penguins and encourage recruitment, nest boxes ideally should be placed under bushes or artificial structures on open ground up to 90 m from the landing. © 2019 The Ornithological Society of New Zealand Inc.

ABSTRACT: Maintenance of ex situ populations for species conservation is a collaborative effort involving multiple agencies, institutions, and individuals around the world. Gentoo penguins (Pyogoscelis papua) are one species involved in such a conservation effort, and a Species Survival Plan (SSP) has been put in place by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) to foster their long-term sustainability. As a part of their SSP, a Breeding and Transfer Plan has been created to support interagency exchanges of specimens. These transfers are vital to the demographic health and stability of ex situ populations, as well as the maintenance of genetic diversity. In populations such as the Gentoo, where social monogamy exists, paternal inferences of offspring are usually made through observation of birds’ social behavior. However, social monogamy does not guarantee reproductive monogamy. In this study, we utilize Illumina high-throughput DNA sequencing to genetically test the postulated paternity of Gentoo penguins born at Loveland Living Planet Aquarium (LLPA) in Draper, UT. While our data support the majority of the postulated relationships, we did identify two offspring that were the result of extra-pair paternity (EPP). The results of this research highlight the importance of genetic tests to validate pedigrees used in SSPs, to provide more-accurate data for the support of species conservation. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Parasite population structure can be used to infer fine-scale movement in host species. Many penguin species form large social colonies, and are highly philopatric, returning to the same nest or burrow, along the same route, after each trip to sea. Within a colony, however, the local abundance, physical similarity, and nocturnal habits of penguins hinder the observation of fine-scale movements. To determine the extent of movement and interaction of penguins within colonies, a genotyping by sequencing (GBS) approach was used to study the fine-scale structure of ticks-which depend on host movements for dispersal-exploiting the largest Little Penguin (Eudyptula novaehollandiae) colony in Australia (Phillip Island, Victoria). No barriers to tick gene flow were identified, and we infer that extensive penguin movement occurs throughout the colony. Our findings support the hypothesis that some penguin species are highly gregarious, socializing widely within colonies despite strong nest-site philopatry. © 2018 American Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: In 2017/18, we recorded multiple instances of Adelie Penguin Pygoscelis adeliae nests containing three chicks at Cape Crozier, Ross Island, Antarctica. In one sub-colony, 0.67 % of nests had three chicks, or two chicks and one egg. We found that some Adelie Penguin pairs were willing to brood three chicks, as well as chicks that were not their own. Many factors could lead to supra-normal clutches and broods, including foreign eggs added to a nest, adoption of chicks belonging to other parents, and double-yolked eggs. In order to understand the true cost of colonial breeding in large Adelie Penguin colonies and to assess the source of chicks or eggs in supra-normal clutches and broods, we conclude that future studies should examine the frequency of supra-normal clutches and broods and analyze the genetics of chicks within sub-colonies. © 2019, Marine Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: In this study, there was an examination of the effect on the characteristics of cryopreserved black-footed (Spheniscus demersus) and gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) penguin semen, of thawing at 37 and 5 °C. For two consecutive years, semen was collected and frozen during the April-June period from six gentoo penguins, and during the October-November period from 13 black-footed penguins. After thawing, sperm motility variables were examined by computer-assisted sperm analysis. Propidium iodide and SYBR-14 were used as fluorochromes for the examination of membrane integrity. For the gentoo penguins, no differences were detected in the values of frozen-thawed semen characteristics after thawing at 37 or 5 °C. For the black-footed penguins, however, thawing at 5 °C resulted in greater values (P < 0.05) for straight-line velocity (VSL), average path velocity (VAP), linearity (LIN), straightness (STR), and wobble (WOB) as compared with thawing at 37 °C. After thawing at 37 ºC, there were greater values with gentoo penguin sperm for percentage motile sperm, progressive motility, curvilinear velocity (VCL), VSL VAP, LIN, STR, WOB and beat-cross frequency (BCF; P < 0.05) than that for black-footed penguin sperm. After thawing at 5 ºC, there were no differences in values for any variables between the two species. In conclusion, thawing temperature affects semen characteristics in a species-specific manner. The present data strongly suggest that cryopreservation procedures should be adapted for use with each penguin species. Cryopreserved black-footed penguin semen should be thawed after cryopreservation at 5 ºC, while that of gentoo penguins can be thawed at either 5 or 37 ºC. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) population is estimated at 25,000 breeding pairs, approximately 5% of that at the start of the 20th century, and the species is currently classified as Endangered. In the last two decades, the hand-rearing of penguin chicks that were abandoned by their parents due to oil spills or other circumstances has become a valuable conservation tool to limit mortality and to bolster the population at specific colonies. We summarize and evaluate the techniques employed by the Southern African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds (SANCCOB) to incubate and hand-rear African penguin eggs and chicks. From 2012 to 2016, a total of 694 eggs and 2819 chicks were received by SANCCOB's Chick Rearing Unit. It was estimated that 13% of the eggs were infertile, and 81% of the fertile eggs hatched successfully. The overall release rate for chicks was 77%, with a higher release rate for chicks that were pre-emptively removed (93%) followed by chicks that had been abandoned by their parents (78%), chicks admitted due to avian pox lesions (61%), chicks that hatched from artificially-incubated eggs (57%), and chicks admitted due to injuries or deformities (25%). Rescuing and hand-rearing eggs and chicks has been a successful strategy for African penguins, and might be also applicable for the conservation of other threatened seabird species whose population are critically low or during natural or anthropogenic events that could have disastrous population impacts (e.g. oil spills, disease outbreaks, catastrophic weather events, strong El Niño years, etc.). © 2018 Klusener et al.

ABSTRACT: Although research on parasitic diseases in Antarctic birds is scarce and the information largely fragmented, an increasing number of studies are currently in progress in this area. The host/parasite relationship is very important for understanding the impact of parasitism on the seabirds’ feeding ecology, especially in those isolated regions where the host is extremely sensitive to new diseases. Penguins are a big favorite for these studies because of their importance as indicators of change in the Antarctic ecosystem. This study aims at adding information on gastrointestinal parasites of the Emperor Penguin Aptenodytes forsteri from Snow Hill colony. Based on a sample of 43 individuals found freshly dead (3 adults and 40 chicks) from predation or starvation, the gastrointestinal helminth community in Emperor penguins was composed of two species of cestodes (Parorchites zederi and Tetrabothrius sp.) and three species of nematodes (Stegophorus macronectes, Tetrameres sp. and Contracaecum osculatum). This is the first record of S. macronectes in the Emperor Penguin. The low parasite richness observed might be related to the stenophagic and pelagic diet of this host. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Rhinonyssids are obligate haematophagous mites that parasitize the nasal cavity of vertebrates, and occur in a wide range of birds worldwide. Two species of nasal mites are known to occur in penguins: Rhinonyssus sphenisci, which has been recorded from Humboldt and Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus humboldti and S. magellanicus, respectively), and Rhinonyssus schelli, which has been recorded in Adélie and Gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae and P. papua, respectively). We examined the nasal cavity of African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) that died while under care at a rehabilitation centre (N = 40) or that were found dead at breeding colonies (N = 67). Nasal mites were found in the nasal cavity and/or paranasal of sinuses of 21 penguins, some of which had signs of mild-to-moderate sinusitis. Prevalence was higher in juveniles (29%) and adults (27%) than in chicks (10%). Mean intensity was 5.9 ± 12.9 mites per infected host (range 1-60). The mites presented morphological characteristics that were at times consistent with either R. sphenisci or R. schelli, and therefore we conservatively classified them as 'R. sphenisci sensu lato'. Our morphometric results raise the question of whether the specific status of R. schelli is justified. © 2018 Cambridge University Press.

ABSTRACT: Penguins can bioaccumulate metals, a portion of which can be deposited in the environment through organic remains such as excrement, carcasses, and eggshells. In order to determine Cu and Pb concentrations and their relationship to soil, organic matter and grain size were determined in 27 samples collected in zones without penguins, penguin transit zones, and Adelie (Pygoscelis adeliae), Chinstrap (P. antarctica), and Gentoo penguin (P. papua) colonies on the Ardley Peninsula, Maritime Antarctica. An atomic absorption spectrophotometry analysis was carried out, organic matter was determined by loss on ignition, and grain size was measured with a laser diffraction particle size analyzer. The principal component analysis shows a relationship between the variables Cu, Pb, and grain size and areas with penguin presence. Cu concentrations in soils varied among areas (χ2, 15.707; p = 0.0004), with higher concentrations in transit zones and penguin colonies (142.63 and 140.79 mg/kg, respectively) than in zones without penguins (83.33 mg/kg). Pb concentrations in soils also varied among areas (χ2, 6.5029; p = 0.0387), and were higher in transit zones (5.92 mg/kg) than in the penguin colonies (4.45 mg/kg). Grain size differed significantly among areas (χ2, 13.506; p = 0.0012), with higher values in transit zones (avg. 37.38 μm) than in penguin colonies (avg. 26.93 μm) and zones without penguins (avg. 20.72 μm). Organic matter did not differ significantly among the studied zones (χ2, 2.0882; p = 0.3520). There is a positive correlation between Cu-Pb (Rho, 0.5532; p = 0.0028), Cu-grain size (Rho, 0.4756; p = 0.0130) and Pb-grain size (Rho, 0.4879; p = 0.0098). The presence of penguins increases Cu concentrations in Antarctic soils due to its bioaccumulation and elimination through excrement; however, the presence of penguins has a minor influence on Pb concentration in soil, probably because this metal is stored efficiently in bones, feathers, and eggshells. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

ABSTRACT: The Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) is sensitive to climatic and environmental changes, and paleoecological studies of Adélie penguins and their response to climatic forcing in maritime Antarctica usually address changes on long time scales. However, on Long Peninsula, East Antarctica, we identified numerous mummified Adélie penguin carcasses and phases of rapid sediment deposition at ~750 and ~200 years BP, indicating two multidecadal mass mortality events. Based upon chronological and sedimentary evidence, we propose that the two events were caused by heavy regional precipitation, which led to the abandonment of numerous penguin subcolonies. The anomalous precipitation was likely associated with the intensification of regional meridional air transport under a zonal wave number 3 pattern. Since such atmospheric conditions correspond to present-day observations, and are expected to persist if climate change continues, the mortality events revealed in this study could become an increasing threat to penguins. ©2018.

ABSTRACT: Vegetation near bird and seal rookeries typically has high δ15N signatures and these high values are linked to the enriched δ15N values of rookery soils. However, Antarctic cryptogams are mostly dependent on atmospheric ammonia (NH3) and volatized NH3 from rookeries is severely depleted in δ15N -NH3. So there is an apparent discrepancy between the isotopically depleted source (NH3) and δ15N -enriched vegetation. In this article, we aim to resolve this discrepancy to better understand the mechanisms and processes involved in isotopic changes during nitrogen transfer between Antarctic marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Under laboratory conditions, we quantified whether volatized NH3 affects the isotopic signature of cryptogams. NH3 volatilizing from penguin guano and elephant seal dung was depleted (44–49‰) in δ15N when captured on acidified filters, compared to the source itself. Cryptogams exposed to the volatized NH3 were enriched (18.8–23.9‰) in δ15N. The moss Andreaea regularis gained more nitrogen (0.9%) than the lichen Usnea antarctica (0.4%) from volatilized NH3, indicating a potential difference in atmospheric NH3 acquisition that is consistent with existing field differences in nitrogen concentrations and δ15N between mosses and lichens in general. This study clarifies the δ15N enrichment of cryptogams resulting from one of the most important nitrogen pathways for Antarctic vegetation. © 2019 G.S. S. Bokhorst et al.

ABSTRACT: Penguins exhibit an array of derived feather features and color-producing mechanisms, including distinct melanosome morphologies and beta-keratin nanofibers that produce blue structural color. Several morphologies have been proposed to have hydrodynamic or insulatory functions. An understanding of the distribution of these morphologies over the body of a single penguin species may elucidate their evolution and function. We investigated feather microstructure and color production mechanisms in blue, black, and white barbs of feathers of the Gentoo Penguin (Pygoscelis papua). Light and scanning electron microscopy revealed that all feathers, regardless of color, are semi-lunate in cross section and lack, or show greatly reduced, air-filled compartments (central vacuoles) in feather barbs. Keratin nanofibers are present in all sampled feathers (including those of 8 other penguin species) but are surrounded by melanin in black barbs and disorganized in white barbs. Reduction of the air-filled central vacuole and gain of keratin nanofibers appear to have single origins in penguins. Given that they occur in all feathers regardless of color, we hypothesize that nanofibers have been co-opted for color production but initially arose for another function. © 2018 American Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: In the Southern Ocean, the at-sea distributions of most predators of Antarctic krill are poorly known, primarily because tracking studies have only been undertaken on a restricted set of species, and then only at a limited number of sites. For chinstrap penguins, one of the most abundant krill predators breeding across the Antarctic Peninsula, we show that habitat models developed utilizing the distance from the colony and the bearing to the shelf-edge, adjusting for the at-sea density of Pygoscelis penguins from other colonies, can be used to predict, with a high level of confidence, the at-sea distribution of chinstrap penguins from untracked colonies during the breeding season. Comparison of predicted penguin distributions with outputs from a high-resolution oceanographic model shows that chinstrap penguins prefer nearshore habitats, over shallow bathymetry, with slow-flowing waters, but that they sometimes also travel to areas beyond the edge of the continental shelf where the faster-flowing waters of the Coastal Current or the fronts of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current occur. In the slow-moving shelf waters, large penguin colonies may lead to krill depletion during incubation and chick-rearing periods when penguins are acting as central place foragers. The habitats used by chinstrap penguins are also locations preferentially used by the commercial krill fishery, one of the last under-developed marine capture fisheries anywhere on the planet. As it develops, this fishery has the potential to compete with chinstrap penguins and other natural krill predators. Scaling our habitat models by chinstrap penguin population data demonstrates where overlap with the fishery is likely to be most important. Our results suggest that a better understanding of krill retention and krill depletion in areas used by natural predators and by the krill fishery are needed, and that risk management strategies for the fishery should include assessment of how krill movement can satisfy the demands of both natural predators and the fishery across a range of spatial and temporal scales. Such information will help regional management authorities better understand how plausible ecosystem-based management frameworks could be developed to ensure sustainable co-existence of the fishery and competing natural predators. © 2018 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Like all birds, penguins undergo periodic molt, during which they replace old feathers. However, unlike other birds, penguins replace their entire plumage within a short period while fasting ashore. During molt, king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) lose half of their initial body mass, most importantly their insulating subcutaneous fat and half of their pectoral muscle mass. The latter might challenge their capacity to generate and sustain a sufficient mechanical power output to swim to distant food sources and propel themselves to great depth for successful prey capture. To investigate the effects of the annual molt fast on their dive/foraging performance, we studied various dive/foraging parameters and peripheral temperature patterns in immature king penguins across two molt cycles, after birds had spent their first and second year at sea, using implanted data-loggers. We found that the dive/foraging performance of immature king penguins was significantly reduced during post-molt foraging trips. Dive and bottom duration for a given depth were shorter during post-molt and post-dive surface interval duration was longer, reducing overall dive efficiency and underwater foraging time. We attribute this decline to the severe physiological changes that birds undergo during their annual molt. Peripheral temperature patterns differed greatly between pre-and post-molt trips, indicating the loss of the insulating subcutaneous fat layer during molt. Peripheral perfusion, as inferred from peripheral temperature, was restricted to short periods at night during pre-molt but occurred throughout extended periods during post-molt, reflecting the need to rapidly deposit an insulating fat layer during the latter period. © 2019 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd | Journal of Experimental Biology.

ABSTRACT: Penguins are reliable sentinels for environmental assessments of mercury (Hg) due to their longevity, abundance, high trophic level, and relatively small foraging areas. We analyzed Hg concentrations from blood and feathers of adult Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) and feathers of chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarcticus) from different reproductive colonies with variable degrees of urbanization and industrialization along the Chilean and Antarctic coasts. We evaluated Hg concentration differences between species, sexes (Humboldt penguins), and localities. Our results showed significantly greater levels in Humboldt penguins than in chinstrap penguins and nonsignificant differences between sexes among Humboldts. Penguin Hg concentrations showed a latitudinal pattern, with greater values of the metal at lower latitudes, independent of the species. Both studied penguin species showed elevated Hg concentrations compared to their congeners, highlighting the necessity to investigate potential negative effects on their populations. Although differences between species are possibly due to variation in diet and trophic level, our results suggest an important effect of the degree of Hg pollution adjacent to foraging areas. Further research on Hg content in prey species and environmental samples, together with a larger overall sample size, and investigation on penguin’s diet and trophic level are needed to elucidate Hg bioavailability in each location and the role of local Hg pollution levels. Likewise, it is important to monitor Hg and other heavy metals of ecotoxicological importance in penguin populations in vulnerable regions of Chile. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The concept of individual behavioural consistency has received a great deal of attention in the past 2 decades. However, the fitness benefits of being consistent in varying environmental conditions remain poorly explored. Such information is strongly relevant to our understanding of ecological processes, but also for predicting how some individuals and populations cope with environmental changes. We investigated short-term consistency in foraging behaviours of African penguins Spheniscus demersus at population and individual levels on Bird Island (Algoa Bay, South Africa) between 2015 and 2017, and related individual levels of consistency to reproductive outputs. Short-term overall consistency in foraging behaviour across individuals of the same population (population level) was generally moderate, although it was high for bearing (i.e. direction) towards the furthest point of the foraging trip. At the individual level, foraging consistency differed between years and was higher when environmental conditions were less profitable. Females were more flexible in their foraging behaviours than males. Overall, these results suggest that both intrinsic and extrinsic factors are responsible for inter-individual differences in foraging consistency in African penguins. Chicks of parents that were consistent in their foraging trip duration had higher growth rates than those of more flexible individuals when conditions were poor. It is not clear whether penguins adapt their level of short-term consistency at sea to the changing conditions or maintain their strategy across years. However, our results have revealed a reproductive advantage of individual foraging consistency during a year when resources were poor. For the first time, we have identified a potential mechanism to explain why some African penguins may cope better than others during poor environmental conditions. © Inter-Research 2019.

ABSTRACT: An African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) presented with a large peri-cloacal mass. The mass was diagnosed as a pyogranuloma histologically, with multifocal to coalescing inflammatory responses in the subcutis and keratinized simple stratified squamous epithelium overlying the surface. The patient was prescribed 125 mg/kg oral clavulanic acid/amoxycillin twice a day and 20 mg/kg oral terbinafine once a day for 14 days, but there was no change in the size of the mass 4 days after therapy, so a decision was made to administer 1 mg/kg of intralesional methylprednisolone. Fourteen days later, the mass resolved with no further recurrence. This case demonstrated that intralesional methylprednisolone used with antibiotic and antifungals was effective in resolving a peri-cloacal pyogranuloma and without any side effects. © 2019 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: Aspergillosis is a condition causing serious morbidity and mortality in captive penguins and other bird species. It can be treated with antifungal drugs, such as voriconazole. However, the pharmacokinetics of voriconazole are variable between different animal and bird species. Therefore, the pharmacokinetics of voriconazole were investigated in this study in Magellanic penguins. Pharmacokinetic models were constructed and applied to predict the pharmacokinetics of voriconazole during long-term treatment in Magellanic penguins, since the voriconazole treatment duration in chronic aspergillosis cases can last up to several months. Plasma voriconazole concentration–time data from adult Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus; n = 15) following a single oral (PO) dose of either 2.5 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg in a herring in three separate study periods 7–12 months apart were collected. Mean plasma voriconazole concentrations were above the targeted MIC for Aspergillus fumigatus for 2 hr following a single 2.5 mg/kg voriconazole dose while the plasma concentrations exceeded the MIC for least 24 hr following a 5 mg/kg dose. Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling was used to fit two pharmacokinetic models, one with first-order and another with saturable elimination, to the single-dose data. Fits were good for both, as long as dose was included as a covariate for the first-order model so that clearance was lower and the half-life longer for animals receiving the 5 mg/kg dose. Although the single-dose data suggested saturated elimination at higher concentrations, the model with saturable elimination did not predict plasma voriconazole concentrations well for a clinical aspergillosis case receiving long-term treatment, possibly because of induction of metabolizing enzymes with chronic exposure. Pharmacokinetic models should accurately predict plasma drug concentrations for different dosage regimens in order to be applicable in the field. Future studies should focus on determining clearance at steady-state to be able to refine the pharmacokinetic models presented here and improve model performance for long-term oral voriconazole administration in Magellanic penguins. © 2018 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The paired-box 3 (Pax3) is a transcription factor and it plays an important part in melanin synthesis. In this study, a new Pax3 gene was identified from Pteria penguin (Röding, 1798) (P. penguin) by RACE-PCR (rapid-amplification of cDNA ends-polymerase chain reaction) and its effect on melanin synthesis was deliberated by RNA interference (RNAi). The cDNA of PpPax3 was 2250 bp long, containing an open reading fragment of 1365 bp encoding 455 amino acids. Amino acid alignment and phylogenetic tree showed PpPax3 shared the highest (69.2%) identity with Pax3 of Mizuhopecten yessoensis. Tissue expression profile showed that PpPax3 had the highest expression in mantle, a nacre-formation related tissue. The PpPax3 silencing significantly inhibited the expression of PpPax3, PpMitf, PpTyr and PpCdk2, genes involved in Tyr-mediated melanin synthesis, but had no effect on PpCreb2 and an increase effect on PpBcl2. Furthermore, the PpPax3 knockdown obviously decreased the tyrosinase activity, the total content of eumelanin and the proportion of PDCA (pyrrole-2,3-dicarboxylic acid) in eumelanin, consistent with influence of tyrosinase (Tyr) knockdown. These data indicated that PpPax3 played an important regulating role in melanin synthesis by Tyr pathway in P. penguin. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: In the current study, modified version of the penguins search optimization algorithm (PeSOA) was introduced, and its usage was assessed in the water resources field. In the modified version (MPeSOA), the Gaussian exploration was added to the algorithm. The MPeSOA performance was evaluated in optimal operation of a hypothetical four-reservoir system and Karun-4 reservoir as a real world problem. Also, genetic algorithm (GA) was used as a criterion for evaluating the performance of PeSOA and MPeSOA. The results revealed that in a four-reservoir system problem, the PeSOA performance was much weaker than the GA; but on the other hand, the MPeSOA had better performance than the GA. In the mentioned problem, PeSOA, GA, and MPeSOA reached 78.43, 97.46, and 98.30% of the global optimum, respectively. In the operation of Karun-4 reservoir, although PeSOA performance had less difference with the two other algorithms than four-reservoir problem, its performance was not acceptable. The average values of objective function in this case were equal to 26.49, 23.84, and 21.48 for PeSOA, GA, and MPeSOA, respectively. According to the results obtained in the operation of Karun-4 reservoir, the algorithms including MPeSOA, GA, and PeSOA were situated in ranks one to three in terms of efficiency, respectively. © IWA Publishing 2018.

ABSTRACT: Aim: To provide a method of analyzing penguin tracking data to identify priority at-sea areas for seabird conservation (marine IBAs), based on pre-existing approaches for flying seabirds but revised according to the specific ecology of Pygoscelis penguin species. Location: Waters around the Antarctic Peninsula, South Shetland, and South Orkney archipelagos (FAO Subareas 48.1 and 48.2). Methods: We made key improvements to the pre-existing protocol for identifying marine IBAs that include refining the track interpolation method and revision of parameters for the kernel analysis (smoothing factor and utilization distribution) using sensitivity tests. We applied the revised method to 24 datasets of tracking data on penguins (three species, seven colonies, and three different breeding stages—incubation, brood, and crèche). Results: We identified five new marine IBAs for seabirds in the study area, estimated to hold ca. 600,000 adult penguins. Main conclusions: The results demonstrate the efficacy of a new method for the designation of a network of marine IBAs in Antarctic waters for penguins based on tracking data, which can contribute to an evidence-based, precautionary, management framework for krill fisheries. © 2018 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: New alternative laboratory means are needed to improve the options for antemortem diagnosis of avian aspergillosis. In this study, 3-hydroxybutyrate was measured in plasma samples collected from a cohort of African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) maintained under human care. Results were interpreted in combination with those of protein electrophoresis and compared with anti-Aspergillus antibody and galactomannan antigen detection. Overall, 3-hydroxybutyrate levels were found significantly increased in Aspergillus-diseased cases versus the control penguin group (P = 0.002). Mean absolute concentration of β-globulins was increased >20% in samples from infected birds, and α2-globublins were also found to be significantly increased versus clinically normal controls (P < 0.001 and P = 0.001 respectively). Of note, the α2-globulins were also significantly increased versus penguins with inflammatory (non-aspergillosis) diseases (P = 0.001). The specificity of 3-hydroxybutyrate, β-globulins, and α2-globulins for aspergillosis was 78.6%, 79.6%, and 92.2%, respectively. Using these measures in tandem resulted in high specificity (>90%) and negative predictive value (≥80%). In contrast, anti-Aspergillus antibody and galactomannan antigen did not distinguish between infected cases and controls (P > 0.05). This study demonstrates that basic testing in tandem with the new biomarker 3-hydroxybutyrate may provide reliable evidence for the diagnosis of aspergillosis in penguins. © 2018 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To describe surgical technique, postoperative complications, and visual outcome in penguins after phacoemulsification lens extraction surgery. Animals studied: Twenty-one penguins (27 eyes) that had phacoemulsification from 2011 to 2015 at Animal Eye Associates. Species included are as follows: 14 southern Rockhopper (18 eyes, 66.6%), 4 Gentoo (4 eyes, 19%), 2 King (3 eyes, 9.5%), and 1 Chinstrap penguin (2 eyes, 4.8%). Eleven of the penguins were females, and 10 were males with average age at the time of surgery being 27.5 years (range of 22-31 years). Procedure: This is a retrospective study of phacoemulsification cataract surgery patients from 2011 to 2015. Visual outcome was evaluated by veterinary ophthalmologists at postoperative recheck examinations and subjectively by penguin keepers using individual bird surveys and paired t tests for statistical analysis. Results: All eyes were functionally visual after surgery and at the time of last follow-up. Based on keeper surveys, 81% (17/21) of penguins showed immediate improvements in overall quality of life and 90% (19/21) of penguins exhibited improvement in mobility and behavior within their exhibit following cataract removal. Of the 14 penguins that received 1:5 intracameral atracurium during surgery, 10 (71.4%) had moderate mydriasis, 1 (7.1%) had minimal mydriasis, and 3 (21.4%) showed no effect to the pupil. Seventy percent of the cases had phacoemulsification times less than 60 seconds/eye; the mean time was 72 seconds. Sixteen eyes (59.3%) underwent anterior capsulotomy only, planned anterior and posterior capsulotomies were performed in 3 eyes (11.1%), and the entire lens capsule was removed due to capsular fibrosis and wrinkling in 8 eyes (29.6%). The most common short-term postoperative complication was temporary mild blepharospasm and/or epiphora, reported in 8 eyes (29.6%) from 7 penguins (33.3%). Long-term complications, 2-6 years postoperatively, included posterior synechiation resulting in dyscoria (10 of 24 eyes, 41.7%) and capsular fibrosis in all penguins with residual lens capsule (19/19, 100%). Conclusion: The prognosis for vision and behavioral improvement after phacoemulsification surgery in penguins is good, with low incidence of vision-threatening complications. © 2018 American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists

ABSTRACT: As nonhuman animals age, geriatric individuals require additional care and veterinary support to ensure their well being. The focus on lifelong care is a relatively newer approach when providing good welfare, and few studies have examined how veterinary care impacts behavior at different ages or how best to accommodate geriatric individuals in zoos. The objectives of this study were to (a) assess both the immediate and long-term (one year later) behavioral impacts of cataract removal for macaroni (Eudyptes chrysolophus) and southern rockhopper (Eudyptes chrysocome) penguins; (b) compare the behavior of penguins following cataract surgery to that of other conspecifics in the same habitat; and (c) monitor the impacts of cataract surgery on swimming behavior using time-depth recorders. Individual responses to cataract removal differed in direction and magnitude, and these mixed results highlight that welfare is experienced and thus measured at the individual level. Positive responses included increased habitat use, increased time spent swimming, and increased rates of affiliative interactions. This study highlights the importance of assessing welfare impacts of veterinary interventions on geriatric individuals. © 2018, © 2018 Detroit Zoological Society.

ABSTRACT: Two new species of Andracantha (Polymorphidae) are described from the intestine of the shags Leucocarbo chalconotus (Gray) and Phalacrocorax punctatus (Sparrman), and the penguin Eudyptula minor (Forster) from southern South Island, New Zealand. Andracantha leucocarboi n. sp. is distinguished from its congeners by having no genital or ventral trunk spines, but possessing a scattering of small spines between the anterior fields of spines. This is the first record of a species of Andracantha from a penguin. Circumbursal papillae are illustrated in a scanning electron micrograph for the first time in the polymorphids. Andracantha sigma n. sp. is distinguished by the sigmoid shape of its largest proboscis hook, hook VIII, and having the ventral field separated from the posterior disc field by an aspinous gap. A Maximum Likelihood tree from cox1 and large ribosomal subunit (LSU) data shows A. leucocarboi n. sp. to be more closely related to A. gravida than A. sigma n. sp. and the genus Andracantha as sister to Corynosoma spp. Genetic distances between species of Andracantha are comparatively large. A key to the species of Andracantha is provided. © 2017 Cambridge University Press.

ABSTRACT: Hematological studies concerned with the determination of normal values of blood parameters in animals have been increasing. However, studies on normal concentration of blood constituents of free-living birds still are not very common, and less than 5% of the species of birds have been analyzed, mostly in captivity. Avian hematology has been used in ornithological studies, because it provides biological data about these animals, their biology, and can be very important in the understanding of ecological and behavioral issues. The main purpose of the study was to investigate the concentrations of certain plasma biochemical parameters in nestlings of Rockhopper Penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome) at the crèche phase and the potential influence of some factors such as sex. We captured 95 nestling Rockhopper during the period 24–31 January 2017. All nestlings were randomly selected from colonies in Saunders Island (Falkland Islands). All the sampled birds were between 25 and 45 days of age, with mean weight of 1.778 ± 0.314 kg and mean bill length of 36.0 ± 2.8 mm. No differences in blood parameters or body condition between sexes were found. No parameters but total protein and urea were related to body index. Body index showed a negative significant relationship with urea levels in blood, with penguins in worse condition (those relatively lighter) showing higher levels of urea in blood than those that were relatively heavier. Same trend was observed for total proteins. Urea concentration in blood would be used as a tool in future studies, particularly in young Rockhoppers when they are in crèche phase, a period of high level of mortality mainly by predation. Plasma urea was the single variable that reflects the best body index and also has a rationale background explaining this relationship. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Lateralization, or asymmetry in form and/or function, is found in many animal species. Brain lateralization is considered adaptive for an individual, and often results in "handedness," "footedness," or a side preference, manifest in behavior and morphology. We tested for lateralization in several behaviors in a wild population of Magellanic penguins Spheniscus magellanicus breeding at Punta Tombo, Argentina. We found no preferred foot in the population (each penguin observed once) in stepping up onto an obstacle: 53% stepped up with the right foot, 47% with the left foot (n = 300, binomial test p = 0.27). We found mixed evidence for a dominant foot when a penguin extended a foot for thermoregulation, possibly depending on the ambient temperature (each penguin observed once). Penguins extended the right foot twice as often as the left foot (n = 121, p 0.0005) in 2 years when we concentrated our effort during the heat of the day. In a third year when we observed penguins early and late in the day, there was no preference (n = 232, p = 0.59). Penguins use their flippers for swimming, including searching for and chasing prey. We found morphological evidence of a dominant flipper in individual adults: 60.5% of sternum keels curved one direction or the other (n = 76 sterna from carcasses), and 11% of penguins had more feather wear on one flipper than the other (n = 1217). Right-flippered and left-flippered penguins were equally likely in both samples (keels: p = 0.88, feather wear: p = 0.26), indicating individual but not population lateralization. In fights, aggressive penguins used their left eyes preferentially, consistent with the right side of the brain controlling aggression. Penguins that recently fought (each penguin observed once) were twice as likely to have blood only on the right side of the face (69%) as only on the left side (31%, n = 175, p 0.001). The proportion of penguins with blood only on the right side increased with the amount of blood. In most fights, the more aggressive penguin used its left eye and attacked the other penguin's right side. Lateralization depended on the behavior tested and, in thermoregulation, likely on the temperature. We found no lateralization or mixed results in the population of Magellanic penguins in three individual behaviors, stepping up, swimming, and thermoregulation. We found lateralization in the population in the social behavior fighting. © 2019 PeerJ Inc.. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Feed intake and body weight are drastically altered in penguins during peri-molting period, and molting is known to affect the nutritional status of vitamin A and E. Although vitamin D status is not known in penguins during peri-molting period, vitamin D intake is supposed to be remarkably altered. The objective of the present study was to clarify the alterations in plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration, the most reliable biomarker for assessing vitamin D status, and vitamin D intake during peri-molting period. Blood samples were collected from seven adult male African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) in the control period, pre-molting period, early-molting period, and late-molting period. The dietary content of vitamin D and calcium (Ca) were higher than that of the estimated requirements. Feed intake increased in the pre-molting period and drastically decreased during the molting periods. Body weight increased in the pre-molting period, followed by the loss of weight towards the end of the experiment. Although vitamin D and Ca intakes decreased during the molting periods, plasma 25(OH)D concentration increased during the molting periods and the increase in plasma Ca concentration was also observed in the late-molting period. These results suggest that the reduction in body fat induced by reducing feed intake stimulated the release of vitamin D from body fat, which increased plasma 25(OH)D and Ca concentrations in molting penguins. Penguins are unlikely to suffer from typical hypervitaminosis D even during molting and vitamin D toxicity is not a realistic problem in penguins because of the short duration of molting. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Gentoo penguins Pygoscelis papua breed at a number of sites at the West Antarctic Peninsula, including Goudier Island, Port Lockroy—the longest studied location for tourist-penguin interactions in the Antarctic. These penguins annually encounter some of the highest numbers of tourists in the whole of Antarctica. Using yearly count data from all ten colonies on Goudier Island, we report changes in long-term population size and breeding success over a 21 year period (1996/1997 to 2016/2017), documenting inter-annual variability in numbers of breeding pairs and chicks fledged (productivity). We found a 24.5% (1.4% per annum) decrease in breeding pairs; similar declines were evident in breeding pairs at six colonies visited by tourists as well as at four unvisited colonies. Breeding success also declined, with chick numbers declining in visited (53.7%, 3.8% per annum) and unvisited colonies (59.8%, 4.6% per annum). While gentoo penguin numbers are increasing regionally, we reveal a recent decline in the Goudier Island population occurring simultaneous with increases in tourist numbers from 262 in 1996/1997 to 19,688 in 2016/2017. Analyses suggest a complex situation with different possible drivers of change. There was a significant negative effect of increasing air temperature and shifts in sea ice variables on breeding pairs. However, similar statistical support showed a significant link existed between year and visitors, with higher numbers of visitors negatively affecting penguin numbers. Based on our results we recommend increased precaution in management at Goudier Island, and initiation of similar studies at other frequently visited penguin sites in Antarctica. © 2018, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: A 2-year-old male Humboldt penguin (Spheniscus humboldti) died after a very brief period of illness at a zoo aquarium; the penguin showed sudden depression, anorexia, dyspnoea, and had recurrent melena a day prior to death. The gross examination revealed an extensive bilious effusion in the abdominal cavity due to a gallbladder rupture. Moreover, abscess formation, purulent exudate, severe congestion, and haemorrhages were observed in the trachea and parenchymal organs such as the kidneys and the lungs. A histopathological examination revealed a fibrin deposition with a severe haemorrhage and secondary infiltration of chronic-active inflammatory cells in the parabronchi, atria, and air capillaries and blood vessels of the lungs as well as in most of the parenchymal organs. Moreover, Gram-negative bacilli were found in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tracts including the small and large intestines accompanied by severe epithelial necrosis and the capsule of the liver. Especially, bile pigments were microscopically observed in the whole liver, which indicated a gallbladder rupture. Samples collected from the trachea, lungs, and blood were cultured on a blood agar, and the pure colonies of Proteus genus were isolated. Proteus mirabilis, P. penneri, P. vulgaris, and P. cibarius were identified with polymerase chain reaction (PCR). As a result, the diagnosis was confirmed as Proteus septicaemia. To our knowledge, this is the first report of concomitant infection by different Proteus species that eventually resulted in septicaemia in a Humboldt penguin, and it will provide valuable information for zoo veterinarians for its diagnosis as well, since Humboldt penguins are the most widely found penguins in zoos and Proteus septicaemia in the penguins has, to the best of our knowledge, not been reported as yet. © 2019 Czech Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

ABSTRACT: Crested penguins Eudyptes spp. have evolved a unique form of breeding in which the first of two eggs laid is much smaller than the second and has a higher likelihood of being lost during egg laying and incubation. In this study, we quantified aggressive behaviour in nesting Snares penguins and undertook an egg survival analysis to examine which factors influence egg loss. During 120 h of observation of 50 nests, we recorded a total of 300 aggressive events in which females were repeatedly pecked, bitten and beaten. Aggressive events lasted from less than a minute to up to 55 min (mean 4.6 ± 7.4 min). Single males were the aggressor in 75% of aggressive events and in 50.7% of aggressive events the aggressor was identified as a neighbouring, breeding male. A greater percentage of the small first eggs (34%) were lost than the large second eggs (4%). We found that egg mortality was influenced by 1) whether the other egg within a nest had hatched, 2) who was present at the nest (father, mother or both) and 3) the average duration of aggressive events on the nest. When one egg within a nest had hatched, the other egg had a vastly increased mortality risk irrespective of aggression. However, long, aggressive events directed towards females after their partners had gone foraging, also increased the probability of egg loss. We suggest that the prolonged nest attendance by breeding males well beyond egg laying is in response to the high frequency of aggressive behaviour during this time. Our data show that A-egg losses occur due to intraspecific aggression in this species. Further research is needed to clarify whether aggressive behaviour in breeding crested penguins is modulated by elevated testosterone levels in the males and whether any reproductive benefits accrue to the aggressors. © 2019 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as an alternative to manned aircrafts is an excellent, less invasive, safe tool, especially in sensitive polar regions. Here we used a fixed-wing UAV to collect data on seabird and pinniped populations in hardly accessible Antarctic areas. The implementation of an auto-piloted UAV equipped with a digital camera (Canon EOS 700D, 35 mm f/2.0 lens) allowed us to collect high-quality material applicable to a quantitative analysis of the fauna populations. A successful photogrammetric mission, at an altitude of 550 m above sea level, was accomplished during one Beyond Visual Line of Sight flight above hard-to-access Penguin Island and Turret Point Oasis (King George Island). Obtained selected RGB images were processed to generate a panoramic image stitch with resolution of 0.07 m ground sampling distance. A total of 4290 (SD = 33.08) breeding individuals of two penguin species, Adélie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarcticus), 426 (SD = 7.78) individuals of the southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina) and 6 individuals of the Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii) were identified in both study areas. Additionally, 222 (SD = 2.0) individuals of the southern giant petrel (Macronectes giganteus) and 76 (SD = 1.0) of the Antarctic shag (Phalacrocorax atriceps bransfieldensis) in the Turret Point area were recognized. The presented observations on the natural history of the investigated fauna together with the available literature may be useful in future research on population trends. A comparison with available historical data for both investigated areas suggests a decrease of 68.29% in both penguin species in the 1980–2016 period. The presented results confirmed that UAVs are useful for remote census work for Antarctic seabirds. © 2018, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The Endangered northern rockhopper penguin Eudyptes moseleyi, like all penguins, is monomorphic, making sex determination of individuals in the field challenging. We examined the degree of sexual size dimorphism of adult birds across the species' breeding range in the Atlantic Ocean and developed discriminant functions (DF) to predict individuals' sex using morphometric measurements. We found significant site-specific differences in both bill length and bill depth, with males being the larger sex on each island. Across all islands, bill length contri - buted 78% to dissimilarity between sexes. Penguins on Gough Island had significantly longer bills, whilst those from Tristan da Cunha had the deepest. Island-specific DFs correctly classified 82-94% of individuals, and all functions performed significantly better than chance. The model for Nightingale Island correctly classified the greatest proportion of individuals (94-95%), while that for Tristan da Cunha performed the poorest (80-82%). A discriminant function derived from all sites accurately sexed 86-88% of northern rockhopper penguins achieving similar accuracy to island-specific functions. While molecular techniques conclusively determine an individual's sex, morphometric measurements can provide a reliable estimate with close to 90% accuracy using a method that is less invasive and requires little technical expertise. Sexing is an important tool for meaningful interpretation of ecological data. Consideration of sex-specific differences in future studies will aid investigation of a potential sex-dependent vulnerability in this Endangered species. © The authors 2019.

ABSTRACT: Sexual segregation characterises many animal communities, and in seabirds (including penguins), foraging strategies are known to vary with sex. The forging strategies of Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) have been studied to some extent in some Antarctic locations; however, sex-based differences in foraging in this species have only been studied in depth in East Antarctica. Therefore, in this study, we aim to determine whether sexual segregation drives the foraging ecology [in terms of foraging habitat and diet based on analysis of stable carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) isotopes, respectively] of Adélie penguins in the Antarctic Peninsula (Hope Bay) during the breeding season. Our results showed strong sexual isotopic spatial segregation. Females forage for more krill than fish in more offshore, pelagic waters in contrast to males which feed equally on both items in more inshore, benthic waters. These results suggest a link between foraging habitat and diet that differs according to sex, similar to that found in East Antarctica. Given these similarities, we hypothesise that the foraging ecology of Adélie penguins varies with sex throughout the Antarctic continent. Nevertheless, further research in other locations such as in western Antarctica is needed to confirm this hypothesis. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) breeding population at Esperanza/Hope Bay, at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, is one of the largest Adélie penguin colonies in Antarctica. Nevertheless, the last known published field count during the egg-laying period is from 1985/1986. We counted breeding pairs within the entire colony, consisting of 274 breeding groups, during the 2012/2013 breeding season for comparison with previously published ground and satellite-derived counts. We also counted breeding pairs in 26 breeding groups that have been monitored annually since 1995/1996. We estimated the current population size to be 104,139 (95th-percentile CI 70,126–138,151) breeding pairs for the whole colony. The counts indicate population declines of 15.9% over 27 years in the whole colony and 37.5% over 18 years in the annually monitored subset of breeding groups, respectively. The observed decrease matches recent trends reported in other Adélie penguin colonies throughout the western Antarctic Peninsula and southern Scotia Sea. This population assessment contributes to the current estimates of the total predator populations in the region, which is necessary information for the management of marine living resources. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus) is a pelagic species that breeds on sub-Antarctic islands relatively close to the Antarctic polar front. After a significant decline at the beginning of the twentieth century because of widespread exploitation by sealers, the species' numbers are currently increasing, with observed local fluctuations. There has also been an increase in the number of sightings in the Antarctic, and recorded breeding attempts in this area. Here we present the history of observations of king penguins from 1977 to 2017 in two Antarctic Specially Protected Areas: ASPA No. 128 Western Shore of Admiralty Bay, and No. 151 Lions Rump, King George Island, South Shetland Islands (Western Antarctic). Additionally, we report on a new breeding site at Lions Rump, the third known breeding site for this species in the South Shetland Islands. Together with observations from other parts of the archipelago, the information in this study supports earlier suggestions of a southerly expansion of this species and of attempts to colonise the Antarctic Peninsula region. © 2019 Cambridge University Press.

ABSTRACT: Understanding animal personalities has notable implications in the ecology and evolution of animal behavior, but personality studies can also be useful in optimizing animal management, with the aim of improving health and well-being, and optimizing reproductive success, a fundamental factor in the species threatened with extinction. Modern zoos are increasingly being structured with enclosures that host different species, which permanently share spaces. This condition has undeniable positive aspects, but, in some species, it could determine the appearance of collective or synchronized behaviors. The aim of this study was to verify, in a colony of three species of communally housed penguins (Pygoscelis papua, Aptenodytes patagonicus and Eudyptes moseleyi), through a trait-rating assessment, if interspecific group life impacts on the expression of personality traits, and if it is possible to highlight specie-specific expression of personality traits, despite the influence of forced cohabitation. For many of the personality traits we analyzed, we have observed that it was possible to detect an expression that differed, according to the species. From a practical point of view, these data could ameliorate the management of the animals, allowing to design animal life routines, according to the different behavioral characteristics of the cohabiting species. © 2019 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: There is increasing interest in using higher-trophic level predators as ecosystem indicators because their performance is presumed to be linked to the overall function of the ecosystem that supports them. In the southwest Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) supports huge predator populations as well as a growing commercial fishery. To utilize information from the ecosystem in an adaptive framework for sustainably managing krill catch levels, performance indices of krill predators have been proposed as a proxy for krill abundance. However, there are several potentially confounding sources of variability that might impact predator performance such as the effects of environmental variability and fishing pressure on krill availability at scales relevant to predators. In this context, our study capi-talises on the occurrence of an unexpected El Niño event to characterise how environmental variability can drive changes in predator foraging behaviour. We demonstrate a clear link between coastal downwelling and changes in the at-sea habitat usage of chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica) foraging in a local krill fishing area. Penguins tracked from their breeding colonies on Powell Island, Antarctic Peninsula, undertook fewer, longer foraging trips during the downwelling-affected season compared with the season where no such downwelling was detected, suggesting that changes in climate-driven oceanography may have reduced krill availability along the northern shelf of the island. Our study demonstrates that penguin foraging behaviour is modified by scale-dependent processes, which if not accounted for may result in erroneous conclusions being drawn when using penguins as bioindicators of krill abundance. © International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2018.

ABSTRACT: There is a growing search for less invasive methods while studying the diet of Antarctic animals in the wild. Therefore, we compared the diet of gentoo penguins from stomach contents (i.e. through visual identification of prey remains) and scats (i.e. faeces), and further compared prey DNA assay in fresh and old scats. Prey remains identified visually in stomach contents and scats were broadly comparable: the crustaceans and fish were the most important components, with Themisto gaudichaudii clearly being the most frequent and numerous prey species in both sampling methods. By mass, differences in species frequency were observed in stomach contents (Parachaenichthys georgianus) and scats (Champsocephalus gunnari), with the former fish species absent in scats. Differences were detected in the most frequent prey (T. gaudichaudii and Euphausia superba) and in various fish species, most with bigger sizes in scats. Allometric equations to estimate most crustacean’s sizes (i.e. relationships between carapace and mass/total length) are needed. For DNA studies, when comparing DNA from fresh and old scats, both provided similar results that, in general, were also similar to the visual analysis. In order to use penguin scats (along with the use of DNA analyses) for monitoring purposes, allometric equations to estimate mass and size of prey (most crustaceans) and better designed species-specific primers are needed for targeting key prey species (e.g. Euphausia superba, T. gaudichaudii). These DNA methodologies can complement other methods (i.e. visual analyses and stomach contents analyses) in monitoring programs of penguins. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Wild birds harbor a huge diversity of avian avulaviruses (formerly avian paramyxoviruses). Antarctic penguin species have been screened for avian avulaviruses since the 1980s and, as such, are known hosts of these viruses. In this study, we screened three penguin species from the South Shetland Islands and the Antarctic Peninsula for avian avulaviruses. We show that Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) are hosts for four different avian avulavirus species, the recently described avian avulaviruses 17 to 19 and avian avulavirus 10-like, never before isolated in Antarctica. A total of 24 viruses were isolated and sequenced; avian avulavirus 17 was the most common, and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated patterns of occurrence, with different genetic clusters corresponding to penguin age and location. Following infection in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens, all four avian avulavirus species were shed from the oral cavity for up to 7 days postinfection. There was limited shedding from the cloaca in a proportion of infected chickens, and all but one bird seroconverted by day 21. No clinical signs were observed. Taken together, we propose that penguin species, including Antarctic penguins, may be the central reservoir for a diversity of avian avulavirus species and that these viruses have the potential to infect other avian hosts. IMPORTANCE Approximately 99% of all viruses are still to be described, and in our changing world, any one of these unknown viruses could potentially expand their host range and cause epidemic disease in wildlife, agricultural animals, or humans. Avian avulavirus 1 causes outbreaks in wild birds and poultry and is thus well described. However, for many avulavirus species, only a single specimen has been described, and their viral ecology and epidemiology are unknown. Through the detection of avian avulaviruses in penguins from Antarctica, we have been able to expand upon our understanding of three avian avulavirus species (avian avulaviruses 17 to 19) and report a potentially novel avulavirus species. Importantly, we show that penguins appear to play a key role in the epidemiology of avian avulaviruses, and we encourage additional sampling of this avian group. Copyright © 2019 Wille et al.

ABSTRACT: Seabirds are highly vocal on land where acoustic communication plays a crucial role in reproduction. Yet, seabirds spend most of their life at sea. They have developed a number of morphological, physiological and behavioural adaptations to forage in the marine environment. The use of acoustic signals at sea could potentially enhance seabirds’ foraging success, but remains largely unexplored. Penguins emit vocalisations from the sea surface when commuting, a behaviour possibly associated with group formation at sea. Still, they are unique in their exceptional diving abilities and feed entirely underwater. Other air-breathing marine predators that feed under water, like cetaceans, pinnipeds and marine turtles, are known to emit sound underwater, but such behaviour has not yet been described in seabirds. We aimed to assess the potential prevalence and diversity of vocalisations emitted underwater by penguins. We chose three study species from three different genera, and equipped foraging adults with video cameras with built-in microphones. We recorded a total of 203 underwater vocalisation from all three species during 4 h 43 min of underwater footage. Vocalisations were very short in duration (0.06 s on average), with a frequency of maximum amplitude averaging 998 Hz, 1097 Hz and 680 Hz for King, Gentoo and Macaroni penguins, respectively. All vocalisations were emitted during feeding dives and more than 50% of them were directly associated with hunting behaviour, preceeded by an acceleration (by 2.2 s on average) and/or followed by a prey capture attempt (after 0.12 s on average). The function of these vocalisations remain speculative. Although it seems to be related to hunting behaviour, these novel observations warrant further investigation. Copyright 2019 Thiebault et al.

ABSTRACT: According to central place foraging theory, breeding seabirds should energetically optimize prey acquisition and, therefore, foraging is expected to be located where prey are most available, within limits defined by the energetics of the species. We have shown this previously for Adélie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae, using foraging intensity as a proxy for prey patch quality, but we have yet to assess the habitat characteristics where foraging success is highest. Here, we report an effort using biologging instruments that recorded location and an index of foraging success, allowing us to characterize aspects of more or less successful foraging locations on the basis of sea-surface temperature, chlorophyll concentration, sea ice cover, water column stratification, and bathymetry. We retrieved data from 162 breeding Adélie penguins over 5 austral summers, 2005−2008 and 2012, and used a machine-learning algorithm to model the relationship between the number of undulations (>1 m) penguins made (i.e. our index of foraging success) and oceanographic conditions at the fine scale (5 km). We found that most oceanographic features were not predictive of foraging success, although light availability and thermocline strength as measured at the scale of individual penguin foraging dives were both relatively strong predictors. Contrary to previous results obtained at larger scales, we showed that at the fine scale, sea ice concentration is not an important predictor of foraging success, although the associated effect of sea ice cover, i.e. a stratified water column as indicated by thermocline strength, was important. We also confirmed that penguins traveled farther to achieve the same foraging success later in the season despite consistent oceanographic features, indicating that prey become depleted as the breeding season progresses. Our findings suggest that finer spatial and temporal scale data, including from underwater, are necessary to accurately describe the environmental variables that correlate with penguin foraging success, reinforcing the promise of small, animal-borne sensors for evaluating ecosystem processes. © The authors 2019.

ABSTRACT: Numerous skeletal remains recovered in situ from the late early to middle Paleocene Takatika Grit of Chatham Island, New Zealand, are among the oldest known fossils attributed to the penguin clade (Aves, Sphenisciformes). They represent a new medium-sized taxon, for which we erect a new genus and species, and a second, nota-bly larger form. These new penguins are analysed in a parsimony and Bayesian framework using an updated and revised phylogenetic matrix, based on morphological and molecular characters, and interpreted as among the most basal of known sphenisci-forms, closely related to Waimanu. While sharing numerous characteristics with the earliest wing-propelled divers, the novel taxon records the oldest occurrence of the characteristic penguin tarsometatarsus morphology. These ancient Chatham Island representatives add to a growing number and increased morphological diversity of Paleocene penguins in the New Zealand region, suggesting an origin for the group there. With their addition to other Paleocene penguins, these taxa reveal that sphenis-ciforms rapidly diversified as non-volant piscivores in the southern oceans following the end-Cretaceous mass extinction. They also provide further evidence for the hypothesis that their origin predates the Paleocene. This implies that stem Sphenisciformes and their sister group, the Procellariiformes, both originated in, and so may be expected to occur in, the Late Cretaceous. © 2019, Texas A and M University.

ABSTRACT: Between 25-30 November 2013, 2014 and 2015, miniaturized video cameras were attached to Magellanic Penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus; n = 14) in Punta Norte/San Lorenzo, Península Valdés, Chubut, Argentina. The objective was to examine prey selection, consumption of untraceable prey, and inter- and intraspecific interactions. During 56.3 hr of video footage, 1,621 dives from 14 individuals were recorded. Magellanic Penguins swam through shoals of lobster krill (Munida gregaria morph subrugosa), selectively consuming the fish, primarily anchovies (Engraulis anchoita), that were dispersed along the shoal, but did not consume the lobster krill. Magellanic Penguins captured fish on dives of less than 2 m in depth. The tagged individuals foraged with conspecifics in 2% (n = 33) of the total recorded dives. In addition, a multispecies feeding association was also documented (n = 1). Results were constrained to the upper 40 m of the water column; below this depth light level was too low for detections by video. The development of cameras with a light source and wider-angle lens are crucial to improve our understanding of Magellanic Penguin foraging behavior. © 2018 The Waterbird Society.

ABSTRACT: Relationships between shell morphological traits and byssus dimensions in adult winged pearl oysters Pteria penguin are described to include a more detailed description of byssus growth in juveniles under typical culture conditions. Byssus growth, byssus diameter (BD) relations between the byssus and shell traits [shell height; total wet weight (TW)], byssus occurrence, and the size distributions in samples collected monthly or bimonthly over a 1-y duration were recorded. Pearl oysters exhibited continuous shell growth and weight increase over the experimental period, but byssal measurements exhibited a different pattern. The increase in BD decreased as oysters aged and no further increase was observed after day 267. Moreover, BD/TW ratio exhibited a steadily diminishing trend as P. penguin aged. The relationships between the BD and the shell traits in 68-day-old oysters proved to be insignificant, probably because the oysters were neither heavy nor large enough to exhibit the relationships, but later, when oysters increased in size and weight, the relationships became significant. Byssus diameter was determined to be slightly more closely related to the weight of the animal than the size of the shell, and oysters at day 183 exhibited comparatively higher r2 values than oysters at day 366 of cultivation. The occurrence of oysters without byssus decreased gradually during cultivation from 30% initially to 0 after a year of cultivation. © 2018 National Shellfisheries Association. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Some top predators couple their migration with the migration of their main prey. Magellanic penguins, Spheniscus magellanicus, migrate north from their Patagonian colonies during their non-breeding period, supposedly following the Argentine anchovy, Engraulis anchoita, a keystone species and their main prey item in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. However, previous studies based on stranded carcasses suggest that cephalopods are the main food item for the penguins at their Brazilian wintering grounds. Moreover, anchovy stocks are in the early stages of commercial exploitation in southern Brazil. This study aims to investigate the importance of the Argentine anchovy in the diet of Magellanic penguins, including penguins of different age classes, both healthy and debilitated individuals, and in different parts of their annual cycle, using stomach content analysis and stable isotope analysis of multiple tissues, representing different time windows. Juvenile and adult penguins were collected (n = 54), either stranded on the beach or incidentally killed during gillnet fishing in adjacent waters. Penguins collected at sea had higher body mass indexes compared to stranded, demonstrating that they were healthy individuals. Among adult penguins from both areas (n = 21), fish was the main food item in their stomachs (prey-specific index of relative importance, PSIRI = 86%), with high contribution of Argentine anchovy. Cephalopods were the main food item (PSIRI = 71%) for juveniles (n = 20), with a predominance of the squid Doryteuthis sanpaulensis. In liver, muscle and feathers of penguins, mixed models based on δ13C and δ15N values demonstrated large contribution of the Argentine anchovy in the diet of the juveniles (95% credibility interval = 46–98.6%) and adults (39.8–98.9%), despite the high importance of cephalopods in the juvenile diet as identified in the stomach content analysis. Adults and juveniles presented isotopic niche overlap for all the tissues analysed, despite the differences in isotopic niche areas (= niche width) among the age classes. In 29% of the stomach contents, plastic debris was also found. Our results highlight the importance of using complementary techniques to study trophic ecology, as stomach content analysis of individuals found dead on beaches may not provide reliable information on diet. The strong reliance of penguins on the Argentine anchovy as a key resource throughout its annual cycle suggests that the stocks of this small pelagic fish should be exploited sustainably, ensuring the minimal forage biomass needed not only for seabirds but also for other consumers. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarcticus) and gentoo (P. papua) penguins are distributed throughout Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic islands. In this study, high-quality de novo assemblies of blood transcriptomes from these penguins were generated using the Illumina MiSeq platform. A total of 22.2 and 21.8 raw reads were obtained from chinstrap and gentoo penguins, respectively. These reads were assembled using the Oases assembly platform and resulted in 26,036 and 21,854 contigs with N50 values of 929 and 933 base pairs, respectively. Functional gene annotations through pathway analyses of the Gene Ontology, EuKaryotic Orthologous Groups, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases were performed for each blood transcriptome, resulting in a similar compositional order between the two transcriptomes. Ortholog comparisons with previously published transcriptomes from the Adélie (P. adeliae) and emperor (Aptenodytes forsteri) penguins revealed that a high proportion of the four penguins’ transcriptomes had significant sequence homology. Because blood and tissues of penguins have been used to monitor pollution in Antarctica, immune parameters in blood could be important indicators for understanding the health status of penguins and other Antarctic animals. In the blood transcriptomes, KEGG analyses detected many essential genes involved in the major innate immunity pathways, which are key metabolic pathways for maintaining homeostasis against exogenous infections or toxins. Blood transcriptome studies such as this may be useful for checking the immune and health status of penguins without sacrifice. © 2019, Korea Genome Organization.

ABSTRACT: A recent increase in the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)—also known as remotely piloted aircraft (RPA)—in the Antarctic in private, commercial and scientific sectors suggests that operational guidelines are urgently needed. One of the factors inhibiting adoption of such guidelines is the lack of knowledge about the impact of UAVs on wildlife. During the austral summer field season of 2014/15, data were gathered on the behavioural reactions to UAVs of Gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) and Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae), both resident breeding species on Ardley Island, King George Island, South Shetland Islands. A series of overflights at different altitudes above the nesting penguins were conducted with a small octocopter UAV, and their behaviour was recorded by video. Penguin behaviour altered as a result of the UAV flights, and behavioural reactions were more pronounced when the UAV was flown at lower altitudes. In Adélie penguins, behavioural reactions caused by the UAV were evident at the highest tested altitude of 50 m, while in Gentoo penguins reactions were evident from 30 m downwards. For both species, the reactions increased markedly when the UAV was flown at low altitudes of 10–20 m. Gentoo penguins showed significant reactions when the UAV was launched at distances closer than 20 m. There was some evidence of habituation to the UAV at some altitudes for horizontal flights, but no evidence of habituation in vertical flights. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: A large number of studies have focused on the reactivity of the hypothalamic–pituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis and the consequences of glucocorticoids (GC) in mediating life-history trade-offs. Although short-term increases in GCs are viewed as adaptive, mobilizing energy substrates allowing animals to deal with impending threats (e.g. stimulating hepatic gluconeogenesis, stimulating lipolysis, mobilizing amino acids), few studies have actually measured the exact time-course of substrate mobilisation in response to acute stress in natural conditions. We evaluated the hormonal and metabolic components of the stress response to acute stress in 32 free-living king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus). We monitored changes in blood GCs (corticosterone, CORT), glucose, lactate, ketone bodies (β-hydroxybutyrate), non-esterified fatty acids, and uric acid in response to a standardized capture-restraint protocol lasting for up to 90 min. Furthermore, we tested whether the vigilance status of the animal (alert or asleep) affected its perception of the capture, thereby modulating the hormonal and metabolic stress responses. The time course of energy mobilisation followed the characteristic pattern expected from laboratory and theoretical models, with a rapid depletion of those energy stores linked to rapid adrenergic responses (i.e. glucose and ketone bodies), followed by a mobilisation of energy stores associated with the sustained longer-term GC response (i.e. fats and protein stores). HPA reactivity was generally slower than reported in other birds, and there was high inter-individual variability. Sleeping birds had higher GC and glucose responses to acute stress, suggesting a more rapid mobilization of energy stores. Our results highlight the importance of considering HPA and metabolic responses to acute stress against species-specific life history and ecological relevant backgrounds. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The Fiordland crested penguin Eudyptes pachyrhynchus is one of the least studied crested penguin species, with indications the species has a declining population, which would be in line with the historic and contemporary trends for most crested penguins. To determine the current population trend of the Fiordland crested penguin, a number of monitoring programmes using both abundance counts and demographic modelling approaches were carried out between 1990 and 2010 in the northern half of the species’ range. A 2.6% ± 0.8% annual decline rate of active nests was detected at 14 monitoring plots, and the number of nests along two coastlines declined annually by 1.2% and 2.6%. Population matrix models using site-specific demographic rates for the species at two South Westland sites indicated contrasting population trends, with one site increasing by 1.6% annually and a second site decreasing at 0.3% annually. Due to concerns about the reproductive parameters used in the model, the trajectory indicated by the nest-chick data was deemed more robust and should be used to inform management. Six potential threats to Fiordland crested penguin were reviewed against the detected population trend and specifically adult survival, but it was determined that there is insufficient understanding about the species, particularly its foraging ecology and effects of fishing and terrestrial predation, to confidently identify the key threats. Therefore, the recommended management action is to address these knowledge gaps. © New Zealand Ecological Society.

ABSTRACT: Geographic variation in bird vocalizations is common and has been associated with genetic differences and speciation, as well as with short-term changes in response to anthropogenic noise. Because vocalizations are used for individual recognition in many species, geographic variation in these traits may affect mate choice, pair bonding, and territory defense. Anecdotal evidence suggests the existence of geographic variation in vocalizations between isolated populations of Gentoo Penguins (Pygoscelis papua), but there have been no comprehensive studies of Gentoo Penguin vocalizations across a broad geographic range. We used acoustic recordings of ambient colony sound at 22 breeding colonies in the Antarctic Peninsula and South Shetland Islands, South Georgia, the Falkland Islands, and Argentina to address 2 main questions regarding Gentoo Penguin vocalizations: (1) How do ecstatic display calls vary both within and between individuals, colonies, and regions? (2) Can ecstatic display calls be used to distinguish subspecies? We found high levels of variation between individuals and between colonies, but little additional variation between regions or subspecies. We found no trends to suggest a latitudinal gradient in vocal characteristics, although we did find that some measures varied with relative distance between colonies. Although we found significant differences at the colony level, unknown calls could not easily be categorized to colony or region by machine learning. We conclude that the vocal soundscape of each colony is driven by variation between individuals within a colony and, developing independently from neighboring colonies, becomes differentiated from other colonies through a process of drift. Although individual calls could, in most cases, be identified to subspecies by machine learning, our analysis suggests that subspecies differences may be driven by variation among colonies and that subspecies identification may be unreliable using acoustics alone. © 2017 American Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: A Pliocene-age volcano on Penguin Island became active again in the Pleistocene/Holocene, forming the main cone of the island – Deacon Peak, and leaving late-Holocene phreatomagmatic craters, including ‘Petrel Crater’, about 200 m in diameter and filled currently by a maar lake with a flat bottom at 18 m water depth. Petrographic, geochemical, photosynthetic pigment, and diatom data from the 72-cm-long sediment core reveal that the crater was initially a marine lagoon with typical phytoplankton assemblages. Most probably, tectonic–volcanic activity about 1250 years ago, documented in tephra fallout, triggered an abrupt glacio-isostatic uplift that separated the lake from the sea. The horizon of tephra, probably from the Deception Island volcano, marks a sudden change in environment from brackish to lacustrine. The ecological evolution of the lake was initially constrained by an uplift, whereas the influence of marine water vanished with time, the lake became meromictic, and the freshwater mixolimnion layer expanded, while the monimolimnion became anoxic due to the influence of a penguin rookery situated on the shore. During the ‘Little Ice Age’ (LIA), the maar may have been covered by permanent ice. A discharge of mineralized guano from the possibly enlarged penguin rookery on the lake shore caused an expansion of the anoxic monimolimnion to the ice surface and an important reduction of autochthonous lacustrine biota of the maar, whereas a substantially increased participation of allochthonous biota passively supplied with guano. That record in the lake sediment core reaffirms the occurrence of a regional LIA event in the maritime Antarctic. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.

ABSTRACT: The breeding success, foraging strategies and abundance of penguin species are thought to vary according to the quality of near-shore marine environments. Little blue penguins (LBP), Eudyptula minor, in particular, are considered a candidate species for assessing near-shore marine productivity and integrity due to their limited foraging ranges and reliance on local resources, particularly during breeding. However, to assess their ability to be near-shore ecosystem indicators an understanding of what their “normal” dive patterns and population parameters from across New Zealand are needed. This research investigates diving behaviours and feather stable isotope values (as indicators of diet) of LBPs from southern (Pearl Island, Stewart Island/Rakiura, Nov. 2011) and central (Adele Island, Abel Tasman, Nov. 2012) New Zealand (NZ), two areas not previously studied, and compares them with LBPs from other areas of NZ. The diving behaviours of LBPs across NZ, are highly variable, not obviously linked with local geography and bathometry. These results and the NZ wide comparison indicates that LBPs are environmentally adaptable, which may make them difficult to use as ecosystem indicators across sites. However, with increasing knowledge of diving behaviours and population parameters of LBPs within a region, they are likely to be indicators of local changing marine environment. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Although penguins have a very abundant fossil record in Antarctica, very few cranial elements have been found so far, and in all the cases the specimens are incomplete. We describe a new cranium of a medium-sized penguin from the late Eocene Submeseta Formation in Marambio/ Seymour Island, Antarctica. Its morphology allows us to establish a common cranial pattern for all known Eocene taxa (including South American, Antarctic and probably Oceanian species), with very different proportions between cranium and post-cranium from those of modern penguins. These Paleogene fossils exhibit a small neurocrania, extremely elongated bills, large occipital condyles, and strong cranio-mandibular articulations. © 2017 E.

ABSTRACT: The Adélie penguin is a well-known indicator for climate and environmental changes. Exploring how large-scale climate variability affects penguin ecology in the past is essential for understanding the responses of Southern Ocean ecosystems to future global change. Using ornithogenic sediments at Cape Bird, Ross Island, Antarctica, we inferred relative population changes of Adélie penguins in the southern Ross Sea over the past 500 yr, and observed an increase in penguin populations during the Little Ice Age (LIA; 1500–1850 AD). We used cadmium content in ancient penguin guano as a proxy of ocean upwelling and identified a close linkage between penguin dynamics and atmospheric circulation and oceanic conditions. During the cold period of ∼1600–1825 AD, a deepened Amundsen Sea Low (ASL) led to stronger winds, intensified ocean upwelling, enlarged Ross Sea and McMurdo Sound polynyas, and thus higher food abundance and penguin populations. We propose a mechanism linking Antarctic marine ecology and atmospheric/oceanic dynamics which can help explain and predict responses of Antarctic high latitudes ecosystems to climate change. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Shell dimensions of 588 hatchery-produced Pteria penguin (Röding, 1798) were measured and analyzed to describe morphometric changes in shell form of this species over its life cycle. Oysters ranged from 9.4 to 202.2 mm in dorsoventral height (DVH), 0.1-1,526.9 g in weight and spanned 0.5-5 y of age. Significant positive curvilinear relationships were observed between shell width (SW) and DVH (R2 = 0.99, P < 0.001), diagonal length (DL) and DVH (R2 = 0.99, P < 0.001), shell thickness (ST) and DVH (R2 = 0.98, P < 0.001), and wet weight (WW) and DVH (R2 = 0.99, P < 0.001). Trends in the morphometric ratios of P. penguin indicated a proportional decrease in SW and DL with increasing DVH, resulting in a shift from a horizontally elongate to a vertically elongate shell form. The ST of P. penguin remained proportionally stable over its life cycle, whereas its WW increased proportionally by more than two orders of magnitude. Based on the results of this study, future research should examine (1) the relationship between the external shell dimensions and internal nacreous area, (2) changes in nacre deposition rate in different shell locations, and (3) the relationship between soft tissue weight, shell weight, nacre thickness, and DVH of P. penguin. The description of the growth form of P. penguin represents an important first step toward determining optimum half-pearl (mabé) culture procedures for P. penguin in Tonga.

ABSTRACT: Vocalizations in birds play a significant role in species and mate recognition as well as sexual selection. Geographic variation in vocalization is well studied in male songbirds but largely unexplored in seabirds and in females. We investigated variation in male and female agonistic and advertising calls between 4 populations of Little Penguins (Eudyptula minor) in South Australia. We also determined whether call similarity was better explained by the geographic distances between the colonies, by microhabitat variation, or by variation in the physical characteristics of the individuals. Further, we used playback experiments testing male and female responses to determine the biological importance of geographic call variation. Both agonistic and advertising calls differed between individuals and sexes, with males producing calls at higher frequencies than females. Our results also reveal significant variation in agonistic calls across the colonies, best explained by variation in microhabitat. However, resident birds did not discriminate between calls originating from different colonies. The behavioral patterns are discussed in relation to gene flow and population differentiation. © 2018 American Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: We excavated active and abandoned Adélie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) colonies at Seymour Island and Hope Bay, Antarctic Peninsula, to determine an occupation history for this species at these sites. Previous research at Hope Bay has indicated an occupation there since the middle Holocene, based on a sediment record from Lake Boeckella. Excavations revealed only shallow and relatively fresh ornithogenic soils in the active colonies at the two localities. At least 53 abandoned pebble mounds were located at Hope Bay of which nine were excavated and four were sampled by probing to recover organic remains to determine their age. Radiocarbon dating of egg membrane, feather, and bone from both sites revealed a young occupation dating to less than ~600 years after correcting for the marine carbon reservoir effect. The mismatch in the geologic record of Adélie Penguin occupation in the northern Antarctic Peninsula, including Lake Boeckella sediments and geologic deposits and lake sediments on King George Island, with more direct evidence of breeding colonies from ornithogenic soils from active and abandoned colonies is hereby referred to as the ‘northern enigma’ as it does not occur in other regions of Antarctica including the southern Antarctic Peninsula, East Antarctica, or the Ross Sea, where the penguin record extends to the early to middle Holocene and matches well with the geologic record of deglaciation and penguin occupation. As yet, there is no convincing explanation for the ‘northern enigma’. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

ABSTRACT: Carotenoids have important roles in bird behavior, including pigmentation for sexual signaling and improving color vision via retinal oil droplets. Yellow carotenoids are diet-derived, but red carotenoids (ketocarotenoids) are typically synthesized from yellow precursors via a carotenoid ketolase. Recent research on passerines has provided evidence that a cytochrome p450 enzyme, CYP2J19, is responsible for this reaction, though it is unclear if this function is phylogenetically restricted. Here I provide evidence that CYP2J19 is the carotenoid ketolase common to Aves using the genomes of 65 birds and the retinal transcriptomes of 15 avian taxa. CYP2J19 is functionally intact and robustly transcribed in all taxa except for several species adapted to foraging in dim light conditions. Two penguins, an owl and a kiwi show evidence of genetic lesions and relaxed selection in their genomic copy of CYP2J19, and six owls show evidence of marked reduction in CYP2J19 retinal transcription compared to nine diurnal avian taxa. Furthermore, one of the owls appears to transcribe a CYP2J19 pseudogene. Notably, none of these taxa are known to use red carotenoids for sexual signaling and several species of owls and penguins represent the only birds known to completely lack red retinal oil droplets. The remaining avian taxa belong to groups known to possess red oil droplets, are known or expected to deposit red carotenoids in skin and/or plumage, and/or frequently forage in bright light. The loss and reduced expression of CYP2J19 is likely an adaptation to maximize retinal sensitivity, given that oil droplets reduce the amount of light available to the retina. © 2017

ABSTRACT: We evaluate whether helminth parasites affect both cellular and humoral components of the immune system of Magellanic Penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus (J.R. Forster, 1781)) chicks. We measured immune components after the administration of an antihelminthic drug to remove parasites. Cellular immune components included the complete white blood cell (WBC) count and the in vivo skin-swelling response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Humoral aspects assessed were the ability of plasma to agglutinate foreign particles and the bactericidal capacity of plasma. Antihelminthic treatment resulted in lower total WBC counts supporting the role of circulating leukocytes in fighting macroparasites. Deparasitized chicks showed a reduction in all types of leukocytes. Contrary to our expectation, deparasitized Magellanic Penguin chicks showed lower response to PHA injection than control chicks. The swelling response was positively correlated with body condition and with total WBC in circulation. We hypothesize that the specific helminth community naturally occurring in Magellanic Penguin chicks might have an overall immunostimulatory effect on the PHA response. Antihelminthic treatment did not alter the innate humoral immune parameters measured. Our results support the prediction that, given their relatively low costs of use and maintenance, innate humoral components would not be as affected by antihelminthic treatment as more costly cellular responses. © 2018, Canadian Science Publishing.

ABSTRACT: A eumelanistic chinstrap penguin Pygoscelis antarcticus was registered at Penguin Island, Maritime Antarctica during the 2014/2015 austral summer. Melanism mutations are quite rare for this species, and even though former informal records have been made, as far as we know, this is the first official report of eumelanism in chinstrap penguins. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: The role and use of olfactory cues by penguins is largely under-investigated, with only a few studies suggesting that odours are involved in prey detection, orientation and for interspecific communication. This also applies to King Penguins Aptenodytes patagonicus where little is known about their chemoreception abilities and, subsequently, the role of odours in their behavioural ecology. Here, we investigated the chemical composition of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from feathers of King Penguins in the Kerguelen Archipelago and their potential to carry information on identity and sex. We analysed VOCs using direct thermal desorption, a novel approach for extracting volatile compounds directly from solid matrices. We were only able to test at desorption temperatures of 70 and 100 °C to optimize conditions for VOC analysis. We found a profile of 26 VOCs present in most individuals, which varied significantly between individuals but not between sexes. Results suggested that VOCs could possibly be used by King Penguins to locate the colony and recognize individuals, if similar VOCs are also present at ambient conditions. Further studies and behavioural experiments are encouraged to explore olfactory-based communication in this species. © 2017 British Ornithologists’ Union

ABSTRACT: Persistent organic pollutants were assessed in Humboldt Penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) from the Punta San Juan Marine Protected Area, Peru, in the austral winter of 2009. Plasma samples from 29 penguins were evaluated for 31 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners and 11 organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) by using gas chromatography coupled to an ion trap mass spectrometer and for 15 polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners by using gas chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry. The detection rate for PCBs in the samples was 69%, with congeners 105, 118, 180, and 153 most commonly detected. The maximum ∑PCB concentration was 25 ng/g. The detection rate for DDT, DDD, and/or DDE was higher than for other OCP residues (90%; maximum concentration=10 ng/g). The detection rate for PBDEs was 86%, but most concentrations were low (maximum ∑PBDE concentration=3.81 ng/g). This crucial breeding population of S. humboldti was not exposed to contaminants at levels detrimental to health and reproductive success; however, the identified concentrations of legacy and recently emerged toxicants underscore the need for temporal monitoring and diligence to protect this endangered species in the face of regional human population and industrial growth. These results also provide key reference values for spatial comparisons throughout the range of this species. © Wildlife Disease Association 2018.

ABSTRACT: Reproduction and moulting are costly events in birds. Some studies have pointed out the possibility that the immune response is optimized and traded off against such costly functions. Moreover, it is also known that stressful conditions may lead to the suppression of immune functions. As reproduction and moulting do not overlap in penguins, they offer a good opportunity to explore the relationships between immunity and both events. Our aim is to compare physiological stress and immunity between breeding and moulting in the Chinstrap Penguin. Considering the large amount of energy expended during breeding and the almost total inactivity during moulting and the immunosuppression caused by stress, it is expected that the Chinstrap Penguin shows a higher degree of stress during breeding and that immunological capacity was lower in this life stage. As a measure of stress, we examined the heterophil/lymphocyte ratio. To account for an overall measure of the immunological status, we measured cellular immunity (total leukocyte count and the response to phytohaemagglutinin) and humoral immunity (immunoglobulin levels). All measures were taken in both breeding and moulting penguins. Our results showed that breeding was more stressful than moulting in the Chinstrap Penguin. Immunological differences between the two physiological activities showed a complex picture as cellular immunity values were higher during moulting and humoral immunity values were higher during breeding. Differences were also found between sexes with males showing higher levels of stress than females and lower values of total leukocyte count. © 2017, Dt. Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: Chemotherapy-induced alopecia is a distressing side effect of cancer treatment. The aim of this registry study was to assess efficacy and tolerability of scalp hypothermia using Penguin Cold Caps (Penguin) in breast cancer patients. Methods: Hair loss was assessed by patients using a 100-point Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and by physicians using the 5-point Dean Scale at baseline, every 3–4 weeks during chemotherapy, and at least 1 month after completion of chemotherapy. The primary efficacy endpoint for success was defined as ≤50% hair loss by patient report (VAS) at follow-up (FUP). Tolerability and satisfaction were assessed by patient report. Results: 103 patients enrolled between 7/2010 and 6/2015; 97 are evaluable for the primary endpoint. Chemotherapy included docetaxel/cyclophosphamide (TC; n = 50) for 4–6 cycles every 3 weeks, weekly paclitaxel for 12 weeks then doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (P/AC; n = 23) for 4 cycles every 2–3 weeks, AC then paclitaxel (AC/P; n = 10), docetaxel/carboplatin ± trastuzumab (TCH; n = 4) for 4–6 cycles every 3 weeks. Overall, 61% of patients successfully prevented CIA; impact was regimen specific: TCH 100%, TC × 4 84%, TC × 5–6 50%, P/AC 43%, AC/P 20%. The most common toxicity was headache, reported by 78.5% of patients with mean pain level 37/100. Satisfaction among those who completed scalp cooling (SC) and FUP ranged from 74 to 100%. All patients who completed SC/FUP recommended Penguin. Conclusions: Scalp hypothermia with Penguin is effective in reducing alopecia, particularly for non-anthracycline-based shorter regimens. Penguin was well tolerated and viewed favorably by most patients. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

ABSTRACT: Identifying the at-sea distribution of wide-ranging marine predators is critical to understanding their ecology. Advances in electronic tracking devices and intrinsic biogeochemical markers have greatly improved our ability to track animal movements on ocean-wide scales. Here, we show that, in combination with direct tracking, stable carbon isotope analysis of essential amino acids in tail feathers provides the ability to track the movement patterns of two, wide-ranging penguin species over ocean basin scales. In addition, we use this isotopic approach across multiple breeding colonies in the Scotia Arc to evaluate migration trends at a regional scale that would be logistically challenging using direct tracking alone. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Penguins are a monophyletic group in which many species are found breeding sympatrically, raising questions regarding how these species coexist successfully. Here, the isotopic niche of three sympatric pygoscelid penguin species was investigated at Powell Island, South Orkney Islands, during two breeding seasons (austral summers 2013–2014 and 2015–2016). Measurements of carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) stable isotope ratios were obtained from blood (adults) or feather (chicks) samples collected from Adélie Pygoscelis adeliae, chinstrap P. antarctica, and gentoo P. papua penguins. Isotopic niche regions (a proxy for the realized trophic niches) were computed to provide estimates of the trophic niche width of the studied species during the breeding season. The isotopic niche regions of adults of all three species were similar, but gentoo chicks had noticeably wider isotopic niches than the chicks of the other two species. Moderate to strong overlap in isotopic niche among species was found during each breeding season and for both age groups, suggesting that the potential for competition for shared food sources was similar during the two study years, although the actual level of competition could not be determined owing to the lack of data on resource abundance. Clear interannual shifts in isotopic niche were seen in all three species, though of lower amplitude for adult chinstrap penguins. These shifts were due to variation in carbon, but not nitrogen, isotopic ratios, which could indicate either a change in isotopic signature of their prey or a switch to an alternative food web. The main conclusions of this study are that (1) there is a partial overlap in the isotopic niches of these three congeneric species and that (2) they responded similarly to changes that likely occurred at the base of their food chain between the 2 years of the study. © 2018 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Plumage aberrations, such as leucism, isabellinism, albinism and melanism, are hereditary and are caused by irregularities in the formation of melanin. This paper presents opportunistic observations of plumage aberrations in 15 Macaroni Penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus at sub-Antarctic Marion Island during 2008–2016. Across five colonies, full and partial leucism, isabellinism and partial melanism were recorded. Plumage aberration in Macaroni Penguins is rarely reported elsewhere in the world. The relatively high number of recorded individuals at Marion Island, in conjunction with limited mixing between global Macaroni Penguin colonies, suggests that a relatively high proportion of the population is entrained with this genetic predisposition. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: We describe a partial skeleton of a new stem group representative of the Sphenisciformes from the mid-Paleocene Waipara Greensand in New Zealand, which represents the best-preserved and most complete Paleocene penguin found so far. Sequiwaimanu rosieae, n. gen. et sp., is the fourth penguin species from the Waipara Greensand, which previously yielded two species that were assigned to the taxon Waimanu, in addition to leg bones of an unnamed giant penguin. Among other features, the new species is characterized by an articular facet for the furcula on the apex carinae of the sternum, which is unknown from other sphenisciforms. We perform detailed comparisons with the species assigned to Waimanu and show that the type species Waimanu manneringi differs in tarsometatarsus morphology from its putative congener ‘W.’ tuatahi, which is here assigned to the new taxon Muriwaimanu. Sequiwaimanu rosieae exhibits a more derived morphology than Muriwaimanu tuatahi, but its exact affinities to W. manneringi are unresolved owing to the incompletely known osteology of the latter species. With S. rosieae being more closely related to the crown group than M. tuatahi, shared characteristics of the two taxa are likely to be plesiomorphic for sphenisciforms. Although the skeletal morphology of these sphenisciform stem species shows some similarities to plotopterids (i.e., wing-propelled diving seabirds from the North Pacific Basin) in some characters, the stem group sphenisciforms from the Waipara Greensand are clearly distinguished from plotopterids. http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:86031231-EADB-45EF-930B-8E55833D32F6 SUPPLEMENTAL DATA—Supplemental materials are available for this article for free at www.tandfonline.com/UJVP Citation for this article: Mayr, G., V.

ABSTRACT: The Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) is a marine sentinel for the southern Atlantic Ocean that is a proxy of environmental quality. The presence of marine debris (macro-debris) in the stomach contents of emaciated juvenile penguins stranded from 21°S to 23°S was compared at different times (2000 and 2008), and the debris ingestion pathway was determined. The frequency of marine debris in the stomachs doubled in less than a decade, and flexible plastics remained the main ingested item over time (68–70%). The pelagic octopus, Argonauta nodosa, which inhabits the sea surface, was the most important prey species recovered in the stomach contents. The poor physical condition of the penguins that reach the northern migration limit (study area) reduces the diving capacity of the animals and increases their vulnerability to debris ingestion. Considering their preferred prey and physical condition, we conclude that the penguins likely ingested the marine debris in surface waters. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Penguin stomach microbiota and its variability are important as these microbes may contribute to the fitness of the host birds and their chicks, and influence the microbial ecosystem of the surrounding soils. However, there is relatively little knowledge in this area, with the majority of studies focused on their deposited faeces. Here we investigated whether similar foraging strategies in adjacent colonies of different penguin species lead to similar temporarily conserved stomach microbiota. To do this, we studied the inter- and intra-specific variations in bacterial community composition in the stomach contents of sympatrically breeding Adélie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and Chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarctica) Penguins, which consumed a diet of 100% Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) under a similar foraging regime on Signy Island (maritime Antarctic), using a high-throughput DNA sequencing approach. Our data show that Adélie and Chinstrap Penguins shared 23–63% similarity in the stomach bacterial community composition, with no significant differences observed in the α-diversity or the assemblages of frequently encountered groups of operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The most frequently encountered OTUs that were shared between the species represented members of the phyla Fusobacteria, Firmicutes, Tenericutes and Proteobacteria. OTUs which were unique to individual birds and to single species formed approximately half of the communities identified, suggesting that stomach microbiota variability can occur in penguins that forage and breed under similar environmental conditions. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

ABSTRACT: Objectives The incidence of multidrug-resistant bacteria in wildlife animals has been investigated to improve our knowledge of the spread of clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance genes. The aim of this study was to report the first draft genome sequence of an extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa ST644 isolate recovered from a Magellanic penguin with a footpad infection (bumblefoot) undergoing rehabilitation process. Methods The genome was sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq® platform using 150-bp paired-end reads. De novo genome assembly was performed using Velvet v.1.2.10, and the whole genome sequence was evaluated using bioinformatics approaches from the Center of Genomic Epidemiology, whereas an in-house method (mapping of raw whole genome sequence reads) was used to identify chromosomal point mutations. Results The genome size was calculated at 6 436 450 bp, with 6357 protein-coding sequences and the presence of genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides, β-lactams, phenicols, sulphonamides, tetracyclines, quinolones and fosfomycin; in addition, mutations in the genes gyrA (Thr83Ile), parC (Ser87Leu), phoQ (Arg61His) and pmrB (Tyr345His), conferring resistance to quinolones and polymyxins, respectively, were confirmed. Conclusion This draft genome sequence can provide useful information for comparative genomic analysis regarding the dissemination of clinically significant antibiotic resistance genes and XDR bacterial species at the human–animal interface. © 2017 International Society for Chemotherapy of Infection and Cancer

ABSTRACT: The ability to identify the sex of individuals is essential in studies of ecology, behavior, and conservation, but reliable methods for sexing species that exhibit low sexual dimorphism are often time consuming or invasive. Previous studies have evaluated the usefulness of morphological measurements as easy and minimally invasive means of sexing seabirds in the field. We used a discriminant function analysis (DFA) to determine the accuracy of sexing Galápagos penguins Spheniscus mendiculus using 6 morphological measurements: bill depth, bill length, head length, gape, flipper length, and foot length. Using these variables, we sexed 95% of study penguins correctly. Simplified functions, including bill depth and length, or bill depth only, also correctly classified the sex of 95% of study penguins. We also looked for sexual dimorphism in plumage, estimating the size of the white feather patch underneath the chin. Ninety-five percent of penguins with little to no white chin patch were female, while penguins with larger chin spots were both male and female. We show that Galápagos penguins, a rare and Endangered seabird, may be sexed accurately, even when data are limited to 1 morphological measurement. © The authors 2018.

ABSTRACT: All through the bird literature and feature films, there is much ado about dedicated emperor penguin males fasting for 115 days while they do all the incubation of the single egg. Sometimes, they may not fast for so long. Based on a winter visit to Cape Washington, we obtained evidence that some birds may feed before the egg is laid, and if they do, and some are males, then their fast is much less than 115 days. The consequence of a shorter fast for the male is a better chance of completing the 65 day incubation fast and success in fledging the chick. For those in northern colonies that may migrate south, there will be closer access to open water, but there will be the need to dive in the dark. © 2018. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Long-term monitoring of seabird breeding cycles and breeding success is essential for conservation and a valuable indicator of ecological change, but is logistically expensive and time consuming. We describe the annual cycle and year-round colony attendance patterns for Gentoo Penguins Pygoscelis papua at Martillo Island, Beagle Channel, by analyzing camera trap photographs. We deployed a Reconyx HC500 Hyperfire trail camera programmed in time-lapse mode to take single pictures once per hour year-round (27 Feb 2013 until 27 Feb 2014). The nonreproductive stage began 23 April 2013 when adults completed molt and ended 24 September 2013 when the first pair formation was observed. In general Gentoos Penguins performed daily trips, and the number of adults present at 1900 h ART was not significantly different at any stage except the late chick-rearing and premolt stages. Breeding success was 0.92 chicks per nest. Small variations in day length had a significant influence on penguin's trip duration during the nonreproductive stage. The method proved to be effective for monitoring this species and provided important data for management and conservation. © 2018 Wilson Ornithological Society. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The poorly known winter foraging ecology of the king penguin, a major Southern Ocean consumer, was investigated at the subantarctic Crozet Islands where the largest global population breeds. Blood δ13C and δ15N values were used as proxies of the birds’ foraging habitat and diet, respectively, and circulating prolactin levels helped in determining the birds’ reproductive status. Plasma prolactin concentrations showed that king penguin adults of unknown breeding status (n = 52) that were present at the colony in winter were in fact breeders and failed breeders, but were not non -breeders. Circulating prolactin was neither related to δ13C nor δ15N values, thus suggesting that both breeders and failed breeders used the same foraging habitats and fed on the same prey. Plasma and blood cell isotopic values depicted four new relevant biological features on the feeding strategies of king penguins during the critical winter period: (1) 42% of the birds foraged in the distant Antarctic Zone, but 58% fed primarily in subantarctic waters (δ13C), (2) they preyed upon myctophids in both zones (δ15N), (3) individuals were consistent in their foraging strategies over the winter months (δ13C and δ15N), and (4) a higher proportion of females (77%–80%) than males (27%–31%) favored feeding in distant Antarctic waters (δ13C). This study highlights trophic connectivity between subantarctic and Antarctic ecosystems and hence the key role of energy export from Antarctic waters to sustain breeding populations of subantarctic predators, including during the Austral winter. © 2018 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: CASE HISTORY: A little penguin (Eudyptula minor) of wild origin, in captivity at Wellington Zoo, became inappetent and lethargic in March 2013. Despite supportive care in the zoo’s wildlife hospital, the bird died within 24 hours. CLINICAL FINDINGS: Weight loss, dehydration, pale mucous membranes, weakness, increased respiratory effort and biliverdinuria were apparent on physical examination. Microscopic evaluation of blood smears revealed intra-erythrocytic stages of Plasmodium spp. and a regenerative reticulocytosis in the absence of anaemia. PATHOLOGICAL FINDINGS: Post-mortem findings included reduced body condition, dehydration, pulmonary congestion and oedema, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, hydropericardium and subcutaneous oedema. Histopathological findings included protozoal organisms in sections of lung, liver and spleen. A marked, diffuse, sub-acute interstitial histiocytic pneumonia was present. Accumulation of haemosiderin was noted in the Kupffer cells of the liver and in histiocytic-type cells in the spleen. MOLECULAR TESTING: DNA was extracted from frozen portions of the liver. Nested PCR results and DNA sequencing confirmed infection of the deceased little penguin with Plasmodium (Huffia) elongatum lineage GRW06. DIAGNOSIS: Avian malaria due to Plasmodium (Huffia) elongatum GRW06 RETROSPECTIVE INVESTIGATION: A retrospective analysis of 294 little penguin cases in the Massey University post-mortem database revealed three other potential avian malaria cases. Analysis of archived tissues using a nested PCR for Plasmodium spp. followed by DNA sequencing revealed that a little penguin which died at Auckland Zoo was infected with P. elongatum GRW06 and two wild little penguins found dead on New Zealand beaches were infected with P. relictum SGS1 and Plasmodium. sp. lineage LINN1. Therefore, the overall frequency of deaths in little penguins associated with avian malaria was 4/295 (1.36%). CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our results suggest that avian malaria is associated with sporadic mortality in New Zealand’s little penguins both in the wild and in captivity, but there is no evidence of mass mortality events due to Plasmodium spp. infection. © 2017 New Zealand Veterinary Association.

ABSTRACT: The main soil physical-chemical features, the concentrations of a set of pollutants, and the soil microbiota linked to penguin rookeries have been studied in 10 selected sites located at the South Shetland Islands and the Antarctic Peninsula (Maritime Antarctica). This study aims to test the hypothesis that biotransport by penguins increases the concentration of pollutants, especially heavy metals, in Antarctic soils, and alters its microbiota. Our results show that penguins do transport certain chemical elements and thus cause accumulation in land areas through their excreta. Overall, a higher penguin activity is associated with higher organic carbon content and with higher concentrations of certain pollutants in soils, especially cadmium, cooper and arsenic, as well as zinc and selenium. In contrast, in soils that are less affected by penguins' faecal depositions, the concentrations of elements of geochemical origin, such as iron and cobalt, increase their relative weighted contribution, whereas the above-mentioned pollutants maintain very low levels. The concentrations of pollutants are far higher in those penguin rookeries that are more exposed to ship traffic. In addition, the soil microbiota of penguin-influenced soils was studied by molecular methods. Heavily penguin-affected soils have a massive presence of enteric bacteria, whose relative dominance can be taken as an indicator of penguin influence. Faecal bacteria are present in addition to typical soil taxa, the former becoming dominant in the microbiota of penguinaffected soils, whereas typical soil bacteria, such as Actinomycetales, co-dominate the microbiota of less affected soils. Results indicate that the continuous supply by penguin faeces, and not the selectivity by increased pollutant concentrations is the main factor shaping the soil bacterial community. Overall, massive penguin influence results in increased concentrations of certain pollutants and in a strong change in taxa dominance in the soil bacterial community. © 2017 Santamans et al.

ABSTRACT: Trace elements are chemical contaminants that can be present almost anywhere on the planet. The study of trace elements in biotic matrices is a topic of great relevance for the implications that it can have on wildlife and human health. Penguins are very useful, since they live exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere and represent about 90% of the biomass of birds of the Southern Ocean. The levels of trace elements (dry weight) in different biotic matrices of penguins were reviewed here. Maps of trace element records in penguins were included. Data on exposure and effects of trace elements in penguins were collected from the literature. The most reported trace elements in penguins are aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, copper, zinc, and manganese. Trace elements have been measured in 11 of the 18 species of penguins. The most studied biotic matrices are feathers and excreta. Most of the studies have been performed in Antarctica and subantarctic Islands. Little is known about the interaction among metals, which could provide better knowledge about certain mechanisms of detoxification in penguins. Future studies of trace elements in penguins must incorporate other metals such as vanadium, cobalt, nickel, and chromium. Data of metals in the species such as Eudyptes pachyrhynchus, Eudyptes moseleyi, Eudyptes sclateri, Eudyptes robustus, Eudyptes schlegeli, Spheniscus demersus, Spheniscus mendiculus, and Megadyptes antipodes are urged. It is important to correlate levels of metals in different biotic matrices with the effects on different species and in different geographic locations. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

ABSTRACT: Nestling growth and survival of marine birds are influenced by multiple factors. Oceanic conditions influence food availability and energy value of the diet and affect nestling condition. Climate variables, like heavy rains, could drown or cause hypothermia of nestlings. Besides oceanic conditions, parental conditions and hatching asynchrony can also affect nestling growth and survival. Magellanic penguins are long-lived seabirds with multiple breeding opportunities that lay a two-egg clutch, but they may raise only one of the two chicks depending on the breeding season. We studied nestling growth and survival for four breeding seasons (2010–2013) and related these to parents’ body condition and hatching asynchrony. We also analysed the effect of nestling diet, rainfall, chlorophyll a concentrations (c-a), and sea surface temperature (SST) of known foraging sites to evaluate nestling performance. We found that parents’ body condition, especially that of males, were positively related to nestling growth. Hatching asynchrony appears not to have an important role in nestling growth/survival. Nestling growth/survival, rain, diet, c-a and SST differed drastically among breeding seasons. During the breeding season with the highest mortality and lowest asymptotic mass of nestlings (2012), we registered heavy daily rains within the first stage of the raising period. We also found that high/low concentrations of c-a were related to high/low mortality of nestlings, respectively, and that SST was inversely related to asymptotic mass. Nonetheless, neither of these oceanic variables was related clearly to nestling growth/survival during breeding seasons with intermediate breeding success. On the contrary, the estimated proportion of low quality compared to high quality items in nestling diets coincided in every breeding season with the survival/growth of nestlings. We concluded that c-a and SST were not precise enough to determine nestling success or survival of nestlings during breeding seasons with intermediate nestling success, but that the proportion of high quality compared to low quality items in the diet were key for nestling survival and growth. Although the breeding seasons did not seem to be so “unfavourable” in terms of c-a and SST, when low quality items predominated in the diet, this had a strong impact on the condition of the chicks. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: This study evaluated the semen of two penguin species from separate genera with reference to unique features in sperm structure using light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Ejaculates from African penguin (n = 51) and Rockhopper penguin (n = 9) contained on average more than 60% motile spermatozoa and a sperm concentration of 3274 × 106/ml and 1423 × 106/ml, respectively. The percentage progressive motility was similar for the two species as well as all the kinematics parameters. The sperm morphology of these two penguin species is almost identical and largely resembles that of non-passerine birds in terms of the filiform head, small acrosome and mid-piece containing 13 spherical mitochondria, arranged around the proximal and distal centrioles in a single helix. Apart from a shorter mid-piece, penguin sperm morphometrics were similar to other non-passerine birds. The ultrastructure of the sperm principal piece revealed the typical 9 + 2 microtubular arrangement without any outer dense fibres. An unusual feature in both African and Rockhopper penguin spermatozoa was the occurrence of multiple axonemes contained in one plasmalemma in 4% of spermatozoa. These double, triple and quadruple axonemal arrangements have not been described previously albeit multiple tails were reported in other bird species. It is unclear whether such a unique structural feature will be of any advantage for sperm motility and might rather be a result of the absence of sperm competition. Multiple axonemes found in penguin flagella could be an apomorphism that distinguish them from other bird spermatozoa. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Throughout the animal kingdom, individual variation in reproductive success is commonly observed, even under similar environmental conditions. However, the mechanisms behind such differences remain unclear. The notion of behavioural consistency in animals has developed rapidly since the early 21st century partly as an approach to understand among-individual differences. In this context, a number of studies have highlighted the influence of pair assortment in personality on breeding success. In this study, we related breeding success to individual behaviour, specifically a risk-taking behaviour, and pair assortment per behaviour in African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) over two breeding seasons of contrasting food availability. On Bird Island, Algoa Bay, South Africa, we used indices of boldness and overall mobility in penguins’ nest defence behaviour as a response to a standard pedestrian approach during chick-rearing. These behaviours were consistent over the trials and indicated these traits may be related to personality in African penguins. Individuals were categorized as risk-prone (“bold,” “mobile”) or risk-averse (“shy,” “non-mobile”). We then assessed their breeding success through chick growth and survival over 4 weeks in 2015 and 2016. There was weak positive assortment of pairs in relation to nest defence behaviour. However, pair assortment did not significantly influence birds’ breeding success. Shy penguins were generally the most successful (had the highest chick growth rates), which was especially apparent during a food shortage in 2016, possibly reflecting a higher energy investment when foraging. In contrast, chicks from bold parents grew significantly slower, especially in 2016. Bold parents may defend their nest successfully against predation or intra-specific aggression when food is abundant, but when predation risks are limited and food availability is low, this strategy may not be beneficial. In the context of climate change, where food shortage events may become more frequent, risk-averse individuals may be favoured and genetic diversity may be reduced in African penguins. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

ABSTRACT: Variation in the phenology of avian taxa has long been studied to understand how aspecies reacts to environmental changes over both space and time. Penguins(Sphenicidae) serve as an important example of how biotic and abiotic factors influence certain stages of seabird phenology because of their large ranges and the extreme, dynamic conditions present in their Southern Ocean habitats. Here, weexamined the phenology of gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) and chinstrap penguins(Pygoscelis antarctica) at 17 sites across the Scotia arc, including the first documentedmonitoring of phenology on the South Sandwich Islands, to determine which breeding phases are intrinsic, or rather vary across a species range and between years. Weused a novel method to measure seabird breeding phenology and egg and chick survival: time-lapse cameras. Contrary to the long-standing theory that these phases areconsistent between colonies, we found that latitude and season had a predominantinfluence on the length of the nest establishment, incubation, and guard durations.We observe a trend toward longer incubation times occurring farther south, whereambient temperatures are colder, which may indicate that exposure to cold slowsembryo growth. Across species, in colonies located farther south, parents abandoned nests later when eggs were lost or chicks died and the latest record of eggs orchicks in the nest occurred earlier during the breeding period. The variation in bothspace and time observed in penguin phenology provides evidence that the durationof phases within the annual cycle of birds is not fundamental, or genetic, as previously understood. Additionally, the recorded phenology dates should inform fieldresearchers on the best timing to count colonies at the peak of breeding, which ispoorly understood. © 2018 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Individual foraging consistency is commonly seen in wild populations, even in species considered generalists and allows individuals to forage more efficiently. It may, therefore, have important consequences on ecological processes, for individuals and populations. Within seabirds, data on timescales over which consistency is maintained is lacking, despite its potential to determine how adaptable individuals and populations are to face environmental changes. Little penguins (Eudyptula minor) were tracked at two colonies in south-eastern Australia during 5 years, using GPS data loggers and dive recorders. This study investigated the presence of behavioural consistency, its persistence through time and the influence of extrinsic and intrinsic factors on behaviour and consistency. Individual consistency was compared between colonies, among consecutive foraging trips, among different breeding stages/clutches and years. Individuals showed high plasticity, with foraging metrics influenced by site, year, stage/clutch. Low to moderate short-term consistency in foraging metrics was highlighted, except for bearing. Over larger timescales, no consistency in these metrics was detected. Mass and morphology are known to influence foraging behaviour and consistency, but seemed not to affect behavioural consistency, which varied with year and site instead. This further highlights the plasticity of animals foraging on prey highly spatially and temporally variable in their distribution. We emphasize the importance of taking timescale into account when assessing behavioural consistency. Finally, mechanisms other than behavioural consistency seem to allow little penguins to find mobile food in the water column (e.g. group foraging, and switching from short to long trips at specific times of the breeding season). © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

ABSTRACT: Babesia spp. are tick-borne parasites, and 16 avian-infecting species have been described to date, including one species (Babesia peircei) that infects penguins. Considering the results of a recent study reporting Babesia sp. in penguins on Deception Island, South Shetland Islands, we re-examined the samples obtained in a previous investigation on the occurrence of blood parasites in adult Adélie (Pygoscelis adeliae), chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarcticus) and gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) on King George and Elephant islands, South Shetland Islands. Notwithstanding a comprehensive re-examination of the blood smears, Babesia sp. was not detected. When we employed two nested PCR tests targeting the 18S rRNA gene of Babesia, a considerable proportion of the samples produced positive results; however, gene sequencing revealed these were due to cross-amplification of non-target organisms. We therefore did not detect Babesia sp. infection in penguins on King George and Elephant islands. Additional studies will be valuable to clarify the distribution and epidemiology of tick-borne pathogens in sub-Antarctic and Antarctic seabirds. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: Avian aspergillosis presents a significant threat to captive penguin populations. Currently, a lack of objective prognostic factors limits disease staging, objective reassessment throughout treatment, comparative evaluation of treatment regimes, and appropriate timing of euthanasia. Objective: The study objective was to investigate absolute and relative plasma protein fractions by agarose gel electrophoresis (EPH) as predictors of survival in Gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua papua) under treatment for aspergillosis. Methods: One hundred and eighty-three EPH profiles from individual clinical cases were examined retrospectively. Animal survival to 90 days post sampling was established from clinical records; birds either survived (n = 146) or died within 90 days (n = 37), and time to death was recorded. Results: Fourteen variables showed statistically significant differences (P <.05) between surviving and dying birds. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified total albumin concentration (albumin + prealbumin) and albumin-to-globulin (A:G) ratio as having strongest discriminatory values (95% CI) at 0.788 (0.710–0.866) and 0.784 (0.696–0.871), respectively. Albumin (concentration and percentage of total protein) displayed moderate discriminatory value but additionally a weak positive correlation with time to death (95% CI); r =.353 (0.033–0.608) and.424 (0.116–0.658), respectively. Conclusions: Optimized test cutoffs for total albumins, albumin (concentration and percentage of total protein), and A:G ratio achieved moderate sensitivity and specificity, strong negative predictive values, but weak positive predictive values due to a low prevalence of death. Selection of appropriate test cutoff values may provide valuable adjunctive prognostic tools for clinical decision-making when the prognosis is difficult to assess clinically. © 2017 American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology

ABSTRACT: The Southern African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds facility near Cape Town, South Africa, receives ∼900 African Penguins (Spheniscus demersus) for rehabilitation every year. Data were analyzed from 3,657 adult African Penguins over a 12-yr period (2002–13), and multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate whether individual history and clinical parameters upon admission could predict the outcome of rehabilitation. Penguins admitted due to molt or debilitation were more likely to die during rehabilitation than those admitted due to oiling. Individuals admitted during summer and spring were more likely to die during rehabilitation than those admitted during winter. Penguins diagnosed with Plasmodium infection at some point during rehabilitation were more likely to die than those that were consistently negative, and no significant effect was found for other blood parasite infections. Penguins admitted with low body mass, low total plasma protein, or low hematocrit were more likely to die during rehabilitation than those with normal values. With regard to euthanasia, penguins admitted due to molt, debilitation, injury, or other causes and those admitted during spring or with low plasma protein were more likely to be euthanized. © 2018, © Wildlife Disease Association 2018.

ABSTRACT: Tyrosinase is a key rate-limiting enzyme in melanin synthesis. In this study, a new tyrosinase gene (Tyr) was identified from Pteria penguin and its effect on melanin synthesis was deliberated by RNA interference (RNAi). The cDNA of PpTyr was 1728 bp long, containing a 5′untranslated region (UTR) of 11 bp, a 3′UTR of 295 bp, and an open reading fragment of 1422 bp encoding 473 amino acids. Amino acid alignment showed PpTyr had the highest (50%) identity to tyrosinase-like protein 1 from Pinctada fucata. Phylogenetic tree analysis classified PpTyr into α-subclass of type-3 copper protein. Tissue expression analysis indicated that PpTyr was highly expressed in mantle, a nacre formation related tissue. After PpTyr RNA interference, PpTyr mRNA was significantly inhibited by 71.0% (P < 0.05). For other melanin-related genes, PpCreb2 and PpPax3 expression showed no significant change, but PpBcl2 was obviously increased. By liquid chromatograph-tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS) analysis, the total content of PDCA (pyrrole-2, 3-dicarboxylic acid) and PTCA (pyrrole-2,3,5-tricarboxylic acid), as main markers for eumelanin, was sharply decreased by 66.6% after PpTyr RNAi (P < 0.05). The percentage of PDCA was also obviously decreased from 20.1% to 13.9%. This indicated that tyrosinase played a key role in melanin synthesis and color formation of P. penguin. © 2018

ABSTRACT: Camera loggers are increasingly used to examine behavioural aspects of free-ranging animals. However, often video loggers are deployed with a focus on specific behavioural traits utilizing small cameras with a limited field of view, poor light performance and video quality. Yet rapid developments in consumer electronics provide new devices with much improved visual data allowing a wider scope for studies employing this novel methodology. We developed a camera logger that records full HD video through a wide-angle lens, providing high resolution footage with a greater field of view than other camera loggers. The main goal was to assess the suitability of this type of camera for the analysis of various aspects of the foraging ecology of a marine predator, the yellow-eyed penguin in New Zealand. Frame-by-frame analysis allowed accurate timing of prey pursuits and time spent over certain seafloor types. The recorded video footage showed that prey species were associated with certain seafloor types, revealed different predator evasion strategies by benthic fishes, and highlighted varying energetic consequences for penguins pursuing certain types of prey. Other aspects that could be analysed were the timing of breathing intervals between dives and observe exhalation events during prey pursuits, a previously undescribed behaviour. Screen overlays facilitated analysis of flipper angles and beat frequencies throughout various stages of the dive cycle. Flipper movement analysis confirmed decreasing effort during descent phases as the bird gained depth, and that ascent was principally passive. Breathing episodes between dives were short (<1 s) while the majority of the time was devoted to subsurface scanning with a submerged head. Video data recorded on free-ranging animals not only provide a wealth of information recorded from a single deployment but also necessitate new approaches with regards to analysis of visual data. Here, we demonstrate the diversity of information that can be gleaned from video logger data, if devices with high video resolution and wide field of view are utilized. Copyright 2018 Mattern et al.

ABSTRACT: Background: Historical factors, demography, reproduction and dispersal are crucial in determining the genetic structure of seabirds. In the Antarctic marine environment, penguins are a major component of the avian biomass, dominant predators and important bioindicators of ecological change. Populations of chinstrap penguins have decreased in nearly all their breeding sites, and their range is expanding throughout the Antarctic Peninsula. Population genetic structure of this species has been studied in some colonies, but not between breeding colonies in the Antarctic Peninsula or at the species' easternmost breeding colony (Bouvetøya). Results: Connectivity, sex-biased dispersal, diversity, genetic structure and demographic history were studied using 12 microsatellite loci and a mitochondrial DNA region (HVRI) in 12 breeding colonies in the South Shetland Islands (SSI) and the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), and one previously unstudied sub-Antarctic island, 3600 km away from the WAP (Bouvetøya). High genetic diversity, evidence of female bias-dispersal and a sign of population expansion after the last glacial maximum around 10,000 mya were detected. Limited population genetic structure and lack of isolation by distance throughout the region were found, along with no differentiation between the WAP and Bouvetøya (overall microsatellite F ST = 0.002, p = 0.273; mtDNA F ST = - 0.004, p = 0.766), indicating long distance dispersal. Therefore, genetic assignment tests could not assign individuals to their population(s) of origin. The most differentiated location was Georges Point, one of the southernmost breeding colonies of this species in the WAP. Conclusions: The subtle differentiation found may be explained by some combination of low natal philopatric behavior, high rates of dispersal and/or generally high mobility among colonies of chinstrap penguins compared to other Pygoscelis species. © 2018 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The King Penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus) is a pelagic seabird that breeds on Subantarctic islands and is considered a rare vagrant in South Africa. From 2001 to 2017, six King Penguins were rescued along the South African coast and admitted into rehabilitation centers. These and previous records of King Penguins were obtained near the country’s major ports, which suggests that some of these birds may have been ship-assisted. One of the King Penguins evaluated in this study died shortly after being admitted to the rehabilitation center due to extensive hemorrhage caused by a long-line fishing hook, and another had a beak wound consistent with fishing hook injury. Three King Penguins were infected with the tick-borne protozoan Babesia peircei and two died as a result of babesiosis. One King Penguin was diagnosed with an infection by Rickettsia-like organisms. Pox-like lesions, presumably mosquito-borne, developed on the eyelid skin of one penguin. Additionally, one of two King Penguins permanently captive in Cape Town during the same period also presented a lethal case of spirochetosis, which was possibly tick-borne. These novel records of vector-borne pathogens in King Penguins highlight the risk of seabird rehabilitation centers to serve as potential sources of pathogens to vagrant species, while also illustrating the opportunities that these centers provide for pathogen research and surveillance. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

ABSTRACT: Anthropogenic activity in Antarctica constitutes a continuous risk for the introduction of infectious diseases into indigenous wildlife populations. Penguin colonies living close to human settlements or inhabiting in areas considered for tourism could be facing a greater threat of infection. Fecal samples from Pygoscelis penguins (Pygoscelis spp.) were collected from different sites within Antarctic Peninsula and South Shetlands Islands in order to assess the presence of Salmonella enterica. Bacterial identification and characterization was performed applying biochemical and molecular techniques. Isolates were tested for antimicrobial resistance by the disk diffusion method, and PCR analyses were used for detection of resistance and virulence-associated genes. Four samples (1.74%) from P. papua were found to be positive to S. enterica serovar Enteritidis strains. All of them showed phenotypic antimicrobial resistance to at least three antimicrobials, and shared a similar gene profile through PCR. Results in this study urgently call for improvements in sanitary standards for waste disposal and sewage treatment in Antarctica. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report antimicrobial resistance in S. enterica isolated from Antarctic wild species. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

ABSTRACT: Two amoeboid organisms of the genera Sappinia Dangeard, 1896 and Rosculus Hawes, 1963 were identified in a sample containing king penguin guano. This sample, collected in the Subantarctic, enlarges the list of fecal habitats known for the presence of coprophilic amoebae. The two organisms were co-isolated and subcultured for over 6 mo, with continuous efforts being invested to separate each one from the mixed culture. In the mixed culture, Rosculus cells were fast growing, tolerated changes in culturing conditions, formed cysts, and evidently were attracted by Sappinia trophozoites. The separation of the Rosculus strain was accomplished, whereas the Sappinia strain remained intermixed with inseparable Rosculus cells. Sappinia cell populations were sensitive to changes in culturing conditions; they improved with reduction of Rosculus cells in the mixed culture. Thick-walled cysts, reportedly formed by Sappinia species, were not seen. The ultrastructure of both organisms was congruent with the currently accepted generic characteristics; however, some details were remarkable at the species level. Combined with the results of phylogenetic analyses, our findings indicate that the ultrastructure of the glycocalyx and the presence/absence of the Golgi apparatus in differential diagnoses of Sappinia species require a critical re-evaluation. © 2018 The Author(s) Journal of Eukaryotic Microbiology © 2018 International Society of Protistologists

ABSTRACT: A mycoplasma isolated from the liver of a dead Humboldt penguin (Spheniscus humboldti) and designated strain 56A97T, was investigated to determine its taxonomic status. Complete 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that the organism was most closely related to Mycoplasma gallisepticum and Mycoplasma imitans(99.7 and 99.9% similarity, respectively). The average DNA-DNA hybridization values between strain 56A97Tand M. gallisepticum and M. imitans were 39.5 and 30%, respectively and the Genome to Genome Distance Calculator gave results of 29.10 and 23.50%, respectively. The 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer was 72-73% similar to M. gallisepticum strains and 52.2% to M. imitans. A partial sequence of rpoB was 91.1-92% similar to M. gallisepticum strains and 84.7% to M. imitans. Colonies possessed a typical fried-egg appearance and electron micrographs revealed the lack of a cell wall and a nearly spherical morphology, with an electron-dense tip-like structure on some flask-shaped cells. The isolate required sterol for growth, fermented glucose, adsorbed and haemolysed erythrocytes, but did not hydrolyse arginine or urea. The strain was compared serologically against 110 previously described Mycoplasma reference strains, showing that, except for M. gallisepticum, strain 56A97Tis not related to any of the previously described species, although weak cross-reactions were evident. Genomic information, serological reactions and phenotypic properties demonstrate that this organism represents a novel species of the genus Mycoplasma, for which the name Mycoplasma tullyi sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is 56A97T(ATCC BAA-1432T, DSM 21909T, NCTC 11747T). © 2017 IUMS.

ABSTRACT: Emperor penguins Aptenodytes forsteri are important predators in the Ross Sea ecosystem, yet little is known about their movement and foraging behavior outside the breeding season or within different demographic groups. In early March 2013, we instrumented 20 non-breeding emperor penguins in the eastern Ross Sea with satellite-linked recorders and analyzed their habitat preference and dive behavior. Track length ranged from 273 km to nearly 9000 km and dive data were obtained for over 96 000 dives (mean maximum depth: 90.2 ± 77.8 (SD) m, mean dive duration: 4.6 ± 2.3 min), 17 of which exceeded the previous duration record of 27.6 min. Overall, emperor penguins preferred areas north of Cape Colbeck that were beyond the shelf break and received more sunlight. In these areas, penguins performed dives that were deeper, longer, faster, and more pelagic than dives located near the colony. Birds exhibited various movement and foraging strategies ('shelf' and 'gyre'; benthic and pelagic). The occurrence of deeper and longer dives during the day (n = 28 318) and at twilight (n = 60 171) than at night (n = 7582), especially at high latitudes, is consistent with emperor penguins being visual predators. Observed differences in both movement and dive behavior as a function of light may indicate a change in prey preference across space and time. Our study offers novel insight into the habitat preferences and dive behavior for a previously unstudied demographic group, at a time when emperor penguins experience the most severe environmental conditions of their annual life cycle. © 2018 Inter-Research.

ABSTRACT: Jellyfish and other pelagic gelatinous organisms (“gelata”) are increasingly perceived as an important component of marine food webs but remain poorly understood. Their importance as prey in the oceans is extremely difficult to quantify due in part to methodological challenges in verifying predation on gelatinous structures. Miniaturized animal-borne video data loggers now enable feeding events to be monitored from a predator's perspective. We gathered a substantial video dataset (over 350 hours of exploitable footage) from 106 individuals spanning four species of non-gelatinous-specialist predators (penguins), across regions of the southern oceans (areas south of 30°S). We documented nearly 200 cases of targeted attacks on carnivorous gelata by all four species, at all seven studied localities. Our findings emphasize that gelatinous organisms actually represent a widespread but currently under-represented trophic link across the southern oceans, even for endothermic predators, which have high energetic demands. The use of modern technological tools, such as animal-borne video data loggers, will help to correctly identify the ecological niche of gelata. © The Ecological Society of America

ABSTRACT: Sexual selection and social selection are two important theories proposed for explaining the evolution of colorful ornamental traits in animals. Understanding signal honesty requires studying how environmental and physiological factors during development influence the showy nature of sexual and social ornaments. We experimentally manipulated physiological stress and immunity status during the molt in adult king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus), and studied the consequences of our treatments on colourful ornaments (yellow-orange and UV beak spots and yellow-orange auricular feather patches) known to be used in sexual and social contexts in this species. Whereas some ornamental features showed strong condition-dependence (yellow auricular feather chroma, yellow and UV chroma of the beak), others were condition-independent and remained highly correlated before and after the molt (auricular patch size and beak UV hue). Our study provides a rare examination of the links between ornament determinism and selection processes in the wild. We highlight the coexistence of ornaments costly to produce that may be honest signals used in mate choice, and ornaments for which honesty may be enforced by social mediation or rely on genetic constraints. © 2017 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) typically prey on fish, cephalopods, and invertebrates. While other seal species also include penguins as part of their regular diet, such as leopard seals, this behavior seems unusual for Weddell seals. Here, we describe an opportunistic observation of a Weddell seal attacking and killing a Gentoo Penguin (Pygoscelis papua) at Neko Harbour, Antarctic Peninsula. This behavior has rarely been observed and published. Yet, we collected several additional anecdotal observations from various regions around Antarctica, indicating that this behavior might be more common than previously assumed, challenging our current understanding of Weddell seal foraging ecology. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Individual specialisations have been suggested to improve foraging efficiency by optimising individual capacity (physiological and behavioural) and reducing intra-specific competition in exploiting prey resources. In this study, we investigated the inter-and intra-individual variation in behaviour in an opportunistic forager, the gentoo penguin Pygoscelis papua, at Kerguelen Island, southern Indian Ocean. We used complementary bio-logging and stable isotope analyses, coupled with morphometric measurements, to: (1) determine the inter-individual variation in morphology and foraging behaviour; (2) quantify intra-individual variation in foraging behaviour; (3) investigate the links between consistency in foraging, distances travelled and body condition; and (4) determine if dietary specialisations exist and are maintained outside the breeding season. We show that this species exhibits a large inter-individual variation in foraging behaviour, with some individuals conducting very short trips close to the colony while others travelled considerably farther. Heavier individuals tended to forage in more distant locations, dive deeper and perform more benthic dives. Individual specialisation in behaviour was low to moderate at the population level, yet some individuals were very consistent. The rate of travel was not influenced by consistency, and there was a lack of correlation between body condition and foraging consistency. High inter-individual variation in feeding ecology and dietary specialisations outside of a single breeding season were observed, consistent with gentoo penguins being Type 'B' generalists (i.e. generalist populations composed of individuals each consuming a different range of foods).

ABSTRACT: We report the case of an adult African Penguin Spheniscus demersus with a supernumerary hindlimb. It was located between the left foot and the tail, and the penguin was able to move this third leg and foot as a response to being handled. However, the breadth of movement was very limited, and the leg was not functional. The bird had fully developed ovaries and was in good body condition, indicating the additional limb did not hinder survival to sexual maturity. © 2018, Marine Ornithology. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The identification and quantification of Antarctic Pygoscelis penguin colonies depends increasingly on recognition of the characteristic optical properties of guano deposits, but almost all knowledge of these properties until now has been compromised by resolution and atmospheric propagation effects. Here we present hyperspectral reflectance data in the range 350-2500 nm, collected in situ from fresh guano deposits in Pygoscelis penguin colonies on Signy Island, South Orkney Islands. The period of data collection included the transition from predominantly white guano to the pink coloration characteristic of a krill-rich diet. The main identifiable features in the spectra are a broad absorption feature centred around 550 nm, responsible for the pink coloration and identified with the pigment astaxanthin, as well as several water absorption features. Variations in these features are responsible for differentiation between spectra. From these results we propose two spectral indices suitable for use with satellite data, one of which responds to the presence of astaxanthin in the guano and the other to water. Our results do not allow us to differentiate between penguin species from their guano, but do suggest that the breeding phenology of Pygoscelis penguins could be determined from a time series of multispectral imagery. © Antarctic Science Ltd 2017.

ABSTRACT: Telomeres are noncoding genetic repeats protecting the ends of linear chromosomes. Long telomeres are often associated with high individual survival, and interindividual variation in telomere length has recently been proposed as a proxy for individual quality. Therefore, one might expect individuals of either sex with long telomeres to be of higher intrinsic quality and to be preferred in the context of mate choice. Thus, in sexually monomorphic species where individuals discriminate mates on the basis of signals of intrinsic quality, mate choice should lead to assortative pairing by telomere length, and it should be associated with breeding performance. We tested these two predictions in the King Penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus J.F. Miller, 1778), a sexually monomorphic seabird. Over 3 years of study and 73 penguin pairs under contrasting environmental conditions, we found strong assortative pairing by telomere length. Interestingly, only female telomere length was positively associated to chick survival up to fledging, and this relationship was only apparent when foraging conditions at sea were average. The positive link between telomere length and breeding success confirmed that telomere length is somehow related to individual biological state at a given time. The proximate mechanisms by which birds assess individual state related to telomere length remain to be discovered. © 2018, Canadian Science Publishing. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Penguins are an important indicator of marine ecosystem health and a major contributor of nutrients to terrestrial ecosystems in Antarctica. Their stomach microbiota is influenced by both the prey consumed and their foraging environment in the sea. As penguins feed at sea and breed on land, they might be expected to transfer microbes (e.g. prey-associated and marine bacteria) as well as nutrients from their stomachs while regurgitating food or in their guano to the surrounding terrestrial environment. However, most research attention to date has focused separately on the penguin gut microbiota (via cloacal/guano samples) and the terrestrial soil microbiota, and any relationship between them has yet to be established. Here, we analysed the bacterial communities in stomach regurgitates and cloacal swabs from the same individual birds, freshly deposited guano and rookery soils of two Pygoscelis penguins that breed sympatrically on Signy Island (South Orkney Islands, maritime Antarctic) using a high-throughput DNA sequencing method. Our data do not support the hypothesis that bacteria transferred from penguin guts and/or deposited guano make a significant contribution to the communities of the surrounding terrestrial microbial ecosystem. In both penguin species, composition of bacterial communities differed between the four sample types, with Jaccard similarities ranging between 10 and 36%. Assemblages of the dominant and co-occurring bacterial communities in rookery soils were either significantly negatively correlated or not correlated with the three other sample types. Sample-specific communities were also identified in this study, contributing around 63% of the identified diversity overall. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

ABSTRACT: Shells in pearl oysters are produced by the mantle which is also used as a graft in pearl operations. Here, we investigate the mantle structure of a new pearl oyster species of the Persian Gulf, Pinctada persica, and compare it to two other pearl-producing species, Pinctada radiata and Pteria penguin. The anterior, ventral and posterior segments of the mantle edge of each valve were fixed, and tissue sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin. A new pentachrome method and PAS-alcian blue staining were used to characterise the different mucosubstances. The mantle edges were found to have an outer, middle and inner fold, which have different morphology in each species. The mantle edge is lined by cuboidal and columnar epithelia, and interspersed among these epithelial cells we found mucous cells and cells that contained brown granules. The outer and middle folds of the two Pinctada species show different shapes to that of Pteria penguin. Most of the mucous cells in the mantle contain acidic mucosubstances and small amounts of mixed acidic-neutral mucosubstances were observed in the middle and inner fold of Pinctada persica. This study reveals that the mantle edges of the three species possess similar cellular structure, but vary in the shape of the folds. © 2017 The Malacological Society of Australasia and the Society for the Study of Molluscan Diversity.

ABSTRACT: Supraorbital salt-excreting glands are present in at least 10 avian orders and are largest in marine species, including penguins. Diseases of the avian salt gland have been described infrequently. From September 2015, five captive northern rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes moseleyi) were presented over a 6-wk period for unilateral or bilateral supraorbital swellings. In September 2016, two cases recurred and two additional cases were identified. Histopathology demonstrated salt gland adenitis with extensive squamous metaplasia. Blood plasma testing demonstrated marked vitamin A and E deficiencies within the colony. Prolonged frozen storage of feed-fish was implicated as a cause of vitamin depletion; reducing storage times and addition of dietary supplementation prevented recurrence. © Copyright 2018 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Nasal mites occur in different groups of birds, but little is known about their diversity associated with seabirds. The aim of this study was to verify the presence of nasal mites in the Magellanic Penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus), and to study their parasitological indices. For that purpose, the nasal cavity of 99 Magellanic Penguin found in the southern coast of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, was dissected and examined. Rhinonyssus sphenisci (Rhinonyssidae) occurred in 17 hosts (17.2%) with mean intensity of 11.52 mites/host. There were no significant differences in prevalence and mean intensity of infection between male and female hosts. Rhinonyssus sphenisci had already been reported in S. magellanicus; however, there had been no information on parasitological indices. Therefore, this study reported infection levels of R. sphenisci in S. magellanicus. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

ABSTRACT: Colonially-breeding seabirds have long served as indicator species for the health of the oceans on which they depend. Abundance and breeding data are repeatedly collected at fixed study sites in the hopes that changes in abundance and productivity may be useful for adaptive management of marine resources, but their suitability for this purpose is often unknown. To address this, we fit a Bayesian population dynamics model that includes process and observation error to all known Adélie penguin abundance data (1982-2015) in the Antarctic, covering >95% of their population globally. We find that process error exceeds observation error in this system, and that continent-wide "year effects" strongly influence population growth rates. Our findings have important implications for the use of Adélie penguins in Southern Ocean feedback management, and suggest that aggregating abundance across space provides the fastest reliable signal of true population change for species whose dynamics are driven by stochastic processes. © 2017 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Meloxicam is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that has been used orally and intramuscularly in numerous avian species, but not studied to date, in African penguins (Spheniscus demersus). The study describes the pharmacokinetic parameters of meloxicam after oral and intramuscular administration to African penguins. Several pilot studies were conducted initially where meloxicam (1, 0.5, and 0.25 mg/kg) was given intramuscularly to 4 birds, and orally (1 mg/kg) to 2 birds. Based on pilot study results, one group of 8 penguins was given meloxicam 0.5 mg/kg intramuscularly and one group of 8 penguins was given 1 mg/kg orally. Blood samples were collected at baseline and at 11 time intervals per group after administration of meloxicam. Meloxicam time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax), maximum concentration (Cmax), and half-life (t1/2) after intramuscular administration were 1.00 hour, 8.03 μg/mL, and 31.87 hours, respectively, while oral administration produced a Tmax, Cmax, and t1/2 of 12.00 hours, 10.84 μg/mL, and 28.59 hours, respectively. Based on plasma meloxicam concentrations found to be therapeutic in other bird species and humans, the recommended dosage and frequency for African penguins is 1 mg/kg orally every 48 hours and 0.5 mg/kg intramuscularly every 24 hours. Further studies are needed to determine the multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of meloxicam in African penguins. © 2018 by the Association of Avian Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Colour aberrations among wild birds are of long-time interest because they are uncommon, particularly in seabirds, although recent publications have revealed varying forms of aberrations in cormorants and penguins. In African Penguins Spheniscus demersus, there have been previous sightings of abnormal plumages, particularly in Algoa Bay, South Africa. This paper reveals new cases of plumage aberrations in African Penguins: leucism, “brown,” and phaeomelanism, all within Algoa Bay. While all aberrations seemed of natural origin, one in the shape of a number eight may have resulted from human actions. © 2018, Marine Ornithology. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Marine endotherms living in cold water face an energetically challenging situation. Unless properly insulated, these animals will lose heat rapidly. The field metabolic rate of king penguins at sea is about twice that on land. However, when at sea, their metabolic rate is higher during extended resting periods at the surface than during foraging, when birds descend to great depth in pursuit of their prey. This is most likely explained by differences in thermal status. During foraging, peripheral vasoconstriction leads to a hypothermic shell, which is rewarmed during extended resting bouts at the surface. Maintaining peripheral perfusion during rest in cold water, however, will greatly increase heat loss and, therefore, thermoregulatory costs. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain the maintenance of a normothermic shell during surface rest: (1) to help the unloading of N2 accumulated during diving; and (2) to allow the storage of fat in subcutaneous tissue, following the digestion of food. We tested the latter hypothesis by maintaining king penguins within a shallow seawater tank, while we recorded tissue temperature at four distinct sites. When king penguins were released into the tank during the day, their body temperature immediately declined. However, during the night, periodic rewarming of abdominal and peripheral tissues occurred, mimicking temperature patterns observed in the wild. Body temperatures, particularly in the flank, also depended on body condition and were higher in 'lean' birds (after 10 days of fasting) than in 'fat' birds. While not explicitly tested, our observation that nocturnal rewarming persists in the absence of diving activity during the day does not support the N2 unloading hypothesis. Rather, differences in temperature changes throughout the day and night, and the effect of body condition/mass supports the hypothesis that tissue perfusion during rest is required for nutritional needs. © 2017.

ABSTRACT: The Magellanic Penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) is native to Argentina, Chile, and the Falkland/Malvinas Islands, and is a regular winter migrant in Uruguayan and Brazilian coastal waters. The species is known to be susceptible to a variety of gastrointestinal nematodes, cestodes, trematodes, and acanthocephalans, as well as renal trematodes and pulmonary nematodes. Schistosomes (Platyhelminthes, Trematoda, Schistosomatidae) and microfilariae (Nematoda, Secernentea, Onchocercidae) were histologically identified in Magellanic Penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) that died while under care at rehabilitation centers in southern Brazil. Phylogenetic analysis of the COI gene, ITS-1 region, 5.8S rRNA gene, ITS-2 region, and 28S rRNA gene sequences of the schistosome revealed that it is closely related to, but distinct from, a schistosome reported from the African Penguin (Spheniscus demersus). The schistosomes from Magellanic and African Penguins were grouped with Gigantobilharzia huronensis, Gigantobilharzia melanoidis, and Dendritobilharzia pulvurenta; however, the lack of a clearly monophyletic origin precludes determining their genus. The incidental discovery of novel parasites during a study that did not specifically aim to investigate the occurrence of helminths underscores the value of histopathological examination as an exploratory diagnostic approach. © 2018 American Society of Parasitologists.

ABSTRACT: The vulnerability of seabirds related to their migratory dynamics is frequently linked to environmental problems along the migration path. In this context, Magellanic penguins (Sphenicus magellanicus) seem to be vulnerable to an extensive range of environmental disturbances during their northward migration along the Atlantic waters of South America, which include by catch, marine debris ingestion, overfishing and environmental contamination. In this study, we investigate mercury accumulation in muscle and hepatic tissues of juveniles penguins collected along the Brazilian coast during three migratory seasonal years (2006, 2008 and 2012) and three areas along a latitudinal gradient. We found significant differences in Hg levels across the years, with higher hepatic Hg levels found in tissues of penguins sampled in 2008. The higher Hg levels in samples of penguins from 2008 might be attributed to variations in body condition or Hg uptake, associated with the trophic imbalance linked to an extreme El Niño event during that year. Significant differences in Hg accumulation across the latitudinal areas were also observed. The penguins sampled at the farthest area from the breeding ground presented the higher levels of Hg and also the poorest body condition. Body condition and other traits may influence the levels of chemical pollutants and decrease the migratory success rate in the juvenile age phase, compromising population dynamics. Mercury levels in Magellanic penguins vary along the migratory path. © 2018

ABSTRACT: Lyme borreliosis (or Lyme Disease) is an emerging threat to human health in the Northern Hemisphere caused by tick-borne bacteria from the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl) complex. Seabirds are important reservoir hosts of some members of the Bbsl complex in the Northern Hemisphere, and some evidence suggests this may be true of penguins in the Southern Hemisphere. While the Bbsl complex has not been detected in Australia, a novel Borrelia species (‘Candidatus Borrelia tachyglossi’) was recently sequenced from native ticks (Ixodes holocyclus and Bothriocroton concolor) parasitising echidnas (Tachyglossus aculeatus), suggesting unidentified borreliae may be circulating amongst native wildlife and their ticks. In the present study, we investigated whether ticks parasitising little penguins (Eudyptula novaehollandiae) harbour native or introduced Borrelia bacteria. We chose this penguin species because it is heavily exploited by ticks during the breeding season, lives in close proximity to other potential reservoir hosts (including native wildlife and migratory seabirds), and is known to be infected with other tick-borne pathogens (Babesia). We screened over 230 penguin ticks (Ixodes spp.) from colonies in south-eastern Australia, and found no evidence of Borrelia DNA. The apparent absence or rarity of the bacterium in south-eastern Australia has important implications for identifying potential tick-borne pathogens in an understudied region. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH

ABSTRACT: Penguins are marine birds extremely well adapted to life in the sea but it is not rare to find lifeless individuals along the coast and deaths are caused by factors relating both to human influence on the environment and to specific diseases The aim of the present study was to identify parasite species found in Magellanic penguins on the coast of Espírito Santo, Brazil and describe the main gross findings. Five birds presented ectoparasites. All the birds presented nematodes. Four individuals presented trematodes. All the penguins presented a body state score of 2. Two of the individuals examined presented rupture of the esophagus caused by a foreign object and one individual presented a foreign object in the stomach. In the respiratory system, the lesions found were lung congestion, fibrin in the air sacs, caseous content inside the trachea, lung edema and pneumonia. Magellanic penguins on the coast of the state of Espírito Santo are susceptible to parasitoses. Helminths of the species Contracaecum pelagicum and Cardiocephaloides physaliswere identified, along with the ectoparasite Austrogoniodes bifasciatus. The main macroscopic lesions found were located in the respiratory system and gastrointestinal tract. © 2018 Universidade Federal do Parana.

ABSTRACT: Knowledge of the feeding ecology of a species at local level is fundamental to determine the relationship between the fluctuations in local marine resources and population dynamics of predators. In this study, we examined the diet of Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) during the crèche stage at the Stranger Point colony, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, over a 13-year period (2002/2003–2014/2015). Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) was the dominant prey for Adélie penguins during the crèche period (contribution: 100% of occurrence and >99.7% by mass). The fish component in the diet represented a small proportion of the total prey (contribution: from 4 to 24% of occurrence but <0.15% by mass). A marked inter-annual variability in the mass of stomach contents, the krill size consumed and the proportion of juvenile krill was observed. Moreover, a possible recruitment event of krill was recorded. A negative relationship between the size of krill in the diet and breeding success was found, suggesting that population dynamics of krill also reflected changes in the local availability of this crustacean. This work is the first long-term study of dietary parameters of Adélie penguins for the Stranger Point colony. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

ABSTRACT: Seabirds breeding on the Antarctic continent must cope with extreme changes in sea ice cover and day length throughout the year. Adélie penguins are expected to adjust their migratory movements and diving activity to seasonal changes in foraging conditions, but their winter diving activities have not been examined previously. Here, we tracked 18 and 5 Adélie penguins by using geolocators with and without depth sensors, from a colony in East Antarctica over 2 winter seasons. After breeding, all but one penguin migrated westward from March to April, then moved northward from May to August as the sea ice edge extended to the north, then moved southeastward, returning towards the breeding colony. Migratory movements followed sea ice movements and the seasonal extension in this region, which is influenced by the west-flowing Antarctic Slope Current and wind. Penguins dived deeper during winter, reaching a maximum depth of 129 m. The birds dived mostly between civil dawn and dusk, and tended to stay on ice overnight. Diving effort (total time spent underwater per day) did not decline with sea ice concentrations, suggesting that penguins found open water to dive even with >90% sea ice cover. Diving effort was lowest around the winter solstice, but was relatively high before and after the annual moult, and also before the start of breeding when birds presumably needed to accumulate body reserves. Our results highlight how the migratory movement and winter diving activity of Adélie penguins are closely associated with the seasonal polar environment. © Inter-Research 2018.

ABSTRACT: Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) may affect the immune system of seabirds, and some field studies have examined this effect. There are evidences that POPs cause negative effects on the immune system, but in Antarctic penguins data are scarce. In order to assess the risks that POPs may have on wild animals, some immunological studies constitute a good alternative. Determining the levels of immunoglobulins can deliver relevant information about the potential impact of POPs in seabirds from different environments. However, there are very few records in penguins so far. The aim of the present work was to quantify the concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (∑DDT), endosulfans, and immunoglobulin IgY in blood samples of colonies of chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica) that inhabit in the Antarctic Peninsula area. Analysis of POPs in blood samples was carried out through extraction with QuEChERS method, followed by gas chromatography. Detection of IgY concentrations was achieved by ELISA test, using anti-chicken antibodies. There was some significant correlation between immunoglobulin and the presence of PCBs and endosulfans. Even though the levels of these pollutants are low to cause any biological effect on the birds, the results are indicating some influence on the IgY concentrations in penguin blood. © Universidad Austral de Chile.

ABSTRACT: The relationships of the shell morphological traits, including the byssus dimensions, were recorded and analyzed in sample groups of 18- and 30-mo-old cultured winged pearl oysters, Pteria penguin. All relationships among shell dimensional traits with respect to shell height (SH) in the 18- and 30-mo-old oysters were observed to be positive and significant (P < 0.05). Although allometric growth was observed in both groups, the r2 values in the relationship between SH and total wet weight (TW) were higher in old oysters than in young ones. These findings indicate that weight in young oysters is heterogeneous. Moreover, the TW-SH ratio showed a clearer tendency to increase relative to exterior dimensions in old oysters. The r2 values in the correlation between SH and maximum dorso-ventral length were the highest in both oyster groups; hence, this dimension is a reliable predictor of SH. On the other hand, the relationships between SH and either hinge length or shell thickness were slightly weak in both age groups. Oysters with no byssus were found only in the younger group. It is possible that older oysters are less susceptible to factors that induce byssus shedding. In young oysters, the length and diameter of the byssus was closely related to the weight of the animal rather than the size of the shell. But, as individuals continued gaining weight, no augmentation in the byssus organ diameter was measured, suggesting a threshold for the byssus diameter in heavier oysters. Because it is possible that byssus size may influence the quality of pearls formed in the oyster due to the proximity of the pearl sac to the byssus root, it is important to consider the weight of the oysters selected or cultivated for pearl production, as this may indirectly affect the quality of the finished pearl product.

ABSTRACT: Negative eﬀects of ecotourism on wildlife are rising worldwide. Conservation physiology can play a major role in protecting wildlife by providing early alerts on changes in the status of individuals exposed to tourist activities. We measured an integrated set of immune and health-state indices to evaluate the eﬀects of ecotourism on Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus). We studied two reproductive colonies that diﬀered in the intensity of tourism and population trends: Punta Tombo (higher tourism intensity, declining population) and San Lorenzo (lower tourism intensity, growing population). Within each colony, we compared individuals from an area that was exposed to tourists and a control area where tourism was excluded. Adult penguins exposed to tourism at Punta Tombo, but not at San Lorenzo, showed physiological alterations indicative of chronic stress (higher heterophil to lymphocyte ratios) and parasitic infection (elevated heterophil and eosinophil counts). Penguin chicks exposed to tourism at Punta Tombo, but not at San Lorenzo, also showed physiological alterations indicative of poor immune and general-health condition: lower humoral innate immunity, haematocrit, and glucose levels and higher inﬂammatory responses likely due to increased prevalence of ﬂeas. Our results indicate that individuals of a declining population exposed to high levels of tourism express physiological indicators of chronic stress and poor health that could make adults and juveniles vulnerable to disease. These eﬀects are expressed despite a long history of exposure and behavioural habituation to human visitation. In contrast, individuals of a growing population exposed to more recent and lower levels of tourism showed no eﬀect. Our study demonstrates how a diverse physiological toolkit within a conservation physiology approach can provide important information for a better comprehension of anthropogenic eﬀects on wild animals in our changing world. © The Author 2018.

ABSTRACT: Avian Malaria is a vector borne disease caused by protozoan blood parasites of the genus Plasmodium, transmitted exclusively by mosquitoes (Culicidae) to a variety of birds. However, a few avian groups, including penguins (Sphenisciformes), are considered highly susceptible and may develop severe disease when exposed to these parasites. Clinical signs vary from asymptomatic presentation to per-acute mortality, depending on the susceptibility of the host species. Outbreaks in captive populations of penguins have often led to high morbidity and mortality rates. We describe an unusual prevalence of Avian Malaria caused by Plasmodium spp. in the adult population of Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) at an Israeli zoo between years 2012 and 2015. The laboratory diagnostic methods included screening for Plasmodium by blood or touch smears stained by Giemsa, nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and histopathology. During this period, 14 penguins were found dead while 8 of them (3 females, 5 males) were definitively diagnosed as malaria-positive. Some penguins were found dead without previous detected clinical signs, however, some of them presented with non-specific clinical signs such as weakness and anorexia. Most of the mortalities occurred in the summer months between June and August. The age range of those 8 malaria-positive penguins at death was between 2-12 years, with a mean and standard deviation of the mean of 7.2 ± 3.4 years. As malaria is considered usually a disease of young penguins up to three years of age, the unusual advanced age of infection, uncommon in zoos in Israel previously, is worth noting and should require the continuing monitoring for malaria as a significant cause of penguin mortality in Israeli’s zoos. © 2018, Israel Veterinary Medical Association.

ABSTRACT: Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) are responding to ocean-climate variability throughout the marine ecosystem of the western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) where some breeding colonies have declined by 80%. Nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers were used to understand historical population genetic structure and gene flow given relatively recent and continuing reductions in sea ice habitats and changes in numbers of breeding adults at colonies throughout the WAP. Genetic diversity, spatial genetic structure, genetic signatures of fluctuations in population demography and gene flow were assessed in four regional Adélie penguin colonies. The analyses indicated little genetic structure overall based on bi-parentally inherited microsatellite markers (F ST =-0.006-0.004). No significant variance was observed in overall haplotype frequency (mtDNA Φ ST =0.017; P=0.112). Some comparisons with Charcot Island were significant, suggestive of female-biased philopatry. Estimates of gene flow based on a two-population coalescent model were asymmetrical from the species' regional core to its northern range. Breeding Adélie penguins of the WAP are a panmictic population and hold adequate genetic diversity and dispersal capacity to be resilient to environmental change. © Antarctic Science Ltd 2017 Â.

ABSTRACT: The population history of the Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) and its response to climatic and environmental changes have been widely studied in maritime Antarctica and several glacial refugia of Adélie penguins were dated back to the Last Glacial Maximum. However, the process of colony expansion during the subsequent glacial-interglacial transition was less well-documented. In this paper, we investigate an ornithogenic core from Vestfold Hills, East Antarctica, to improve knowledge of postglacial penguin colonization. Local deglaciation occurred around 15.6 kyr BP, based on a coarse-grained detrital layer, a date that is earlier than most of those reported in other studies from the same region. Geochemical analysis of the core suggests penguins started colonizing the northern Vestfold Hills around 14.6 kyr BP, the oldest geological record in East Antarctica on penguin occupation, and their population exhibited a broadly increasing trend thereafter. The population expanded at approximately 6740 yr BP, in the mid-Holocene, which corresponds to a local climatic optimum. Although this inference is based on population changes of local sub-colonies, it corresponds well to reconstructions of regional climate change, and changes in the penguin population based on genetic studies. From a consideration of the results of previous studies of the occupation history of sea birds following deglaciation in the Arctic, as well as other parts of Antarctica, we propose that sea birds colonized the emerging ice-free areas shortly after local glacier retreat. Over geological time-scales, the availability of breeding habitat is a key factor controlling the population size and activity range of Antarctic Adélie penguins. © 2017

ABSTRACT: Mitochondria are the powerhouse of animal cells. They produce through oxidative phosphorylation more than 90% of the cellular energy (ATP) required for organism's growth, reproduction, and maintenance. Hence, information on mitochondrial function is expected to bring important insights in animal ecology and evolution. Unfortunately, the invasiveness of the procedures required to measure mitochondrial function (e.g. sampling of liver or muscles) has limited its study in wild vertebrate populations so far. Here, we capitalize on the fact that bird red blood cells (RBCs) possess functional mitochondria to describe a minimally invasive approach to study mitochondrial function, using blood samples. In the king penguin, we present a protocol, using a high-resolution respirometry system and specific agonists and antagonists enabling the assessment of mitochondrial function in RBCs. We evaluated the inter-assay repeatability of our measures of mitochondrial function, and tested the influence of sample storage and bird handling time on these measures. We also compared measures of mitochondrial function in RBCs and in the pectoral muscle obtained from the same individuals. Mitochondria from RBCs showed the expected responses to mitochondrial agonists and antagonists, and therefore the protocol presented allows computing effective measures of mitochondrial function. The different measures of RBC mitochondrial function were significantly repeatable, were not affected by the handling time of the bird prior to blood sampling (i.e. stress response), and only minimally affected by the storage time of the sample at 4 °C up to 24 h. Most notably, we showed that mitochondrial parameters measured in RBCs moderately correlated to those measured in the pectoral muscle. This study sheds light on the use of RBCs in birds as a valuable and minimally invasive source of information on mitochondrial function. This approach opens new opportunities to study mitochondrial function in free-living animals and could bring knowledge gains in ecology and evolution. Fish, amphibians and reptiles also possess mitochondria in their RBCs, and the approach presented here could also be applicable to these taxa. © 2016 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The use of biomimetic tandem flapping foils for ships and underwater vehicles is considered as a unique and interesting concept in the area of marine propulsion. The flapping wings can be used as a thrust producing, stabilizer and control devices which has both propulsion and maneuvering applications for marine vehicles. In the present study, the hydrodynamic performance of a pair of flexible flapping foils resembling penguin flippers is studied. A ship model of 3 m in length is fitted with a pair of counter flapping foils at its bottom mid-ship region. Model tests are carried out in a towing tank to estimate the propulsive performance of flapping foils in bollard and self propulsion modes. The same tests are performed in a numerical environment using a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software. The numerical and experimental results show reasonably good agreement in both bollard pull and self propulsion trials. The numerical studies are carried out on flexible flapping hydrofoil in unsteady conditions using moving unstructured grids. The efficiency and force coefficients of the flexible flapping foils are determined and presented as a function of Strouhal number. © 2017 Jilin University

ABSTRACT: In this paper, we report the complete mitochondrial genome of an Australian little penguin (Eudyptula minor novaehollandia). The mitogenome sequence has been found to be circular, and 17,608 bp in length. Similar to other Spheniscidae species, the genome encoded a typically conserved structure consisting of 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), two rRNA genes, and 22 tRNA genes, as well as all protein coding sequences started with methionine. The lengths of 12S ribosomal RNA and 16S ribosomal RNA were 977 bp and 1612 bp, respectively, and were located between tRNA-Phe and tRNA-Leu. The overall base composition of the mitogenome of E. minor novaehollandia had slightly higher AT (55.5%) content than GC (45.5%). The complete mitogenome sequence determined in this study would be useful to track the deeper evolutionary history and conservation of E. minor novaehollandia. © 2017, © 2017 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Studies of the at-sea distribution and trophic ecology of penguins are essential to understand their role in the broader marine food web. Magellanic Penguins Spheniscus magellanicus have a wide distribution and their foraging behaviour varies across breeding sites and between sexes, among others. In this study, we characterized the at-sea areas, the diving strategies and the relative trophic level of Magellanic Penguins breeding at Isla de los Estados, Argentina, during the early chick-rearing period. In addition, we quantified the interannual, sexual and individual variability in those parameters during three breeding seasons (2011–2013) using devices recording position and dive depth, and obtained blood samples for stable isotope analysis. During the early chick-rearing period, Magellanic Penguins showed small differences between the sexes in their foraging behaviour and large overlap in the at-sea areas used, suggesting no intraspecific variation between sexes. Although there was interannual variability in the foraging behaviour and the trophic level of the penguins, most of the studied nests managed successfully to raise both chicks during the first stage of the breeding cycle (guard stage). The foraging ecology of Magellanic Penguins from this colony was comparable with results of past studies at other breeding colonies. This study contributes to the identification of important at-sea areas for Magellanic Penguins at the southern edge of their distribution and also to the identification of possible threats in the study area such as interaction with fisheries. © 2017 British Ornithologists’ Union

ABSTRACT: The emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) is an iconic Antarctic species. George Robert Gray attributed the first description to Johann Reinhold Forster during James Cook's voyage of 1772-1775, attribution that persists to this day. Gray therefore honoured Forster in the emperor's scientific name - but he was almost certainly mistaken. Thaddeus von Bellingshausen in 1820 was probably the true first observer. Charles Wilkes in 1840 was next. James Clark Ross in 1841 made important observations and brought specimens home to the British Museum. Edward Wilson and others, in 1902-1903 and 1911 on the two expeditions of Robert F. Scott, discovered and investigated the first breeding colony, substantially advancing knowledge about this remarkable creature. © 2018 Cambridge University Press.

ABSTRACT: Taxonomic studies were carried out on a carotenoid-producing strain, designated WV39T, isolated from the faeces of Antarctic penguins. Cells of strain WV39T were Gram-stain-negative, strictly aerobic, yellow and rod-shaped. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strain WV39T was closely related to Flavobacterium qiangtangense JCM 19739T (96.3 % similarity), Flavobacterium noncentrifugens NBRC 108844T (95.5 %) and Flavobacterium aquatile LMG 4008T (94.9 %). The predominant cellular fatty acids were iso-C15: 0, iso-C15: 0 3-OH and summed feature 3 (comprising iso-C15: 0 2-OH and/or C16: 1!7c). Menaquinone-6 was the sole quinone identified, and the major pigment was zeaxanthin. The major polar lipid was phosphatidylethanolamine. DNA–DNA relatedness of strain WV39T with respect to its closest phylogenetic neighbours was 41.8 % for F. qiangtangense JCM 19739T, 25.5 % for F. aquatile LMG 4008T and 25.2 % for F. noncentrifugens NBRC 108844T. The DNA G+C content of strain WV39T was 39.8 mol%. Based on the phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic data, strain WV39T is concluded to represent a novel species of the genus Flavobacterium, for which the name Flavobacterium kingsejongi sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is WV39T (=KCTC 42908T=CECT 9085T). © 2018 IUMS.

ABSTRACT: Expansion of penguin activity in maritime Antarctica, under ice thaw, increases the chances of penguin feces affecting soil microbiomes. The detail of such effects begins to be revealed. By comparing soil geochemistry and microbiome composition inside (one site) and outside (three sites) of the rookery, we found significant effects of penguin feces on both. First, penguin feces change soil geochemistry, causing increased moisture content (MC) of ornithogenic soils and nutrients C, N, P, and Si in the rookery compared to non-rookery sites, but not pH. Second, penguin feces directly affect microbiome composition in the rookery, not those outside. Specifically, we found 4,364 operational taxonomical units (OTUs) in 404 genera in six main phyla: Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Bacteroidetes. Although the diversity is similar among the four sites, the composition is different. For example, penguin rookery has a lower abundance of Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Nitrospirae but a higher abundance of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Thermomicrobia. Strikingly, the family Clostridiaceae of Firmicutes of penguin-feces origin is most abundant in the rookery than non-rookery sites with two most abundant genera, Tissierella and Proteiniclasticum. Redundancy analysis showed all measured geochemical factors are significant in structuring microbiomes, with MC showing the highest correlation. We further extracted 21 subnetworks of microbes which contain 4,318 of the 4,364 OTUs using network analysis and are closely correlated with all geochemical factors except pH. Our finding f penguin feces, directly and indirectly, affects soil microbiome suggests an important role of penguins in soil geochemistry and microbiome structure of maritime Antarctica. © 2018 Guo, Wang, Li, Rosas, Zang, Ma, Liu, Han and Cao.

ABSTRACT: One of the notable features of penguin evolution is the occurrence of very large species in the early Cenozoic, whose body size greatly exceeded that of the largest extant penguins. Here we describe a new giant species from the late Paleocene of New Zealand that documents the very early evolution of large body size in penguins. Kumimanu biceae, n. gen. et sp. is larger than all other fossil penguins that have substantial skeletal portions preserved. Several plesiomorphic features place the new species outside a clade including all post-Paleocene giant penguins. It is phylogenetically separated from giant Eocene and Oligocene penguin species by various smaller taxa, which indicates multiple origins of giant size in penguin evolution. That a penguin rivaling the largest previously known species existed in the Paleocene suggests that gigantism in penguins arose shortly after these birds became flightless divers. Our study therefore strengthens previous suggestions that the absence of very large penguins today is likely due to the Oligo-Miocene radiation of marine mammals. © 2017 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Bird feathers have been proven to be reliable indicators of metal exposure originating from contaminated food and polluted environments. The concentrations of 15 essential and non-essential metals were investigated in African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) feathers from a Northwestern Italian zoological facility. These birds are exclusively fed with herring from the northeast Atlantic Ocean. Certain elements, such as Hg and Cd, reflected the bioaccumulation phenomena that occur through the marine food chain. The levels of Cr, Mn, and Ni were comparable to those registered in feathers of birds living in polluted areas. These results are important for comparative studies regarding the health, nutrition and welfare of endangered seabirds kept under human care. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Online news is an emerging channel where the internet users can get news. Analyzing huge volume of online news articles is a challenging one, because online news articles are generated and updated time to time. Big data techniques are used to tackle this problem. In order to classify the news articles into different categories, an approach based on Evolving Fuzzy Systems(EFS) was used. It categories news articles based on the changes in the content of the corresponding articles. However, it has the problem in the selection of threshold value. Moreover Gaussian membership function is used in EFS that describes the closeness to the prototype. Sometimes it is hard to justify. So in this paper, a Penguins Search Optimization Algorithm(PeSOA) is introduced to optimize the pruning threshold value and a bell shaped fuzzy membership function is introduced to define the closeness to the prototype. The optimized pruning threshold is used in term filtering which prune the generated terms based on their frequencies of occurrence throughout the collection. Then the fuzzy rules are generated by EFS where bell shaped fuzzy membership function is used to define the closeness to the prototype. Based on the fuzzy rules the online news articles are categorized. © 2018 D. Nithya, Dr. S. Sivakumari.

ABSTRACT: Madrynornis mirandus, one of the few fossil penguins known from a nearly complete articulated skeleton, represents a key taxon for understanding the stem-crown transition in penguins. Despite the wealth of morphological character data preserved in the holotype specimen, the phylogenetic placement of this early late Miocene taxon has remained controversial. Reexamination of the Madrynornis mirandus holotype provides support for placement within the penguin crown clade. However, this placement is highly sensitive to the molecular signal and Madrynornis falls just outside the crown clade when molecular data are excluded. The neuroanatomy of Madrynornis shares many derived features with extant penguins, including an airencephalic brain shape, highly reduced bulbus olfactorius, and absence of an interaural pathway. However, the brain endocast differs from all surveyed extant species in that the eminentia sagittalis (wulst) is less caudally expanded, the tectum opticus is relatively less developed, and the flocculus is stouter and more laterally disposed. The cranial osteology and reconstructed jaw myology of Madrynornis suggest a primarily piscivorous diet, which likely characterizes the clade uniting Madrynornis, Inguza, Eudyptula, and Spheniscus.

ABSTRACT: The penguin species Tasidyptes hunteri van Tets & O'Connor, 1983, the sole representative of an extinct penguin genus, was described on the basis of four bones excavated from a prehistoric midden on Tasmania's Hunter Island. Several authors have since questioned the validity of T. hunteri, citing the fragmentary nature of the remains and the similarity of some elements (coracoid and tarsometatarsus) to those of extant crested penguin (Eudyptes) species. We designed four overlapping primer pairs to amplify a 499 bp region of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 (COI) in penguins and used these to amplify and sequence COI from all known bones attributed to T. hunteri. The T. hunteri COI sequences were assessed within a phylogenetic framework against COI sequences for all extant penguin species. Our results reveal that the T. hunteri bones are an assemblage of remains from three extant penguin species (Eudyptes pachyrhynchus, E. robustus, Eudyptula novaehollandiae), and we find no molecular support for any of these bones representing an extinct penguin lineage. © 2017 The Linnean Society of London.

ABSTRACT: While dramatic increases in populations of King Penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) have been documented throughout their range, population changes on the island of South Georgia have not been assessed. We reconstructed time series of population size for six major colonies across South Georgia using historical data stretching back to 1883 and new population estimates derived from direct on-the-ground censuses and oblique, high-resolution digital photographs. We find evidence for a significant increase in the population of King Penguins at all colonies examined over the 124 years of available survey data. We discuss our findings in the context of four established hypotheses explaining King Penguin population growth: (1) favorable changes in the pelagic food web; (2) climate forcing; (3) greater availability of breeding habitat; and (4) the cessation of harvesting. While we do find evidence that glacial retreat may have increased suitable breeding habitat at some colonies and facilitated population expansion, glacial retreat is not associated with all of South Georgia’s growing populations. Local anomalies in sea surface temperature have increased in parallel with King Penguin population growth rate, suggesting that climate forcing may contribute to colony growth, but a complete explanation for the island’s rapidly growing King Penguin population remains unclear. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: In king penguin juveniles, the environmental transition from a terrestrial to a marine habitat, occurring at fledging, drastically stimulates lipid catabolism and the remodelling of muscle mitochondria to sustain extensive swimming activity and thermoregulation in the cold circumpolar oceans. However, the exact nature of these mechanisms remains only partially resolved. Here we investigated, in vitro, the uncoupling effect of increasing doses of fatty acids in pectoralis muscle intermyofibrillar mitochondria isolated, either from terrestrial never-immersed or experimentally cold water immersed pre-fledging king penguins or from sea-acclimatized fledged penguins. Mitochondria exhibited much greater palmitate-induced uncoupling respiration and higher maximal oxidative capacity after acclimatization to marine life. Such effects were not reproduced experimentally after repeated immersions in cold water, suggesting that the plasticity of mitochondrial characteristics may not be primarily driven by cold exposure per se but by other aspects of sea acclimatization. © 2017

ABSTRACT: The annual molt of Southern Rockhopper Penguins, Eudyptes chrysocome, usually takes place at their colonies after a pre-molting foraging trip. In 2016, an unusual number of Rockhopper Penguins was found molting, and in part subsequently dying, along the southernmost portion of the Argentine coast, far from the main colonies. To report the extent of this dispersion and mortality event, a survey was conducted between February and May 2016 along the southern Patagonian coast. A total of 1039 molting Rockhopper Penguins were reported. The mortality, mainly attributed to starvation, varied between 40 and 89%, according to sites. Furthermore, as adverse oceanographic conditions are known to affect prey availability and penguin’s survival, chlorophyll a concentrations (as a primary productivity index) and sea surface temperatures were analyzed at main foraging grounds. The results showed lower chlorophyll a and sea surface temperature values close to the main colonies during 2016 (compared to average 2003–2015). Although these values alone cannot explain such mortality (as similar low values already occurred in some of the previous year without inducing mortality events), our results support the hypothesis of a reduction in primary productivity close to the main colonies prior to the molt, inducing penguins to move towards more distant foraging grounds, which finally led them to molt later and away from their colonies. Although the oceanographic processes were not fully understood, this event highlights the serious effects that unusual conditions prior to molting can pose on the survival of this endangered penguin, in a context of climate variability. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Range shift is the primary short-term species response to rapid climate change, but it is often hampered by natural or anthropogenic habitat fragmentation. Different critical areas of a species' niche may be exposed to heterogeneous environmental changes and modelling species response under such complex spatial and ecological scenarios presents well-known challenges. Here, we use a biophysical ecological niche model validated through population genomics and palaeodemography to reconstruct past range shifts and identify future vulnerable areas and potential refugia of the king penguin in the Southern Ocean. Integrating genomic and demographic data at the whole-species level with specific biophysical constraints, we present a refined framework for predicting the effect of climate change on species relying on spatially and ecologically distinct areas to complete their life cycle (for example, migratory animals, marine pelagic organisms and central-place foragers) and, in general, on species living in fragmented ecosystems. © 2018 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Nest usurpation is a relatively common phenomenon in birds but remains poorly documented in penguins. This behaviour may advantage bolder and aggressive individuals and influence population dynamics by affecting breeding success. African Penguins Spheniscus demersus are aggressive towards conspecifics during the breeding season when competing for territory. However, nest usurpation is rarely observed in this species. We describe three records of nest usurpation in African Penguins from Bird Island, Algoa Bay (South Africa) in 2017. After a climate-related massive breeding failure, late breeders in search of a territory attacked occupants of earlier-breeding nests, sometimes leading to the death of their brood. These observations may be the consequence of an extreme weather event, which created a marked asynchrony in breeding stages in this specific year, with many birds tending chicks, while others were just beginning to look for territories. This mismatch provided the opportunity for particularly aggressive individuals to decrease the breeding output of less aggressive birds, thereby possibly influencing the species’ population dynamics. © 2018, Marine Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: Long-term photographic recordings of animal populations provide unique insights into ecological and evolutionary processes. However, image acquisition at remote locations under harsh climatic conditions is highly challenging. We present a robust, energetically self-sufficient and remote-controlled observatory designed to operate year-round in the Antarctic at temperatures below −50°C and wind speeds above 150 km/h. The observatory is equipped with multiple overview cameras and a high resolution steerable camera with a telephoto lens for capturing images with high spatial and temporal resolution. Our observatory has been in operation since 2013 to investigate an emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) colony at Atka Bay near the German Neumayer III research station. Data recorded by this observatory give novel biological insights in animal life cycle and demographic trends, but also in collective and individual behaviour. As an example, we present data showing how wind speed and direction influence movements of the entire colony and of individual penguins. We also estimate daily fluctuations in the total number of individuals present at the breeding site. Our results demonstrate that remote-controlled observation systems can bridge the gap between remote sensing, simple time-lapse recording setups, and on-site observations by human investigators to collect unique biological datasets of undisturbed animal populations. © 2018 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Hematology and serum biochemistry reference values are essential for health evaluation and disease diagnosis in penguins. However, there are currently no published physiological values for captive Adélie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and Chinstrap penguins (P. antarcticus), nor for wild or captive Macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus). The present study is the first investigation regarding hematology and serum biochemistry reference values for captive Adélie, Gentoo (P. papua), Chinstrap, and Macaroni penguins in Asia. Fixed effect models for repeated measure were applied to determine the influence of penguin species, age, gender, and age-gender interaction on each blood parameter. Hematology and serum biochemical data from 122 apparently healthy penguins (24 Adélie, 38 Chinstrap, 46 Gentoo, and 14 Macaroni) were collected between 2009 and 2014. The effects of penguin species were observed for most blood parameters, except total bilirubin, creatine kinase (CK), creatinine, and potassium ion (K+). Values of mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), heterophil, ratio of heterophils to lymphocytes (H/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and chloride ion (Cl-) had significant positive correlation with age, while significant negative correlation with age was observed in total red blood cells (RBCs), lymphocytes, thrombocytes, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), CK, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and plasma iron. Compared to male penguins, females had lower mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) but higher calcium ion (Ca2+) values. As for age-gender interaction, significant positive correlation was shown in MCHC and K+, and the reverse was true in H/L ratio. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Most animals experience periods of unfavourable conditions, challenging their daily energy balance. During breeding, king penguins fast voluntarily for up to 1.5 months in the colony, after which they replenish their energy stores at sea. However, at sea, birds might encounter periods of low foraging profitability, forcing them to draw from previously stored energy (e.g. subcutaneous fat). Accessing peripheral fat stores requires perfusion, increasing heat loss and thermoregulatory costs. Hence, howthese birds balance the conflicting demands of nutritional needs and thermoregulation is unclear. We investigated the physiological responses of king penguins to fasting in cold water by: (1) monitoring tissue temperatures, as a proxy of tissue perfusion, at four distinct sites (deep and peripheral); and (2) recording their oxygen consumption rate while birds floated inside a water tank. Despite frequent oscillations, temperatures of all tissues often reached near-normothermic levels, indicating that birds maintained perfusion to peripheral tissues throughout their fasting period in water. The oxygen consumption rate of birds increased with fasting duration inwater, while it was also higher when the flank tissue was warmer, indicating greater perfusion. Hence, fasting king penguins in water maintained peripheral perfusion, despite the associated greater heat loss and, therefore, thermoregulatory costs, probably to access subcutaneous fat stores. Hence, the observed normothermia in peripheral tissues of king penguins at sea, upon completion of a foraging bout, is likely explained by their nutritional needs: depositing free fatty acids (FFA) in subcutaneous tissues after profitable foraging or mobilizing FFA to fuel metabolism when foraging success was insufficient © 2017.

ABSTRACT: Background: Mitochondria play a key role in the balance of energy and heat production, and therefore the mitochondrial genome is under natural selection by environmental temperature and food availability, since starvation can generate more efficient coupling of energy production. However, selection over mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genes has usually been evaluated at the population level. We sequenced by NGS 12 mitogenomes and with four published genomes, assessed genetic variation in ten penguin species distributed from the equator to Antarctica. Signatures of selection of 13 mitochondrial protein-coding genes were evaluated by comparing among species within and among genera (Spheniscus, Pygoscelis, Eudyptula, Eudyptes and Aptenodytes). The genetic data were correlated with environmental data obtained through remote sensing (sea surface temperature [SST], chlorophyll levels [Chl] and a combination of SST and Chl [COM]) through the distribution of these species. Results: We identified the complete mtDNA genomes of several penguin species, including ND6 and 8 tRNAs on the light strand and 12 protein coding genes, 14 tRNAs and two rRNAs positioned on the heavy strand. The highest diversity was found in NADH dehydrogenase genes and the lowest in COX genes. The lowest evolutionary divergence among species was between Humboldt (Spheniscus humboldti) and Galapagos (S. mendiculus) penguins (0.004), while the highest was observed between little penguin (Eudyptula minor) and Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) (0.097). We identified a signature of purifying selection (Ka/Ks < 1) across the mitochondrial genome, which is consistent with the hypothesis that purifying selection is constraining mitogenome evolution to maintain Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) proteins and functionality. Pairwise species maximum-likelihood analyses of selection at codon sites suggest positive selection has occurred on ATP8 (Fixed-Effects Likelihood, FEL) and ND4 (Single Likelihood Ancestral Counting, SLAC) in all penguins. In contrast, COX1 had a signature of strong negative selection. ND4 Ka/Ks ratios were highly correlated with SST (Mantel, p-value: 0.0001; GLM, p-value: 0.00001) and thus may be related to climate adaptation throughout penguin speciation. Conclusions: These results identify mtDNA candidate genes under selection which could be involved in broad-scale adaptations of penguins to their environment. Such knowledge may be particularly useful for developing predictive models of how these species may respond to severe climatic changes in the future. © 2018 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: All species should invest in systems that enhance longevity; however, a fundamental adult life-history trade-off exists between the metabolic resources allocated to maintenance and those allocated to reproduction. Long-lived species will invest more in reproduction than in somatic maintenance as they age. We investigated this trade-off by analyzing correlations among telomere length, reproductive effort and output, and basal corticosterone in Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus). Telomeres shorten with age in most species studied to date, and may affect adult survival. High basal corticosterone is indicative of stressful conditions. Corticosterone, and stress, has been linked to telomere shortening in other species. Magellanic penguins are a particularly good model organism for this question as they are an unusually long-lived species, exceeding their mass-adjusted predicted lifespan by 26%. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found adults aged 5 years to over 24 years of age had similar telomere lengths. Telomeres of adults did not shorten over a 3-year period, regardless of the age of the individual. Neither telomere length, nor the rate at which the telomeres changed over these 3 years, correlated with breeding frequency or investment. Older females also produced larger volume clutches until approximately 15 years old and larger eggs produced heavier fledglings. Furthermore, reproductive success (chicks fledged/eggs laid) is maintained as females aged. Basal corticosterone, however, was not correlated with telomere length in adults and suggests that low basal corticosterone may play a role in the telomere maintenance we observed. Basal corticosterone also declined during the breeding season and was positively correlated with the age of adult penguins. This higher basal corticosterone in older individuals, and consistent reproductive success, supports the prediction that Magellanic penguins invest more in reproduction as they age. Our results demonstrate that telomere maintenance may be a component of longevity even with increased reproductive effort, investment, and basal corticosterone. © 2017 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: King penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) have a circum-subantarctic range though recently, pairs breeding in Antarctica were reported. In a scenario of environmental variability as it is recorded in Antarctic Peninsula and adjacent islands, one ecological response registered in penguins was the shift in its distribution and breeding range probably due to the increment in the areas available to breed and/or feed. In the 2014–2015 season, the first king penguin chick was registered at Stranger Point (62°S. 25 de Mayo/King George Island), which remained alive until 5 months old. This record represents the southernmost birth of this species and the fourth consecutive breeding attempts in this site. This provides further evidence of a possible consolidation of a new breeding site at South Shetland Islands and thus the southward expansion of the bio-geographic range. Moreover, it suggests that both terrestrial and marine environmental conditions were favourable for king penguins, at least until the beginning of the crèche stage. Nevertheless, an increase in the number of breeding pairs is essential to ensure the survival of chicks and enable the colonization. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Predicting population responses in changing environments is an important task for ecologists. In polar regions, climate warming, loss of sea ice, and more frequent anomalous events suggest that further reductions in ice-dependent animal populations are likely. We assess the risk of near-term (30-year) depletion of an Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) population with a stochastic matrix model parameterized with 30 yr (1982-2011) of data from the Copacabana colony on King George Island, Antarctica. The model was fitted to nest census data by estimating correction factors for survival rates estimated from a multi-state mark-recapture model. We modeled future survival and fecundity scenarios during the projection period (2012-2041) based on a two-state Markov chain that randomly assigned survival rates and reproductive success from their respective historical distributions to represent "good" and "poor" years. Monte Carlo simulation was used to estimate population trajectories across a range of progressively worse survival conditions. The results suggest that, given historical distributions of survival and reproductive success, a limited scope for recovery of the population is present, commensurate with recent stabilization in population size at the study site. However, our projections mainly suggest that the Adélie penguin population will decline if the frequency of years with poor survival remains at, or increases above, its 30-year mean. The risk of local depletion within 30 yr, defined according to International Union for Conservation of Nature categories for endangered and critically endangered species, was 33% for >90% declines, but near 100% for 50% declines given status-quo conditions. As survival conditions worsen, the risk of substantive depletions rose rapidly. Given expectations of further environmental and ecosystem changes in the northern Antarctic Peninsula region, continued declines in Adélie penguin population size at the northern extent of their range should be expected. © 2017 Hinke et al.

ABSTRACT: In the present study, the first outbreak of a penguinpox virus (PPV) in Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) and four outbreaks of fowlpox virus (FPV) in layer chickens are reported. Clinically, cutaneous wart-like growths were observed around the eyes in four juvenile Humboldt penguins and cutaneous nodular lesions in the comb, wattles, around the eyes and other unfeathered skin parts of layer chickens. Histopathology (FPV and PPV), electron microscopy (PPV), virus isolation (FPV) and PCR amplification (FPV and PPV) confirmed that both isolates were avipoxviruses (APVs). According to the phylogenetic analysis of the partial P4b core protein gene, the Belgian Humboldt PPV clustered with sequences of free-range (domestic and synanthrope bird species) and wild bird species of the United States and Europe (99 - 100% homology), and all four Belgian FPV isolates clustered with FPV isolates of chickens, turkeys, canary and FPV attenuated live vaccines from all over the world (100% homology).

ABSTRACT: We quantified the trophic niche of Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) breeding and moulting in Golfo San Jorge, Argentina, through conventional stomach content and stable isotope analysis. A total of 112 adults were flushed during the early and late chick stages of 2011 and 2012 at Isla Vernacci Norte, and at least 15 prey taxa were found, including fishes, cephalopods, crustaceans and polychaetes. Overall, Argentine anchovy (Engraulis anchoita) showed the highest contribution in terms of importance by mass (68.1–85.3%, depending on chick stage and year), except for the old chick stage in 2011 when the shortfin squid (Illex argentinus) was the main prey consumed (56.0%). Based on carbon and nitrogen isotopic values from a total of 256 blood samples, corresponding to young and old chicks and to adults of both sexes sampled throughout the incubation, chick and moult stages at the above mentioned colony and years, Bayesian mixing model outputs showed that Argentine anchovy was always the main prey (48–86%). Bayesian mixing model outputs obtained from adults of both sexes and their chicks during the late chick stage of 2013 at Isla Vernacci Norte, Isla Tova and Isla Leones also showed that Argentine anchovy was the main prey consumed. This is the first comprehensive assessment of Magellanic penguin diet composition in northern Patagonia, quantifying the relative contribution of prey in the diet of adults and chicks at different stages of the annual cycle and years, and confirms the relevance of a forage fish such as the Argentine anchovy in its trophic ecology. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Tarsometatarsi are key skeletal elements in penguin palaeontology. They constitute, among others, type specimens of all 10 widely accepted species of fossil penguins from the Eocene La Meseta Formation on Seymour Island (Graham Land, Antarctic Peninsula). Here, we report on a recently collected large-sized tarsometatarsus from this formation that represents a new morphotype. We are convinced that the morphotype corresponds to a new species, but the material is too scarce for a taxonomic act. Undoubtedly, the bone discussed here is a valuable addition to our knowledge on diversity of early penguins. © 2017 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: We describe leg bones of a giant penguin from the mid-Paleocene Waipara Greensand of New Zealand. The specimens were found at the type locality of Waimanu manneringi and together with this species they constitute the oldest penguin fossils known to date. Tarsometatarsus dimensions indicate a species that reached the size of Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi, one of the largest known penguin species. Stem group penguins therefore attained a giant size very early in their evolution, with this gigantism existing for more than 30 million years. The new fossils are from a species that is phylogenetically more derived than Waimanu, and the unexpected coexistence of Waimanu with more derived stem group Sphenisciformes documents a previously unknown diversity amongst the world’s oldest penguins. The characteristic tarsometatarsus shape of penguins evolved early on, and the significant morphological disparity between Waimanu and the new fossil conflicts with recent Paleocene divergence estimates for penguins, suggesting an older, Late Cretaceous, origin. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: For all species, finite metabolic resources must be allocated toward three competing systems: maintenance, reproduction, and growth. Telomeres, the nucleoprotein tips of chromosomes, which shorten with age in most species, are correlated with increased survival. Chick growth is energetically costly and is associated with telomere shortening in most species. To assess the change in telomeres in penguin chicks, we quantified change in telomere length of wild known-age Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) chicks every 15 days during the species' growth period, from hatching to 60 days-of-age. Magellanic penguins continue to grow after fledging so we also sampled a set of 1-year-old juvenile penguins, and adults aged 5 years. Telomeres were significantly shorter on day 15 than on hatch day but returned to their initial length by 30 days old and remained at that length through 60 days of age. The length of telomeres of newly hatched chicks, chicks aged 30, 45 and 60 days, juveniles, and adults aged 5 years were similar. Chicks that fledged and those that died had similar telomere lengths. We show that while telomeres shorten during growth, Magellanic penguins elongate telomeres to their length at hatch, which may increase adult life span and reproductive opportunities.

ABSTRACT: Changes in penguin populations on the Antarctic Peninsula have been linked to several environmental factors, but the potentially devastating impact of volcanic activity has not been considered. Here we use detailed biogeochemical analyses to track past penguin colony change over the last 8,500 years on Ardley Island, home to one of the Antarctic Peninsula's largest breeding populations of gentoo penguins. The first sustained penguin colony was established on Ardley Island c. 6,700 years ago, pre-dating sub-fossil evidence of Peninsula-wide occupation by c. 1,000 years. The colony experienced five population maxima during the Holocene. Overall, we find no consistent relationships with local-regional atmospheric and ocean temperatures or sea-ice conditions, although the colony population maximum, c. 4,000-3,000 years ago, corresponds with regionally elevated temperatures. Instead, at least three of the five phases of penguin colony expansion were abruptly ended by large eruptions from the Deception Island volcano, resulting in near-complete local extinction of the colony, with, on average, 400-800 years required for sustainable recovery. © 2017 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Gaze following is widespread among animals. However, the corresponding ultimate functions may vary substantially. Thus, it is important to study previously understudied (or less studied) species to develop a better understanding of the ecological contexts that foster certain cognitive traits. Penguins (Family Spheniscidae), despite their wide interspecies ecological variation, have previously not been considered for cross-species comparisons. Penguin behaviour and communication have been investigated over the last decades, but less is known on how groups are structured, social hierarchies are established, and coordination for hunting and predator avoidance may occur. In this article, we investigated how African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) respond to gaze cues of conspeciﬁcs using a naturalistic setup in a zoo environment. Our results provide evidence that members of the family Spheniscidae follow gaze of conspeciﬁcs into distant space. However, further tests are necessary to examine if the observed behaviour serves solely one speciﬁc function (e.g. predator detection) or is displayed in a broader context (e.g. eavesdropping on relevant stimuli in the environment). In addition, our ﬁndings can serve as a starting point for future cross-species comparisons with other members of the penguin family, to further explore the role of aerial predation and social structure on gaze following in social species. Overall, we also suggest that zoo-housed animals represent an ideal opportunity to extend species range and to test phylogenetic families that have not been in the focus of animal cognitive research. © 2017 Nawroth et al.

ABSTRACT: Antarctica and the Southern Ocean are increasingly affected by fisheries, climate change and human presence. Antarctic seabirds are vulnerable to all these threats because they depend on terrestrial and marine environments to breed and forage. We assess the current distribution and total abundance of Adélie penguins in East Antarctica and find there are 3.5 (95% CI 2.9–4.2) million individuals of breeding age along the East Antarctic coastline and 5.9 (4.2–7.7) million individuals foraging in the adjacent ocean after the breeding season. One third of the breeding population numbering over 1 million individuals breed within 10 km of research stations, highlighting the potential for human activities to impact Adélie penguin populations despite their current high abundance. The 16 Antarctic Specially Protected Areas currently designated in East Antarctica offer protection to breeding populations close to stations in four of six regional populations. The East Antarctic breeding population consumes an average of 193 500 tonnes of krill and 18 800 tonnes of fish during a breeding season, with consumption peaking at the end of the breeding season. These findings can inform future conservation management decisions in the terrestrial environment under the Protocol on Environmental Protection to develop a systematic network of protected areas, and in the marine environment under the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources to allow the consumption needs of Adélie penguins to be taken into account when setting fishery catch limits. Extending this work to other penguin, flying seabird, seal and whale species is a priority for conservation management in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. © 2016 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Modeling metapopulation dynamics is potentially a useful and powerful tool for ecologists and conservation biologists. However, the key processes driving metapopulation dynamics are colonization and extinction events, which are notoriously difficult to study. A recent global assessment of Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) breeding populations reported multiple potential colonization and extinction events from occupancy observations using recent high-resolution satellite imagery and examination of historical occupancy literature, but emphasized that the events should be confirmed with direct observations. We evaluated these conclusions by developing a comprehensive database of direct observations of Adelie Penguin breeding site occupancy across East Antarctica. The database allowed 16 of 19 proposed colonization and extinction events in this region to be evaluated using direct observations that were concurrent in space and time (same breeding season) with observations from satellite imagery. We concluded that none of the 16 proposed colonization and extinction events had occurred. One true extinction event may have been correctly identified from satellite imagery, but a conclusive evaluation was not possible because the direct and satellite observations were not concurrent in time. The evaluation identified several sources of error in observations from satellite imagery, including errors of omission through failure to detect small colonies and errors of commission through misidentification of other biological and physical features as Adelie Penguin guano. The occupancy database corrected issues of poor precision and accuracy in locations of historical occupancy data. Our results improve understanding of key parameters for Adelie Penguin metapopulation dynamics and facilitate improved interpretation of satellite imagery in the future.

ABSTRACT: Climate change and fisheries are transforming the oceans, but we lack a complete understanding of their ecological impact [1–3]. Environmental degradation can cause maladaptive habitat selection, inducing ecological traps with profound consequences for biodiversity [4–6]. However, whether ecological traps operate in marine systems is unclear [7]. Large marine vertebrates may be vulnerable to ecological traps [6], but their broad-scale movements and complex life histories obscure the population-level consequences of habitat selection [8, 9]. We satellite tracked postnatal dispersal in African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) from eight sites across their breeding range to test whether they have become ecologically trapped in the degraded Benguela ecosystem. Bayesian state-space and habitat models show that penguins traversed thousands of square kilometers to areas of low sea surface temperatures (14.5°C–17.5°C) and high chlorophyll-a (∼11 mg m−3). These were once reliable cues for prey-rich waters, but climate change and industrial fishing have depleted forage fish stocks in this system [10, 11]. Juvenile penguin survival is low in populations selecting degraded areas, and Bayesian projection models suggest that breeding numbers are ∼50% lower than if non-impacted habitats were used, revealing the extent and effect of a marine ecological trap for the first time. These cascading impacts of localized forage fish depletion—unobserved in studies on adults—were only elucidated via broad-scale movement and demographic data on juveniles. Our results support suspending fishing when prey biomass drops below critical thresholds [12, 13] and suggest that mitigation of marine ecological traps will require matching conservation action to the scale of ecological processes [14]. © 2017 The Authors

ABSTRACT: To help meet the high energy demands of raising the young, some seabirds alternate between short, frequent foraging trips to maximize food delivery to the young, and infrequent, long foraging trips that serve towards self-maintenance. Our study is the first to investigate the foraging behaviour of gentoo penguins at Marion Island, which we did through a combined use of GPS loggers and time-depth recorders. The shallow shelf between Marion and Prince Edward Islands proved to be an important foraging area, and penguins exploited this area using a novel foraging strategy. Penguins undertook alternating trips of relatively short and long durations. Short trips, performed in the afternoon, were likely associated with self-maintenance as they were followed by roosting on the beach overnight and not returning to the colony. They were followed by longer and more distant foraging trips, after which birds returned to the colony to provision chicks. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate alternating trip lengths in gentoo penguins and the first to associate short trips with self-maintenance in seabirds. We suggest that due to the close proximity of a predictable foraging area for these penguins at Marion Island, there is minimal energetic cost to return to land after self-provisioning. Hence, unlike other seabirds that feed at greater distances from their breeding colonies, gentoo penguins are afforded the opportunity for short self-maintenance trips. Finally, we argue that these birds may be using this novel strategy due to sub-optimal feeding conditions resulting from environmental change. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: The aim of the present work is to determine the presence of isomers like αHCH, βHCH, γHCH, 4.4'DDE, 4.4'DDD and 4.4'DDT that compound both the commercial forms of insecticides HCH (Lindane) and DDT in moulting feathers of two Pygoscelidae penguin species, Pygoscelis antarctica and Pygoscelis papua, from Livingston and Peterman Islands, Western Antarctica. The analyses of the total quantity of the chosen chlorinated pesticides (ΣHCH and ΣDDT) shows significant differences between DDT and HCH concentrations, with quantities of DDT about six times more than this for HCH. In contrast, there were not recorded any differences, either between investigated localities or between penguin species, despite the certain differences in the food spectrum between them. The concentrations of ΣHCH were as follows: for P. antarctica from Livingston Island, 0.419 ± 0.178 μg/g; for P. papua from Livingston Island, 0.356 ± 0.179 μg/g; and for P. papua from Peterman Island, 0.437 ± 0.012 μg/g. The corresponding values for ΣDDT were: for P. antarctica from Livingston Island, 2.596 ± 0.312 μg/g; for P. papua from Livingston Island, 2.507 ± 0.254 μg/g; and for P. papua from Peterman Island - 2.628 ± 0.013 μg/g. Percentage composition of the HCHs compounds showed that β-HCH dominated all investigated samples, being between 55 and 70% of the total quantity of the analyzed HCHs. The major component DDT isomer composes about 2/3 from the total sum or between 72% in feathers of P. papua from Livingston Island and 87% for P. papua from Peterman Island. There were not obtained any statistically significant differences between investigated species or between two localities.

ABSTRACT: Past research during the breeding season in the Antarctic Peninsula region indicates that gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) are generalist foragers whereas Adélie (P. adeliae) and chinstrap (P. antarcticus) penguins tend to specialize on Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). However, little is known about the degree of temporal consistency in the diets and foraging habitats of these three species, particularly at the individual level. Such year-round and inter-annual dietary understanding is important to help interpret contrasting trends in their populations. We used carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis of blood and feathers to evaluate seasonal shifts in diet and individual foraging consistency within Pygoscelis penguin species breeding in the South Shetland Islands as well as among three geographically distinct gentoo penguin populations in the western Antarctic Peninsula and South Shetland Islands. We found that gentoo penguins exhibited a generalist foraging strategy with individual consistency, Adélie penguins exhibited an intermediate generalist foraging strategy with little individual consistency, and chinstrap penguins exhibited a specialized diet with little inter-individual variation. Our results also indicated that all three species have greater variation in foraging habitat use during the post-breeding season compared to the breeding season. Finally, we observed differences in the degree of seasonal shifts in population level diet and consistency in foraging strategies at the individual level across the three gentoo penguin populations examined. This suggests that Pygoscelis penguins can differ in diets and foraging habitat use not only at the population level among species, sites, and seasons, but also in the level of variation within populations, and in the degree of seasonal consistency among individuals. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Until recently, species from all but three families of seabirds were known to give extended parental care, provisioning young after fledging. The exceptions were shearwaters, storm-petrels, and penguins. The Gentoo Penguin (Pygoscelis papua) is now known to feed its young after fledging. This paper adds the Galapagos Penguin (Spheniscus mendiculus) to the list, describing five instances of adult provisioning of recently fledged Galapagos Penguin chicks. All feedings were on land and in the afternoon or early evening. Extended parental care is rare in penguins and should occur only if 1) provisioning does not harm adult body condition or conflict with molting, 2) food is available close to the colony, and 3) adults and fledglings return to the nest area after the chicks fledge and before their dispersal from the colony. These requirements suggest it is unlikely that other penguin species commonly feed chicks after they fledge.

ABSTRACT: Understanding the boundaries of breeding populations is of great importance for conservation efforts and estimates of extinction risk for threatened species. However, determining these boundaries can be difficult when population structure is subtle. Emperor penguins are highly reliant on sea ice, and some populations may be in jeopardy as climate change alters sea-ice extent and quality. An understanding of emperor penguin population structure is therefore urgently needed. Two previous studies have differed in their conclusions, particularly whether the Ross Sea, a major stronghold for the species, is isolated or not. We assessed emperor penguin population structure using 4,596 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), characterized in 110 individuals (10–16 per colony) from eight colonies around Antarctica. In contrast to a previous conclusion that emperor penguins are panmictic around the entire continent, we find that emperor penguins comprise at least four metapopulations, and that the Ross Sea is clearly a distinct metapopulation. Using larger sample sizes and a thorough assessment of the limitations of different analytical methods, we have shown that population structure within emperor penguins does exist and argue that its recognition is vital for the effective conservation of the species. We discuss the many difficulties that molecular ecologists and managers face in the detection and interpretation of subtle population structure using large SNP data sets, and argue that subtle structure should be taken into account when determining management strategies for threatened species, until accurate estimates of demographic connectivity among populations can be made. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

ABSTRACT: Evidence of climate-change-driven shifts in plant and animal phenology have raised concerns that certain trophic interactions may be increasingly mismatched in time, resulting in declines in reproductive success. Given the constraints imposed by extreme seasonality at high latitudes and the rapid shifts in phenology seen in the Arctic, we would also expect Antarctic species to be highly vulnerable to climate-change-driven phenological mismatches with their environment. However, few studies have assessed the impacts of phenological change in Antarctica. Using the largest database of phytoplankton phenology, sea-ice phenology, and Adélie Penguin breeding phenology and breeding success assembled to date, we find that, while a temporal match between Penguin breeding phenology and optimal environmental conditions sets an upper limit on breeding success, only a weak relationship to the mean exists. Despite previous work suggesting that divergent trends in Adélie Penguin breeding phenology are apparent across the Antarctic continent, we find no such trends. Furthermore, we find no trend in the magnitude of phenological mismatch, suggesting that mismatch is driven by interannual variability in environmental conditions rather than climate-change-driven trends, as observed in other systems. We propose several criteria necessary for a species to experience a strong climate-change-driven phenological mismatch, of which several may be violated by this system. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America

ABSTRACT: Niche partitioning plays an important role in minimising interspecific competition for resources. Using carbon and nitrogen stable isotopic analysis of feathers, we investigated how macaroni penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus and eastern rockhopper penguins E. chrysocome filholi breeding at the Prince Edward Islands partition the marine environment during the critical pre-moult period over 5 consecutive years (2011 to 2015). Both species consistently foraged immediately south of the Antarctic Polar Front, with macaroni penguins foraging farther south in years of reduced primary productivity, minimising spatiotemporal overlap between species. Macaroni penguins consistently foraged at a higher trophic level than rockhopper penguins, indicating trophic niche differentiation. Male rockhopper penguins fed at a higher trophic level than females, but macaroni penguins showed no differences between sexes. The observed dietary differences, partial allochrony and species-specific spatial responses to reduced primary productivity (i.e. prey availability) indicate that macaroni and eastern rockhopper penguins exhibit contrasting foraging strategies that limit interspecific competition during the pre-moult period. © The authors 2017.

ABSTRACT: Early-life demographic traits are poorly known, impeding our understanding of population processes and sensitivity to climate change. Survival of immature individuals is a critical component of population dynamics and recruitment in particular. However, obtaining reliable estimates of juvenile survival (i.e., from independence to first year) remains challenging, as immatures are often difficult to observe and to monitor individually in the field. This is particularly acute for seabirds, in which juveniles stay at sea and remain undetectable for several years. In this work, we developed a Bayesian integrated population model to estimate the juvenile survival of emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri), and other demographic parameters including adult survival and fecundity of the species. Using this statistical method, we simultaneously analyzed capture–recapture data of adults, the annual number of breeding females, and the number of fledglings of emperor penguins collected at Dumont d'Urville, Antarctica, for the period 1971–1998. We also assessed how climate covariates known to affect the species foraging habitats and prey [southern annular mode (SAM), sea ice concentration (SIC)] affect juvenile survival. Our analyses revealed that there was a strong evidence for the positive effect of SAM during the rearing period (SAMR) on juvenile survival. Our findings suggest that this large-scale climate index affects juvenile emperor penguins body condition and survival through its influence on wind patterns, fast ice extent, and distance to open water. Estimating the influence of environmental covariates on juvenile survival is of major importance to understand the impacts of climate variability and change on the population dynamics of emperor penguins and seabirds in general and to make robust predictions on the impact of climate change on marine predators. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

ABSTRACT: Whether oiled wildlife should be rehabilitated during an oil spill is internationally debated. Research on little penguins (LP, Eudyptula minor) rehabilitated and released back into a cleaned environment after the New Zealand C/V Rena grounding oil spill in 2011 found the rehabilitation process was effective at treating and reversing the negative effects of oil-contamination on penguin post-release survival, productivity and diving behaviour. Here we investigated the acute corticosterone stress response of LPs to determine if responses of rehabilitated birds differed from those of “control” birds. Corticosterone responses of LPs two years after an oil spill did not differ between rehabilitated and non-rehabilitated penguins. These results show that the rehabilitation process for LP did not affect their long-term physiological responses to humans. This indicates that wildlife can be rehabilitated and returned to the wild with similar human tolerance levels to non-rehabilitated birds and an absence of habituation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Fecundity, an important demographic variable for wildlife populations, is time consuming and expensive to measure. For seabirds, reproductive success is often estimated from 2 surveys of the colony, 1 during incubation and 1 during chick rearing. Using 33 yr of data on Magellanic Penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus), we compared reproductive success estimated from 2 surveys per season, from infrequent nest checks, and from daily nest checks to answer 4 questions: (1) Is reproductive success estimated from 2 surveys per season accurate enough for population models (within 15% of the 'true' value)? We found that the answer was yes, if surveys were done on optimal dates and chick counts were adjusted by the percentage of chicks that were heavy enough to fledge. Optimal dates depended on the synchrony and phenology of the species. If penguins bred particularly late or early in a given year, estimates were wrong even if counts were done on the average optimal date. (2) Can counts of occupied nests be adjusted based solely on date? We determined no, not without additional information on egg dates and egg and chick losses. (3) Can long-Term trends in reproductive success be detected from 2 surveys per season? Our answer was yes; even using biased data from counts on suboptimal dates, trends with similar slopes were detected using both methods (2 surveys vs. nest checks). (4) How often must nests be checked to get reproductive success estimates comparable with those calculated from daily nest checks? We discovered that checking nests every 2 days was as good as doing daily checks. Reproductive success was overestimated by <5% when checks were conducted every 3-8 days and by <15% (in 90% of years) when checks were done every 9-30 days. The degree of overestimation depended on the timing of nest checks relative to egg laying, loss, and hatching. We conclude that reproductive success can be estimated from 2 surveys, but only if timing, synchrony, and variability of breeding are also known. © 2017 Cooper Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Lipid biomarkers are potential tools for identifying the sources, diagenesis and reactivity of organic matter (OM) in marine systems, including in Antarctica where the particular environmental characteristics have motivated several studies of organic markers. Sedimentary sterol distributions were determined in two sediment cores (PGI-1 and PGI-2) collected from the marine environment around Penguin Island, Antarctica, during the 2007-08 summer. The cores were sectioned at 1 cm intervals and the sterols were analysed using gas chromatography with flame ionization detection. The results indicate that the sterols were subjected to decades of degradation and transformation with depth in both cores. However, an expected progressive conversion of stenols to stanols (evaluated by 5α-stanols/Δ5-stenols ratio) within the deepest sediment layers was not clear, suggesting low degradation rates. In PGI-1, the deposition of large quantities of penguin guano affected the distribution of sterols and, consequently, primary production was favoured by the ornithogenic soil input. The results contribute to the understanding of the current processes associated with primary sources and transformation of OM in this important region of the Antarctic environment. © Antarctic Science Ltd 2016.

ABSTRACT: The presence of Campylobacter species was studied in three Antarctic penguin species, Adélie (Pygoscelis adeliae), chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarctica) and gentoo (Pygoscelis papua). A total of 390 penguins were captured in 12 different rookeries along the Antarctic Peninsula with differences in the amount of human visitation: six colonies were highly visited [Stranger Point, King George Island (P. papua and P. adeliae); Hannah Point, Livingston Island (P. papua and P. antarctica); Deception Island (P. antarctica); and Paradise Bay, Antarctic Peninsula (P. papua)], and six colonies were rarely visited [Devil’s Point, Byers Peninsula, Livingston Island (P. papua); Cierva Cove, Antarctic Peninsula (P. papua); Rongé Island (P. papua and P. antarctica); Yalour Island (P. adeliae); and Avian Island (P. adeliae)]. A total of 23 strains were isolated from penguins from nine different rookeries. Campylobacter lari subsp. lari was isolated from eight samples (seven from P. papua and one from P. adeliae); C. lari subsp. concheus from 13 (ten from P. adeliae and three from P. antarctica) and C. volucris from two samples (both from P. papua). We did not find any significant differences in the prevalence of Campylobacter spp. between the populations in highly and rarely visited areas. This is the first report of C. lari subsp. concheus and C. volucris isolation from penguins in the Antarctic region. © 2017, International Association for Ecology and Health.

ABSTRACT: During the last century, there has been a steady decline in the global breeding population of Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome, and this species has been exposed to many different threats. However, the small breeding population of Isla Pingüino, Argentina, increased since its discovery in 1985 until 1990. To determine whether this population continued to grow, we assessed its trend over a 30-year period and estimated its breeding success. This study shows a strong increase in the population in Isla Pingüino with an annual growth rate of more than 7 %, throughout the 30-year study period. The threats that are affecting seabird populations in other areas seem to have no negative effects on this breeding population. In particular, tourism, which has grown exponentially during the survey period, appears to not have had a negative effect on the settlement of new pairs, the number of breeding pairs and their breeding success. We suggest that the population increase in Isla Pingüino might have been facilitated by an immigration of breeding adults from nearby breeding sites such as Falkland Islands (Malvinas). © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Heavy metals are a threat to wildlife, and they have yet to be analyzed in seabirds from the Galápagos Archipelago. To gauge their prevalence in Galápagos seabird species, we collected and analyzed feather samples from Galapagos Penguins Spheniscus mendiculus, Flightless Cormorants Phalacrocorax harrisi, and Waved Albatross Phoebastria irrorata in seven different breeding areas in 2011 and 2012 as part of an ongoing mark-recapture study. The results showed that lead is higher in penguins and cormorants; cadmium was found to be below the limit for quantification in all our samples. The heavy metals recorded did not have a clear local source related to human activities, as breeding areas are not located near populated areas. Environmental media (soil, water), marine currents, and atmospheric deposition are possible sources. © 2017, Marine Ornithology. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and their effects on Antarctic seabirds by using excreta as a non-destructive biomonitoring tool have received little consideration. Here we determine the levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and some organochlorine pesticides such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs), hexachlorobencene (HCB), heptachlor, and endrin aldehyde in penguin excreta. Animal exposure to these environmental contaminants was determined through porphyrins in penguin droppings. Stool samples of Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae), chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica) and gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) were collected on two locations of the Antarctic Peninsula area: Base O'Higgins (Antarctic Peninsula) and Ardley Island (King George Island). Despite POPs have been banned more than three decades ago, the levels (ng g-1 ww) of PCBs (1.45-2.35), DDTs (1.33-1.76), HCB (0.51-1.70), endrin (0.48-0.71) and heptachlor (0.97-2.40) showed that these pollutants are still present in Antarctica. Porphyrin levels in excreta (4.6-6.7 nmol g-1 dw) were significantly correlated to POPs, indicating certain chemical exposure on penguin colonies that inhabit the Antarctic Peninsula area. The levels of heptachlor found in penguin guano may be affecting some biota in terrestrial sites next to nesting places. Further studies and better understanding of POPs impact on animal performance in Antarctic biota are recommended. © 2016 Cambridge University Press.

ABSTRACT: Small pelagic fish play a significant role in regulating the foraging activities and population trends of marine top predators in upwelling ecosystems, yet there is little information on oceanographic drivers of fish assemblages at temporal and spatial scales relevant to their predators. The survival of the Endangered African penguin Spheniscus demersus is closely linked to the availability of pelagic fish prey. This study assesses the influence of oceanographic variables on the spatio-temporal dynamics of pelagic fish in Algoa Bay, South Africa, where half of the world population of African penguins breed on 2 islands, St Croix and Bird. Using small-scale acoustic surveys and an array of underwater oceanographic data recorders spread across the bay during 3 yr, we reveal the complex and variable nature of this system, with fish responding differently to physical processes around each island. Chlorophyll a concentrations were good predictors of relative fish abundance around Bird Island but had little influence around St Croix Island, possibly due to the masking effect of purse-seine fishing around this site. The horizontal distribution of fish schools around Bird Island was more aggregated under upwelling conditions (cooler sea surface temperatures) and the vertical distribution of fish around both islands was strongly influenced by stratification and mean temperatures. Mechanistic drivers of upwelling included northeasterly winds and offshore Natal pulses, both of which are predicted to have an increasingly more significant effect on the suitability of habitat for pelagic fish and associated predators under the influences of climate change and industrial fishing. © Inter-Research 2017 www.int-res.com.

ABSTRACT: The early explorer and scientist Otto Nordenskjöld, leader of the Swedish South Polar Expedition of 1901-1903, was the first to collect Antarctic penguin fossils. The site is situated in the northeastern region of Seymour Island and constitutes one of the most important localities in the study of fossilised penguins. The task of describing these specimens together with fossilised whale remains was given to Professor Carl Wiman (1867-1944) at Uppsala University, Sweden. Although the paradigm for the systematic study of penguins has changed considerably over recent years, Wiman's contributions are still remarkable. His establishment of grouping by size as a basis for classification was a novel approach that allowed them to deal with an unexpectedly high morphological diversity and limited knowledge of penguin skeletal anatomy. In the past, it was useful to provide a basic framework for the group that today could be used as 'taxon free' categories. First, it was important to define new species, and then to establish a classification based on size and robustness. This laid the foundation for the first attempts to use morphometric parameters for the classification of isolated penguin bones.

ABSTRACT: In the Ross Sea region, most South Polar Skuas (Stercorarius maccormicki) nest near Adélie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) colonies, preying and scavenging on fish, penguins, and other carrion. To derive a relationship to predict skua numbers from better-quantified penguin numbers, we used distance sampling to estimate breeding skua numbers within 1000 m of 5 penguin nesting locations (Cape Crozier, Cape Royds, and 3 Cape Bird locations) on Ross Island in 3 consecutive years. Estimated numbers of skua breeding pairs were highest at Cape Crozier (270,000 penguin pairs; 1099 and 1347 skua pairs in 2 respective years) and lowest at Cape Royds (3000 penguin pairs; 45 skua pairs). The log–log linear relationship (R2 = 0.98) between pairs of skuas and penguins was highly significant, and most historical estimates of skua and penguin numbers in the Ross Sea were within 95 % prediction intervals of the regression. Applying our regression model to current Adélie Penguin colony sizes at 23 western Ross Sea locations predicted that 4635 pairs of skuas now breed within 1000 m of penguin colonies in the Ross Island metapopulation (including Beaufort Island) and northern Victoria Land. We estimate, using published skua estimates for elsewhere in Antarctica, that the Ross Sea South Polar Skua population comprises ~50 % of the world total, although this may be an overestimate because of incomplete data elsewhere. To improve predictions and enable measurement of future skua population change, we recommend additional South Polar Skua surveys using consistent distance-sampling methods at penguin colonies of a range of sizes. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Little is known about the early life at sea of marine top predators, like deep-diving king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus), although this dispersal phase is probably a critical phase in their life. Apart from finding favourable foraging sites, they have to develop effective prey search patterns as well as physiological capacities that enable them to capture sufficient prey to meet their energetic needs. To investigate the ontogeny of their thermoregulatory responses at sea, we implanted 30 juvenile king penguins and 8 adult breeders with a small data logger that recorded pressure and subcutaneous temperature continuously for up to 2.5 years. We found important changes in the development of peripheral temperature patterns of foraging juvenile king penguins throughout their first year at sea. Peripheral temperature during foraging bouts fell to increasingly lower levels during the first 6 months at sea, after which it stabilized. Most importantly, these changes re-occurred during their second year at sea, after birds had fasted for ∼4 weeks on land during their second moult. Furthermore, similar peripheral temperature patterns were also present in adult birds during foraging trips throughout their breeding cycle. We suggest that rather than being a simple consequence of concurrent changes in dive effort or an indication of a physiological maturation process, these seasonal temperature changes mainly reflect differences in thermal insulation. Heat loss estimates for juveniles at sea were initially high but declined to approximately half after ∼6 months at sea, suggesting that juvenile king penguins face a strong energetic challenge during their early oceanic existence.

ABSTRACT: We comment on the proposition that lower temperatures and especially greater seasonal variation in temperature call for individuals and societies to adopt ⋯ a greater degree of self-control (Van Lange et al., sect. 3, para. 4) for which we cannot find empirical support in a large data set with data-driven analyses. After providing greater nuance in our theoretical review, we suggest that Van Lange et al. revisit their model with an eye toward the social determinants of self-control.

ABSTRACT: Two main hypotheses have been debated about the biogeography of the Southern Ocean: (1) the Antarctic Polar Front (APF), acting as a barrier between Antarctic and sub-Antarctic provinces, and (2) the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), promoting gene flow among sub-Antarctic areas. The Gentoo penguin is distributed throughout these two provinces, separated by the APF. We analyzed mtDNA (HVR1) and 12 microsatellite loci of 264 Gentoo penguins, Pygoscelis papua, from 12 colonies spanning from the Western Antarctic Peninsula and the South Shetland Islands (WAP) to the sub-Antarctic Islands (SAI). While low genetic structure was detected among WAP colonies (mtDNA ФST = 0.037–0.133; microsatellite FST = 0.009–0.063), high differentiation was found between all SAI and WAP populations (mtDNA ФST = 0.678–0.930; microsatellite FST = 0.110–0.290). These results suggest that contemporary dispersal around the Southern Ocean is very limited or absent. As predicted, the APF appears to be a significant biogeographical boundary for Gentoo penguin populations; however, the ACC does not promote connectivity in this species. Our data suggest demographic expansion in the WAP during the last glacial maximum (LGM, about 20 kya), but stability in SAI. Phylogenetic analyses showed a deep divergence between populations from the WAP and those from the SAI. Therefore, taxonomy should be further revised. The Crozet Islands resulted as a basal clade (3.57 Mya), followed by the Kerguelen Islands (2.32 Mya) as well as a more recent divergence between the Falkland/Malvinas Islands and the WAP (1.27 Mya). Historical isolation, local adaptation, and past climate scenarios of those Evolutionarily Significant Units may have led to different potentials to respond to climate changes. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is a high energy-demanding process that may be inhibited by penguin guano. We tested this hypothesis in Ardley Island by measuring BNF in biological soil crusts (BSC) directly within a Penguin Colony and in sites unaffected by penguins. We also explored the effect of adding guano to BSCs in sites free of the influence of penguins. Water availability is also one of the most limiting elements for life in the Antarctica, and we expected that a wetter growing season would stimulate BNF. To evaluate the effect of moisture on BNF, we added water to BSCs under laboratory conditions and estimated BNF by means of the acetylene reduction assay during three growing seasons (2012, 2013 and 2014), with contrasting temperature and precipitation conditions. The results reveal an almost complete inhibition of N fixation in the BSCs of the Penguin Colony. In sites free of ammonium and phosphate in rainwater, BNF rates reached up to 3 kg N ha−1 year−1 during warmer and wetter years. The addition of guano to BSCs significantly inhibited the rates of BNF. In laboratory incubations, the addition of water significantly stimulated rates of BNF during the warmer growing season with more sunshine hours. The likely increases in soil moisture levels due to climate change and glacier melting in the Antarctic Peninsula may enhance the rates of BNF. However, this may be constrained by accompanying changes in the distribution of Penguin Colonies. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: We herein review the modeling approach of Pinkerton et al. (2016, Ecol. Modelling), who tested the hypothesis that fishery depletion of large, neutrally buoyant Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni) was implicated in the recent increase in the southern Ross Sea population of Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae). Toothfish are a trophic competitor of penguins for Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarctica) in the southern Ross Sea, hence Ainley et al. (2013) and Lyver et al. (2014) proposed that the effect of the removal of toothfish was through predation release of silverfish. Pinkerton et al. concluded that predation release could not provide sufficient energy to sustain the observed penguin population growth. Critically, however, they failed to consider certain spatial and size-by-depth aspects of diet overlap, and mechanisms associated with population dynamics that could cause the population growth through predation release. In order to effectively test the prey release hypothesis, we suggest a strong inference path that incorporates what we know about population dynamics in penguins and Ross Sea food webs into life history parameterizations of penguins, toothfish and silverfish population dynamics models. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: A number of potential stressors are present in captive environments and it is critically important to identify them in order to improve health and welfare in ex situ animal populations. In this study, we investigated the adrenocortical activity of a colony of African penguins hosted in an immersive zoo in Italy, with respect to the presence of visitors and local microclimatic conditions, using the non-invasive method of assessing faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGMs). The penguins’ exhibit is a large naturalistic outdoor enclosure, which closely reproduces the natural habitat of this species. Data collection took place from the beginning of June to the end of August 2014, during the period of maximum flow of visitors. We carried out 12 sampling periods, each involving 2 consecutive days; during the first day we counted the visitors and we registered the meteorological data, and on the second day, we collected the faecal samples, which amounted to a total of 285 faecal samples. Our results showed that the number of visitors did not influence the adrenocortical activity of the African penguins. Conversely, the local microclimatic conditions did influence the physiological stress on these birds. We found that an increase of the daily mean temperature induced a significant increase in FGM concentrations, although humidity and wind speed had a moderating effect on temperature and reduced the heat-induced stress. Moreover, we calculated two climatic indices, commonly used to assess the thermal discomfort in animals, namely the THI (Temperature-Humidity Index) and WCI (Wind Chill Index), and we detected a positive relationship between their values and the FGM levels, demonstrating that these indices could be useful indicators of weather discomfort in African penguins. Our study shows that the simulating naturalistic conditions could have significant benefits for zoo animals, such as reducing the negative effect of visitors. Nevertheless, it should be taken into account where the zoological facility is located and if the local microclimatic conditions are compatible with the hosted species, to ensure that they do not differ greatly from their natural habitat. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: A white Adélie Penguin Pygoscelis adeliae was sighted in offshore waters of East Antarctica at 65°56‘S, 80°39‘E on 20 February 2013. This individual had the same morphological characteristics and body size of normal Adélie Penguins, but had entirely white plumage, eyes paler than normal, a brownish to purplish red bill, pale pink legs and feet, and an absence of black coloration on the body. This individual was classified as a possible ‘inolight’ according the color aberration types defined by van Grouw (2013). © Yamashina Institute for Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: Identifying predators and determining their influence on bird population declines can be crucial in the implementation of appropriate conservation measures. In this study, we focus on the Little Penguin Eudyptula minor, a flightless seabird whose numbers have seriously declined in some populations across Australia and New Zealand, for a variety of reasons, some not fully understood. Using a combination of motion-camera monitoring at active burrows and postmortem examinations of carcasses, we present data on the identity, occurrence and impact of terrestrial predators at two colonies in South Australia: Granite Island and Emu Bay (Kangaroo Island). Terrestrial predation varied from 20% for carcasses found on Granite Island to 44% at Emu Bay. There was no evidence for predation at burrows on Granite Island but, at Emu Bay, we identified goannas (Heath Monitor Varanus rosenbergi) as predators of chicks (by using cameras), and Cats Felis catus as predators of chicks and juveniles (from postmortem examination of carcasses). In addition, 45% of the carcasses found at Emu Bay were categorised as chicks. We discuss potential biases in identifying causes of death from carcasses only and the importance of combining both direct and indirect evidence.

ABSTRACT: Maremma guardian dogs have been protecting Little Penguins Eudyptula minor from canid predation at Middle Island, Warrnambool, since 2006. Foxes had preyed heavily on the penguins contributing to a population crash-from over 500 arrivals in the 1999-2000 breeding season, to less than 10 some five years later. Our monitoring of arrivals indicates numbers have grown to over 100 penguins. The successful use of guardian dogs to protect native wildlife and the strong community participation and support for the program constitutes what has become known as the ‘Warrnambool Method’ for wildlife conservation management. © 2017, Field Naturalists Club of Victoria.

ABSTRACT: Longitudinal studies focusing on lifetime reproductive success (LRS) have been used to measure individual breeding performance and identify commonalities among successful breeders. By extending the focus to subsequent generations we identify a proportion of high-quality individuals that contribute disproportionately to the population over multiple generations. We used 23 years of yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes) breeding data from one breeding area to identify the proportion of individual birds that raised successful breeders, which in turn raised offspring. We explored which life-history components influenced LRS, as this knowledge would enable conservation resources to be focused on high-performing individuals in this endangered population. From 2,147 birds marked as chicks, 370 (17.2%) survived to adulthood and recruited to their natal location, of which 219 (10.2%) fledged offspring: 124 (56.6%) of the 219 birds produced offspring that recruited as breeders. Only 102 birds (4.8% of 2,147) fledged first-generation offspring that in turn fledged offspring (second-generation offspring, or grandoffspring). We found that ~25% of the birds that survived to breed had aboveaverage LRS as well as above-average numbers of grand-offspring, and were more likely to have produced first-generation chicks that recruited and also produced above-average numbers of second-generation chicks. Our findings suggest that there is a core of "super-breeders" that contribute disproportionately to the population over successive generations. Lifespan and age-at-first-breeding were correlated with LRS.We suggest that traits of birds relating to longevity, health (e.g., immunocompetence) and fitness could be examined to identify potential links with high LRS and inter-generational fecundity. "Super-breeders" appear to consistently achieve high LRS and long lifespans in a stochastic environment, demonstrating greater resilience in the face of extreme events. © 2017 Stein et al.

ABSTRACT: The total-evidence approach to divergence time dating uses molecular and morphological data from extant and fossil species to infer phylogenetic relationships, species divergence times, and macroevolutionary parameters in a single coherent framework. Current model-based implementations of this approach lack an appropriate model for the tree describing the diversification and fossilization process and can produce estimates that lead to erroneous conclusions. We address this shortcoming by providing a total-evidence method implemented in a Bayesian framework. This approach uses a mechanistic tree prior to describe the underlying diversification process that generated the tree of extant and fossil taxa. Previous attempts to apply the total-evidence approach have used tree priors that do not account for the possibility that fossil samples may be direct ancestors of other samples, that is, ancestors of fossil or extant species or of clades. The fossilized birth-death (FBD) process explicitly models the diversification, fossilization, and sampling processes and naturally allows for sampled ancestors. This model was recently applied to estimate divergence times based on molecular data and fossil occurrence dates.We incorporate the FBD model and amodel of morphological trait evolution into a Bayesian total-evidence approach to dating species phylogenies. We apply this method to extant and fossil penguins and show that the modern penguins radiated much more recently than has been previously estimated, with the basal divergence in the crown clade occurring at ∼12.7 Ma and most splits leading to extant species occurring in the last 2 myr. Our results demonstrate that including stem-fossil diversity can greatly improve the estimates of the divergence times of crown taxa. The method is available in BEAST2 (version 2.4) software www.beast2.org with packages SA (version at least 1.1.4) and morph-models (version at least 1.0.4) installed. © The Author(s) 2016.

ABSTRACT: The winged pearl oyster Pteria penguin is a commercially important marine pearl oyster species, with pearls that are quite different from those of other pearl oysters. Among such species, mantle tissue is the main organ responsible for shell and pearl formation, a biomineralization process that is regulated by a series of genes, most of which remain unknown. In this study, we sequenced and characterized the transcriptome of P. penguin mantle tissue using the HiSeq 2000 sequencing platform. A total of 93,204 unique transcripts were assembled from 51,580,076 quality reads, with a mean length of 608 bp, and 40,974 unigenes were annotated. The sequence data enabled the identification of 79,702 potential single nucleotide polymorphism loci and 4345 putative simple sequence repeat loci. A total of 71 unique transcripts were identified homologous to known biomineralization genes, including mantle gene, nacrein, pearlin, pif, chitinase, and shematrin, of which only 3 were previously reported in P. penguin. qPCR analysis indicated that 10 randomly selected biomineralization genes were much more highly expressed in mantle tissue than in the other tissues. In addition, 30 unique sequences were identified as highly expressed, with FPKM values of > 3000, and most of these were biomineralization-related genes, including shematrin family genes, a jacalin-related lectin synthesis gene, calponin-2, and paramyosin. These findings will be useful for future studies of biomineralization in P. penguin, as well as in other Pteria species. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Why Penguins Communicate: The Evolution of Visual and Vocal Signals is a comprehensive and condensed review of several hundred publications on the evolution of penguin behaviors, particularly signaling, linking genetics and ecology via such behavioral adaptations as nuptial displays. This exciting work has developed from the authors’ many years researching on the behavioral strategies of penguins, such as the unique vocal signatures for individual recognition. Studies of penguins on islands surrounding Antarctica are presented, fully showcasing the behavioral significance of visual ornaments (mating displays) and how and why penguins behave via adaptive evolutionary explanations. Through this evolutionary lens, the authors address several questions involving their identification and taxonomy, habitat and location, breeding, and differences between penguins and other seabirds. Each species occupies a unique ecological niche, and behaviors permit separating the species through mutual display. Although model organisms in science are diverse and specialized, we see the entire integration in penguins, from acoustical and optical physics, to behavioral display and speciation. This work highlights the adaptive significance of their behavior through an evolutionary point- of-view. © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Penguins are classified in the order Sphenisciformes into a single family, Spheniscidae. The genus Pygoscelis Wagler, 1832, is composed of three species, Pygoscelis antarcticus Forster, 1781, P. papua Forster, 1781 and P. adeliae Hombron & Jacquinot, 1841. In this work, the objective was to describe and to compare the karyotypes of Pygoscelis penguins contributing genetic information to Sphenisciformes. The metaphases were obtained by lymphocyte culture, and the diploid number and the C-banding pattern were determined. P. antarcticus has 2n = 92, P. papua 2n = 94 and P. adeliae exhibited 2n = 96 in males and 2n = 95 in females. The difference of diploid number in P. adeliae was identified as a multiple sex chromosome system where males have Z1Z1Z2Z2 and females Z1Z2W. The C-banding showed the presence of a heterochromatic block in the long arm of W chromosome and Z2 was almost entirely heterochromatic. The probable origin of a multiple system in P. adeliae was a translocation involving the W chromosome and the chromosome ancestral to Z2. The comparison made possible the identification of a high karyotype homology in Sphenisciformes which can be seen in the conservation of macrochromosomes and in the Z chromosome. The karyotypic divergences in Pygoscelis are restricted to the number of microchromosomes and W, which proved to be highly variable in size and morphology. The data presented in this work corroborate molecular phylogenetic proposals, supporting the monophyletic origin of penguins and intraspecific relations. © Ricardo José Gunski et al.

ABSTRACT: Well-studied, long-lived species, such as seabirds, can be exposed to decades of investigator interventions, and if the species is of conservation concern, intensive monitoring and management as well. Most evaluations of impacts of investigator disturbance have been relatively short-term. We evaluated both short- and long-term impacts of investigator disturbance on the yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes) by focusing on both the breeding season during which the impact occurred and lifetime reproductive success (LRS). In long-lived species, reproductive decisions are often trade-offs between current and future reproductive success, and lifetime reproductive success (LRS) can be influenced by many life- history and environmental parameters, including investigator disturbance. Yellow-eyed penguins, a long-lived seabird that has been intensively studied on the Otago Peninsula of South Island, New Zealand for three decades, are known to be vulnerable to human intrusion. Research and monitoring has required banding and band maintenance, handling, blood sampling, stomach flushing, and device deployment. We found no negative effects associated with any investigator disturbance type on breeding success or LRS. Monitoring disturbances (egg, chick and adult handling, band maintenance) that occurred during the egg and chick phases showed a positive association with breeding success and LRS, probably because the longer a nest survived the more likely eggs, chicks, or adults would be handled. There appeared to be a core of resilient individuals with long lifespans and high LRS that may buffer the population despite being exposed to many investigator disturbance events. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: West Nile virus (genus Flavivirus) outbreaks and mortality events have been documented in both wild and captive avian species, including penguins. Serologic response to vaccination in avian species has varied and appears to be largely species dependent; however, Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) previously showed excellent rates of seroconversion. The goal of this study was to determine virus neutralization titers of 17 Humboldt penguin hens and their subsequent eggs, chicks, or both following vaccination with a killed West Nile vaccine. Chicks were also vaccinated at 56, 70, and 84 days old. Titers were measured from 10-346 days prior to lay as well as serially in seven chicks. Data collected showed positive rank correlation between maternal titers and yolk titers (ρ = 0.90, P < 0.0001, n = 14) but no association between booster vaccination and yolk titers. All seven chicks had detectable antibody on days 14 and 28, and antibody levels had increased (relative to day 56) in 3 of 6 chicks (50%; 95% confidence interval 14-86%) by day 112. Further information is provided on a suggested vaccination schedule for Humboldt penguin chicks based on a time-dependent decline in maternal antibody titers. Cell-mediated immunity and experimental challenge following vaccination have not yet been investigated in this species. Copyright © 2017 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: A survey of Fiordland crested penguin/tawaki, Eudyptes pachyrhynchus, breeding colonies between Cascade River and Martins Bay, South Westland, was undertaken from August to September 2014 to obtain an accurate population estimate for the area. A total of 835 nests was found, making this one of the major breeding locations for the species. This total represents a minimum estimate as tawaki nests are spread through large areas of dense forest and are very difficult to locate, and so count accurately. A total of 150 nests was observed in previous surveys of the same location. This dramatic difference in results (835 vs. 150) is atributed to a difference in survey methods and the surveyor's familiarity with the breeding area, not a population increase. Given these results and the difficulty involved in locating tawaki, it is likely that the species' overall population size has been significantly underestimated. © The Ornithological Society of New Zealand Inc.

ABSTRACT: Caspian Terns from a breeding colony on Penguin Island in the southern metropolitan coastal waters of Perth, Western Australian, dispersed primarily onto the nearby Peel-Harvey Estuary. The terns preyed on benthic fishes associated with marine seagrass meadows and estuarine shallows. The diet was dominated by detritivores, in particular sea mullet Mugil cephalus and Perth herring Nematalosa vlaminghi. Stable isotope values from adult feathers also indicated the importance of perennial or annual seagrass habitats for foraging. Cadmium and lead levels in feathers were low. However, most breeding adults had elevated levels of mercury in their tail feathers. Mercury concentrations were strongly correlated with δ15N, indicating a link between exposure and the mineralised nitrogen associated with the relative eutrophication of the foraging habitats.

ABSTRACT: Plumage aberration records are widely reported for terrestrial bird species, although for seabirds those records are still scarce. The brown mutation is one of the most frequent color aberration in birds, and is defined as a qualitative reduction of eumelanin. Here we describe the first records of brown plumage aberration for two seabird species, in two individuals of Larus dominicanus and one individual of Spheniscus magellanicus, in coastal southern Brazil, thus contributing to the knowledge on color variations in wild birds. © 2017, Sociedade Brasileira de Ornitologia.

ABSTRACT: Recent genetic analyses have revealed evidence for the existence of two distinct lineages of Little Penguin (genus Eudyptula), one endemic to New Zealand (E. minor), and the other widespread along the coasts of Australia and south-east New Zealand (E. novaehollandiae). Here we present the first comprehensive morphometric analysis of complete Eudyptula skeletons. We show that variability in Eudyptula body and bill size is associated with sea surface temperature gradients, suggesting that thermoregulatory processes underpin morphological variation in these seabirds. More importantly, we detect osteological differentiation between New Zealand and Australian specimens, providing further support for the taxonomic separation of these behaviourally and genetically distinct lineages. Broadly, our study shows the value of multivariate osteological analyses in helping to resolve the status of genetic lineages that appear morphologically ‘cryptic’ when considering external morphometrics and plumage features alone. © 2017, © 2017 BirdLife Australia.

ABSTRACT: The present study was undertaken to evaluate the morphological variations of Pteria penguin (Roding, 1798) in wild as well as cultured populations from South China Sea. A total of 307 samples were collected from five different geographic locations comprising three wild (Pop. 1, 2 and 4) and two cultured (Pop. 3 and 5) populations and 10 measured traits were analysed. Principal component analysis (PCA), discriminant analysis and cluster analysis were used to evaluate the morphological variations in the collected samples. Results showed a low intra-population variation within the five sampled populations. Multivariate analyses indicated that the five populations were more or less differentiated on the basis of body characters, particularly those related to major dimensions of the shell outline and their ratios. Discriminant analysis revealed that the overall random assignment of individuals into their original groups was high (81.8%), indicating that these populations are highly divergent from each other. The proportion of individuals correctly classified into their original groups was 96.9, 76.7, 75.0, 78.0 and 82.0% for populations 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 respectively. Cluster analysis showed highest morphological variation between Pop.1 and Pop. 2. All other populations (Pop.3, Pop.4 and Pop.5) were found to be morphologically similar and consistent with the respective geographical location. Results of the present study will be of use in resource assessment and management of P. penguin in the South China Sea. © 2017, Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Penguins are the most threatened group of seabirds after albatrosses. Although penguins are regularly captured in fishing gear, the threat to penguins as a group has not yet been assessed. We reviewed both published and grey literature to identify the fishing gear types that penguins are most frequently recorded in, the most impacted species and, for these susceptible species, the relative importance of bycatch compared to other threats. While quantitative estimates of overall bycatch levels are difficult to obtain, this review highlights that, of the world's 18 species of penguins, 14 have been recorded as bycatch in fishing gear and that gillnets, and to a lesser extent trawls, are the gear types that pose the greatest threats to penguins. Bycatch is currently of greatest concern for yellow-eyed Megadyptes antipodes (Endangered), Humboldt Spheniscus humboldti (Vulnerable) and Magellanic Spheniscus magellanicus penguins (Near Threatened). Penguins face many threats; reducing bycatch mortality in fishing gear will greatly enhance the resilience of penguin populations to threats from habitat loss and climate change that are more difficult to address in the short term. Additional data are required to quantify the true extent of penguin bycatch, particularly for the most susceptible species. In the meantime, it is crucially important to manage the fisheries operating within known penguin foraging areas to reduce the risks to this already threatened group of seabirds. © The author 2017.

ABSTRACT: Microsatellites are valuable molecular markers for evolutionary and ecological studies. Next generation sequencing is responsible for the increasing number of microsatellites for non-model species. Penguins of the Pygoscelis genus are comprised of three species: Adélie (P. adeliae), Chinstrap (P. antarcticus) and Gentoo penguin (P. papua), all distributed around Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic. The species have been affected differently by climate change, and the use of microsatellite markers will be crucial to monitor population dynamics. We characterized a large set of genome-wide microsatellites and evaluated polymorphisms in all three species. SOLiD reads were generated from the libraries of each species, identifying a large amount of microsatellite loci: 33,677, 35,265 and 42,057 for P. adeliae, P. antarcticus and P. papua, respectively. A large number of dinucleotide (66,139), trinucleotide (29,490) and tetranucleotide (11,849) microsatellites are described. Microsatellite abundance, diversity and orthology were characterized in penguin genomes. We evaluated polymorphisms in 170 tetranucleotide loci, obtaining 34 polymorphic loci in at least one species and 15 polymorphic loci in all three species, which allow to perform comparative studies. Polymorphic markers presented here enable a number of ecological, population, individual identification, parentage and evolutionary studies of Pygoscelis, with potential use in other penguin species. © 2017, Sociedade Brasileira de Genética.

ABSTRACT: Several studies have suggested that penguins are undergoing a major restructuring of their feeding habits and distribution after drastic climatic changes in the Antarctic Peninsula region. With the objective of estimating potential medium-term and inter-annual variations in trophic niche, we measured δ15N and δ13C in feather samples of pygoscelid penguins from museum specimens (1982–1984) and in blood and feather samples from 2009/10–2011 collected from animals on Ardley Island. Current penguin feathers had lower δ13C and δ15N values and were more similar to Antarctic krill values, than feathers in 1982–1984 and blood from 2009/10-2011. Moreover, δ13C and δ15N values from museum feathers and modern samples occupied a larger isotopic space in Gentoo Penguins (Pygoscelis papua), compared to Adélie Penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) and Chinstrap Penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica). Our results from feathers samples indicated that penguins have decreased their consumption of fish and other prey of higher trophic levels in the early interbreeding period (EIBP), while increasing the amount of euphausiids (Antarctic krill Euphausia superba) taken. The isotopic values of the species suggest that foraging sites varied significantly over time and seasonally. We suggest that environmental changes may have modified the feeding habits of pygoscelid penguins, resulting in changed foraging behaviour in the EIBP, and altering the secondary prey consumption. Prey choice in breeding pygoscelid species is probably limited by the foraging range around the breeding colony and competitive exclusion between congeners. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Breeding animals can increase the survival of their offspring by defending their offspring and perform a conspicuous display against nest predators and potential risks. Here, we recorded the behavioral responses of Antarctic penguins when a stuffed skua and a human approached their nests. We investigated (1) how sympatrically breeding chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarcticus) and gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) penguins responded to the approaching skua (a real nest predator) and human (a newly introduced intruder) and (2) how the penguin responses varied based on the degree of previous exposure to humans. Our results showed that chinstrap penguins mostly displayed strongly threatening behavior, with physical attacks on both the skua and human. However, gentoo penguins displayed a weaker threatening behavior toward the skua and responded differently to the presence of a human. Many gentoo individuals avoided the human rather than displaying threatening behavior. Furthermore, gentoo penguins near the pathway used by humans exhibited weak responses after 4 weeks of exposures to passers-by, whereas other individuals far from the pathway responded with threatening behavior. These results indicate that chinstrap and gentoo penguins may have different strategies for defending their offspring; gentoo penguins might discriminate between intruder types depending on the degree of danger, whereas chinstrap penguins consistently reacted to any intruders approaching to their nest sites. Our findings suggest that gentoo penguins may become habituated with humans following prior to short-term exposure. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Inter-annual variability in diet during crèche (December to February) over 22 years (1989–2010) was examined for gentoo penguins Pygoscelis papua breeding at Bird Island, South Georgia (54°00′S, 38°03′W). Overall, diets comprised 51% crustaceans and 49% fish by mass. Crustaceans were present in 89% of samples and were the main prey (>50% by mass) in 10 years of the study. Antarctic krill Euphausia superba were present in 85% of all diet samples. Fish were present in 79% of samples and were the main prey in 12 years, with Champsocephalus gunnari and Lepidonotothen larseni the most frequently recorded species, in 51 and 33% of samples, respectively. The energy or mass of krill in the diet was the most reliable predictor of breeding success (the number of chicks fledged per breeding pair); the correlation between model-predicted and observed values was 0.58. We compared annual patterns of gentoo penguin diet variability with those of macaroni penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus breeding at the same location. Our results suggest that the availability of krill is a key source of diet variability for both species, but their diets indicate that gentoo penguins are generalist predators (feeding on pelagic and bentho-pelagic prey), while macaroni penguins are krill specialists (feeding on pelagic prey). Differences in the response to variability in key prey species is an important factor separating the ecological niches of these two sympatric krill predators. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Plasma corticosterone concentrations increase when birds experience a stressor, and plasma corticosterone responses to a capture and handling stressor have been measured in many species of birds. Whilst it is assumed that the reported corticosterone responses reflect the inherent sensitivity of each bird to the stressor, responses of the same birds have rarely been measured at intervals of one or more years. The current study was conducted to measure the repeatability in two successive years of corticosterone responses of little penguins (Eudyptula minor) at Oamaru, New Zealand. There was a wide range of individual corticosterone responses to capture and restraint in 96 little penguins in 2012 and 50 penguins sampled at the same time of year in 2013. There were significant repeatabilities for the ranks of corticosterone at 15, 30 and 60 min (r = 0.416 ± 0.160, r = 0.636 ± 0.115 and r = 0.380 ± 0.166 respectively) and for the ranks of integrated corticosterone responses (r = 0.594 ± 0.126) for 23 birds sampled in both years. There were no significant relationships between the size of corticosterone responses and age, body weight or condition index. Mean corticosterone concentrations at 60 min were 114.22 ± 6.65 ng/ml in 2012 and 116.94 ± 6.42 ng/ml in 2013. Mean corticosterone responses did not differ between two successive years and were greater than responses of other penguin species. Penguins are well suited to long term studies in which corticosterone responses are measured annually as potential measures of changing marine environmental conditions. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Monitoring permafrost and active layer is essential for prognostic research of future climate scenarios. Although biotic factors have a prominent role in active layer behavior, apart from vegetation effects, their influence remains little investigated. It is generally assumed that frozen ground exerts influence on nesting fauna, whereas, on the other hand, land colonization by birds, such as penguins can also interfere with the soil thermal regime. However, to our knowledge, no studies report on permafrost and active layer regime changes under penguin activity. We present a comparative study of two adjacent sites located in Hope Bay, one representing an active penguin rookery-S1, and another, an adjacent abandoned site currently vegetated-S2. Soil temperature and water content, and air temperature were monitored hourly from 2009 to 2011. Current penguin activity and the resulting deposition of guano during spring and summer in S1 is an important factor for explaining the higher number of thaw degree days due to direct physical impact and chemical reactions caused by rapid guano decomposition. In the vegetated S2 site, the snow pack lasted longer, showing the highest mean minimum temperature and larger thermal insulation, as well as larger FDD than those found in the bare soil of the active rookery (S1), and lower n-F, due to greater thermal insulation. Penguins played a significant role in changing the active layer depth and thermal regime, and represent a neglected actor on the ground thermal regime in Antarctic terrestrial environments. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: It is expected that activities which require a high use of energy could generate higher oxidative stress. In the present study, we have compared two breeding periods (incubation and chick rearing) with different energetic demands in the Magellanic penguin, predicting a higher oxidative unbalance during chick rearing since involves higher demanding activities such as chick feeding and greater nest protection than during incubation. Specifically, we predicted higher oxidative damage and lower antioxidant defences during chick rearing than during incubation. Fieldwork was conducted in a Magellanic penguin colony located in Estancia San Lorenzo (42°05′S, 63°49′W), Peninsula Valdes, Argentina, during the breeding season of 2014–2015. Surprisingly, our results did not support our initial prediction. Incubating adults had their oxidative status unbalanced showing significantly lower antioxidant levels than those rearing chicks. Moreover, oxidative damage did not show any significant variation between both breeding periods. Further, we did not find differences in oxidative status between sexes. Our results suggest that incubation is a highly demanding activity compared to chick rearing in terms of oxidative balance since the lower presence of antioxidants can be explained as they have probably depleted to limit oxidative damage by ROS. Differential foraging effort could explain such results as Magellanic penguins adjust their foraging location to prey availability performing longer foraging trips during incubation than during chick rearing which increases the energy costs and therefore imbalance penguins oxidative status. Our results show the importance of examining physiological markers such as oxidative stress to assess differences during the breeding cycle and how the behaviour at sea could explain such differences in seabirds. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: The oxidative cost of reproduction has been a matter of debate in recent years presumably because of the lack of proper experimental studies. Based on the hypothesis that different brood sizes produce differential reproductive costs, an experimental manipulation during breeding of Adélie penguins was conducted at Hope Bay, Antarctica, to study oxidative status and stress. We predict that a lower reproductive effort should be positively related to low oxidative and physiological stress. We randomly assigned nests with two chicks to a control reproductive effort group (CRE), and by removing one chick from some nests with two chicks, formed a second, low reproductive effort group (LRE). We examined how oxidative status in blood plasma (reactive oxygen metabolites, ROMs, and total antioxidant capacity, OXY) and stress (heterophil/lymphocyte ratio, H/L) responded to a lower production of offspring total biomass. Our nest manipulation showed significant differences in offspring total biomass, which was lower in the LRE group. As predicted, the LRE group had higher antioxidant capacity than individuals in the CRE group. We have also found, although marginally significant, interactions between sex and treatment in the three variables analysed. Females had higher OXY, lower ROMs and lower H/L ratio when rearing one chick, whereas males did so when rearing two except for OXY which was high regardless of treatment. Moreover, there was a significant negative correlation between the H/L ratio and OXY in females. Finally, we have found a negative and significant relationship between the duration of the experiment and OXY and ROMs and positive with H/L ratio which suggests that indeed breeding penguins are paying an effort in physiological terms in relation to the duration of the chick rearing. In conclusion, a reduction of the reproductive effort decreased oxidative stress in this long-lived bird meaning that a link exists between breeding effort and oxidative stress. However, our findings suggest different sex strategies which results in opposite physiological responses presumably depending on different life-history strategies in males and females. © 2017 Colominas-Ciuró et al.

ABSTRACT: Aspergillosis is a common respiratory fungal disease in African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) under managed care, and treatment failures with itraconazole due to drug resistance are increasingly common, leading to recent use of voriconazole. Empirical dosing with voriconazole based on other avian studies has resulted in adverse clinical drug effects in penguins. The objective of this study was to determine oral voriconazole pharmacokinetics (PK) in African penguins (n = 18). Single and once daily multiple oral doses of 5 mg/kg voriconazole were evaluated with a 4-mo washout period between trials. Plasma voriconazole concentrations were determined via high-performance liquid chromatography. Data was modeled using 3-compartamental population methodologies that supported first-order elimination. Observed mean peak concentration (1.89 μg/ml) after single dosing PK analysis was determined within the first hour following voriconazole administration. In the multiple-dose trial average plasma voriconazole concentrations were significantly higher on days 4 and 7 as compared with day 2. The mean estimates for volume of distribution (V/F) and clearance (Cl/F) for the multiple-dose study were 3.34 L and 0.18 L/hr, respectively. Monte Carlo simulations determined the median area under the curve (AUC 0-24) at 84 hr was 37.7 μg·h/ml. As this assessment was comparable with the average AUC in humans receiving the recommended human oral dosage 200 mg b.i.d., it suggests that 5 mg/kg p.o. s.i.d. could be a safe and effective regimen in African penguins for treatment of aspergillosis. However, due to potential drug accumulation and subsequent toxicity, therapeutic drug monitoring with dosage adjustments is recommended to individualize dosing. © Copyright 2017 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Detecting and predicting how populations respond to environmental variability are crucial challenges for their conservation. Knowledge about the abundance and distribution of the emperor penguin is far from complete despite recent information from satellites. When exploring the locations where emperor penguins breed, it is apparent that their distribution is circumpolar, but with a few gaps between known colonies. The purpose of this paper is therefore to identify those remaining areas where emperor penguins might possibly breed. Using the locations of emperor penguin breeding colonies, we calculated the separation distance between each pair of geographically adjacent colonies. Based on mean separation distances between colonies following a circumpolar distribution, and known foraging ranges, we suggest that there may yet be six undiscovered breeding locations with half of these in Eastern and the remainder in Western Antarctica. Productivity in these regions suggests that food resources are likely to sustain emperor penguin populations. Our analysis highlights a fundamental requirement, that in order to predict how species might respond to regional climate change, we must better understand their biogeography and the factors that lead to their occupation of particular sites. Regarding emperor penguins, remote sensing should target the identified gaps apparently devoid of penguins in order to update the total number of colonies, to re-evaluate both the regional and global population of emperor penguins, and to gain a better understanding of their biogeography. © 2017

ABSTRACT: The African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) is the only penguin species that breeds on the African continent and it is currently classified as endangered. Its conservation is assisted by the Southern African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds (SANCCOB) which is a seabird rehabilitation facility based at the Rietvlei Wetland Reserve in Tableview, Cape Town. Despite the success of SANCCOB in rehabilitating diseased, injured or oiled penguins, significant mortalities have occurred at the facility as a result of avian malaria. Avian malaria can be contracted during rehabilitation during which penguins are inadvertently exposed to additional threats. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to assess the anti-Plasmodium antibody levels of penguins to avian malaria on entry into the SANCCOB facility from 2001 to 2004 and during their rehabilitation process. Using blood smear data, avian malaria prevalence and malaria-related deaths were also monitored from 2002 to 2013. Significant increases in anti-Plasmodium antibody levels after admission were found during summer months. New infection and not parasite recrudescence was concluded to be the cause of this increase. This source was confirmed by a dramatic drop in penguin mortalities upon exclusion of mosquito vectors in 2008. Mortalities did not depend on the birds' abilities to produce an anti-Plasmodium antibody response and oiling had no influence on immunity or prevalence of avian malaria infections. This study highlights the importance of mosquito vector control to control pathogen exposure in wild bird rehabilitation centres. © 2017 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: In isolated areas without direct human impact where several species of seabirds nest, transformations affecting the soil come mainly from natural processes, such as chemical enrichment caused by seabirds. Penguins constitute an important bird biomass in the Southern Hemisphere, where they breed in colonies on different sites from 100 to thousands of individuals. The accumulation of trace elements and nutrients in soils within two perennial colonies of Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) located in north western Chile and three colonies of Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) in the Antarctic Peninsula area were investigated here. Surface soil samples were collected directly from nesting sites. Control samples were taken outside the colonies within sites adjacent to the nesting areas, but not affected by bird excrement. The contents of Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, Sr, V and Zn were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. Ammonium (NH4) and nitrate (NO3) ions were determined colorimetrically. Extractable potassium (K) was determined by flame emission spectrometry, and available phosphorus (Olsen-P) was determined by spectrophotometry. The highest concentrations of trace metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mo, V and Zn) and macronutrients (available N, K and P), along with an increase in salinity and acidity levels, were found directly below the seabird colony, a situation occurring in northern Chile as well as in the Antarctic Peninsula area, highlighting the role that penguins have as bio-vectors on generating geochemical changes in different ecosystems. Some terrestrial plants and animals that live near those penguin colonies might be affected at a greater level than the organisms that live in sites similar but distant from colonies of birds. New data about the role of these species of seabirds as bio-vectors of chemical contaminants are added. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: Background: The sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Archipelago (46°53′S, 37°52′E), consisting of Marion and Prince Edward islands, is situated in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean, approximately 2 600 km away from the closest Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) breeding locality, Bouvet Island (54°25′S; 3°22′E). Methods: Two opportunistic sightings of an Adélie penguin at Marion Island on 28 October 2015 at Ship's Cove and Transvaal Cove, at 9 am and 5 pm respectively. Results and Conclusions: This is the first record of an Adélie penguin at Marion Island. An Adélie penguin was observed twice on the same day at two separate beaches approximately 2.5 km apart and appeared to be in good health. We assumed that the same penguin has been sighted twice due to the time lapse between the two sightings. Previously, 29 vagrant bird species have been recorded at Marion Island, including chinstrap (Pygoscelis Antarctica) and Magellanic (Spheniscus magellanicus) penguins. Extralimital sightings of penguins, as observed in this study, could potentially be a result of navigational errors due to severe storms or anomalous ocean conditions acting independently or in concert with other factors such as young age or poor health. © The Author(s). 2017.

ABSTRACT: Climate change is a global issue with effects that are difficult to manage at a regional scale. Yet more often than not climate factors are just some of multiple stressors affecting species on a population level. Non-climatic factors-especially those of anthropogenic origins-may play equally important roles with regard to impacts on species and are often more feasible to address. Here we assess the influence of climate change on population trends of the endangered Yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes) over the last 30 years, using a Bayesian model. Sea surface temperature (SST) proved to be the dominating factor influencing survival of both adult birds and fledglings. Increasing SST since the mid-1990s was accompanied by a reduction in survival rates and population decline. The population model showed that 33% of the variation in population numbers could be explained by SST alone, significantly increasing pressure on the penguin population. Consequently, the population becomes less resilient to non-climate related impacts, such as fisheries interactions, habitat degradation and human disturbance. However, the extent of the contribution of these factors to declining population trends is extremely difficult to assess principally due to the absence of quantifiable data, creating a discussion bias towards climate variables, and effectively distracting from non-climate factors that can be managed on a regional scale to ensure the viability of the population. © 2017 Mattern et al.

ABSTRACT: Piscivorous species like the Little Penguin (Eudyptula minor) are particularly at risk of being negatively impacted by pollution due to their heightened exposure through aquatic food chains. Therefore, determining the concentration of heavy metals in the fish prey of seabirds is an essential component of assessing such risk. In this study, we report on arsenic, cadmium, mercury, lead and selenium concentrations in three fish species, which are known to comprise a substantial part of the diet of Little Penguins at the urban colony of St Kilda, Melbourne, Australia. Metal concentrations in the fish sampled were generally within the expected limits, however, arsenic and mercury were higher than reported elsewhere. Anchovy (Engraulis australis) and sandy sprat (Hyperlophus vittatus) contained higher Hg concentrations than pilchard (Sardinops sagax), while sandy sprat and pilchard contained more selenium. We present these findings together with metal concentrations in Little Penguin blood and faeces, sampled within weeks of the fish collection. Mercury concentrations were highest in the blood, while faeces and fish prey species contained similar concentrations of arsenic and lead, suggesting faeces as a primary route of detoxification for these elements. We also investigated paired blood - faecal samples and found a correlation for selenium only. Preliminary data from stable isotope ratios in penguin blood indicate that changes in penguin blood mercury concentrations cannot be explained by trophic changes in their diet alone, suggesting a variation of bioavailable Hg within this semi-enclosed bay. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) are native to Argentina, Chile and the Falkland Islands. Magellanic penguins are highly susceptible to blood parasites such as the mosquito-borne Plasmodium spp., which have been documented causing high morbidity and mortality in zoos and rehabilitation centres. However, to date no blood parasites have been detected in wild Magellanic penguins, and it is not clear whether this is reflective of their true absence or is instead related to an insufficiency in sampling effort or a failure of the diagnostic methods. We examined blood smears of 284 Magellanic penguins from the Argentinean coast and tested their blood samples with nested polymerase chain reaction tests targeting Haemoproteus, Plasmodium, Leucocytozoon and Babesia. No blood parasites were detected. Analysing the sampling effort of previous studies and the climatogeography of the region, we found there is strong basis to conclude that haemosporidians do not infect wild Magellanic penguins on the Argentinean coast. However, at present it is not possible to determine whether such parasites occur on the Chilean coast and at the Falkland Islands. Furthermore, it is troubling that the northward distribution expansion of Magellanic penguins and the poleward distribution shift of vectors may lead to novel opportunities for the transmission of blood parasites. © 2017 Cambridge University Press.

ABSTRACT: Species endangered by rapid climate change may persist by tracking their optimal habitat; this depends on their dispersal characteristics. The Emperor penguin (EP) is an Antarctic seabird threatened by future sea ice change, currently under consideration for listing under the US Endangered Species Act. Indeed, a climate-dependent-demographic model without dispersion projects that many EP colonies will decline by more than 50% from their current size by 2100, resulting in a dramatic global population decline. Here we assess whether or not dispersion could act as an ecological rescue, i.e. reverse the anticipated global population decline projected by a model without dispersion. To do so, we integrate detailed dispersal processes in a metapopulation model—specifically, dispersal stages, dispersal distance, habitat structure, informed dispersal behaviors, and density-dependent dispersion rates. For EP, relative to a scenario without dispersion, dispersal can either offset or accelerate climate driven population declines; dispersal may increase the global population by up to 31% or decrease it by 65%, depending on the rate of emigration and distance individuals disperse. By developing simpler theoretical models, we demonstrate that the global population dynamic depends on the global landscape quality. In addition, the interaction among dispersal processes - dispersion rates, dispersal distance, and dispersal decisions - that influence landscape occupancy, impacts the global population dynamics. Our analyses bound the impact of between-colony emigration on global population size, and provide intuition as to the direction of population change depending on the EP dispersal characteristics. Our general model is flexible such that multiple dispersal scenarios could be implemented for a wide range of species to improve our understanding and predictions of species persistence under future global change. © 2017

ABSTRACT: Many species of Eudyptes penguin have shown substantial population declines and in response, there have been efforts to identify the key demographic parameters. Here, we present the demographic parameters of one of the least well known and the least abundant species of crested penguin, the endangered Fiordland crested penguin Eudyptes pachyrhynchus. A population study incorporating mark–recapture, nest occupancy and breeding success was conducted over 16 years at several sites in the northern half of the range of the species. Survival probabilities were calculated using standard Cormack–Jolly–Seber models and the Burnham Live and Dead model. The annual probability of true survival for banded birds and apparent survival for birds with transponders were both estimated at 89% during their adult years, which is similar to that reported for Eudyptes penguin species inhabiting more southerly latitudes. Annual juvenile survival was assessed for Fiordland crested penguins until their first return at 77%. The mean breeding success (0.61 ± 0.02 chicks/pair) was higher than is observed for other crested penguin species, except the southern rockhopper penguin, which may be due to having lower A-egg ejection rates and higher rates of fledging two chicks per pair. Breeding success was related to the niche of predators present. © 2017 Crown copyright New Zealand Government.

ABSTRACT: There are seven emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) colonies distributed throughout the traditional boundaries of the Ross Sea from Cape Roget to Cape Colbeck. This coastline is c. 10% of the entire coast of Antarctica. From 2000 to 2012, there has been a nearly continuous record of population size of most, and sometimes all, of these colonies. Data were obtained by analysing aerial photographs. We found large annual variations in populations of individual colonies, and conclude that a trend from a single emperor penguin colony may not be a good environmental sentinel. There are at least four possibilities for census count fluctuations: i) this species is not bound to a nesting site like other penguins, and birds move within the colony and possibly to other colonies, ii) harsh environmental conditions cause a die-off of chicks in the colony or of adults elsewhere, iii) the adults skip a year of breeding if pre-breeding foraging is inadequate and iv) if sea ice conditions are unsatisfactory at autumn arrival of the adults, they skip breeding or go elsewhere. Such variability indicates that birds at all Ross Sea colonies should be counted annually if there is to be any possibility of understanding the causes of population changes. © 2017 Antarctic Science Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Tear production and intraocular pressures (IOPs) were determined in 38 and 102 wild Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti), respectively, from the Punta San Juan Marine Protected Area in Ica, Peru. Tear production was measured by Schirmer tear test, and IOP was measured with a TonoVet rebound tonometer. Adult (n = 90) and chick (n = 12) penguins were sampled from 2 different beaches (north and south facing) during 2 sampling years (2010 and 2011). Results showed a mean ± SD (range) of 9 ± 4 (2-20) mm/min for tear production and 28 ± 9 (3-49) mm Hg for IOP. Tear production in penguins differed between beach and sex, whereas IOP differed between age, year, and beach. The IOPs were negatively correlated with packed cell volume. Tear production and IOP values had greater variation in this population than it has in other avian species. Previous investigations of IOP and tear production in Spheniscus species were conducted with birds housed under professional care in artificial marine and freshwater environments. This is the first study, to our knowledge, investigating tear production and IOP in wild penguins and establishes valuable reference intervals for this species. © 2017 by the Association of Avian Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: A novel avian alphaherpesvirus, preliminarily designated sphenicid alphaherpesvirus 1 (SpAHV-1), has been independently isolated from juvenile Humboldt and African penguins (Spheniscus humboldti and Spheniscus demersus) kept in German zoos suffering from diphtheroid oropharyngitis/laryngotracheitis and necrotizing enteritis (collectively designated as penguindiphtheria-like disease). High-throughput sequencing was used to determine the complete genome sequences of the first two SpAHV-1 isolates. SpAHV-1 comprises a class D genome with a length of about 164 kbp, a G+C content of 45.6 mol% and encodes 86 predicted ORFs. Taxonomic association of SpAHV-1 to the genus Mardivirus was supported by gene content clustering and phylogenetic analysis of herpesvirus core genes. The presented results imply that SpAHV-1 could be the primary causative agent of penguin-diphtheria-like fatal diseases in banded penguins. These results may serve as a basis for the development of diagnostic tools in order to investigate similar cases of penguin diphtheria in wild and captive penguins. © 2017 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: An eighteen-month-old female Humboldt penguin (Spheniscus humboldti) that was 50 cm in length and 4.5 kg in weight was presented with anorexia and vomiting. The hematological and blood biochemical profiles revealed no remarkable findings, and no Salmonella, Shigella or Vibrio spp. were isolated from the fecal culture. However, radiographic imaging revealed a long linear foreign body presenting from the lower esophagus to the stomach. To retrieve this foreign body, flexible endoscopic extraction was performed using flexible rat tooth grasping forceps. A long bamboo stick (29 × 1 cm) was removed from the stomach, and the penguin fully recovered. © 2017 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: Temperature is a primary determinant of biogeographic patterns and ecosystem processes. Standard techniques to study the ocean temperature in situ are, however, particularly limited by their time and spatial coverage, problems which might be partially mitigated by using marine top predators as biological platforms for oceanographic sampling. We used small archival tags deployed on 33 Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus), and obtained 21,070 geo-localized profiles of water temperature, during late spring of 2008, 2011, 2012 and 2013; in a region of the North Patagonian Sea with limited oceanographic records in situ. We compared our in situ data of sea surface temperature (SST) with those available from satellite remote sensing; to describe the three-dimensional temperature fields around the area of influence of two important tidal frontal systems; and to study the inter-annual variation in the three-dimensional temperature fields. There was a strong positive relationship between satellite- and animal-derived SST data although there was an overestimation by remote-sensing by a maximum difference of +2 °C. Little inter-annual variability in the 3-dimensional temperature fields was found, with the exception of 2012 (and to a lesser extent in 2013) where the SST was significantly higher. In 2013, we found weak stratification in a region which was unexpected. In addition, during the same year, a warm small-scale vortex is indicated by the animal-derived temperature data. This allowed us to describe and better understand the dynamics of the water masses, which, so far, have been mainly studied by remote sensors and numerical models. Our results highlight again the potential of using marine top predators as biological platforms to collect oceanographic data, which will enhance and accelerate studies on the Southwest Atlantic Ocean. In a changing world, threatened by climate change, it is urgent to fill information gaps on the coupled ocean-atmosphere system allowing to link the hydrothermal process to the at-sea distribution of top predators. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Identification of factors causing population declines is a critical prerequisite for conserving threatened species. The most likely cause of dramatic decreases in numbers of the ‘Vulnerable’ Southern Rockhopper Penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome) in the twentieth century is oceanographic change reducing food availability. For example, the massive decline of the Eastern sub-species (E. c. filholi) on Campbell Island, New Zealand (94.6 %, 1942–2012), has been attributed to climate change. This decline reversed in the mid-1990s after a shift to favourable conditions, but a localized decline continued at a small, fragmented population in Penguin Bay, where one of five sub-colonies went extinct in 2010, and the number of breeding pairs fell from 7360 in 1984 to 3012 in 2012. Emerging concerns for Eudyptes penguins are the effects of increased predation from native predators. At Campbell Island, monitoring demonstrated that penguin eggs and chicks in smaller sub-colonies were most vulnerable to predation by Brown Skuas (Catharacta antarctica lonnbergi), so that average reproductive success was 25 % lower at the smallest sub-colony than at the largest. ‘Endangered’ New Zealand sea lions (Phocarctos hookeri) were estimated to depredate 6 % of the adult penguin population each year, which modelling identified as the most important driver of the population’s negative exponential growth rate (λ = 0.905, −9.5 % per year). Although occasional years of very poor food availability may exert a larger ‘bottom–up’ effect on penguin demographic rates, the ‘top–down’ effects of high avian and pinniped predation rates can be sufficient to drive the decline of small penguin populations. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: The Mapping Application for Penguin Populations and Projected Dynamics (MAPPPD) is a web-based, open access, decision-support tool designed to assist scientists, non-governmental organisations and policy-makers working to meet the management objectives as set forth by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) and other components of the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) (that is, Consultative Meetings and the ATS Committee on Environmental Protection). MAPPPD was designed specifically to complement existing efforts such as the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program (CEMP) and the ATS site guidelines for visitors. The database underlying MAPPPD includes all publicly available (published and unpublished) count data on emperor, gentoo, Adélie and chinstrap penguins in Antarctica. Penguin population models are used to assimilate available data into estimates of abundance for each site and year. Results are easily aggregated across multiple sites to obtain abundance estimates over any user-defined area of interest. A front end web interface located at www.penguinmap.com provides free and ready access to the most recent count and modelled data, and can act as a facilitator for data transfer between scientists and Antarctic stakeholders to help inform management decisions for the continent. © Cambridge University Press 2017.

ABSTRACT: Magellanic penguins, Spheniscus magellanicus, are frequently found along the coast of Brazil during the winter migration. However, there are very few ecological studies of the parasite fauna of these birds, especially of the adults, which are found dead on Brazilian beaches. Moreover, no studies of parasites of the Magellanic penguins found on the Brazilian coast have evaluated adult or larval nematodes during winter migration so far. Thus, this work is the first one to investigate the parasitism by anisakid nematodes comparatively between young and adult specimens of S. magellanicus in southern Brazil. Parasitological indexes were compared in relation to host gender, parasite development stage and gender, and sites of infection. The gastrointestinal tract of 36 specimens of Magellanic penguins found dead along the coast of Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul states, were analyzed. The nematode fauna was composed of a single species, the anisakid, Contracaecum pelagicum. In Rio Grande do Sul, the young specimens of S. magellanicus were more intensely and abundantly parasitized by C. pelagicum than the adult ones. The stomach and the intestine were the organs that showed highest mean density of infection by adult and larval nematodes, respectively, in the hosts collected in both locations. A high prevalence was observed in both areas, although no differences in the parasitism between male and female penguins were detected. The young Magellanic penguins found in Paraná were on average less parasitized than the ones found in Rio Grande do Sul. These results, together with data available in the literature, suggest a latitudinal variation in the parasitological indexes of C. pelagicum, which are related to changes in the diet of the Magellanic penguins during their winter migration in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean. © 2017, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ).

ABSTRACT: In many bird species, eggs in a brood hatch within days of each other, leading to a size asymmetry detrimental to younger siblings. Hatching asynchrony is often thought of as an adaptive strategy, and the most widely studied hypothesis in relation to this is the ‘brood reduction hypothesis’. This hypothesis states that when food resources are unpredictable, hatching asynchrony will allow the adjustment of the brood size maximizing fledging success and benefitting parents. The Magellanic penguin Spheniscus magellanicus is an appropriate species to test this hypothesis because it has a 2-egg clutch that hatches over a 2-d interval with a broad range of variation (–1 to 4 d), it shows facultative brood reduction, and food abundance between breeding seasons is variable. We performed a manipulative study at Isla Quiroga, Argentina, during three breeding seasons (2010–2012) by forcing broods to hatch synchronously (0 d) or asynchronously (2 or 4 d). Years were categorized based on estimated food abundance. Our study provided mixed results because in the low estimated food abundance year asynchronous broods did not have higher nestling survival than synchronous broods, and the second-hatchling in asynchronous broods did not die more often than those in synchronous broods. On the other hand, younger siblings of 4-d asynchronous broods starved earlier than those of synchronous broods, and 2-d asynchronous broods fledged heavier young than synchronous broods. Asynchronous hatching would seem to benefit reproduction in this species, not with respect to survival, but in terms of the advantages it can accord to nestlings and, in terms of lower costs, for parents raising nestlings. © 2017 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Detailed information on the emperor penguin colonies is crucial for estimating total populations and analysing population migration. This study presents a new method for detecting colonies of emperor penguins by identifying areas covered with their faeces using Landsat 8 data. Top of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance and Brightness Temperature (BT) of Landsat images are used as inputs. This method first uses normalized spectral indexes (normalized difference water index (NDWI), normalized difference faeces index (NDFI), normalized difference snow index (NDSI)), band ratios and an individual band reflectance to produce probability masks for areas covered by faeces differentiating from other land cover types. Then, after eliminating those pixels that have abnormal elevations and performing a median filter, the probability masks for those areas covered by faeces are used to derive the corresponding polygons. Subsequently, the geometric centre of the polygons of those areas covered by faeces is used as the location for a corresponding colony. For a widely distributed set of data around the Ross and Somov Seas, the overall classification accuracy is as high as 91% with a small standard deviation of 0.12. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) levels were determined in the faeces of three Antarctic Peninsula penguin species to assess viability as a non-invasive approach for sampling PCBs in Antarctic biota. These determinations were complemented with stable isotope and porphyrins assessments, and together this methodology determined the role of diet and metabolic disruption in penguins. Up to 60% of the collected faecal samples evidenced low molecular weight PCBs, of which, the more volatile compounds were predominant, in agreement with previous results. The highest PCB levels were reported in the gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua; 35.3 ng g− 1 wet weight average), followed by the chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarctica; 6.4 ng g− 1 wet weight average) and Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae; 12.9 ng g− 1 wet weight average). Stable isotope analyses (δ15N and δ13C) demonstrated that gentoo feeding and foraging habits differed from those of Adélie and chinstrap penguins. A strong positive correlation was found between PCB concentrations and δ15N, indicating the role of diet on the observed pollutant levels. Porphyrins metabolite levels were also directly correlated with PCB concentrations. These results suggest that PCB levels impair the health of Antarctic penguins. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Previous studies on a limited number of birds suggested that the IgD-encoding gene was absent in birds. However, one of our recent studies showed that the gene was definitely expressed in the ostrich and emu. Interestingly, we also identified subclass diversification of IgM and IgY in these two birds. To better understand immunoglobulin genes in birds, in this study, we analyzed the immunoglobulin heavy chain genes in the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) and Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua), belonging respectively to the order Passeriformes, the most successful bird order in terms of species diversity and numbers, and Sphenisciformes, a relatively primitive avian order. Similar to the results obtained in chickens and ducks, only three genes encoding immunoglobulin heavy chain isotypes, IgM, IgA and IgY, were identified in both species. Besides, we detected a transcript encoding a short membrane-bound IgA lacking the last two CH exons in the Gentoo penguin. We did not find any evidence supporting the presence of IgD gene or subclass diversification of IgM/IgY in penguin or zebra finch. The obtained data in our study provide more insights into the immunoglobulin heavy chain genes in birds and may help to better understand the evolution of immunoglobulin genes in tetrapods. © 2017 Han et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.

ABSTRACT: When monitoring species with extensive ranges in harsh climates, comprehensive studies across a species' range are both logistically and technically challenging and therefore rare. Such scarcity in data collection is particularly true in the polar regions where sea ice and weather constraints prevent widespread access to sites for much of the year, specifically during winter. Penguins (Spheniscidae) show large variations in winter strategies with many species migrating long distances while others are distinctly sedentary, remaining at the colony year-round. However, in some species, their attendance at the breeding site during the nonbreeding winter period depends greatly on the colony location and environmental factors. Here we aim to examine fluctuations in winter attendance at the breeding site in Gentoo Penguins (Pygoscelis papua) along a latitudinal gradient of 7 sites, ranging from Martillo Island, a colony in Argentina, to Petermann Island, a colony located toward the southern edge of the species' range on the Western Antarctic Peninsula. We use an established network of cameras to observe winter populations of penguins across a large latitudinal gradient. This study provides the first evidence of across-year variation in Gentoo Penguin nonbreeding attendance at the breeding site. We found that both temporal and spatial factors drive winter attendance in this species with distinct patterns between years and colony locations, particularly at the edges of its range. Additionally, environmental and temporal factors, including sea ice extent directly offshore and photoperiod, appear to dictate Gentoo Penguin winter attendance across their range. As Gentoo Penguins are neither sedentary nor migratory during the nonbreeding period, understanding patterns in winter site occupation across time and space provides insight into half of the species' annual cycle and has important implications in the face of changes in climate, direct human disturbance, and fisheries activities. © 2017 American Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Although many studies have investigated organohalogenated contaminants (OHCs) in yolk, little is known about the mechanisms and timing of transfer of OHCs from the female to the egg. Vitellogenin, a yolk precursor, has been suggested to play a role in this transport. We here report for the first time the temporal changes in OHC and an index of vitellogenin concentrations in female plasma from the pre-laying period to clutch completion in free-living birds: the southern rockhopper penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome) breeding in the Falkland/Malvinas Islands. In addition, OHC concentrations in the corresponding clutches were analysed. OHC concentrations in female plasma and in the yolk of both the first (A-) and the second (B-)eggs followed a similar pattern, with hexachlorobenzene (HCB) > Σpolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) > Σdichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) > Σmethoxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers (MeO-PBDEs) > Σchlordanes (CHLs) > Σpolybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) ≈ Σhexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs). The higher concentrations of MeO-PBDEs compared to PBDEs indicate a diet containing naturally-produced MeO-PBDEs. All OHC compounds except for PBDEs increased from the pre-laying period to A-egg laying and subsequently declined from A-egg laying to B-egg laying, and female plasma vitellogenin showed the same pattern. For ΣPCBs and ΣMeO-PBDEs, we found positive correlations between female plasma during A-egg laying and both eggs, and for HCB between female plasma and A-eggs only. During pre-laying, only ΣMeO-PBDEs correlated between both eggs and female plasma, and no correlations between OHC concentrations in eggs and female plasma were found during B-egg laying, highlighting that maternal transfer of OHCs is time- and compound-specific. Finally, female vitellogenin concentrations did not significantly correlate with any OHC compounds in either female plasma or eggs, and our results therefore did not confirm the suggested role of vitellogenin in the maternal transfer of OHC molecules into their eggs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Increasing evidence suggests that penguins are sensitive to dimethyl sulphide (DMS), a scented airborne compound that a variety of marine animals use to find productive areas of the ocean where prey is likely to be found. Here we present data showing that king penguins Aptenodytes patagonicus are also sensitive to DMS. We deployed DMS on a lake near a king penguin colony at Ratmanoff beach in the Kerguelen archipelago. We also presented DMS to ‘sleeping’ adults on the beach. On the lake, penguins responded to the DMS deployments by swimming more, while on the beach, penguins twitched their heads and woke up more for the DMS than for the control presentations. Interestingly, penguins did not respond to cod liver oil deployments on the lake; mirroring at-sea studies of other penguins. Although at-sea studies are needed to confirm that king penguins use DMS as a surface cue that informs them of productivity under the water, this study is an important first step in understanding how these birds locate prey over significant distances. © 2016 The Authors

ABSTRACT: King penguins make up the bulk of avian biomass on a number of sub-Antarctic islands where they have a large functional effect on terrestrial and marine ecosystems. The same applies at Marion Island where a substantial proportion of the world population breeds. In spite of their obvious ecological importance, the at-sea distribution and behavior of this population has until recently remained entirely unknown. In addressing this information deficiency, we deployed satellite-linked tracking instruments on 15 adult king penguins over 2 years, April 2008 and 2013, to study their post-guard foraging distribution and habitat preferences. Uniquely among adult king penguins, individuals by and large headed out against the prevailing Antarctic Circumpolar Current, foraging to the west and southwest of the island. On average, individuals ventured a maximum distance of 1,600 km from the colony, with three individuals foraging close to, or beyond, 3,500 km west of the colony. Birds were mostly foraging south of the Antarctic Polar Front and north of the southern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Habitat preferences were assessed using boosted regression tree models which indicated sea surface temperate, depth, and chorophyll a concentration to be the most important predictors of habitat selection. Interestingly, king penguins rapidly transited the eddy-rich area to the west of Marion Island, associated with the Southwest Indian Ocean Ridge, which has been shown to be important for foraging in other marine top predators. In accordance with this, the king penguins generally avoided areas with high eddy kinetic energy. The results from this first study into the behavioral ecology and at-sea distribution of king penguins at Marion Island contribute to our broader understanding of this species. © 2017 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: We investigated an epidemic mortality cluster of yellow-eyed penguins (Megadyptes antipodes) that involved 67 moribund or dead birds found on various beaches of the Otago Peninsula, New Zealand, between 21 January and 20 March 2013. Twenty-four carcases were examined post-mortem. Histological lesions of pulmonary, hepatic and splenic erythrophagocytosis and haemosiderosis were found in 23 of 24 birds. Fifteen birds also had haemoglobin-like protein droplets within renal tubular epithelial cells. Despite consistent histological lesions, a cause of death could not be established. Virology, bacteriology and molecular tests for avian influenza, avian paramyxovirus-1, avipoxvirus, Chlamydia psittaci, Plasmodium spp., Babesia spp., Leucocytozoon spp. and Toxoplasma gondii were negative. Tissue concentrations of a range of heavy metals (n = 4 birds) were consistent with low level exposure, while examination of proventricular contents and mucus failed to detect any marine biotoxins or Clostridium botulinum toxin. Hepatic concentrations of total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (n = 5 birds) were similar to background concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons previously found in yellow-eyed penguins from the South Island of New Zealand, but there were significantly higher concentrations of 1-methylnapthelene and 2-methylnapthelene in the birds found dead in this mortality cluster. The biological significance of this finding is unclear. A temporal investigation of the epidemic did not indicate either a common source or propagative epidemic pattern. Although our investigation did not definitively implicate a toxic or infectious agent, we could not rule out causes such as toxic marine organisms or mycoplasmosis. Further investigations should therefore by carried out in the event of future mortality clusters. © 2017 Houghton Trust Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Diphtheritic stomatitis is a seasonal disease that has been recognized as a syndrome in Yellow-eyed Penguin (Megadyptes antipodes) chicks in New Zealand for >10 yr. It was present in about 50% of 234 chicks examined since 2002 and is characterized by a thick serocellular exudate in the oral cavity of 1–4-wk-old chicks. The syndrome includes inanition, weight loss, and death in many affected birds. Microscopically, the lesions varied in severity. Most affected chicks had severe, locally extensive, ulcerative stomatitis with large amounts of exudate containing numerous bacteria; a smaller number had mild focal lesions with smaller amounts of exudate and bacteria. Although Corynebacterium amycolatum has been consistently isolated from the oral lesions, it was also present in the oral cavity of 34% of normal adult penguins and their chicks and is not known to possess diphtheritic toxins. A primary viral pathogen was therefore suspected, and intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies were occasionally seen in oral mucosal epithelial cells. No herpesvirus DNA was detected with PCR. Avipoxvirus DNA and an unidentified virus-like agent were detected in some early oral lesions, but could not be confirmed in subsequent testing. Electron microscopy on early affected epithelium with intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies was unrewarding. Our findings raise the possibility that the disease is caused by an unknown primary virus infection followed by secondary Corynebacterium invasion, but this requires confirmation. The means of transmission has not been established but insect vectors are suspected. © Wildlife Disease Association 2017.

ABSTRACT: It is generally expected that animals, including marine organisms, travel at speeds achieving the minimum energetic cost of transport. However, several factors cause variation in speeds within the energetically acceptable range. Light intensity is known to affect movement speeds in some flying and walking insects, which reduce speeds at low light levels. This is explained as compensation for degraded temporal resolution of vision in dim light by maintaining the rate of information gained per unit of travelling distance. Such a relationship between ambient light intensity and movement speeds is expected for any visual system in principle, but has not been examined in any marine species. As a mesopelagic forager, king penguins Aptenodytes patagonicus regularly commute between their breeding colonies and productive foraging areas over several hundreds of kilometres. During these trips, they experience a wide variation in light intensity between day and night, as well as within daylight hours, as dives often reach deeper than 100 m. The present study investigated diel patterns in the swim speeds of king penguins in relation to light intensity experienced within dives. King penguins gradually decreased their cruising speeds around dusk and increased them again around dawn. This resulted in consistently slower speeds in nocturnal dives. Correspondingly, the underwater light levels estimated were always higher in diurnal dives, even at depths greater than 100 m. The slower swim speeds after dusk may facilitate travelling and occasional prey detection in the dark. These results suggest that a common behavioural response to ambient light levels has evolved in different taxa of animals. © Inter-Research 2016.

ABSTRACT: Humans are unable to survive low temperature environments without custom designed clothing and support systems. In contrast, certain penguin species inhabit extremely cold climates without losing substantial energy to self-heating (emperor penguins ambient temperature plummets to as low as −45 °C). Penguins accomplish this task by relying on distinct anatomical, physiological and behavioral adaptations. One such adaptation is a blood vessel heat exchanger called the ‘Rete Tibiotarsale’ – an intermingled network of arteries and veins found in penguins’ legs. The Rete existence results in blood occupying the foot expressing a lower average temperature and thus the penguin loosing less heat to the ground. This study examines the Rete significance for the species thermal endurance. The penguin anatomy (leg and main blood vessels) is reconstructed using data chiefly based on the Humboldt species. The resulting model is thermally analyzed using finite element (COMSOL) with the species environment used as boundary conditions. A human-like blood vessel configuration, scaled to the penguin's dimensions, is used as a control for the study. Results indicate that the Rete existence facilitates upkeep of 25−65% of the species total metabolic energy production as compared with the human-like configuration; thus making the Rete probably crucial for penguin thermal endurance. Here, we quantitatively link for the first time the function and structure of this remarkable physiological phenotype. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The in vitro and in vivo functionality of cryopreserved spermatozoa was examined over two breeding seasons in a zoological colony of Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus). Frozen-thawed semen was inseminated into five anesthetized females, over a total of eight egg production cycles, with a different male used for each artificial insemination (AI) within each season. Females were maintained within the colony in cordoned nest sites to prevent copulation with their paired male, and were inseminated every 3-10 days until the first oviposition. Semen frozen from seven males using a straw method retained 39.8%, 25.7%, 74.0%, and 52.1% of its initial total motility, progressive motility, average path velocity, and plasma membrane integrity, respectively. Normal morphology of motile cells was reduced (P < 0.05) during freeze-thawing from 76.7% immediately prior to freezing to 65.3% post-thawing. Conceptive females received 1.6 ± 0.2 inseminations before the first oviposition, with 19.2 ± 1.6 × 10(6) motile, morphologically normal spermatozoa per insemination. Overall fertility was 53.3% (8/15 eggs), hatchability was 50.0% (4/8), and genetic analyses confirmed that all embryos and hatchlings were sired by the AI male. Fertile eggs were laid at 4.0-12.1 days after AI, indicating that frozen-thawed spermatozoa resided in the female reproductive tract for up to ∼7.2 days prior to fertilization. Results demonstrate that frozen-thawed Magellanic penguin spermatozoa are fully functional in vivo and support the use of genome banking and AI as tools for managing the sustainability of zoological penguin populations.

ABSTRACT: Nine Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti), between 1 and 1.5 years old and kept at Zoo Dresden, developed local and systemic infections with various opportunistic pathogens within a period of 4 months. Affected birds died peracutely without preceding symptoms or showed various clinical signs, including separation from conspecifics, reduced food intake, lethargy, dyspnea, swelling of the salt glands, and ocular discharge. One bird showed central nervous signs, including seizures. Pathologic examination of deceased birds revealed severe necrotizing inflammation of the mucous membranes and deep structures of the glottis, trachea, nasal sinus, and conchae and granulomatous inflammation of the salt glands. Further findings were airsacculitis, pneumonia, hepatitis, conjunctivitis, and myositis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the predominant pathogen in 7 cases. Six penguins died or were euthanatized, whereas 3 penguins that received systemic antibiotic treatment with tobramycin (10 mg/kg IM q24h for 10 days) showed rapid clinical improvement. Insufficient turnover rate of the filtration system, biofilm formation on pipe surfaces, and other factors are assumed to have promoted pathogen buildup in the pool water and subsequent infection. © 2016 by the Association of Avian Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: ABSTRACT: We describe new plotopterids (Aves, Plotopteridae) from late Eocene and Oligocene strata in western Washington State, U.S.A. The specimens belong to four new species of these flightless, wing-propelled seabirds, three of which are named and assigned to two new supraspecific taxa, Olympidytes, gen. nov., and Klallamornis, gen. nov. We confirm previous observations on a high diversity of plotopterids in the Paleogene of North America, but because the fossils are from different formations, it remains elusive how many of the six currently recognized species from western Washington actually coexisted. Tonsala, the only previously described plotopterid taxon from the Olympic Peninsula, is likely to occupy a more basal phylogenetic position than the other plotopterids of this geographic area. Olympidytes and Klallamornis may be successive sister taxa of Copepteryx and Hokkaidornis from the late Oligocene of Japan, but a determination of the exact affinities of the new taxa requires the discovery of further fossils. Notably, the geochronologically youngest plotopterid, the early Miocene Plotopterum, differs from earlier taxa in plesiomorphic features and is here considered to be among the phylogenetically most basal plotopterids. The late Eocene basal Phocavis likewise temporally overlaps with more derived plotopterid taxa. The coexistence of basal and more derived plotopterids in the late Eocene may indicate a rapid evolution of plotopterids towards the late Eocene. The factors that allowed the persistence of basal taxa into the Miocene remain, however, elusive, and so are those that triggered the evolution of wing-propelled diving in these highly specialized birds.

ABSTRACT: Distinguishing morphologically cryptic taxa, by definition, requires genetic data such as DNA sequences. However, DNA sequences may not be obtained easily for taxa from remote sites. Here we provide the details of a high-resolution melt-curve-based method using taxon-specific primers that can distinguish two taxa of Adélie penguins, and that will be usable in Antarctica when combined with some of the newly developed field-deployable thermal cyclers. We suggest that the wider adoption of field-deployable polymerase-chain-reaction-based techniques will enable faster assignation of haplotype to individuals in situ, and so allow the targeting of observations and sample collection to specimens relevant to the research question. Targeting individuals will also reduce the need to repeatedly handle animals and reduce the time and travel required to complete field work. © 2016 The Royal Society of New Zealand.

ABSTRACT: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become a useful tool in polar research. While their performance is already proven, little is known about their impact on wildlife. To assess the disturbance caused on the penguins, flights with a UAV were conducted over an Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) colony. Vertical and horizontal flights were performed between 10 and 50 m in altitude. Penguins’ reactions were video-recorded, and the behavioural response was used to indicate the level of disturbance. During any flight mode, disturbance increased immediately after takeoff and remained elevated at all altitudes between 20 and 50 m. When the UAV descended below 20 m, the disturbance increased further with almost all individuals being vigilant. Only at these low altitudes, vertical flights caused an even higher level of disturbance than horizontal ones. Repetitions of horizontal overflights showed no short-term habituation occurring. Since the results are only valid for the specific UAV model used, we recommend a more extensive approach with different UAV specifications. As the highest flight altitudes already caused detectable but not subjectively visible responses, we also recommend to regard subjective impressions of disturbance with caution. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: A new incomplete penguin skeleton is described herein. It is assigned to Palaeeudyptes klekowskii Myrcha, Tatur and Del Valle, a giant sphenisciform from the Priabonian Submeseta Formation in Marambio/Seymour Island, Antarctic Peninsula. Also provided is a paleobiological discussion derived from the morphology of this skeleton. A thorough description of muscular origin and insertions, body mass, body length, and diving duration estimations support the hypothesis that the new specimen represents a marine bird with limited swimming skills wighing 40-44 kg and measuring 133.2-143.2 cm long.

ABSTRACT: With considerable focus on ecotourism's potential to contribute to conservation, it is increasingly important to understand the implications of ecological information in triggering sustainability-relevant attitudes and actions. This study assesses whether people who have ecological information regarding the negative impact of their recreational behavior on penguins' stress will choose to remain farther away from the penguins to avoid that impact although this option will reduce the personal benefits of their tourism experience. To answer this question, we use a choice experiment with three attributes related to "Humboldt penguin watching": (1) price of the experience, (2) distance at which penguins could be observed, and (3) penguin density. In addition, we used two treatments: with and without ecological information. We used a pooled data (with and without information) mixed logit model to identify the effect of providing or not providing information. Using a chi-square test, we first tested whether people in the sample with information chose different alternatives than those individuals without information. Furthermore, we evaluate whether the coefficient associated with the attributes of the mixed logit model, and therefore people's behavioral preferences, differs among samples. Results show that, irrespective of socio-demographic differences, visitors with information were more prone to select alternatives that reduce penguin stress, despite more educated, wealthier, and older people tend to increase their welfare when they choose being closer to the penguins. People without information never choose the alternative which results in a reduction of penguin stress. Ecological information is shown to reverse this trend, in fact, tourists perceived (on average) a welfare loss of CL$1099 (US$1.9) if he/she is too close to the penguins once information has been granted. These results are encouraging because they support the claim that well-defined educational and informational campaigns can have important effects on the way in which people behave in areas of interest for conservation. Granting ecological information can become an important tool to encourage conservation behavior, particularly in areas where support for enforcement is weak. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Investigating the responses of marine predators to environmental features is of key importance for understanding their foraging behaviour and reproductive success. In this study we examined the foraging behaviour of king penguins breeding at Kerguelen (southern Indian Ocean) in relation to oceanographic and bathymetric features within their foraging ambit. We used ARGOS and Global Positioning System tracking together with Time-Depth-Temperature-Recorders (TDR) to follow the at-sea movements of incubating and brooding king penguins. Combining the penguin behaviour with oceanographic data at the surface through satellite data and at depth through in-situ recordings by the TDRs enabled us to explore how these predators adjusted their horizontal and vertical foraging movements in response to their physical environment. Relating the observed behaviour and oceanographic patterns to local bathymetry lead to a comprehensive picture of the combined influence of bathymetry and meso-scale circulation on the foraging behaviour of king penguins. During both breeding stages king penguins foraged in the area to the south-east of Kerguelen, where they explored an influx of cold waters of southern origin interacting with the Kerguelen Plateau bathymetry. Foraging in the Polar Front and at the thermocline was associated with high prey capture rates. However, foraging trip orientation and water mass utilization suggested that bathymetrically entrained cold-water features provided the most favourable foraging locations. Our study explicitly reports the exploration of bathymetry-related oceanographic features by foraging king penguins. It confirms the presence of Areas of Ecological Significance for marine predators on the Kerguelen Plateau, and suggests the importance of further areas related to the cold-water flow along the shelf break of the Kerguelen Plateau. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: ABSTRACT: Avian malaria is a mosquito-borne disease caused by protozoans of the genus Plasmodium, and it is considered one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in captive penguins, both in zoological gardens and rehabilitation centres. Penguins are known to be highly susceptible to this disease, and outbreaks have been associated with mortality as high as 50–80% of affected captive populations within a few weeks. The disease has also been reported in wild penguin populations, however, its impacts on the health and fitness of penguins in the wild is not clear. This review provides an overview of the aetiology, life cycle and epidemiology of avian malaria, and provides details on the strategies that can be employed for the diagnostic, treatment and prevention of this disease in captive penguins, discussing possible directions for future research. © 2016 Houghton Trust Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Persistent organic pollutants (POPs), including polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PBDD/Fs), polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), have been identified in penguins, lichens, soils, and ornithogenic soils in the Antarctic coastal environment in this study. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has reported PBDD/F and PBB data from Antarctica. The POP mass contents in penguins were in the following order: PCBs >> PBDEs >> PCDD/Fs; PCBs were the dominant pollutants (6310–144,000 pg/g-lipid), with World Health Organization toxic equivalency values being 2–14 times higher than those of PCDD/Fs. Long-range atmospheric transport is the most primary route by which POPs travel to Antarctica; however, local sources, such as research activities and penguin colonies, also influence POP distribution in the local Antarctic environment. In penguins, the biomagnification factor (BMF) of PCBs was 61.3–3760, considerably higher than that for other POPs. According to BMF data in Adélie penguins, hydrophobic PBDE congeners were more biomagnified at log Kow > 6, and levels decreased at log Kow > 7.5 because larger molecular sizes inhibited transfer across cell membranes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Interannual variation in seabird foraging or reproductive behaviour may reflect fluctuations in marine resources. In this study, we evaluated different foraging and breeding parameters of Magellanic Penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) from Martillo Island in the Beagle Channel, and the relationships between these parameters at different stages within the season (incubation, early and late chick-rearing) over three consecutive breeding seasons (2006–2007, 2007–2008 and 2008–2009). In 2007, we observed greater adult foraging effort (longer foraging trip duration and vertical travel distance, VTD) and lower chick feeding frequency, together with a slower growth rate and later fledging date of chicks, which we suggest was linked to lower food availability near the colony that year. The increased foraging effort appeared to be compensated by enhanced feeding activity (e.g., number of wiggles per dive). However, this increase did not coincide with a larger amount of food load brought to colony, which may have been due to a change in the type or size of prey consumed by the penguins. Magellanic Penguins from Martillo Island showed great plasticity in foraging behaviour, as evidenced by changes in consumed prey type or increased foraging effort and feeding activity when the consumption of their main prey item, Sprattus fuegensis, seemed to decrease. Moreover, during this particular breeding season, although the growth rate of chicks was lower, the breeding success remained constant throughout the study period, suggesting that the penguins managed to compensate for the apparent decrease in Fuegian sprat. © 2016, Dt.

ABSTRACT: We evaluated the diet of Adélie (Pygoscelis adeliae) and gentoo (P. papua) penguins at Stranger Point colony (25 de Mayo/King George Island) during different stages of their annual cycle using the stable isotope method and the conventional dietary analyses (i.e. stomach contents). Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) dominated the diet of Adélie and gentoo penguins in all three studied stages (pre-breeding, breeding and post-breeding). Nevertheless, only in gentoo penguins a shift in the diet was evident from mainly krill during the breeding stage to mixed diet (i.e. krill and fish/squids) during the pre- and post-breeding stages. Results from stable isotopes suggest that Adélie penguins might be foraging in southern localities compared to their congener during the inter-breeding period. Moreover, Adélie penguins showed a large individual variability in foraging habitat during the post-breeding stage. However, our model has predicted that both species exploited similar areas during the breeding season. The results obtained during the chick-rearing stage were compared with the stomach contents of both species obtained during the same season (2011/2012). Our findings provide new knowledge on the feeding ecology and foraging habitats of pygoscelid penguins. They confirm the importance of Antarctic krill during the annual cycle and improve the understanding of life strategies and predator–prey interactions essentially out of the reproductive period, in which the information is very limited. These results can help to establish new management strategies, particularly considering the potential overlap between predators and fisheries. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Petroleum is one of the most common toxic substances released into the marine environment. Accidental pollution is spectacular and receives a lot of attention when the negative effect to the environment is dramatic. The impact of chronic petroleum pollution or small oil spills is often not sensational and hence has received less attention than it deserves. Seabirds are one of the most vulnerable groups of marine animals affected by petroleum. Penguins are particularly vulnerable to petroleum spills because they swim low in the water, must surface regularly to breathe, do not fly, are less able to detect and avoid petroleum than other seabirds, and often encounter discharges of petroleum when they are at sea. Mortality of penguins from petroleum is a long term and large scale problem. Petroleum pollution has killed thousands of penguins in Africa, Australia and New Zealand, South America, and even Antarctica. The Southwest Atlantic, although not well known for petroleum pollution problems, is a chronic source of petroleum discharge. Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) are killed during their winter migration between Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil, when they encounter petroleum. To avoid severe negative impacts of petroleum on penguins and other marine species, planning and implementation strategies should concentrate on minimizing risk associated with petroleum discharge and development. New legislation combined with effective enforcement could reduce petroleum spills, minimize operational discharges from ships and from land-based sources and thereby, decrease the release of petroleum into the ocean. Reduced exposure and vulnerability to petroleum can be achieved through marine conservation tools, such as Marine Protected Areas or Marine Spatial Planning to minimize risk to wildlife. Conservation of marine biodiversity is an important value, but can protection be achieved with minimal impact on economic activity? This paper reviews how petroleum pollution has impacted populations of penguins. In addition, it suggests how marine management strategies could mitigate petroleum pollution harm to penguins, with particular emphasis on the Magellanic penguins populations in the SW Atlantic. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Knowledge of diet is critical in interpreting the ecological roles of marine top predators and provides information towards their conservation and management. The Falkland Islands hold the largest number of breeding gentoo penguins. Yet knowledge of gentoo penguin diet at the Falklands is limited to either broad taxonomic divisions of prey items or dietary samples collected only on a single day. This study is the first to investigate gentoo penguin diet at Cow Bay, Falklands, to the species level, over repeated sampling intervals during the breeding period. Through stomach content analysis, we determined diet over a large temporal scale (2002/2003/2004–2011/2012/2013) and between the guard and crèche periods of chick rearing. The principle prey item by reconstituted mass was rock cod fish Patagonotothen spp., for all periods (47–78 %) except that of the 2012/2013 crèche period (19 %) when Falkland herring Sprattus fugensis made up the bulk of the diet (52 %). Of the cephalopods recovered, Patagonian squid Doryteuthis gahi was prominent (1–24 %), while crustaceans contributed negligibly to gentoo penguin diet. Our findings revealed that gentoo penguins breeding at the Falkland Islands were primarily demersal foragers with an ability for pelagic feeding. Diet choice appears to reflect prey availability. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: In response to prolonged periods of fasting, animals have evolved metabolic adaptations helping to mobilize body reserves and/or reduce metabolic rate to ensure a longer usage of reserves. However, those metabolic changes can be associated with higher exposure to oxidative stress, raising the question of how species that naturally fast during their life cycle avoid an accumulation of oxidative damage over time. King penguins repeatedly cope with fasting periods of up to several weeks. Here, we investigated how adult male penguins deal with oxidative stress after an experimentally induced moderate fasting period (PII) or an advanced fasting period (PIII). After fasting in captivity, birds were released to forage at sea. We measured plasmatic oxidative stress on the same individuals at the start and end of the fasting period and when they returned from foraging at sea. We found an increase in activity of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase along with fasting. However, PIII individuals showed higher oxidative damage at the end of the fast compared with PII individuals. When they returned from re-feeding at sea, all birds had recovered their initial body mass and exhibited low levels of oxidative damage. Notably, levels of oxidative damage after the foraging trip were correlated to the rate of mass gain at sea in PIII individuals but not in PII individuals. Altogether, our results suggest that fasting induces a transitory exposure to oxidative stress and that effort to recover in body mass after an advanced fasting period may be a neglected carryover cost of fasting. © 2016, Company of Biologists Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Acosta Hospitaleche, C. & Olivero, E., April 2016. Re-evaluation of the fossil penguin Palaeeudyptes gunnari from the Eocene Leticia Formation, Argentina: additional material, systematics and palaeobiology. Alcheringa 40, xx–xx. ISSN 0311-5518 Eocene penguins are known mostly from Antarctic specimens. A previously documented partial skeleton consisting of a pelvis, femur, tibiotarsus and fibula, from the middle Eocene Leticia Formation, Tierra del Fuego Province, Argentina, has been prepared and re-described. Re-analysis favours assignment to Palaeeudyptes gunnari, a species widely recorded in the Eocene of Antarctica. A new isolated coracoid belonging to an indeterminate species reveals new information about diving kinematics and swimming abilities. Palaeobiological attributes and morphology of the fossils indicate that both specimens belonged to large penguins with poor diving capability and wing propulsion systems similar to those of extant taxa. These penguin remains are the only vertebrate fossils thus far recorded from the Leticia Formation, and provide important insights into the relationships of South American and Antarctic penguins during the Paleogene. The presence of Palaeeudyptes in Argentina supports an Eocene connection between the South American and Antarctic penguin faunas. Carolina Acosta Hospitaleche [acostacaro@fcnym.unlp.edu.ar], CONICET.

ABSTRACT: Capsule: Most bird species start full incubation before the clutch is complete, others long after laying the last egg, gradually increasing the incubation temperature as incubation progresses, as is the case in Magellanic Penguins Spheniscus magellanicus. Aims: In this study, we analysed the possible mechanisms underlying this delayed start of full incubation in Magellanic Penguins. We postulated two non-mutually exclusive, possible mechanisms: delayed development of the brood patch and/or variation in the adults’ incubation postures. Methods: We conducted our work at Isla Quiroga, Argentina during 2011–13. We measured the development of the brood patch area, its temperature, the egg temperature and observed the postures of adult penguins. Results: We found no association between the adults’ postures and the delayed start of full incubation, nor between brood patch temperature and the increase in egg temperature as incubation proceeded (egg age). The intercept of the curve between egg temperature and egg age was positively related to brood patch area, while the slope of the curve was negatively related. Conclusion: Our results support the hypothesis that the shape of the curve of the increase in egg temperature as incubation proceeds is a consequence of the increase in the extension of the brood patch area. © 2016 British Trust for Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: Magellanic penguins, Spheniscus magellanicus, are the most abundant penguins living in temperate regions of South America and are good indicators of environmental pollution in the region. Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) were detected in the liver of Magellanic penguins found debilitated or dead on the beaches of Brazil (states of Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul) between 2008 and 2012 as well as in Uruguay and Chile in 2011. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were more prevalent than organochlorine pesticides (DDTs ~ HCB ~ Drins) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Among PCBs, penta-, hexa- and hepta-chlorinated congeners were predominant. Concentrations of POPs were similar between the Pacific and Atlantic penguin populations, except for PCBs, which were relatively higher in the Pacific population. During the study years (2008-2012), large variations were found in organochlorine pesticides and PCBs tended to decline. Overall, the southern portion of South America has low concentrations of POPs, with either a constant trend or evidence of decline. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: We developed and characterised 12 polymorphic microsatellite loci for Pteria penguin (Roding, 1798), an important pearl oyster species for pearl production in China. The number of observed alleles per locus ranged from 5 to 26 within 46 individuals. The observed and expected heterozygosities per locus ranged from 0.2 to 0.925 and 0.707 to 0.945, respectively. The polymorphism information content values per locus ranged from 0.656 to 0.929. Ten loci were in accordance with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and no significant linkage disequilibrium was detected between loci. These new microsatellite markers will be useful for population and conservation genetic studies of P. penguin. © 2016, Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Background: Seabirds are important components of marine ecosystems, both as predators and as indicators of ecological change, being conspicuous and sensitive to changes in prey abundance. To determine whether fluctuations in population sizes are localised or indicative of large-scale ecosystem change, we must first understand population structure and dispersal. King penguins are long-lived seabirds that occupy a niche across the sub-Antarctic zone close to the Polar Front. Colonies have very different histories of exploitation, population recovery, and expansion. Results: We investigated the genetic population structure and patterns of colonisation of king penguins across their current range using a dataset of 5154 unlinked, high-coverage single nucleotide polymorphisms generated via restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RADSeq). Despite breeding at a small number of discrete, geographically separate sites, we find only very slight genetic differentiation among colonies separated by thousands of kilometers of open-ocean, suggesting migration among islands and archipelagos may be common. Our results show that the South Georgia population is slightly differentiated from all other colonies and suggest that the recently founded Falkland Island colony is likely to have been established by migrants from the distant Crozet Islands rather than nearby colonies on South Georgia, possibly as a result of density-dependent processes. Conclusions: The observed subtle differentiation among king penguin colonies must be considered in future conservation planning and monitoring of the species, and demographic models that attempt to forecast extinction risk in response to large-scale climate change must take into account migration. It is possible that migration could buffer king penguins against some of the impacts of climate change where colonies appear panmictic, although it is unlikely to protect them completely given the widespread physical changes projected for their Southern Ocean foraging grounds. Overall, large-scale population genetic studies of marine predators across the Southern Ocean are revealing more interconnection and migration than previously supposed. © 2016 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The evolution of morphology in a population reflects several factors, including the influence of environmental variability on natural selection. We estimated natural selection on, and heritability of, 4 individual morphological traits (bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and foot length) and 2 multivariate morphological traits in adult Magellanic Penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) at Punta Tombo, Argentina, from 1983 to 2010. We estimated heritability of morphology with parent-offspring regression and animal models, conditioning on sex because the species is sexually dimorphic. For the analysis of selection on each trait, we estimated both linear and quadratic selection gradients, based on the number of fledglings produced, for breeding males and females in each year. Estimates from animal models indicated that all 6 traits were heritable; in parent-offspring regressions, corresponding heritabilities were significantly higher in sons than in daughters in 100% of tests. Over 28 yr, we detected no selection in 21 yr for males and in 21 yr for females. For the years in which we did detect selection, the direction and intensity of selection on traits varied, being especially variable for females. We detected selection on primarily multivariate body size but also on male bill sizes and female bill and foot lengths. Selection on male flipper and foot lengths and on female bill depth was detectable only in relation to selection on body size. When there was selection in males, selection on body and bill sizes was mainly toward larger sizes and occurred in 4 of 6 yr with high chick starvation. The absence of detectable selection on morphology in most years suggests that it is not tightly linked to fitness and that the dynamic environment where Magellanic Penguins live helps maintain morphological variation. The temporal variability in selection likely fosters stability of morphology through time, a pattern that might not be evident in short-term studies. © 2016 American Ornithologists' Union.

ABSTRACT: The African Penguin (Spheniscus demersus) has suffered population declines and is listed in the IUCN Red List as Endangered. The species is endemic to the coast of southern Africa, and breeding colonies are distributed on the south-western coast of Africa. Currently, African Penguins are being kept in zoo and aquarium facilities throughout South Africa. In this study, molecular genetic data based on 12 microsatellite markers from 1 119 African Penguin samples from four facilities were generated in order to determine the level of genetic variation, population structure and differentiation, and effective population size to assist in the development of an effective captive management plan. Expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.57 to 0.62, and allelic richness from 4.2 to 5.1. However, based on differences between first- and second-generation captive birds, we conclude that the ex situ population is at risk of losing genetic variability in the future and management programmes should include exchange of birds between captive facilities in order to induce gene flow and increase effective population size. Adding individuals from in situ populations should also be considered in the future in cases where these birds cannot be rehabilitated. Molecular genetic analyses of wild penguin populations should be carried out for comparison, and to ascertain to what degree 'in situ genetic diversity' is represented among ex situ populations. With regular resampling and analyses, the extent of the effect of processes such as genetic drift on diversity in the ex situ penguin populations will become evident. © Zoological Society of Southern Africa.

ABSTRACT: Phenology, the study of stages within the life cycles of plants and animals, has served as a proxy for weather and climate throughout human history, but has only recently become its own field of environmental science. Phenological constraints are particularly demanding in avian species because of the necessity of matching chick provisioning with high food abundance, while allocating time for migration. Within avian species, seabird phenology is of particular interest because many seabird species exhibit colonial breeding behaviour. Penguins, representing roughly 90 % of the biomass in the Southern Ocean, are well studied in the context of population dynamics, prey abundance, and phenology. Here I review the annual cycles of Pygoscelis penguins, a genus including gentoo (Pygoscelis papua), chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarctica), and Adélie (Pygoscelis adeliae) penguins, to better understand what is known about their phenology, what causes known changes, and how their phenology influences fitness. Major differences exist between species, particularly in relation to winter migration, incubation shifts, and the timing of breeding. Even with the numerous studies examining phenology in Pygoscelis penguins, large gaps in our understanding of plasticity in the annual cycle remain. In particular, certain phases are neglected because they are logistically difficult to record or have erroneously been ignored. In addition, temporally, large gaps exist in our understanding of phenology, where studies have not been updated in over 20 years at a particular field site. Because phenology does vary greatly between years, depending on the colony, when possible, researchers should strive to update phenological records by recording the dates of phases each year. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Multi-zoo comparisons of animal welfare are rare, and yet vital for ensuring continued improvement of zoo enclosures and husbandry. Methods are not standardized for the development of zoo enclosures based on multiple indicators, and case study species are required. This study compares behavior and breeding success to various enclosure and husbandry parameters for the Humboldt penguin, Spheniscus humboldti, for the development of improved enclosure design. Behavioral sampling was completed at Flamingo Land over a period of 8 months. Further data on behavior, enclosure design, and breeding success were collected via questionnaires, visits to zoos, and literature review. Breeding success was primarily influenced by colony age and number of breeding pairs, suggesting an important social influence on reproduction. Across zoos, there was also significant variation in behavior. The proportion of time spent in water varied between zoos (2–23%) and was used as an indicator of physical activity and natural behavior. Regression models revealed that water-use was best predicted by total enclosure area per penguin, followed by land area, with some evidence for positive influence of pool surface area per penguin. Predominantly linear/curvilinear increases in our biological indicators with enclosure parameters suggest that optimal conditions for S. humboldti were not met among the selected zoos. We propose revised minimum conditions for S. humboldti enclosure design, which exceed those in the existing husbandry guidelines. We present a framework for the evaluation of zoo enclosures and suggest that a rigorous scientific protocol be established for the design of new enclosures, based on multivariate methods.

ABSTRACT: Commercially available micro-algae concentrates have been successfully used as an alternative to live micro-algae as a food source during routine larval culture of the winged pearl oyster, Pteria penguin. This supports the development of simplified hatchery facilities and larval rearing protocols that are more appropriate to Pacific island nations. An optimal feeding regime based on these products that also accounts for larval stocking density is yet to be developed. Two experiments were conducted at a commercial pearl oyster hatchery facility in the Kingdom of Tonga to examine the combined effects of stocking density and ration on survival and growth of both D-stage (from 1 to 8 days post-fertilsation) and umbo-stage (from 8 to 17 days) P. penguin larvae. Both experiments used a factorial design combining three larval stocking densities (D-stage: 2, 6 & 10 larvae mL-1; umbo-stage: 1, 3 & 5 larvae mL-1) and three rations (D-stage: 5, 10 & 15 cells mL-1; umbo-stage: 10, 15 & 20 cells mL-1). Survival during D-stage was significantly improved in aquaria stocked below 10 larvae mL-1, whereby a density of 6 mL-1 maximised larval production. An intermediate ration of 10 × 103 cells mL-1 maximised both survival and growth during D-stage. Increasing the initial stocking density of umbo-stage larvae from 1 to 3 mL-1 resulted in significant reductions in both survival and growth. Growth of umbo-stage larvae stocked at a density of 1 mL-1 increased significantly when ration remained below 20 × 103 cells mL-1. The results of this study provide a basis for optimised hatchery culture protocols for P. penguin that are more appropriate to Pacific island nations. © 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Intrapopulation variation in resource use occurs in many populations of generalist predators with important community and evolutionary implications. One of the hypothesised mechanisms for such widespread variation is ecological opportunity, i.e. resource availability determined by intrinsic constraints and extrinsic conditions. In this study, we combined tracking data and stable isotope analysis to examine how breeding constraints and prey conditions influenced intrapopulation variation in resource use in a generalist predator, the macaroni penguin Eudyptes chrysolophus. Isotopic variation was also examined as a function of breeding success, individual traits and individual specialisation. Variation in isotope ratios was greatest across multiple tissue types when birds were able to undertake mid-range foraging trips (i.e. during incubation and pre-moult). This variation was highly consistent between years that spanned a 3-fold difference in local prey Euphausia superba density, and was also highly consistent at the individual level between 2 years that had similar prey densities. Furthermore, by comparing our results with previous work on the same population, it appeared that a decrease in local prey availability can also increase intrapopulation variation in resource use during periods with more restricted foraging ranges (i.e. during brood-guard and crèche). This study highlights the importance of considering ecological interactions that operate on multiple spatio-temporal scales when examining the drivers of resource use in populations of generalist predators. © The authors 2016.

ABSTRACT: The Eisenmenger ventricular septal defect is an uncommon type of ventricular septal defect characterised in humans by a traditionally perimembranous ventricular septal defect, anterior deviation (cranioventral deviation in small animal patients) of the muscular outlet septum causing malalignment relative to the remainder of the muscular septum, and overriding of the aortic valve. This anomaly is reported infrequently in human patients and was identified in a 45-day-old Humboldt Penguin, Spheniscus humboldti, with signs of poor growth and a cardiac murmur. This case report describes the findings in this penguin and summarises the anatomy and classification of this cardiac anomaly. To the authors’ knowledge this is the first report of an Eisenmenger ventricular septal defect in a veterinary patient. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) is the largest living species of penguin. Herein, we first reported the complete mitochondrial genome of emperor penguin. The mitochondrial genome is a circular molecule of 17 301 bp in length, consisting of 13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNA genes, two rRNA, and one control region. To verify the accuracy and the utility of new determined mitogenome sequences, we constructed the species phylogenetic tree of emperor penguin together with 10 other closely species. This is the second complete mitochondrial genome of penguin, and this is going to be an important data to study mitochondrial evolution of birds. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

ABSTRACT: The objective of this study was to evaluate infrared thermography as a noninvasive screening tool for detection of pododermatitis during the developing and active stages of disease in three species of penguins: king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus), macaroni penguin (Eudyptes chrysolophus), and rockhopper penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome). In total, 67 penguins were examined every 3 mo over a 15-mo period. At each exam, bumblefoot lesions were characterized and measured, and a timed series of thermal images were collected over a 4-min period. Three different methods were compared for analysis of thermograms. Feet with active lesions that compromise the surface of the foot were compared to feet with inactive lesions and no lesions. The hypothesis was that feet with active lesions would have warmer surface temperatures than the other conditions. Analysis of the data showed that although feet with active bumblefoot lesions are warmer than feet with inactive or no lesions, the variability seen in each individual penguin from one exam day to the next and the overlap seen between temperatures from each condition made thermal imaging an unreliable tool for detection of bumblefoot in the species studied. © Copyright 2016 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Stomach flushing has been used in diet studies of 17 of 18 species of penguins, and is commonly used to obtain diet samples from fish, reptiles, amphibians, mammals, and other bird species. However, a review of the literature indicates that there have been virtually no assessments of the impacts of stomach flushing. Stomach flushing has been used in four studies of yellow-eyed penguins (Megadyptes antipodes), with extensive investigations during 1984 to 1986, and 1990 to 1993. Using long-term data we compared yellow-eyed penguin adult resighting probability, productivity, and chick mass, between nests where adults were flushed, with those that were not. Flushed birds were less likely to be resighted than birds that were not flushed, although when the poor season of 1985/86 was removed, resighting rates were comparable between flushed and non-flushed birds. Hatching success and fledging success were unaffected by flushing, however, the mean mass of chicks was lower in nests where the combined number of stomach flushes for both parents exceeded four events. Our results imply that stomach flushing has no long-term effects on apparent adult survival or productivity, unless undertaken during a year of poor food availability. We recommend that future diet studies of yellow-eyed penguins that require using stomach flushing apply no more than four stomach flushing events per nest during breeding. The use of complementary biochemical techniques could reduce the need for stomach flushing of yellow-eyed penguins, however we advocate for the use of dietary analysis methods that are most appropriate to address important knowledge gaps. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Anesthesia protocols for patients with intracranial lesions need to provide hemodynamic stability, preserve cerebrovascular autoregulation, avoid increases in intracranial pressure, and facilitate a rapid recovery. Propofol total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) maintains cerebral blood flow autoregulation and is considered superior to inhalant agents as an anesthetic protocol for patients with intracranial lesions. A propofol-based TIVA subsequent to premedication with medetomidine and diazepam was used in a king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus) undergoing magnetic resonance imaging of the brain after a new onset of seizures. This protocol provided a rapid and smooth induction and calm recovery in the penguin. When ventilation control is possible, propofol TIVA may be a superior choice to inhalant agents for anesthesia of birds with potential intracranial lesions. © 2016 by the Association of Avian Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Seabirds are ideal model organisms to track mercury (Hg) through marine food webs as they are long-lived, broadly distributed, and are susceptible to biomagnification due to foraging at relatively high trophic levels. However, using these species as biomonitors requires a solid understanding of the degree of species, sexual and age-specific variation in foraging behaviors which act to mediate their dietary exposure to Hg. We combined stomach content analysis along with Hg and stable isotope analyses of blood, feathers and common prey items to help explain inter and intra-specific patterns of dietary Hg exposure across three sympatric Pygoscelis penguin species commonly used as biomonitors of Hg availability in the Antarctic marine ecosystem. We found that penguin tissue Hg concentrations differed across species, between adults and juveniles, but not between sexes. While all three penguins species diets were dominated by Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and to a lesser extent fish, stable isotope based proxies of relative trophic level and krill consumption could not by itself sufficiently explain the observed patterns of inter and intra-specific variation in Hg. However, integrating isotopic approaches with stomach content analysis allowed us to identify the relatively higher risk of Hg exposure for penguins foraging on mesopelagic prey relative to congeners targeting epipelagic or benthic prey species. When possible, future seabird biomonitoring studies should seek to combine isotopic approaches with other, independent measures of foraging behavior to better account for the confounding effects of inter and intra-specific variation on dietary Hg exposure. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Penguins of the genus Eudyptes are unique among birds in that their first-laid A-egg is 54–85% the mass of their second-laid B-egg. Although the degree of intra-clutch egg-size dimorphism varies greatly among the seven species of the genus, obligate brood reduction is typical of each, with most fledged chicks resulting from the larger B-egg. Many authors have speculated upon why Eudyptes penguins have evolved and maintained a highly dimorphic 2-egg clutch, and why it is the first-laid egg that is so much smaller than the second, but only recently has a testable, proximate mechanism been proposed. In most species of Eudyptes penguins females appear to initiate egg-formation at sea during return migration to breeding colonies. In macaroni penguins E. chrysolophus, females with a shorter pre-laying interval ashore (and thus presumably greater overlap between migration and egg-formation) lay more dimorphic eggs, suggesting a physiological conflict may constrain growth of the earlier-initiated A-egg. This migratory carry-over effect hypothesis (MCEH) was tested in eastern rockhopper penguins E. chrysocome filholi on Campbell Island, New Zealand, by recording the arrival and lay dates, body sizes, and egg masses of transponder-tagged females over two years. Females with longer pre-laying intervals laid less dimorphic clutches, as predicted by the MCEH. However, repeated measures of individual females revealed that within-individual variation in egg-size dimorphism between years was unrelated to within-individual variation in pre-laying interval. Egg masses, and to a lesser extent egg-size dimorphism, were highly repeatable traits related to body size and body mass. These results and a detailed consideration of the MCEH suggest that egg-size dimorphism in Eudyptes penguins is unlikely to be caused by a migratory carry-over effect. © 2015 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: An ongoing challenge in marine top predator research is understanding processes that are responsible for patterns that are often derived from land-based access to individuals. The use of animal-borne camera loggers, however, is proving useful in this regard as researchers can directly observe species and habitat-associated interactions. During an ongoing study investigating the foraging ecology of gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) at the Falkland Islands, we observed the first attempted underwater intraspecific kleptoparasitism event for a penguin. This was revealed through a bird deployed with an animal-borne camera logger. Although unsuccessful in its attempt, the new reported behaviour highlights a novel interaction and further demonstrates the value of cameras in better understanding the ecology of marine vertebrates. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Behavioral plasticity may allow organisms to respond adaptively to reduced food availability caused by climate change, facilitating population persistence. Conversely, inflexible parental roles may constrain sex-specific parental investment and amplify reduced reproductive fitness during nutritional stress. We examined chick-provisioning rates of transponder-tagged female and male eastern rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome filholi) using an automated gateway on Campbell Island, New Zealand in a year of good diet quality and a poor year of nutritional stress. All seven species of Eudyptes penguins are unique in exhibiting canalized parental roles during the first 3–4 weeks of chick-rearing: males fast while guarding chicks provisioned exclusively by females. In the remaining 5–6 weeks before fledging, chicks form crèches and are typically fed by both parents. Each species of Eudyptes is also “vulnerable” or “endangered”, generally because of long-term population declines linked to climate-induced nutritional stress. We hypothesized that the unique role division of Eudyptes penguins contributes to their sensitivity to nutritional stress. We found that chick growth was strongly positively correlated with total provisioning rate. Both sexes made longer foraging trips and provisioned less often under nutritional stress, but males decreased their investment in chick-provisioning more than females by making extra-long self-feeding trips early in the crèche period. We show that Eudyptes chicks would be fed more often if the sexes shared all chick-provisioning, especially under nutritional stress. We conclude that the canalized division of labor strategy of Eudyptes penguins is maladapted to more frequent years of nutritional stress under climate change. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: The evolutionary and adaptive potential of populations or species facing an emerging infectious disease depends on their genetic diversity in genes, such as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). In birds, MHC class I deals predominantly with intracellular infections (e.g., viruses) and MHC class II with extracellular infections (e.g., bacteria). Therefore, patterns of MHC I and II diversity may differ between species and across populations of species depending on the relative effect of local and global environmental selective pressures, genetic drift, and gene flow. We hypothesize that high gene flow among populations of Humboldt and Magellanic penguins limits local adaptation in MHC I and MHC II, and signatures of selection differ between markers, locations, and species. We evaluated the MHC I and II diversity using 454 next-generation sequencing of 100 Humboldt and 75 Magellanic penguins from seven different breeding colonies. Higher genetic diversity was observed in MHC I than MHC II for both species, explained by more than one MHC I loci identified. Large population sizes, high gene flow, and/or similar selection pressures maintain diversity but limit local adaptation in MHC I. A pattern of isolation by distance was observed for MHC II for Humboldt penguin suggesting local adaptation, mainly on the northernmost studied locality. Furthermore, trans-species alleles were found due to a recent speciation for the genus or convergent evolution. High MHC I and MHC II gene diversity described is extremely advantageous for the long-term survival of the species. © 2016 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Summary Sustainable ecotourism requires careful management of human impacts on wildlife. Contrasting responses to the disturbance caused by ecotourism are observed across taxa and within species, because species and populations can differ in their tolerance to humans. However, the mechanisms by which tolerance develops remain unclear. Penguin colonies are popular tourist attractions. Although ecotourism increases public awareness and generates conservation income, it can also disturb penguins, raising concerns for threatened species such as the African Penguin Spheniscus demersus, whose populations are in rapid decline. We compared the tolerance of African Penguins to human disturbance across four colonies with contrasting histories of human exposure. Human approaches invoked the least response at colonies where human exposure was highest, suggesting increased human tolerance with increased exposure. The response to humans close to the nest also decreased more rapidly in highly exposed individuals within colonies. These results were consistent independent of breeding stage, and were repeated among colonies. Because the impacts of human disturbance, including temporary nest desertion, were greatest at the colony with least human exposure, human disturbance of breeding African Penguins potentially may be mitigated through increased levels of tolerance to humans, or displacement of shyer individuals, although this could not be assessed in the present study. However, human exposure could significantly increase stress, impair reproduction and even reduce genetic diversity. Consequently, ecotourism must be managed carefully to minimize population level impacts, potentially by facilitating habituation in populations subject to non-threatening human disturbance, and maintaining some areas free of disturbance to allow shy individuals to breed. © BirdLife International 2016.

ABSTRACT: Fisheries bycatch, the incidental mortality that occurs as a result of entanglement in fishing gear, is an important conservation threat to penguins and other seabirds. Identification of entanglement and drowning in beach-cast carcasses of seabirds remains a challenge, as it is still unclear what lesions are to be expected in a bycaught seabird. We necropsied 2 Magellanic penguins Spheniscus magellanicus that were entangled and drowned in gillnets. Marked distension of the lungs with foamy red fluid and marked oedema of the dorsal visceral pleura were prominent lesions consistent with those described in cases of 'wet drowning' in humans. On the other hand, the air sacs contained very small quantities of liquid, suggesting that absence of water in the air sacs might not be a reliable sign to exclude drowning. Other relevant findings included cutaneous lacerations and bruising in one bird and cervical and pectoral rhabdomyolysis in both birds. While cutaneous or subcutaneous hematomas may be an indication of bycatch, especially if linear or cross-linear patterns consistent with fishing nets are present, these lesions might not always be discernible and their absence does not suffice to exclude the possibility of entanglement in fishing nets. Additionally, our findings suggest that the histological examination of skeletal muscles, particularly of the neck, may provide additional clues to corroborate the diagnosis of drowning in penguins. © Inter-Research 2016.

ABSTRACT: Mate choice is expected to be important for the fitness of both sexes for species in which successful reproduction relies strongly on shared and substantial parental investment by males and females. Reciprocal selection may then favour the evolution of morphological signals providing mutual information on the condition/quality of tentative partners. However, because males and females often have differing physiological constraints, it is unclear which proximate physiological pathways guarantee the honesty of male and female signals in similarly ornamented species. We used the monomorphic king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus) as a model to investigate the physiological qualities signalled by colour and morphological ornaments known to be under sexual selection (coloration of the beak spots and size of auricular feather patches). In both sexes of this slow-breeding seabird, we investigated the links between ornaments and multiple indices of individual quality; including body condition, immunity, stress and energy status. In both sexes, individual innate immunity, resting metabolic rate, and the ability to mount a stress response in answer to an acute disturbance (capture) were similarly signalled by various aspects of beak coloration or auricular patch size. However, we also reveal interesting and contrasting relationships between males and females in how ornaments may signal individual quality. Body condition and oxidative stress status were signalled by beak coloration, although in opposite directions for the sexes. Over an exhaustive set of physiological variables, several suggestive patterns indicated the conveyance of honest information about mate quality in this monomorphic species. However, sex-specific patterns suggested that monomorphic ornaments may signal different information concerning body mass and oxidative balance of males and females, at least in king penguins. © 2016 The Linnean Society of London.

ABSTRACT: Penguins are dependent on waterproof plumage for survival. The molt in sub-Antarctic penguin species is a seasonal and catastrophic process during which the animals go through periods of fasting and high levels of stress. Their entire plumage is usually replaced in 3 wk. Attempts at consistent hormonal induction of molt in penguins have been unsuccessful. Four Yellow-eyed Penguins (Megadyptes antipodes) were referred for treatment at Wildbase, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand, in late April 2014, following loss of waterproofing, feather breakage, increased body weight, pododermatitis, and damage to caudal feathers from hock sitting. Feather plucking of damaged areas to stimulate feather regrowth was attempted with poor results. Waiting 10–12 mo for a natural molt was not tenable. Catastrophic molt was induced by treatment with 10 g/kg of fresh beef thyroid gland orally once a day. The molt was complete in 18–26 d during which the animals regained full plumage and waterproofing after feather regrowth. The forced molt feathers had abnormal pigmentation but were of sufficient quality to allow release of the birds back to the wild. © Wildlife Disease Association 2016.

ABSTRACT: We report long-term changes in population size of three species of sympatrically breeding pygoscelid penguins: Adé lie (Pygoscelis adeliae), chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarctica) and gentoo (Pygoscelis papua ellsworthii) over a 38 year period at Signy Island, South Orkney Islands, based on annual counts from selected colonies and decadal all-island systematic counts of occupied nests. Comparing total numbers of breeding pairs over the whole island from 1978/79 to 2015/16 revealed varying fortunes: gentoo penguin pairs increased by 255%, (3.5% per annum), chinstrap penguins declined by 68% (-3.6% per annum) and Adé lie penguins declined by 42% (-1.5% per annum). The chinstrap population has declined steadily over the last four decades. In contrast, Adé lie and gentoo penguins have experienced phases of population increase and decline. Annual surveys of selected chinstrap and Adé lie colonies produced similar trends from those revealed by island-wide surveys, allowing total island population trends to be inferred relatively well. However, while the annual colony counts of chinstrap and Adé lie penguins showed a trend consistent in direction with the results from all-island surveys, the magnitude of estimated population change was markedly different between colony wide and all island counts. Annual population patterns suggest that pair numbers in the study areas partly reflect immigration and emigration of nesting birds between different parts of the island. Breeding success for all three species remained broadly stable over time in the annually monitored colonies. Breeding success rates in gentoo and chinstrap penguins were strongly correlated, despite the differing trends in population size. This study shows the importance of effective, standardised monitoring to accurately determine long-term population trajectories. Our results indicate significant declines in the Adé lie and chinstrap penguin populations at Signy Island over the last five decades, and a gradual increase in gentoo breeding pairs. © 2016 Dunn et al.

ABSTRACT: Niche theory predicts that sympatric species should differentiate ecologically in order to co-exist and conspecifics will also differentiate to reduce intra-specific competition. As central-place foragers, colonial breeding seabirds represent an ideal model system to test this theory and examine the mechanism of niche segregation. We used GPS-TDlog devices for tracking and diving data and stable isotope analysis to examine patterns of inter- and intra-specific niche segregation among southern rockhopper penguins Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome and Magellanic penguins Spheniscus magellanicus breeding on Isla de los Estados, Argentina, across 3 consecutive breeding seasons. Tracking data indicated strong inter-specific spatial segregation of foraging locations and little overlap. Diving data also highlighted vertical foraging niche segregation as female rockhopper penguins dove deeper than male and female Magellanic penguins. δ13C values supported the general pattern of habitat segregation, with lower values for female rock-hopper penguins that dove deeper and foraged off the shelf break. Female rockhopper penguins exhibited a lower relative trophic value (δ15N) than male and female Magellanic penguins, consistent with previous dietary studies of both species. These differences likely act to reduce competition between the 2 species during the breeding season, when they are constrained to exploit the resources around their colonies. In contrast, male and female Magellanic penguins shared a similar foraging niche as measured by areas used to forage, dive depths, relative habitat use and trophic values. The lack of sex-specific foraging niche segregation of Magellanic penguins at Isla de los Estados could be related to the availability of food in the area and/or the small population size. © Inter-Research 2016.

ABSTRACT: The African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) is an endangered seabird that breeds along the coast of Namibia and South Africa, and disease surveillance was identified as a priority for its conservation. Aiming for the establishment of baseline data on the presence of potential pathogens in this species, a comprehensive health assessment (blood smear examination, haematology, biochemistry and serology) was conducted on samples obtained from 578 African penguins at 11 breeding colonies and a rehabilitation centre. There were 68 penguins that were seropositive for at least one of seven pathogens tested: avian encephalomyelitis virus, avian infectious bronchitis virus, avian reovirus, infectious bursal disease virus, Newcastle disease virus, Mycoplasma gallisepticum and Mycoplasma synoviae. All samples were seronegative for avian influenza virus subtypes H5 and H7 and infectious laryngotracheitis virus. The apparent prevalence of Babesia sp. and Borrelia sp. in blood smears was consistent with previous studies. Babesia-infected individuals had a regenerative response of the erythrocytic lineage, an active inflammatory response and hepatic function impairment. These findings indicate that African penguins may be exposed to conservation-significant pathogens in the wild and encourage further studies aiming for the direct detection and/or isolation of these microorganisms. © 2016.

ABSTRACT: Most effects of environmental and climate variability on predator life history traits and population dynamics result from indirect effects mediated through the food chain. There is growing evidence that wind strength might affect seabirds while foraging at sea. Here, we investigated the effect of wind speed on the foraging performance of a flightless marine predator, the little penguin (Eudyptula minor). To this end, we used satellite-derived wind data collected over 11 breeding seasons during which the daily attendance and body mass changes of more than 200 penguins breeding at Phillip Island (Victoria, Australia) were recorded by an automated penguin monitoring system. Over 17 363 foraging trips, we found that wind speed had important effects on foraging and provisioning parameters in breeding adults. During incubation and chick-guard, stronger winds were associated with decreased foraging efficiency (lower body mass gain). During chick-guard, stronger winds were furthermore associated with lower meal sizes provided to the chicks, but parental body reserves appeared unaffected. Under extreme wind conditions (>14 m/s) during the post-guard phase, adults maintained their body reserves by shifting towards longer foraging trips, while providing chicks with smaller meals. Chick meal size and foraging trip duration during chick rearing had direct effects on breeding success, suggesting that the influence of wind on individual fitness was mediated by changes in foraging performances and success. Furthermore, using a long-term wind data series spanning 150-yr from a coastal wind station, we found a slight decline in wind speed and a decrease in wind speed variability in the Bass Strait where little penguins forage. Interestingly, based on this wind data, we found birds to be more directly affected by punctual events of strong winds (e.g. storms or gales), than by an overall change in wind patterns over time. Potential candidate mechanisms mediating the effects of wind speed on foraging efficiency may include swell formation, energy costs of travelling and thermoregulation, and a possible disruption of thermoclines, which may be important for little penguins. Plasticity in foraging strategies allowed parents to partially compensate for negative wind effects. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.

ABSTRACT: Defining reliable demographic models is essential to understand the threats of ongoing environmental change. Yet, in the most remote and threatened areas, models are often based on the survey of a single population, assuming stationarity and independence in population responses. This is the case for the Emperor penguin Aptenodytes forsteri, a flagship Antarctic species that may be at high risk continent-wide before 2100. Here, using genome-wide data from the whole Antarctic continent, we reveal that this top-predator is organized as one single global population with a shared demography since the late Quaternary. We refute the view of the local population as a relevant demographic unit, and highlight that (i) robust extinction risk estimations are only possible by including dispersal rates and (ii) colony-scaled population size is rather indicative of local stochastic events, whereas the species' response to global environmental change is likely to follow a shared evolutionary trajectory.

ABSTRACT: Stress responses are suggested to physiologically underlie parental decisions promoting the redirection of behaviour away from offspring care when survival is jeopardized (e.g., when facing a predator). Besides this classical view, the “brood-value hypothesis” suggests that parents’ stress responses may be adaptively attenuated to increase fitness, ensuring continued breeding when the relative value of the brood is high. Here, we test the brood-value hypothesis in breeding king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus), long-lived seabirds for which the energy commitment to reproduction is high. We subjected birds at different breeding stages (courtship, incubation and chick brooding) to an acute 30-min capture stress and measured their hormonal (corticosterone, CORT) and metabolic (non-esterified fatty acid, NEFA) responses to stress. We found that CORT responses were markedly attenuated in chick-brooding birds when compared to earlier stages of breeding (courtship and incubation). In addition, NEFA responses appeared to be rapidly attenuated in incubating and brooding birds, but a progressive increase in NEFA plasma levels in courting birds suggested energy mobilization to deal with the threat. Our results support the idea that stress responses may constitute an important life-history mechanism mediating parental reproductive decisions in relation to their expected fitness outcome. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Blood parasites are considered some of the most significant pathogens for the conservation of penguins, due to the considerable morbidity and mortality they have been shown to produce in captive and wild populations of these birds. Parasites known to occur in the blood of penguins include haemosporidian protozoans (Plasmodium, Leucocytozoon, Haemoproteus), piroplamid protozoans (Babesia), kinetoplastid protozoans (Trypanosoma), spirochete bacteria (Borrelia) and nematode microfilariae. This review provides a critical and comprehensive assessment of the current knowledge on these parasites, providing an overview of their biology, host and geographic distribution, epidemiology, pathology and implications for public health and conservation. © 2016 Cambridge University Press.

ABSTRACT: African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) in South Africa have been subject to rapid decline in the 20th century and are currently listed as "endangered" on the IUCN Red List. A stochastic, stage-specific system dynamics model with spatial components was developed to investigate the interaction of multiple pressures on penguin population development, and originally applied to study conservation management options for the penguin colony at Robben Island, Table Bay, South Africa. We here present an extension of the model to the nearby colony at Dyer Island. The modelled population was found to be strongly dominated by the effects of Cape fur seal (Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus) predation and immature emigration, which appear to be key drivers behind current declines in population numbers at this colony. Chronic low-level oiling also had a consistent impact despite ongoing mitigation measures, while kelp gull predation had a lower effect than expected. At current low population size, the pressure from either seal predation or immature emigration seems sufficient to mask any beneficial effects to penguins from possible improvements in available food biomass (e.g., from fishery restrictions). Results suggest that conservation management at this colony should focus on regular culling of predating seals combined with improving availability of prey (thus discouraging emigration) both in the foraging range of breeding penguins and in their general foraging area. Our findings demonstrate the use of site-specific scenario tools to explore conservation strategies in data-poor management situations. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The Antarctic Peninsula is one of the areas where the climate is changing at the fastest pace, having several effects on the populations of pygoscelid penguins. Few studies have analysed the variation in immune parameters of antarctic birds in a geographical context; thus, analyses of geographical differences in the immune components of wild pygoscelid penguins are still scarce. Leukocyte counts in birds provide information on their immunity and physiological stress. The objective of this study was to analyse the leukocyte counts in penguins of the genus Pygoscelis (gentoo, Adélie and chinstrap penguins), covering sites along the South Shetland Islands and some islands on the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. Our results revealed differences in the number of heterophils and eosinophils and in the heterophil/lymphocyte ratio in the northeastern populations of gentoo and Adélie penguins as compared to the rest of the colonies studied. The results contribute to better understanding of the variations in physiological parameters of penguins related to a geographical context. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Penguins have been recently identified as useful bioindicators of mercury (Hg) transfer to food webs in the Southern Ocean over different spatial and temporal scales. Here, feather Hg concentrations were measured in adults and chicks of all the seven penguin species breeding in the southern Indian Ocean, over a large latitudinal gradient spanning Antarctic, subantarctic and subtropical sites. Hg was also measured in feathers of museum specimens of penguins collected at the same sites in the 1950s and 1970s. Our aim was to evaluate geographical and historical variations in Hg transfer to penguins, while accounting for feeding habits by using the stable isotope technique (δ13C, habitat; δ15N, diet/trophic level). Adult feather Hg concentrations in contemporary individuals ranged from 0.7 ± 0.2 to 5.9 ± 1.9 μg g-1 dw in Adélie and gentoo penguins, respectively. Inter-specific differences in Hg accumulation were strong among both adults and chicks, and mainly linked to feeding habits. Overall, penguin species that feed in Antarctic waters had lower feather Hg concentrations than those that feed in subantarctic and subtropical waters, irrespective of age class and dietary group, suggesting different Hg incorporation into food webs depending on the water mass. While accounting for feeding habits, we detected different temporal variations in feather Hg concentrations depending on species. Notably, the subantarctic gentoo and macaroni penguins had higher Hg burdens in the contemporary rather than in the historical sample, despite similar or lower trophic levels, respectively. Whereas increases in Hg deposition have been recently documented in the Southern Hemisphere, future monitoring is highly needed to confirm or not this temporal trend in penguins, especially in the context of actual changing Hg emission patterns and global warming. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Brood patches allow the transfer of heat to eggs for their successful embryonic development, and in many species determine egg temperature during incubation. We investigated brood patch development of Magellanic Penguins Spheniscus magellanicus in Isla Quiroga, Argentina, during 2012-2013. Here, we evaluate if brood patch development (in a narrow sense i.e. increase of the brood patch area and temperature measured with an electronic probe thermometer) varies according to laying date of the eggs, and with respect to adults' body condition and size, total clutch volume, and/or the sex of the adults. We found that brood patch temperature reaches its maximum when egg laying is finished, while brood patch area is fully developed starting from the end of the first quarter of the incubation period. The later the penguins started to breed the warmer the initial brood patches - when first egg is laid. Besides, the incubation period was shorter in penguins breeding late. Furthermore, adults in a good body condition had cooler initial brood patches than adults with poor body condition. In contrast, total clutch volume, body size index, and sex of the adults were not related to brood patch development. We conclude that initial brood patch temperature in Magellanic Penguins is associated with environmental factors, like laying date, and physiological attributes, like body condition.

ABSTRACT: Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) breed on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the southernmost parts of South America and migrate northward as far as Peru and Brazil. Serum samples (n = 100) from Magellanic penguins from three zoos and two rehabilitation centers (RCs) in Brazil were assayed for the presence of antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii by means of the modified agglutination test (MAT, cut-off ≥ 20). The penguins were categorized as young (≤4 yr old) or adults (≥4 yr old) and sexed (male, female, or not identified), and data were analyzed using the chi-square test (P ≤ 0.05). Toxoplasma gondii antibodies were found in 28% of penguins: 25.8% males, 27.8% females, 30.3% unknown sex, 25.4% young, and 31.1% adults. Statistical analyses did not find any difference (P > 0.05) with respect to age, sex, or source of birds. This is the first report of T. gondii antibodies in S. magellanicus. © Copyright 2016 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Digital methodologies for rendering the gross morphology of the brain from X-ray computed tomography data have expanded our current understanding of the origin and evolution of avian neuroanatomy and provided new perspectives on the cognition and behavior of birds in deep time. However, fossil skulls germane to extracting digital endocasts from early stem members of extant avian lineages remain exceptionally rare. Data from early-diverging species of major avian subclades provide key information on ancestral morphologies in Aves and shifts in gross neuroanatomical structure that have occurred within those groups. Here we describe data on the gross morphology of the brain from a mid-to-late Paleocene penguin fossil from New Zealand. This most basal and geochronologically earliest-described endocast from the penguin clade indicates that described neuroanatomical features of early stem penguins, such as lower telencephalic lateral expansion, a relatively wider cerebellum, and lack of cerebellar folding, were present far earlier in penguin history than previously inferred. Limited dorsal expansion of the wulst in the new fossil is a feature seen in outgroup waterbird taxa such as Gaviidae (Loons) and diving Procellariiformes (Shearwaters, Diving Petrels, and allies), indicating that loss of flight may not drastically affect neuroanatomy in diving taxa. Wulst enlargement in the penguin lineage is first seen in the late Eocene, at least 25 million years after loss of flight and cooption of the flight stroke for aquatic diving. Similar to the origin of avian flight, major shifts in gross brain morphology follow, but do not appear to evolve quickly after, acquisition of a novel locomotor mode. Enlargement of the wulst shows a complex pattern across waterbirds, and may be linked to sensory modifications related to prey choice and foraging strategy. © 2016 Anatomical Society

ABSTRACT: This is the first reported case of Babesia sp. in Antarctic penguins, specifically a population of Chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica) in the Vapour Col penguin rookery in Deception Island, South Shetlands, Antarctica. We collected peripheral blood from 50 adult and 30 chick Chinstrap penguins. Examination of the samples by microscopy showed intraerythrocytic forms morphologically similar to other avian Babesia species in 12 Chinstrap penguin adults and seven chicks. The estimated parasitaemias ranged from 0.25 × 10-2% to 0.75 × 10-2%. Despite the low number of parasites found in blood smears, semi-nested PCR assays yielded a 274 bp fragment in 12 of the 19 positive blood samples found by microscopy. Sequencing revealed that the fragment was 97% similar to Babesia sp. 18S rRNA from Australian Little Penguins (Eudyptula minor) confirming presence of the parasite. Parasite prevalence estimated by microscopy in adults and chicks was higher (24% vs. 23.3%, respectively) than found by semi-nested PCR (16% vs. 13.3% respectively). Although sampled penguins were apparently healthy, the effect of Babesia infection in these penguins is unknown. The identification of Babesia sp. in Antarctic penguins is an important finding. Ixodes uriae, as the only tick species present in the Antarctic Peninsula, is the key to understanding the natural history of this parasite. Future work should address the transmission dynamics and pathogenicity of Babesia sp. in Chinstrap penguin as well as in other penguin species, such as Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) and Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae), present within the tick distribution range in the Antarctic Peninsula. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

ABSTRACT: This paper reports on successful hatchery production of the winged pearl oyster, Pteria penguin, without the use of live micro-algae. Larval nutrition was provided by commercially available micro-algae concentrates, Instant Algae® ("Isochrysis 1800®" and "Pavlova 1800®", Reed Mariculture Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). Larvae were first transferred to settlement tanks on day 17 when their mean antero-posterior measurement (APM) was 240.2 ± 8.6. μm. Approximately 6.4% of larvae survived to day 17 and more than 700,000 eyed pediveligers were transferred to settlement tanks between day 17 and day 25. Approximately 33,000 spat were harvested from spat collectors on day 105, representing a survival rate of 4.7% from the eyed pediveliger stage. Growth and development of larvae in this study were superior to those reported in a prior study that used a ternary live micro-algae diet to feed P. penguin larvae. Our results indicate that the products used in this study proved nutritious for P. penguin larvae and supported normal growth and development through settlement. The use of commercially available micro-algae concentrates as a replacement for live micro-algae in pearl oyster hatcheries supports development of simplified larval rearing protocols, without live micro-algae culture, that are more appropriate to Pacific island nations.Statement of relevanceThis paper reports for the first time on successful hatchery production of pearl oysters without the use of live micro-algae. Successful replacement of live micro-algae with commercially available micro-algae concentrates as a larval food source supports development of simpler, cheaper hatchery facilities, and larval rearing protocols that are more appropriate to Pacific island nations. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Thermoregulation could represent a significant fraction of the total energy budget of endotherms under unfavourable environmental conditions. This cost affects several traits of the ecology of an organism such as its behaviour, distribution, or life history. Heat produced by muscle contraction during activity can be used to pay for heat loss or thermoregulation in many species (known as “thermal substitution”). This study seeks to unite the effects of temperature, depth, and activity on the energetic costs of endotherm divers using the Magellanic penguin as model species and to evaluate whether penguins may benefit from thermal substitution. This species operates under highly variable temperature and depth conditions along its breeding range and provides an ideal natural experiment. A developed thermodynamic model describing foraging activity predicted that the major element affecting heat loss was depth, exacerbated by temperature. Birds living in colder waters are predicted to be able to minimize costs by executing shallower dives and benefit from thermal substitution by swimming faster, particularly during deeper dives. The model was evaluated in two contrasting scenarios: (1) when birds swim near the surface commuting to the foraging areas and (2) when birds dive to depth to forage. Activity data from tags on free-living penguins indicated two of these predictions were apparent; penguins generally travelled faster while commuting at the surface in colder waters, while birds from warmer water colonies dived deeper while foraging. Contrary to predictions, however, penguins swam slower at deeper depths during both descent and ascent phases of foraging dives. These results suggest that penguins may benefit from thermal substitution by swimming faster when birds perform shallow dives commuting to and back from foraging areas, but they provide no evidence of behavioural response (via swimming faster) for thermoregulation when diving to depth to forage. Reasons for this are discussed and include the relevance of prey abundance in 3-d space and maximizing dive duration by conserving oxygen reserves. The way the bird operates will have profound consequences for the energy needed and therefore necessary energy acquisition rates. Expansion of our findings to other diving endotherms might help explain both global activity patterns and energy flow in ecosystems. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Project CONVERGE, funded by the National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs, is deploying a coordinated ocean observing network to better understand ecological connections along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). Partners from Rutgers University, the University of Alaska, Fairbanks (UAF), Oregon State University, the University of Delaware, and the Polar Oceans Research Group deployed a multiplatform-observing network that includes gliders, animal telemetry, active acoustics for zooplankton distributions, and CODAR High Frequency Radar (HFR). The three-site network was deployed in November of 2014 and provided hourly surface current maps through the following austral summer. This study targets data collected between January and February 2015. Here we focus on Palmer Deep eddy and the tidal currents as they transition from diurnal to semi-diurnal regimes throughout the study period. These data are helping us better understand the links between alternating tidal regimes and the foraging behavior of the local Adélie penguin populations. This analysis has further implications for future research as the region goes through dramatic climate change. © 2015 MTS.

ABSTRACT:                              Marine top and meso predators like seabirds are limited by the need to breed on land but forage on limited or patchily distributed resources at sea. Constraints imposed by such central-place foraging behavior change during breeding or even disappear outside the breeding period when there is no immediate pressure to return to a central place. However, central place foraging is usually factored as an unchanging condition in life history studies. Here we used little penguin Eudyptula minor, a resident bird with one of the smallest foraging range among seabirds, to examine the different degree of pressure/constraints of being a central-place forager. We combined data on isotopic composition (δ                             13                             C and δ                             15                             N), conventional stomach contents and body mass of little penguins breeding at Phillip Island, Australia over 9 years (2003-2011). We explored relationships between diet and body mass in each stage of the breeding season (pre-laying, incubation, guard, and post-guard) in years of "high" and "low" reproductive success. Values of δ                             13                             C and δ                             15                             N as well as isotopic niche width had similar patterns among years, with less variability later in the season when little penguins shorten their foraging range at the expected peak of their central-place foraging limitation. Body mass peaked before laying and hatching in preparation for the energetically demanding periods of egg production and chick provisioning. An increase of anchovy and barracouta in the diet, two major prey for little penguins, occurred at the critical stage of chick rearing. These intra-annual trends could be a response to imposed foraging constraints as reproduction progresses, while inter-annual trends could reflect their ability to match or mismatch the high energy demanding chick rearing period with the peak in availability of high-quality prey such as anchovy. Our findings underline the key advantages of using a stable isotope approach combined with conventional dietary reconstruction to reveal an otherwise intractable ecological issue of different constrains of being a central-place forager, such as the little penguin, which could be applied to other marine species.                          © 2016 Chiaradia, Ramírez, Forero and Hobson.

ABSTRACT: Many species of seabirds, including the only penguin species breeding on the African continent, are threatened with extinction. The world population of the endangered African penguin Spheniscus demersus has decreased from more than 1.5 million individuals in the early 1900s to c.a. 23 000 pairs in 2013. Determining the trophic interactions of species, especially those of conservation concern, is important when declining numbers are thought to be driven by food limitation. By and large, African penguin dietary studies have relied on the identification of prey remains from stomach contents. Despite all the advantages of this method, it has well known biases. We therefore assessed the African penguin's diet, using stable isotopes, at two colonies in Algoa Bay (south-east coast of South Africa). These represent over 50% of the world population. Various samples (blood, feathers, egg membranes) were collected for carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses. Results indicate that the trophic ecology of African penguins is influenced by colony, season and age class, but not adult sex. Isotopic niches identified by standard Bayesian ellipse areas and convex hulls, highlighted differences among groups and variability among individual penguins. Using Bayesian mixing models it was for the first time shown that adults target chokka squid Loligo reynaudii for self-provisioning during particular stages of their annual cycle, while concurrently feeding their chicks primarily with small pelagic fish. This has important ramifications and means that not only pelagic fish, but also squid stocks, need to be carefully managed in order to allow population recovery of African penguin. © 2016 Connan et al.

ABSTRACT: The relationship between atmospheric bioaerosols and ecosystems is currently of global importance. Antarctica has an extreme climate, meaning that ecosystem behavior in this region is relatively simple. Direct sampling of atmospheric bioaerosols was performed at an Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) colony at Hukuro Cove, Langhovde, Antarctica on 22 January 2013. The aim of the sampling was to reveal the effect of the penguins on the Antarctic ecosystem within the atmospheric bioaerosols. Samples were bio-analyzed using a next-generation sequencing method. Biomass concentrations of Bacilli-class bacteria were 19.4 times higher when sampled leeward of the penguin colony compared with windward sampling. The source of these bacteria was the feces of the penguins. Predicted atmospheric trajectories indicate that the bacteria disperse towards the Southern Ocean. The largest biomass concentration in the windward bacteria was of the Gammaproteobacteria class, which decreased markedly with distance through the penguin colony, being deposited on soil, surface water, and ocean. It is concluded that bioaerosols and ecosystems near the penguin colony strongly influence each other. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR.

ABSTRACT: African Penguins Spheniscus demersus are sexually dimorphic; on average, males are larger than females but measurements overlap making sex determination difficult through observations alone. We developed a discriminant function, using bill length and depth from a sample of birds sexed from gonad visualisation during post-mortem, which correctly classified 93% of the individuals. Cross-validation correctly assigned 90% of DNA-sexed birds and 91% of birds sexed by partner measurement comparisons. The use of discriminant function score cutpoints, while leaving 16% and 29% of birds unclassified, improved accuracy of birds sexed by DNA to 97% and of those sexed by partner comparison to 99%. Bill depth was found to be a discriminating variable. However, two techniques for measuring bill depth are currently in use for African Penguins. While these measurements are correlated (r = 0.85), they differ on average by 1.4 mm hindering accuracy of sex determination when using a discriminant function developed from the other bill depth measurement. Exploration of adult bill morphology of birds sexed from DNA at different colonies suggests the discriminant functions can be applied throughout the African Penguins’ South African range. © 2016 NISC (Pty) Ltd.

ABSTRACT: New Zealand (NZ) is an internationally significant area for penguins. All NZ penguin species are listed in ‘at risk’ threat categories. The naturally uncommon Snares crested penguins (Eudyptes robustus), which are restricted to NZ subantarctic islands, are highly susceptible to localised stochastic events and human activities. There has been uncertainty about population size and trends for Snares crested penguins. We surveyed the nest abundance and distribution of Snares crested penguins on Northeast (NE) and Broughton Islands, Snares Island group, from late September to early October in 2008, 2010 and 2013 and compared results with a survey from 2000. Counts of all nests (nests with eggs and total observed nests) within all colonies around the islands were undertaken. In 2008, 19 845 ± 29 nests with eggs and 24 666 ± 38 total nests were counted from 111 colonies. In 2010, 25 525 ± 21 nests with eggs and 30 672 ± 26 total nests from 117 colonies were counted while in 2013, 25 149 ± 39 nests with eggs and 29 009 ± 45 total nests from 119 colonies were counted. Penguin nest numbers at the Snares appear to be stable overall when compared with the 2000 survey, which gave 28 396 nests with eggs (direct counts) and 30 607 total nests from 112 colonies. However, 2008 appears to be a year with considerably lower numbers of nests compared with other years. This apparently stable population is in contrast to most other crested penguins in the world. Given the extremely restricted distribution of Snares crested penguins and potential for a rapid catastrophic decline, we recommend surveys be continued at regular intervals in order to detect a significant decline and allow management measures to be implemented if needed. © New Zealand Ecological Society.

ABSTRACT: Emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) are sensitive to the Antarctic climate change because they breed on the fast sea ice. Studies of paleohistory for the emperor penguin are rare, due to the lack of archives on land. In this study, we obtained an emperor penguin ornithogenic sediment profile (PI) and performed geochronological, geochemical and stable isotope analyses on the sediments and feather remains. Two radiocarbon dates of penguin feathers in PI indicate that emperor penguins colonized Amanda Bay as early as CE 1540. By using the bio-elements (P, Se, Hg, Zn and Cd) in sediments and stable isotope values (δ15N and δ13C) in feathers, we inferred relative population size and dietary change of emperor penguins during the period of CE 1540–2008, respectively. An increase in population size with depleted N isotope ratios for emperor penguins on N island at Amanda Bay during the Little Ice Age (CE 1540–1866) was observed, suggesting that cold climate affected the penguin's breeding habitat, prey availability and thus their population and dietary composition. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Earlier breeding has been shown to be advantageous for the reproductive outcomes of a variety of avian species inhabiting a diverse range of environments. However, it is generally unclear how this advantage translates for polar seabirds that breed in a highly seasonal and restricted breeding season. The present study determined whether there was an overall advantage or disadvantage of early or late breeding on the reproductive outcomes of Adélie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae breeding at Béchervaise Island, East Antarctica. We examined this for individual nests within each year as well as for the overall population over a 13 yr period, using between 69 and 166 monitored nests each year. We investigated whether any advantage was related to bird age, and quantified the different environmental conditions (windchill and snow days) that early and late breeders and their eggs and chicks experienced. In just under half of the years, laying eggs late in the breeding season resulted in a reduced chance of chicks crèching, and early egg laying was advantageous in only 2 years. We found no evidence that the advantage of early breeding or the disadvantage of late laying was due to the age and associated experience of the birds. We are unable to generate a consistent explanation for why the timing of clutch initiation in some years was important for reproductive success, yet in others it was not. The years when timing was important were not consistently harsh nor were they particularly favourable for overall reproductive success. © 2016 Inter-Research.

ABSTRACT: Visible light on Earth largely comes from the sun, including light reflected from the moon. Predation risk is strongly determined by light conditions, and some animals are nocturnal to reduce predation. Artificial lights and its consequent light pollution may disrupt this natural behavior. Here, we used 13 years of attendance data to study the effects of sun, moon, and artificial light on the attendance pattern of a nocturnal seabird, the little penguin Eudyptula minor at Phillip Island, Australia. The little penguin is the smallest and the only penguin species whose activity on land is strictly nocturnal. Automated monitoring systems recorded individually marked penguins every time they arrived (after sunset) at or departed (before sunrise) from 2 colonies under different lighting conditions: natural night skylight and artificial lights (around 3 lux) used to enhance penguin viewing for ecotourism around sunset. Sunlight had a strong effect on attendance as penguins arrived on average around 81 min after sunset and departed around 92 min before sunrise. The effect of moonlight was also strong, varying according to moon phase. Fewer penguins came ashore during full moon nights. Moon phase effect was stronger on departure than arrival times. Thus, during nights between full moon and last quarter, arrival times (after sunset) were delayed, even though moonlight levels were low, while departure times (before sunrise) were earlier, coinciding with high moonlight levels. Cyclic patterns of moon effect were slightly out of phase but significantly between 2 colonies, which could be due to site-specific differences or presence/absence of artificial lights. Moonlight could be overridden by artificial light at our artificially lit colony, but the similar amplitude of attendance patterns between colonies suggests that artificial light did not mask the moonlight effect. Further research is indeed necessary to understand how seabirds respond to the increasing artificial night light levels. © SAGE Publications.

ABSTRACT: Research was performed to increase our understanding of male Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) reproductive biology and to develop artificial insemination (AI) technology to assist with maintaining the species' genetic diversity. Seminal traits were characterized from seven males with noncontaminated ejaculates (n = 123) displaying high in vitro motion parameters, membrane integrity, and morphology. Seven females were maintained in nest sites that permitted visual, auditory, and tactile contact with their paired male but not copulation for 18.3 ± 2.4 days before egg lay. After cloacal AI (2.6 ± 0.4 inseminations/female) with semen chilled for up to 20.5 hr at 5°C, all females produced one to two fertile eggs, with the first oviposition occurring within 7 days of plasma progesterone concentrations exceeding 0.8 ng/ml. Overall fertility was 91.7%, hatchability was 63.6%, and genetic analyses confirmed that all embryos and hatchlings were sired by AI males. The heterospermic AI design demonstrated that eggs were fertilized by spermatozoa chilled for 1.5-19.8 hr before AI and were laid 4.5-11.5 days post AI. These results contribute new data on Magellanic penguin sperm biology and demonstrate that high fertility rates after AI of chilled semen can be achieved with females remaining in proximity to their paired mate. © Copyright 2016 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Little Penguins (Eudyptula minor) are high-trophic coastal feeders and are effective indicators of bioavailable pollutants in their foraging zones. Here, we present concentrations of metals and metalloids in blood of 157 Little Penguins, collected over three years and during three distinct seasons (breeding, moulting and non-breeding) at two locations: the urban St Kilda colony and the semi-rural colony at Phillip Island, Victoria, Australia. Penguin metal concentrations were foremostly influenced by location (St Kilda > Phillip Island for non-essential elements) and differed among years and seasons at both locations, reflecting differences in seasonal metal bioaccumulation or seasonal exposure through prey. Mean blood mercury concentrations showed an increasing annual trend and a negative correlation with flipper length at St Kilda. Notably, this study is the first to report on blood metal concentrations during the different stages of moult, showing the mechanism of non-essential metal mobilisation and detoxification. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Repeated deep dives are highly pro-oxidative events for air-breathing aquatic foragers such as penguins. At fledging, the transition from a strictly terrestrial to a marine lifestyle may therefore trigger a complex set of anti-oxidant responses to prevent chronic oxidative stress in immature penguins but these processes are still undefined. By combining in vivo and in vitro approaches with transcriptome analysis, we investigated the adaptive responses of sea-acclimatized (SA) immature king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) compared with pre-fledging never-immersed (NI) birds. In vivo, experimental immersion into cold water stimulated a higher thermogenic response in SA penguins than in NI birds, but both groups exhibited hypothermia, a condition favouring oxidative stress. In vitro, the pectoralis muscles of SA birds displayed increased oxidative capacity and mitochondrial protein abundance but unchanged reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation per g tissue because ROS production per mitochondria was reduced. The genes encoding oxidant-generating proteins were down-regulated in SA birds while mRNA abundance and activity of the main antioxidant enzymes were up-regulated. Genes encoding proteins involved in repair mechanisms of oxidized DNA or proteins and in degradation processes were also up-regulated in SA birds. Sea life also increased the degree of fatty acid unsaturation in muscle mitochondrial membranes resulting in higher intrinsic susceptibility to ROS. Oxidative damages to protein or DNA were reduced in SA birds. Repeated experimental immersions of NI penguins in cold-water partially mimicked the effects of acclimatization to marine life, modified the expression of fewer genes related to oxidative stress but in a similar way as in SA birds and increased oxidative damages to DNA. It is concluded that the multifaceted plasticity observed after marine life may be crucial to maintain redox homeostasis in active tissues subjected to high pro-oxidative pressure in diving birds. Initial immersions in cold-water may initiate an hormetic response triggering essential changes in the adaptive antioxidant response to marine life. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The Ross Sea is home to about a third of the world population of Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae). Between 2001 and 2013 the number of breeding pairs of Adélie penguins at colonies in the southwestern Ross Sea more than doubled. It has been suggested that this increase was caused by the fishery for Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni) leading to mesopredator release of Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarctica), a shared prey of toothfish and Adélie penguins. Cases of mesopredator release in marine systems have been widely reported, but limited information on marine predators often hinders quantitative investigation of these changes. The present study has brought together information from multiple models to estimate the biomass of silverfish that could be released from predation through the effects of the toothfish fishery. New diet data for toothfish are presented which show that Antarctic toothfish and Adélie penguins do not have significantly overlapping diets in the southwestern Ross Sea. The mass of silverfish released from predation due to the effects of fishing was estimated to be 128 tonnes wet-weight per year (tWW/y; 5th–95th estimation interval of 46–358 tWW/y) in 2013, equivalent to less than 2% of the biomass of silverfish estimated to be consumed annually by Adélie penguins. Even if toothfish consumed only silverfish, the predicted predation release effect would still not be sufficient to explain the observed increase in the number of Adélie penguins in the southern Ross Sea. The results of the modelling are hence inconsistent with predation release of silverfish due to the toothfish fishery being responsible for recent increases in the number of Adélie penguins breeding in the southwestern Ross Sea. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Complete ophthalmic examinations were performed on 160 Macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus) and 90 Rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome) at eight North American zoological institutions. Cataract prevalence in the Macaroni population was 46.5% (n = 74) of penguins and 42.3% (135/319) of eyes. Cataract prevalence in the Rockhopper population was 45.5% (n = 40) of penguins and 40.6% (73/180) of eyes. The mean age of Macaroni penguins without ocular disease was 7.4 ± 5.8 yr, while that of Rockhoppers was 9.8 ± 6.4 yr. Risk factors for cataract were examined through husbandry surveys completed by each institution and by evaluation of light intensity and ultraviolet (UV) light measurements acquired in each penguin exhibit. Risk factors associated with cataract in Macaroni penguins included age, dietary smelt, hand-feeding, and fluorescent exhibit lighting. Risk factors associated with cataract in Rockhopper penguins included age, dietary capelin, increasing population density, and increasing length of minimum photoperiod. Factors associated with decreased odds of cataract in Macaroni penguins included saltwater pool, monitoring of water quality for salinity, pH, and alkalinity; use of water additives; presence of pool filtration and sterilization systems; use of metal halide lightbulbs; increasing light intensity; and UV spectrum lighting. Factors associated with decreased odds of cataract in Rockhoppers included dietary herring and krill, increasing exhibit land area, pool temperature monitoring, increasing maximum photoperiod, and increasing minimum UV light. © 2016 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: We identified and compared gross and microscopic lesions associated with the cestode, Parorchites zederi, in the digestive tracts of three species of penguins (Spheniscidae): the Chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarctica), Gentoo (Pygoscelis papua), and Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae). The gastrointestinal tracts of 79 recently dead individuals (71 chicks and eight adults) were collected in locations throughout the Antarctic Peninsula during summer field trips in 2006–09. Parorchites zederi was found in the small intestine of 37 animals (47%), and 23 (62%) of these had parasite-associated lesions. The cestodes were either free in the intestinal lumen, clustered within mucosal ulcers, or deeply embedded in the intestinal wall. Histopathologic changes were most severe in adult Gentoo Penguins and included transmural fibrogranulomatous enteritis, hemorrhage, and edema. This report of pathology associated with P. zederi in the digestive tracts of penguins can serve as reference to monitor health in Antarctic birds associated with environmental changes. © Wildlife Disease Association 2016.

ABSTRACT: The purpose of this paper is to provide a taphonomic analysis of the holotype of Crossvallia unienwillia Tambussi, Reguero, Marenssi and Santillana, 2005, in order to improve the knowledge of the vertebrate record of the Cross Valley Formation, a unit exposed in the central area of Marambio (Seymour) Island, Antarctic Peninsula. Analyses of the preservational state of the skeleton assigned to Crossvallia unienwillia offer important data for palaeoenvironmental and depositional reconstructions, key for the understanding of the early evolutionary history of penguins. Different techniques, including petrographic sections, SEM observation, Secondary Electrons Detectors, backscattered electrons detectors, microanalysis for probe of electrons, and X-ray diffraction were applied in order to distinguish biostratinomic from fossil diagenetic damage. Fossil bones of Crossvallia are associated with a typical marine assemblage including shark remains and macroinvertebrates. The hosting mudstones suggest a low-energy environment either below the wave-base or protected from wave action. In any case initial marine conditions changed to other with regular influx of land-derived sedimentary material. Crossvallia unienwillia was a female diver that passed through several molting periods before death. Biostratinomic processes consistent with little transport and rapid burial which would have prevented the action of destructive processes such as weathering and carnivores or scavenging, are inferred. The rapid burial favored the initial preservation of the elements under anoxic conditions. The surficial corrosion, fractures, and the internal filling of the cavities, suggest that destructive processes were only important after final burial during the telodiagenetic stage. The absence of more vertebrate fossil remains in the Cross Valley C Allomember is the result of those destructive processes, whereas on the contrary the original depositional environment appears to have been optimal.

ABSTRACT: Concern of pelagic gelatinous organisms taking over perturbed marine ecosystems has led to a recent increase in research into this group. However, the significance of this group as prey remains challenging to assess, and hence, gelatinous consumers are often depicted incorrectly as dead ends of pelagic food webs. In the Southern Ocean, where a shift in trophic webs may favour gelatinous animals, we video-monitored prey intake of a key predator. Twenty-eight chick-rearing Adélie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae from Dumont d’Urville station (66°40ʹS, 140°01ʹE) were instrumented with miniaturized video loggers in 2014-2015. Among other items (krill, fish), 101 gelatinous organisms (n = 79 jellyfish, 6 salps and 16 unidentified) were observed on 13 of 21 exploitable video footages (total: 59 h). Importantly, 65.3 % of gelatinous organisms were attacked, but among them salps were not attacked. Attacks on jellyfish were significantly associated with the visible presence of the jellyfish’s gonad. Jellyfish were encountered at an average depth of 26.2 ± 10.4 m, significantly shallower than krill. Attacks occurred mostly during bottom, but also descent or ascent dive phases. Concomitant GPS location for four birds revealed that attacks on jellyfish occurred above the shelf, 35 km north from the colony, where sea ice concentration reached 88 %. These results indicate that Adélie penguins occasionally feed on jellyfish, even though other prey types are also available. Refining our perception of scyphozoans’ niche may thus help anticipate the functional response of the food webs to the extensive changes witnessed in the Antarctic environment. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016.

ABSTRACT: In marine ecosystems, primary productivity and consequently food availability for higher trophic levels are often strongly affected by the water temperature. Thus, differences in sea surface temperatures (SST) may lead to differences in the diet composition of predators, but this link is still unknown in many species. By combining GPS tracking and dive analyses on chick-rearing southern rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome) with stable isotope analyses and monitoring of chick growth rates and chick survival, we here attempted a comprehensive assessment of the effects of inter-annual environmental variability as indicated by SST and chlorophyll a (reflecting primary productivity) data. Inter-annual differences in environmental variables around our study colony on New Island, Falkland/Malvinas Islands, contradicted the general expectation, with higher chlorophyll a concentrations coinciding with higher spring SST in 2010/2011 compared to 2009/2010. Penguins foraged further away from the colony during guard and crèche in 2010/2011 compared to 2009/2010, while performing deeper dives in 2009/2010. Stable isotope mixing models suggested a crustacean-dominated chick diet in 2009/2010, compared to a mixture of squid and fish in 2010/2011. These differences in foraging behaviour and diet, however, had no consequences for chick growth rates or chick survival and thus had no apparent effect on population trajectories. Potentially, environmental conditions in both years could still be seen as favourable compared to other years and breeding sites, enabling the parental birds to buffer the environmental differences by plastic foraging behaviour. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Morphological variation between populations of the same species can arise as a response to genetic variation, local environmental conditions, or a combination of both. In this study, I examined small-scale geographic variation in bill size and body mass in little penguins (Eudyptula minor) across five breeding colonies in South Australia separated by <150 km. To help understand patterns driving the differences, I investigated these variations in relation to environmental parameters (air temperature, sea surface temperature, and water depth) and geographic distances between the colonies. I found substantial morphological variation among the colonies for body mass and bill measurements (except bill length). Colonies further located from each other showed greater morphological divergence overall than adjacent colonies. In addition, phenotypic traits were somewhat correlated to environmental parameters. Birds at colonies surrounded by hotter sea surface temperatures were heavier with longer and larger bills. Birds with larger and longer bills were also found at colonies surrounded by shallower waters. Overall, the results suggest that both environmental factors (natural selection) and interpopulation distances (isolation by distance) are causes of phenotypic differentiation between South Australian little penguin colonies. © 2016 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: A 19-year-old male African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) was presented with coelomic distention after a 6-week history of lethargy and decreased appetite. Results of radiographs showed loss of coelomic detail, and ultrasound and computed tomography results revealed coelomic fluid and dilated hepatic veins. Echocardiography revealed moderate right atrial enlargement. Findings were consistent with right-sided cardiac disease. Treatment with furosemide initially reduced ascites, but the clinical condition worsened weeks later and enalapril, pimobendan, and sildenafil were added to the medical therapy. At 12 weeks after presentation, results of an echocardiogram revealed persistent right atrioventricular valve regurgitation, moderate ascites, and dilation of hepatic veins. Clinical signs of right heart failure were managed through adjustments in medical therapy and coelomic fluid aspiration, but the bird died 18 weeks after initial presentation. Gross and microscopic findings were consistent with valvular insufficiency and right-sided heart failure. To our knowledge, this case is the first documented report of cardiac disease in an African penguin. © 2016 by the Association of Avian Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Ten Humboldt (Spheniscus humboldti) and eight Magellanic Penguins (S. magellanicus) were successfully equipped with satellite transmitters in March 2009 on Islotes Puñihuil in central south-Chile to follow their post-moult dispersal. Overall, Humboldt Penguins could be followed for a mean period of 49 ±18 days (range: 25-93) and Magellanic Penguins for 57 ±12 days (range 35-68). Irrespective of species and sex, seven study birds remained in the vicinity of their breeding ground throughout the transmission period. All other penguins moved northwards, either only a relatively short distance (max 400 km) to Isla Mocha at 38°S (n= 3) or further north beyond 35°S (n= 8). However, eight of these birds (73%) turned south again towards the end of the individual tracking periods. The total area used by both species during the tracking period was restricted to a coastal area stretching from the breeding site at 42°S about 1000 km to the north at about 32°S. The area used by Humboldt penguins overlapped by 95% the area used by Magellanic penguins, whereas the area used by the latter species was much larger and overlapped only by 45% with the area used by Humboldt penguins. Overall, our results indicate that Magellanic Penguins in the Pacific Ocean are probably less migratory than their conspecifics on the Atlantic side, while Humboldt Penguins appear to be more migratory than previously anticipated. In general, there was a poor relationship between preferred foraging areas and chlorophyll-a, as a proxy for primary productivity, indicating the limitations of using remote-sensed primary productivity as a proxy to interpret the foraging behaviour of marine predators. In addition, there was also no clear relationship between the preferred foraging areas and the amount of regional fish catches by artisanal fishery. © 2016 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Anterior gastrointestinal tract obstruction by a foreign body has been reported in several avian species, most commonly in captive birds. It is often associated with behavioral issues that lead to compulsive consumption of bedding materials or bright moving objects. In penguins, foreign bodies are most commonly identified at necropsy and often are found in the ventriculus because of anatomic characteristics of the species. A captive African black-footed penguin (Spheniscus demersus) was diagnosed with a ventricular foreign body. The anatomic and physiologic differences that should be taken into account when surgically removing a ventricular foreign body in a penguin are described. These differences include the caudal location in the coelom and the large size of the ventriculus in proportion to the penguin's body size; the presence of a simple stomach, uniform in thickness and lacking muscular development; a simple gastrointestinal cycle (gastric contraction); and variability in pH of stomach contents. No complications were observed after surgery, and the bird recovered completely. Management of foreign bodies in birds should be based on the clinical signs of the individual bird, the species affected and its anatomic characteristics, the nature and location of the foreign body, available tools, and the preference and experience of the surgeon. This particular case demonstrates that the most indicated and preferred method is not always possible and that knowledge of biologic, anatomic, and physiologic differences of the species may allow the use of an alternative and more invasive approach with favorable outcomes. © 2016 by the Association of Avian Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Penguins produce contact calls to maintain social relationships and group cohesion. Such vocalisations have recently been demonstrated to encode individual identity information in the African penguin. Using a source-filter theory approach, we investigated whether acoustic cues of individuality can also be found in other Spheniscus penguins and the acoustic features of contact calls have diverged within this genus. We recorded vocalisations from two ex-situ colonies of Humboldt penguin and Magellanic penguin (sympatric and potentially interbreeding in the wild) and one ex-situ group of African penguins (allopatric although capable of interbreeding with the other two species in captivity). We measured 14 acoustic parameters from each vocalisation. These included temporal (duration), source-related (fundamental frequency, f0), and filter-related (formants) parameters. They were then used to carry out a series of stepwise discriminant function analyses (with cross-validation) and General Linear Model comparisons. We showed that contact calls allow individual discrimination in two additional species of the genus Spheniscus. We also found that calls can be classified according to species in a manner far greater than that attributable by chance, even though there is limited genetic distance among African, Humboldt, and Magellanic penguins. Our results provide further evidence that the source-filter theory is a valuable framework for investigating the biologically meaningful information contained in bird vocalisations. Our findings also provide novel insights into penguin vocal communication and suggest that contact calls of the penguin family are affected by selection for individuality. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: When successive stages in the life history of an animal directly overlap, physiological conflicts can arise resulting in carryover effects from one stage to another. The extreme egg-size dimorphism (ESD) of Eudyptes penguins, where the first-laid A-egg is approximately 18-57% smaller than the second-laid B-egg, has interested researchers for decades. Recent studies have linked variation in this trait to a carryover effect of migration that limits the physiology of yolk production and egg sizes. We assembled data on ESD and estimates of migration-reproduction overlap in penguin species and use phylogenetic methods to test the idea that migration-reproduction overlap explains variation in ESD.We showthat migration overlap is generally restricted to Eudyptes relative to non-Eudyptes penguins, and that this overlap (defined as the amount of time that egg production occurs on land versus at sea during homeward migration) is significantly and positively correlated with the degree of ESD in Eudyptes. In the non-Eudyptes species, however, ESD was unrelated to migration overlap as these species mostly produce their clutches on land. Our results support the recent hypothesis that extreme ESD of Eudyptes penguins evolved, in part, as a response to selection for a pelagic overwinter migration behaviour. This resulted in a temporal overlap with, and thus a constraint on, the physiology of follicle development, leading to smaller A-egg size and greater ESD. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Australia has a fossil record of penguins reaching back to the Eocene, yet today is inhabited by just one breeding species, the little penguin Eudyptula minor. The description of recently collected penguin fossils from the re-dated upper Miocene Port Campbell Limestone of Portland (Victoria), in addition to reanalysis of previously described material, has allowed the Cenozoic history of penguins in Australia to be placed into a global context for the first time. Australian pre-Quaternary fossil penguins represent stem taxa phylogenetically disparate from each other and E. minor, implying multiple dispersals and extinctions. Late Eocene penguins from Australia are closest to contemporaneous taxa in Antarctica, New Zealand and South America. Given current material, the Miocene Australian fossil penguin fauna is apparently unique in harbouring 'giant penguins' after they went extinct elsewhere; and including stem taxa until at least 6 Ma, by which time crown penguins dominated elsewhere in the southern hemisphere. Separation of Australia from Antarctica during the Palaeogene, and its subsequent drift north, appears to have been a major event in Australian penguin biogeography. Increasing isolation through the Cenozoic may have limited penguin dispersal to Australia from outside the Australasian region, until intensification of the eastwards-flowing Antarctic Circumpolar Current in the mid-Miocene established a potential new dispersal vector to Australia. © 2016 Park et al.

ABSTRACT: Ophthalmic examinations were performed on 160 macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus) and 90 southern rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome) at eight North American zoos and aquaria. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured using rebound tonometry while penguins were held in two different body positions. Correlations between IOP and factors including age, body position, eye pathology, and housing parameters were evaluated. Normal macaroni penguins had a mean IOP of 42.0 ± 9.7 mm Hg. Normal rockhopper penguins had a mean IOP of 32.9 ± 6.2 mm Hg. Neither species had significantly different IOP between sexes or between left and right eyes of the same penguin. In both species, there was a negative linear correlation between age and IOP. In the macaroni population, IOP was significantly higher when IOP measurement was performed before ophthalmic exam; this was not true in rockhoppers. In both species, IOP measured in a horizontal body position was significantly higher than IOP measured in a vertical body position. In both species, eyes with corneal lesions had significantly lower IOP than normal eyes. In the macaroni penguin, eyes with rubeosis iridis had significantly lower IOP than normal eyes. In macaroni penguins, eyes with cataracts had significantly lower mean IOP than normal eyes; this was not true for rockhoppers. © Copyright 2016 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Slocum Gliders have proven their usefulness in providing large volumes of high definition data but for the first time we were able to couple that with a FIRe system and look at the efficiency rates of phytoplankton in a hard to sample region of the world. The FIRe equipped glider allowed for high spatial and temporal resolution of physiological data vs. discrete samples taken with the traditional Go-Flo/Niskan bottle method and/or continuous flow through surface sampling via ships. We have identified numerous quality control measures that will need to be furthur explored for continued success of the sensor. © 2015 MTS.

ABSTRACT: The Palmer Deep submarine canyon on the Western Antarctic Peninsula provides a conduit for upwelling of relatively warm, nutrient rich waters which enhance local primary production and support a food web productive enough to sustain a large top predator biomass. In an analysis of ten years of satellite-tagged penguins, showed that circulation features associated with tidal flows may be a key driver of nearshore predator distributions. During diurnal tides, the penguins feed close to their breeding colonies and during semi-diurnal tides, the penguins make foraging trips to the more distant regions of Palmer Deep. It is hypothesized that convergent features act to concentrate primary producers and aggregate schools of krill that influence the behavior of predator species. The initial results from a six month deployment of a High Frequency Radar network in Palmer Deep are presented in an attempt to characterize and quantify convergent features. During a three month period from January through March 2015, we conducted in situ sampling consisting of multiple underwater glider deployments, small boat acoustic surveys of Antarctic krill, and penguin ARGOS-linked satellite telemetry and time-depth recorders (TDRs). The combination of real-time surface current maps with adaptive in situ sampling introduces High Frequency Radar to the Antarctic in a way that allows us to rigorously and efficiently test the influence of local tidal processes on top predator foraging ecology © 2016 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Climate change, fisheries' pressure on penguin prey, and direct human disturbance of wildlife have all been implicated in causing large shifts in the abundance and distribution of penguins in the Southern Ocean. Without mark-recapture studies, understanding how colonies form and, by extension, how ranges shift is challenging. Genetic studies, particularly focused on newly established colonies, provide a snapshot of colonization and can reveal the extent to which shifts in abundance and occupancy result from changes in demographic rates (e.g., reproduction and survival) or migration among suitable patches of habitat. Here, we describe the population structure of a colonial seabird breeding across a large latitudinal range in the Southern Ocean. Using multilocus microsatellite genotype data from 510 Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) individuals from 14 colonies along the Scotia Arc and Antarctic Peninsula, together with mitochondrial DNA data, we find strong genetic differentiation between colonies north and south of the Polar Front, that coincides geographically with the taxonomic boundary separating the subspecies P. p. papua and P. p. ellsworthii. Using a discrete Bayesian phylogeographic approach, we show that southern Gentoos expanded from a possible glacial refuge in the center of their current range, colonizing regions to the north and south through rare, long-distance dispersal. Our findings show that this dispersal is important for new colony foundation and range expansion in a seabird species that ordinarily exhibits high levels of natal philopatry, though persistent oceanographic features serve as barriers to movement. © 2016 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The expansion of humans into previously unoccupied parts of the globe is thought to have driven the decline and extinction of numerous vertebrate species. In New Zealand, human settlement in the late thirteenth century AD led to the rapid demise of a distinctive vertebrate fauna, and also a number of’turnover’ events where extinct lineages were subsequently replaced by closely related taxa. The recent genetic detection of an Australian little penguin (Eudyptula novaehollandiae) in southeastern New Zealand may potentially represent an additional ‘cryptic’ invasion. Here we use ancient- DNA (aDNA) analysis and radiocarbon dating of pre-human, archaeological and historical Eudyptula remains to reveal that the arrival of E. novaehollandiae in New Zealand probably occurred between AD 1500 and 1900, following the anthropogenic decline of its sister taxon, the endemic Eudyptula minor. This rapid turnover event, revealed by aDNA, suggests that native species decline can be masked by invasive taxa, and highlights the potential for human-mediated biodiversity shifts. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Seabirds are subject to the influences of local climate variables during periods of land-based activities such as breeding and, for some species, moult; particularly if they undergo a catastrophic moult (complete simultaneous moult) as do penguins. We investigated potential relationships between adult penguin survival and land-based climate variables (ambient air temperature, humidity and rainfall) using 46 years of mark-recapture data of little penguins Eudyptula minor gathered at a breeding colony on Phillip Island in southeastern Australia. Our results showed that adult penguin survival had a stronger association with land-based climate variables during the moult period, when birds were unable to go to sea for up to 3 weeks, than during the breeding period, when birds could sacrifice breeding success in favour of survival. Annual adult survival probability was positively associated with humidity during moult and negatively associated with rainfall during moult. Prolonged heat during breeding and moult had a negative association with annual adult survival. Local climate projections suggest increasing days of high temperatures, fewer days of rainfall which will result in more droughts (and by implication, lower humidity) and more extreme rainfall events. All of these predicted climate changes are expected to have a negative impact on adult penguin survival. © 2015, ISB.

ABSTRACT: The variability in individual fitness within a population is likely to be mediated through individual foraging ability and tactics, themselves linked to age-or experience-related processes, but also to differences in individual quality. Not only age, experience, and quality but also sex-related foraging strategies should particularly play an important role in long-lived central-place foragers that have to cope with strong environmental constraints. We monitored the foraging effort (foraging trip durations and number of trips) of 262 known-age micro-tagged king penguins, Aptenodytes patagonicus, at different breeding stages during one of their breeding cycles. We investigated how their age (4-11 years old), sex, past breeding experience (the number of successful breeding attempts), and breeding quality (the expected breeding success, corresponding to the residual of the linear relationship between the age and on the number of past breeding success divided by the number of breeding attempts) affected foraging over a whole breeding season. During the incubation, younger birds (4 years old) undertook longer foraging trips compared with older ones. During the brooding phase and the second period of the crèching phase, more experienced birds performed shorter foraging trip than those with a low breeding experience, whereas, during the first period of the crèching phase, individuals with better breeding quality performed shorter foraging trips at sea than low breeding quality individuals. Sex-specific foraging patterns were also observed depending on the period of the breeding cycle. Our study shows, for the first time, how foraging effort can be driven by a complex interplay of several individual parameters according to breeding stage and resource availability and abundance. © 2016 Oxford University Press.

ABSTRACT: Helicobacter spp. colonize the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals and have been associated with gastrointestinal diseases. Antarctic habitats are considered pristine ecosystems, but the increase in human activity could be introducing human bacteria hosted into waters and wildlife. However, Helicobacter spp. occurrence has not been studied in Antarctica. The aim of our study was to detect the Helicobacter DNA in different water sources and penguin feces from Greenwich, Dee and Barrientos Islands during summer of 2012 and 2013. High Helicobacter proportion was observed in water sources amplifying the 16S rRNA (33/40) and 23S rRNA genes (37/40) by semi-nested PCR. Similar results were observed in feces from Gentoo penguins (16S rRNA: 32/39, and 23S rRNA: 28/39) and Chinstrap penguins (16S rRNA: 16/17, and 23S rRNA: 15/17) by PCR. The phylogenetic relationship of 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA sequences from penguin feces was closely related to Helicobacter brantae. Analyses of 16S rRNA sequences showed that the majority of water samples are related to penguin (3/6) and Helicobacter pylori (2/6) sequences, but the 23S rRNA sequences matched with Campylobacter and Arcobacter. These results show for the first time the presence of the genus Helicobacter in different Antarctica water sources and in Gentoo and Chinstrap penguin feces. A few 16S rRNA sequences are very closely related to H. pylori, but specific glmM and ureAH. pylori genes were not detected. More studies are needed to determine the Helicobacter species present in this ecosystem and to establish the human impact in these Antarctic Islands. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Intestinal parasites suppose a cost to hosts as they compete directly for nutritional resources. Therefore, hosts must defend themselves against intestinal parasites by mounting an immune response. Many penguin species acquire parasites through their diet and transfer these parasites to their chicks when feeding them. High parasite loads in penguin chicks could have effects on their growth and body condition, and ultimately on their survival. Here, we evaluated the effect of parasites on the cell-mediated immune system in Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) chicks at Stranger Point (25 de Mayo/King George Island, South Shetland Islands). To this end, 12 chicks were experimentally deparasitized with a mixture of anthelminthic drugs (albendazole and praziquantel), whereas 10 others were kept as control. We measured cutaneous cell-mediated immunity in response to immunization with phytohemagglutinin (PHA). We also analyzed the leukocyte profile in both treated and control groups before and after the treatment. After the treatment, deparasitized birds showed larger foot-web swelling in response to PHA injection than control birds. Deparasitized penguins also showed lower eosinophil and monocyte counts than controls, whereas heterophils, lymphocytes, and total white blood cell counts did not differ between groups. Our results suggest that Gentoo penguin chicks parasitized with intestinal parasites suffer a cost in terms of reduced cell-mediated immune responses that could ultimately affect their survival. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: The presence of xenobiotics, such as metals, in ecosystems is concerning due to their durability and they pose a threat to the health and life of organisms. Moreover, mercury can biomagnify in many marine food chains and, therefore, organisms at higher trophic levels can be adversely impacted. Although feathers have been used extensively as a bio-monitoring tool, only a few studies have addressed the effect of both age and sex on metal accumulation. In this study, the concentrations of trace elements were determined in the feathers of all members of a captive colony of African Penguins (Spheniscus demersus) housed in a zoological facility in Italy. Tests were performed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry to detect aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, manganese, nickel, lead, selenium, tin, vanadium, and zinc. Mercury was detected by a direct mercury analyzer. Sexing was performed by a molecular approach based on analyzing the chromo-helicase-DNA-binding1 gene, located on the sex chromosomes. Sex- and age-related differences were studied in order to investigate the different patterns of metal bioaccumulation between male and female individuals and between adults and juveniles. Juvenile females had significantly higher arsenic levels than males, while selenium levels increased significantly with age in both sexes. Penguins kept in controlled environments—given that diet and habitat are under strict control—represent a unique opportunity to determine if and how metal bioaccumulation is related to sex and age. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: Breeding seabirds often need to locate prey in spatially confined search areas on short temporal scales. Ocean physical features such as thermoclines are used as foraging cues since they concentrate and thus increase the likelihood of locating prey. However, in highly variable environments, it is less well understood how these features act as foraging cues. African penguins Spheniscus demersus foraging in Algoa Bay, South Africa, were fitted with GPS-TD loggers to determine the cues they use to locate prey on fine temporal (<24 h) and spatial (<100 km) scales in a bay with changing thermal properties. African penguins showed a preference for cooler surface waters associated with upwelling, avoiding warm surface waters associated with the Agulhas Current. Thermocline presence and characteristics were an important foraging cue; penguins consistently foraged at and below the thermocline even though its depth and gradient shifted over time. Dive ascent and descent rates were quicker in the presence of thermoclines with strong gradients, which form a distinct separation between the warm upper mixed layer and the cooler lower layer. Foraging dives occurred predominantly below the thermocline, while search dives occurred around the thermocline depth. Penguins dived deeper in search of prey when there was no thermo cline. Our results demonstrate that top predators can cope with highly variable environments by adjusting their search strategy to target environments suited to their main prey. © Inter-Research 2016.

ABSTRACT: The early life stage of long-lived species is critical to the viability of population, but is poorly understood. Longitudinal studies are needed to test whether juveniles are less efficient foragers than adults as has been hypothesized. We measured changes in the diving behaviour of 17 one-year-old king penguins Aptenodytes patagonicus at Crozet Islands (subantartic archipelago) during their first months at sea, using miniaturized tags that transmitted diving activity in real time. We also equipped five non-breeder adults with the same tags for comparison. The data on foraging performance revealed two groups of juveniles. The first group made shallower and shorter dives that may be indicative of early mortality while the second group progressively increased their diving depths and durations, and survived the first months at sea. This surviving group of juveniles required the same recovery durations as adults, but typically performed shallower and shorter dives. There is thereby a relationship between improved diving behaviour and survival in young penguins. This long period of improving diving performance in the juvenile life stage is potentially a critical period for the survival of deep avian divers and may have implications for their ability to adapt to environmental change. © 2016 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The passage from shore to marine life is a critical step in the development of juvenile penguins and is characterized by a fuel selection towards lipid oxidation concomitant to an enhancement of lipid-induced thermogenesis. However, mechanisms of such thermogenic improvement at fledging remain undefined. We used two different groups of pre-fledging king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) to investigate the specific contribution of cold exposure during water immersion to lipid metabolism. Terrestrial penguins that had never been immersed in cold water were compared with experimentally cold-water immersed juveniles. Experimentally immersed penguins underwent ten successive immersions at approximately 9–10 °C for 5 h over 3 weeks. We evaluated adaptive thermogenesis by measuring body temperature, metabolic rate and shivering activity in fully immersed penguins exposed to water temperatures ranging from 12 to 29 °C. Both never-immersed and experimentally immersed penguins were able to maintain their homeothermy in cold water, exhibiting similar thermogenic activity. In vivo, perfusion of lipid emulsion at thermoneutrality induced a twofold larger calorigenic response in experimentally immersed than in never-immersed birds. In vitro, the respiratory rates and the oxidative phosphorylation efficiency of isolated muscle mitochondria were not improved with cold-water immersions. The present study shows that acclimation to cold water only partially reproduced the fuel selection towards lipid oxidation that characterizes penguin acclimatization to marine life. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Background: In animals, recoil motion resulting from underwater propulsion can destabilise trajectory and decrease locomotory performance. The posture of diving seabirds fluctuates simultaneously with their appendage beat, especially in the vertical plane, because of the recoil force of the beat. Seabirds that fly and swim face trade-offs between maximising their locomotory performance in one medium relative to the other, and flightless penguins were hypothesised to have higher underwater pitching stability than alcids that fly and swim. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the in situ pitching stability of three species of diving seabirds, including a penguin, Pygoscelis adeliae, and two species of alcids, Cerorhinca monocerata and Uria lomvia. A high-resolution gyroscope data logger was attached to the back of each bird and recorded the angular velocity of the body during the descent phase of dives. Results: For all three species, the root mean square (RMS) of the angular velocity, which indicated the level of angular fluctuation, was negatively correlated with the depth. Many factors, such as the dorsoventral acceleration resulting from wing beat, dive angle, speed, and current depth, as well as the maximum depth in each dive, significantly affected the angular velocity RMS. The angular velocity RMS at a given depth (e.g. 5 and 10 m) significantly increased with the maximum depth of the dives, suggesting buoyancy regulation relative to the target depth to reduce the destabilising angular momentum in all three species. During entire descent periods, the angular fluctuation was generally lower in P. adeliae than in the two species of alcids, supporting the hypothesis of a higher pitching stability in penguins. Furthermore, the angular fluctuation of U. lomvia was lower than that of C. monocerata at deeper depths, suggesting higher pitching stability and more efficient underwater locomotion in U. lomvia. Conclusions: This study demonstrated a difference in the pitching stability, which is an important component of underwater locomotory efficiency, of a penguin and two alcid species while diving freely in natural conditions. In situ angular fluctuation data obtained by gyroscope would be useful to understand the locomotory strategy of swimming animals. © 2016 Noda et al.

ABSTRACT: Quantitative methods are needed to evaluate the ecological effects of fishing forage species upon which predators depend. African penguin Spheniscus demersus numbers at the Robben Island colony rose during the 1990s co-incidental with a marked increase in sardine Sardinops sagax and anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus abundances, but decreased appreciably during the 2000s as sardine suffered a series of poor recruitments. A population dynamics model is developed which relates penguin adult annual mortality to local sardine biomass, and is fit to penguin moult counts and re-sightings of tagged penguins. The predator-prey interaction is best explained by a sardine-penguin mortality relationship with average penguin survival decreasing only when the local sardine biomass is less than approximately one-quarter of the maximum observed. Results suggest that the rapid growth of the colony during the 1990s was driven primarily by immigration. Penguin projections are generated by linking to future sardine abundances predicted under the operational management procedure used to set catch limits for these sardine and anchovy fisheries, and compared with equivalent scenarios without fishing. Results indicate that fishing is likely to have a relatively small impact on penguins, especially when compared with uncertainties that arise from the variable spatial distribution of the sardine population. © 2015 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

ABSTRACT: The African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) is an endangered seabird that resides on the temperate southern coast of Africa. Like all penguins it is flightless, instead using its specialized wings for underwater locomotion termed 'aquatic flight'. While musculature and locomotion of the large Antarctic penguins have been well studied, smaller penguins show different biochemical and behavioural adaptations to their habitats. We used histochemical and immunohistochemical methods to characterize fibre type composition of the African penguin primary flight muscles, the pectoralis and supracoracoideus. We hypothesized the pectoralis would contain predominantly fast oxidative-glycolytic (FOG) fibres, with mainly aerobic subtypes. As the supracoracoideus and pectoralis both power thrust, we further hypothesized these muscles would have a similar fibre type complement. Our results supported these hypotheses, also showing an unexpected slow fibre population in the deep parts of pectoralis and supracoracoideus. The latissimus dorsi was also examined as it may contribute to thrust generation during aquatic flight, and in other avian species typically contains definitive fibre types. Unique among birds studied to date, the African penguin anterior latissimus dorsi was found to consist mainly of fast fibres. This study shows the African penguin has specialized flight musculature distinct from other birds, including large Antarctic penguins. © 2015 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

ABSTRACT: This research aims to validate a novel, visual body scoring system created for the Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) suitable for the zoo practitioner. Magellanics go through marked seasonal fluctuations in body mass gains and losses. A standardized multi-variable visual body condition guide may provide a more sensitive and objective assessment tool compared to the previously used single variable method. Accurate body condition scores paired with seasonal weight variation measurements give veterinary and keeper staff a clearer understanding of an individual's nutritional status. San Francisco Zoo staff previously used a nine-point body condition scale based on the classic bird standard of a single point of keel palpation with the bird restrained in hand, with no standard measure of reference assigned to each scoring category. We created a novel, visual body condition scoring system that does not require restraint to assesses subcutaneous fat and muscle at seven body landmarks using illustrations and descriptive terms. The scores range from one, the least robust or under-conditioned, to five, the most robust, or over-conditioned. The ratio of body weight to wing length was used as a "gold standard" index of body condition and compared to both the novel multi-variable and previously used single-variable body condition scores. The novel multi-variable scale showed improved agreement with weight:wing ratio compared to the single-variable scale, demonstrating greater accuracy, and reliability when a trained assessor uses the multi-variable body condition scoring system. Zoo staff may use this tool to manage both the colony and the individual to assist in seasonally appropriate Magellanic penguin nutrition assessment. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Background: Investigation of early transmission failure from animal-borne, satellite transmitters should reveal vital information about the reliability of the technology, and the risk of application to the animal. Current technology available to the investigator does not provide firm evidence for causes of transmitter blackout. Findings: We address the five most likely causes of satellite transmitter failure on 20 adult (10 male and 10 female) emperor penguins tagged near Cape Colbeck, Antarctica, and one near the Drygalski Ice Tongue, Western Ross Sea, during late summer, 2013. They are: 1. Technical failure of the transmitter, 2. Instrument breakage, 3. Instrument loss because of attachment failure, 4. Predation, and 5. Icing of the salt water detection switch. The longest record of 323 days suggests that prior losses were not due to power failure. Conclusions: Various possibilities of transmission blackout are discussed, and we speculate about the most likely causes of termination of transmissions. A loss of transmission from six tags at similar locations early in the deployments suggests predation. Later losses at random times and locations may be because of antenna breakage or attachment failure. Definite conclusions cannot be made because of the indirect assessment of transmission loss. We suggest some changes in deployment procedures to improve our ability to determine cause of satellite transmission termination in the future. Understanding causes of blackout is important both scientifically and ethically in terms of accurate data interpretation and balancing the benefits of scientific gain with the costs of animal disturbance. © 2015 Kooyman et al.

ABSTRACT: Aspergillosis is a common respiratory fungal disease in penguins managed under human care. Triazole antifungal drugs, including itraconazole, are most commonly used for treatment; however, itraconazole treatment failures from drug resistance are becoming more common, requiring newer treatment options. Voriconazole, a newer triazole, is being used more often. Until recently, no voriconazole pharmacokinetic studies had been performed in penguins, leading to empiric dosing based on other avian studies. This has led to increased anecdotal reporting of apparent voriconazole toxicity in penguins. This report describes 18 probable and 6 suspected cases of voriconazole toxicity in six penguin species from nine institutions: 12 African penguins (Spheniscus demersus), 5 Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti), 3 Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus), 2 gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua papua), 1 macaroni penguin (Eudyptes chrysolophus), and 1 emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri). Observed clinical signs of toxicity included anorexia, lethargy, weakness, ataxia, paresis, apparent vision changes, seizure-like activity, and generalized seizures. Similar signs of toxicity have also been reported in humans, in whom voriconazole therapeutic plasma concentration for Aspergillus spp. infections is 2-6 μg/ml. Plasma voriconazole concentrations were measured in 18 samples from penguins showing clinical signs suggestive of voriconazole toxicity. The concentrations ranged from 8.12 to 64.17 μg/ml, with penguins having plasma concentrations above 30 μg/ml exhibiting moderate to severe neurologic signs, including ataxia, paresis, and seizures. These concentrations were well above those known to result in central nervous system toxicity, including encephalopathy, in humans. This case series highlights the importance of species-specific dosing of voriconazole in penguins and plasma therapeutic drug monitoring. Further investigation, including pharmacokinetic studies, is warranted. The authors recommend caution in determining voriconazole dosages for use in penguin species. © Copyright 2015 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Persistent organic pollutants (POPs), including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), are frequently detected in biota from Antarctica, whereas no data are available for their replacements, such as novel flame retardants (N-FRs). This study presented the occurrence of several N-FRs, PBDEs, and PCBs in tissue samples of an Antarctic rock cod (Trematomus bernacchii), a young gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua), and a brown skua (Stercorarius antarcticus) collected from King George Island. The total concentrations of N-FRs (σN-FRs; mean: 931pg/g dry weight (dw)) were comparable to PBDEs (σ8PBDEs; 681pg/gdw), which were much lower than PCBs (σDL-PCBs; 12,800pg/gdw). Overall, skua contained two to three orders of magnitude higher contamination than penguin and fish. In the future, more attention should be focused on the fate of N-FRs in Antarctica, where usages have increased since PBDEs were banned. To our knowledge, this is the first report of N-FRs in biota from Antarctica. © 2015.

ABSTRACT: Plotopterids are penguin-like, wing-propelled birds with controversial phylogenetic affinities. They are usually regarded as closely related to Suloidea (gannets, cormorants, and allies), with the penguin-like features considered to be of convergent origin. However, it has also been proposed that the similarities shared by plotopterids and penguins are due to common ancestry. An in-depth assessment of plotopterid affinities has been hampered by the fact that very little data about the skull of these birds were available. New fossils of Tonsala from the Oligocene Pysht Formation in Washington State (U.S.A.) include the first well-preserved cranial remains of this taxon. They show that although plotopterids share derived cranial features with members of Suloidea that are absent in species of Sphenisciformes (penguins), they lack diagnostic derived features of the representatives of crown group Suloidea. To assess the affinities of plotopterids, we performed a phylogenetic analysis that included, for the first time, early stem group representatives of Sphenisciformes, resulting in a sister-group relationship between Plotopteridae and Suloidea. Intriguingly, however, our reanalysis of the emended data of a more comprehensive recent analysis that supported a position of Plotopteridae within Suloidea recovered a sister-group relationship between Plotopteridae and Sphenisciformes. Although cranial morphology challenges the hypothesis of close affinities between plotopterids and penguins, more data on early stem lineage representatives of penguins are needed for a robust placement of Plotopteridae relative to Sphenisciformes.

ABSTRACT: The relationship between population structure and demographic history is critical to understanding microevolution and for predicting the resilience of species to environmental change. Using mitochondrial DNA from extant colonies and radiocarbon-dated subfossils, we present the first microevolutionary analysis of emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) and show their population trends throughout the last glacial maximum (LGM, 19.5-16 kya) and during the subsequent period of warming and sea ice retreat. We found evidence for three mitochondrial clades within emperor penguins, suggesting that they were isolated within three glacial refugia during the LGM. One of these clades has remained largely isolated within the Ross Sea, while the two other clades have intermixed around the coast of Antarctica from Adélie Land to the Weddell Sea. The differentiation of the Ross Sea population has been preserved despite rapid population growth and opportunities for migration. Low effective population sizes during the LGM, followed by a rapid expansion around the beginning of the Holocene, suggest that an optimum set of sea ice conditions exist for emperor penguins, corresponding to available foraging area. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The use of DNA barcodes (haplotypic variation in a 648 bp segment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I [COI] gene within the mitochondrial genome, starting from base 58 at the 5′ end of the gene) as part of a species description is an accepted part of modern taxonomy. The evidence COI provides is compelling since a sequence of DNA is biological data obtained from living material. Early in the use of COI, it became apparent that it might highlight potential cryptic species and inform the debate around their status. The litle penguin (Eudyptula minor) has been the subject of such debate. DNA barcodes from 53 litle penguins were assessed to determine the specific status of this species across its range. Analysis of these data indicates distinct Australian and New Zealand haplotypes that may be indicative of separation at the species level. The specific status for the 2 populations is also supported by behavioural evidence and geographic isolation. © The Ornithological Society of New Zealand Inc.

ABSTRACT: Phenotypic plasticity and phenotypic stability are major components of the adaptive evolution of organisms to environmental variation. The invariant two-egg clutch size of Eudyptes penguins has recently been proposed to be a unique example of a maladaptive phenotypic stability, while their egg mass is a plastic trait. We tested whether this phenotypic plasticity during reproduction might result from constraints imposed by migration (migratory carry-over effect) and breeding (due to the depletion of female body reserves). For the first time, we examined whether these constraints differ between eggs within clutches and between egg components (yolk and albumen). The interval between colony return and clutch initiation positively influenced the yolk mass, the albumen mass, and the subsequent total egg mass of first-laid eggs. This time interval had only a slight negative influence on the yolk mass of second-laid eggs and no influence on their albumen and subsequent total masses. For both eggs, female body mass at laying positively influenced albumen and total egg masses. Female investment into the entire clutch was not related to the time in the colony before laying but increased with female body mass. These novel results suggest that the unique intraclutch egg size dimorphism exhibited in Eudyptes penguins, with first-laid eggs being consistently smaller than second-laid eggs, might be due to a combination of constraints: a migratory carry-over effect on the first-laid egg and a body reserve depletion effect on the second-laid egg. Both these constraints might explain why the timing of reproduction, especially egg formation, is narrow in migratory capital breeders. We examined whether the conflict between migration and reproduction acts on the different egg components (especially yolk and albumen). We showed that the puzzling intra-clutch egg size dimorphism observed in crested penguins is due to a combination of negative constraints on egg production: a migratory carry-over effect on the first-laid egg and a reserve depletion effect on the second-laid egg. © 2015 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Global change has affected the Antarctic Peninsula influencing the abundance of krill, one of the main preys of penguins. In areas where breeding penguin populations overlap, species with a more diverse diet have generally been less affected than krill-specialist species, which have shown population declines. Human activities can add to these changes, as penguins are sensitive to anthropic impacts such as contamination. Our objective was to assess whether selected physiological parameters of Adélie and Gentoo penguins reflect their contrasting population trends in a colony located at Punta Stranger (25 de Mayo Island/King George, South Shetland Islands) where they breed sympatrically. During 2012, we assessed the leukocyte profile, heterophil to lymphocyte ratio (H/L), erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENAs), hematocrit, biochemical profile, and a measure of immune function (bacterial agglutination) in adults and chicks of both species. Higher values of ENAs, indicative of genotoxic damage caused by contaminants, are in accordance with a greater sensitivity to ongoing global changes by Adélie penguins. Levels of cholesterol and triglycerides strengthen this idea since individuals could be investing more resources in energy reserves to successfully cope with challenging environmental conditions during the breeding season. The remaining physiological parameters did not provide a clear picture. Furthermore, some results could be related to differences in diet. Gentoos show greater prey diversity than Adélie penguins, incorporating a richer parasite fauna, which could explain their higher heterophils and H/L. The physiological parameters measured here serve as baseline for a sustained monitoring of these rapidly changing populations. Further physiological variables, including stress hormone and indices of oxidative stress, remain to be assessed as potential indicators of population susceptibility to global change in this system. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: A 19-yr-old female African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) presented with labored breathing and anorexia. Radiographs revealed soft-Tissue density lesions in the left lung fields and fluid in the right. The penguin died during the night. Postmortem examination demonstrated multiple granulomas in the lungs and air sacs. The right coelom was filled with opaque fluid. Histopathology of the lung, liver, kidney, and spleen identified Mycobacterium as a primary disease etiology. Large numbers of acid fast-positive, rod-shaped bacteria were recognized on tissue staining. Mycobacterium genavense was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers specific for the species. Further confirmation of M. genavense was accomplished using PCR with universal Mycobacterium spp. primers followed by sequencing of the amplicon obtained. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of mycobacteriosis-And specifically M. genavense-in an African penguin. This case also demonstrates the similarities of presentation between the more commonly suspected and encountered aspergillosis and mycobacteriosis. © Copyright 2015 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) are involved in transporting hydrophobic fatty acids between various aqueous compartments of the cell by directly binding ligands inside their β-barrel cavities. Here, we report the crystal structures of ligand-unbound pFABP4, linoleate-bound pFABP4, and palmitate-bound pFABP5, obtained from gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua), at a resolution of 2.1 Å, 2.2 Å, and 2.3 Å, respectively. The pFABP4 and pFABP5 proteins have a canonical β-barrel structure with two short α-helices that form a cap region and fatty acid ligand binding sites in the hydrophobic cavity within the β-barrel structure. Linoleate-bound pFABP4 and palmitate-bound pFABP5 possess different ligand-binding modes and a unique ligand-binding pocket due to several sequence dissimilarities (A76/L78, T30/M32, underlining indicates pFABP4 residues) between the two proteins. Structural comparison revealed significantly different conformational changes in the β3-β4 loop region (residues 57-62) as well as the flipped Phe60 residue of pFABP5 than that in pFABP4 (the corresponding residue is Phe58). A ligand-binding study using fluorophore displacement assays shows that pFABP4 has a relatively strong affinity for linoleate as compared to pFABP5. In contrast, pFABP5 exhibits higher affinity for palmitate than that for pFABP4. In conclusion, our high-resolution structures and ligand-binding studies provide useful insights into the ligand-binding preferences of pFABPs based on key protein-ligand interactions. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The theory of sexual selection explains sexual dimorphisms in ornaments used in mate choice. Mutual mate choice is a form of sexual selection that might explain sexually monomorphic ornamental traits. Under mutual mate choice, both sexes select partners based on the same ornament. We tested the mutual mate choice hypothesis in a mutually ornamented seabird, the king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus), through observations of the pair formation process in the field. Penguins that were ready to mate formed displaying pairs at the edge of the colony. Some of these pairs moved into the breeding colony and produced an egg (definitive pairs), while other pairs separated and often switched to another potential partner (temporary pairs). Colored ornaments were quantified using color vision modeling. We predicted that birds would mate assortatively by their elaborate ornamental traits (specifically, colors of beak spots, auricular patches of feathers, and breast patch of feathers). We also predicted that definitive pairs would exhibit more elaborate ornaments than temporary pairs. The mutual mate choice hypothesis was supported by assortative pairing for color of the beak spots, but not for color or size of the auricular patches or for the color of the breast patch. An alternative hypothesis was also consistent with our results, that female choice for a male ornamental trait and superior female condition associated with the same trait produced assortative pairing patterns. More UV- and yellow-colored beak spots for females in definitive than temporary pairs supported the female choice hypothesis over the mutual mate choice hypothesis, but previous experimental results from altered beak spot colors supported the latter. Evidence to date thus supports both the mutual mate choice and female choice hypotheses. © 2015 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

ABSTRACT: The microanatomical and histological structure of Eocene Antarctic stem penguin tarsometatarsi is examined in order to characterise the bone microstructure. Eight adult tarsometatarsi belonging to eight fossil species (Palaeeudyptes gunnari, Palaeeudyptes klekowskii, Anthropornis grandis, Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi, Archaeospheniscus wimani, Marambiornis exilis, Delphinornis arctowskii and Delphinornis larseni) collected from the Antarctic A. nordenskjoeldi Biozone (La Meseta Formation, ∼34.2 Ma) were examined. The thin sections revealed a distinctive microanatomical variation among taxa. Whereas Anthropornis spp., A. wimani and P. gunnari possess massive, clearly osteosclerotic bones (medullary cavities absent or strongly reduced), the bones of Delphinornis spp., P. klekowski and M. exilis exhibit well-developed medullary cavities. The cortical bone in all the specimens consists of primary, well-vascularised fibro-lamellar bone and variable amounts of secondary bone. Medullary cavities are coated by a thick layer of lamellar bone tissue and coarse compacted cancellous bone. Although several causes can explain the striking microanatomical variation (e.g. ontogeny), we interpret that such variation is related to differential adaptations to the aquatic life, for which taxa with more massive bones were possibly adapted to deeper and more prolonged diving excursions. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

ABSTRACT: Antarctic penguins survive some of the harshest conditions on the planet. Emperor penguins breed on the sea ice where temperatures drop below 2408C and forage in21.88Cwaters. Their ability to maintain 388C body temperature in these conditions is due in large part to their feathered coat. Penguins have been reported to have the highest contour feather density of any bird, and both filoplumes and plumules (downy feathers) are reported absent in penguins. In studies modelling the heat transfer properties and the potential biomimetic applications of penguin plumage design, the insulative properties of penguin plumage have been attributed to the single afterfeather attached to contour feathers. This attribution of the afterfeather as the sole insulation component has been repeated in subsequent studies. Our results demonstrate the presence of both plumules and filoplumes in the penguin body plumage. The downy plumules are four times denser than afterfeathers and play a key, previously overlooked role in penguin survival. Our study also does not support the report that emperor penguins have the highest contour feather density. © 2015, The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat-2) to be launched in October 2017, will measure the height of Earth from space using lasers, collecting the most precise and detailed account yet of our planet's elevation. The mission will allow scientists to investigate how global warming is changing the planet's icy polar regions and to take stock of Earth's vegetation. ICESat-2's emphasis on polar ice, as well as its unique measurement approach, will provide an intriguing and accessible focus for the mission's education and outreach programs. Sea ice and land ice are areas that have experienced significant change in recent years. It is key to communicate why we are measuring these areas and their importance. ICESat-2 science data will provide much-needed answers to climate change questions such as, "Is the ice really melting in the polar regions?" and "What does studying Earth's frozen regions tell us about our changing climate?" Lessons-learned and novel techniques for engaging and educating all audiences in the mission will be discussed such as results of a unique collaboration with art design school the Savannah College of Art Design (SCAD) to create fun and exciting products such as animated characters, emojis, and interactive stories. Collaborations with wildlife researchers, a new citizen science program in collaboration with GLOBE, and evidence from other STEAM education approaches will also be detailed in this paper.

ABSTRACT: Pollutants and toxic contaminants produced in all parts of the world are transported to remote regions including Antarctica. Tourism, research, and fishing activities on this continent are another source of contamination. Toxic substances affect Antarctic species, and some produced genomic damage to the fauna. The genetic damage can be detected by microscopic observation of erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENAs). We counted the number of ENAs in seven populations of three Pygoscelid penguin species, Adélie (Pygoscelis adeliae), Chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarctica), and Gentoo (Pygoscelis papua), and found important differences among species exposed to the same conditions. ENAs were more frequent in Adélie penguins than in the other two species. Inter-population comparisons within species showed remarkable differences in Adélie and Chinstrap penguins but not in Gentoo penguin. Frequency of ENAs in Adélie penguins was the highest in Yalour Island population, intermediate in King George Island population, and the lowest in Torgersen Island and Avian Island populations. In Chinstrap penguins, the highest number of ENAs was found on Deception Island, and significant differences were found only between Deception Island and King George Island populations. This information will provide baseline data to be used for assessing the evolution of genomic damage of penguins along the Antarctic Peninsula in the future. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Magellanic penguins have been reported as good biomonitors for several types of pollutants, including trace-elements. In this context, selenium (Se), total mercury, methylmercury, inorganic mercury (Hginorg), cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb), as well as metallothionein (MT) levels, were evaluated in the feathers, liver and kidney of juvenile Magellanic penguins found stranded along the coast of Southern Brazil. The highest concentrations of all trace-elements and methylmercury were found in internal organs. Concentrations of Cd and Se in feathers were extremely low in comparison with their concentrations in soft tissues. The results showed that both Se and MT are involved in the detoxification of trace-elements (Cd, Pb and Hginorg) since statistically significant relationships were found in liver. Conversely, hepatic Se was shown to be the only detoxifying agent for methylmercury. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Group members' individual experience can have important influences when navigating collectively. However, how exactly they structure group travel performance is still not fully understood. This study investigated how navigation and leadership dynamics are affected by the presence of an experienced individual in king penguin, Aptenodytes patagonicus, chick pairs. We tested pairs of chicks in which two partners differed in their level of prior navigational experience. Naïve pairs consisted of two chicks that had no previous homing experience. In mixed pairs, one chick was naïve, but the other chick had previous homing experience. Our results showed that in mixed pairs the navigational performance of naïve chicks improved if they travelled together with an experienced partner compared to when they walked alone. Experienced chicks, however, maintained their relatively high speeds and efficiencies irrespective of whether they walked with a partner or independently. We also observed a shift in leadership dynamics: in naïve pairs, both chicks took turns in leading and following, while in mixed pairs, experienced chicks tended to lead throughout. Our work provides a valuable empirical system in which to test theoretical models of leadership and information transfer within groups. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: Avian malaria is a disease caused by species of the genera Haemoproteus, Leucocytozoon, and Plasmodium. It affects hundreds of bird species, causing varied clinical signs depending on the susceptibility of the host species. Although high mortality has been reported in captive penguins, limited epidemiological studies have been conducted in wild colonies, and isolated records of avian malaria have been reported mostly from individuals referred to rehabilitation centers. For this epidemiological study, we obtained blood samples from 501 adult Humboldt and 360 adult Magellanic penguins from 13 colonies throughout South America. To identify malaria parasitaemia, we amplified the mtDNA cytochrome b for all three parasite genera. Avian malaria was absent in most of the analyzed colonies, with exception of the Punta San Juan Humboldt penguin colony, in Peru, where we detected at least two new Haemoproteus lineages in three positive samples, resulting in a prevalence of 0.6% for the species. The low prevalence of avian malaria detected in wild penguins could be due to two possible causes: A low incidence, with high morbidity and mortality in wild penguins or alternatively, penguins sampled in the chronic stage of the disease (during which parasitaemia in peripheral blood samples is unlikely) would be detected as false negatives. © 2014, International Association for Ecology and Health.

ABSTRACT: Background and Objective: The aim of the study was to investigate the acute effects of whole body vibration on the cutaneous temperature of the plantar surface of the feet in healthy penguins and in penguins with bumblefoots by using infrared thermography. Materials and Methods: Twelve captive adult magellanic penguins were divided into two groups: Group 1 seven healthy penguins (14 feet) and group 2-5 penguins with bumblefoot (6 feet). Three sessions of vibrating platform were carried out at the frequency of 20 Hz. Each session lasted 5 min totalizing 15 min. Infrared thermography was performed before (time 0) and at 5, 10 and 15 min after the whole body vibration session. Results: The increased thermal measurements in group 1 were observed at 5 min after vibration in metatarsal footpads and at 10 min in tarsus metatarsus areas. The metatarsal food pads of penguins with bumblefoot showed higher thermographic temperature in comparison to the metatarsal footpads of the healthy penguins. The right tarsus metatarsal areas in group 2 showed increased thermal measurements at 15 min from the baseline, but no statistical difference occurred in the right metatarsal foot pads. Conclusion: The acute use of whole body vibration in healthy penguins increased the cutaneous temperature of the plantar surface of the feet, but it was not observed in the metatarsal footpad of penguins with bumblefoot class II. © 2016 Ivan Felismino Charas dos Santos et al.

ABSTRACT: This study evaluates a modern natural deposit of Magellanic penguin remains in the coast of the Pampas region, and discusses the regional availability of this resource for prehistoric hunter-gatherer populations, as well as the potential for the natural incorporation of this species into the archaeological record. The penguin assemblage from the surveyed area, which results from beaching during seasonal migration, consists of disarticulated bones, articulated bones, and carcasses. In the skeletal representation, there is a strong predominance of limbs and shoulder girdle elements. Natural processes such as weathering, sedimentary abrasion, and predator action highly affected the preservation of specimens. Even though penguins could have been a potential prey for hunter-gatherer populations of the Pampas region, our results suggest that they were not an attractive food resource given their scarcity and poor nutritional condition. The spatial distribution of modern penguin remains and the archaeological evidence suggest that the natural incorporation of bones from this seabird into surface archaeological sites can be expected in the backshore and deflated interdunes. However, the chances of long term burial and bone preservation are low; thus, the formation of a stratigraphic archaeological site containing intrusive penguin remains in these settings is unlikely. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Long-term monitoring of seabird numbers around Antarctica has revealed that the chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica) is largely declining throughout its range in the Scotia Arc. Whether archipelagos across this large area remain connected via dispersal or represent genetically isolated groups has not yet been established. The purpose of this study was to assess the level of genetic differentiation between four breeding colonies on the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), South Shetland, South Orkney, and South Sandwich Islands using microsatellite-based analysis of population structure. All colonies had similar levels of genetic diversity (mean heterozygosity, HO = 0.583) but colonies from the WAP and South Orkney Island had significant inbreeding coefficients. Hierarchical and pairwise F-statistics revealed very limited population structure in the Scotia Arc, with weak differentiation between colonies from the WAP, South Shetland and South Orkney Islands relative to the South Sandwich Islands, which are situated at least 1000 km apart from these other archipelagos. Bayesian model-based clustering methods found no evidence of significant population structuring, suggesting that whilst some isolation by distance may occur, there are no strong barriers to dispersal across this wide geographic range. No evidence of sex-biased dispersal was detected. We conclude that chinstrap penguin colonies across the Scotia Arc represent one interconnected breeding population. High levels of gene flow may be important in maintaining smaller, less stable colonies, and this status should be preserved by creating dispersal corridors throughout the Scotia Arc. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Seabirds are often proposed as useful indicators of marine ecosystems because of their typically tight response to varying levels of prey abundance. We demonstrate here how this relationship can be modified for Southern Ocean higher-order predators when prey accessibility changes as a consequence of the temporally varying sea-ice environment. We examined within- and between-year fluctuations in breeding success, foraging trip duration, meal mass and fledgling weights of Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) at Béchervaise Island (67°35′S, 62°49′E) in east Antarctica to determine the degree of concordance between parameters over a 12-year period and how these varied in relation to sea-ice conditions. The penguins responded to extensive sea-ice (predominantly fast-ice) adjacent to their breeding colony by lengthening their foraging trips, and these years typically had reduced breeding success. Some years indicated good conditions for the penguins across parameters and had relatively high breeding success with heavier fledglings, while others indicated difficult conditions with poorer breeding success and lighter fledglings. In other years, there was discordance in the patterns of breeding success, fledgling mass and early versus late stage foraging trip durations, suggestive of different thresholds for different parameters or within-year changes in resource availability. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for the temporal variability in prey availability as a function of both accessibility and abundance when interpreting predator response curves. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Mercury emissions have increased over the past decades affecting even remote areas such as Antarctica. As gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) breed on many of the islands surrounding Antarctica, foraging close to their colonies, their mercury load should reflect concentrations in the region. We therefore evaluated mercury concentrations in adult gentoo penguin feathers at Bird Island, South Georgia. We found no significant differences in mercury levels between 2009 and 2010 (mean ± SD 0.97 ± 0.67 mg kg−1, mean ± SD 1.13 ± 0.62 mg kg−1, respectively). Stable nitrogen isotope values in feathers indicated that feeding habits had a stronger influence on male mercury concentrations, whereas stable carbon isotope values indicated that foraging habitat had a stronger influence on females. Though no temporal variation in levels of mercury in gentoo penguin feathers was observed, spatial differences were evident when compared with previous studies. Our results could have implications for other animals higher in the food web that prey upon gentoo penguins, with potential consequential effects on their reproduction and development. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Penguins have a more than 60 million year long evolutionary history. Thus, stem lineage fossil taxa are key to understanding their evolution. Here, we present data on three virtual endocasts from stem penguin skulls collected from the Eocene La Meseta Formation of Seymour Island (Antarctica), along with comparative data from extant penguins and outgroups. These fossils appear to belong to three distinct species, and represent both the oldest (34.2 Ma) and the most basal penguin taxa that have yielded endocast data. Data collected from the fossils provide new support for several important shifts in neuroanatomy and cranial skeletal anatomy along the transition from stem to crown penguins, including (1) caudal expansion of the eminentia sagittalis, (2) an increase in the overlap of the telencephalon onto the cerebellum, (3) reduction of the bulbus olfactorius, and (4) loss of the interaural pathway. The large semicircular canal diameters of the Antarctic fossils as well as the more crownward stem penguin Paraptenodytes antarcticus together suggest that canal size increased in basal penguins relative to outgroup taxa but later decreased near the crown radiation. As in most other wing-propelled diving birds, the endocasts lack evidence of cerebellar folds and possess a relatively large floccular recess. Several aspects of the endocast morphology, including the exposure of the tectum opticum in dorsal view and the rostral displacement of the eminentia sagittalis away from the border of the cerebellum, are seen neither in crown penguins nor in Procellariiformes (the extant sister clade to Sphenisciformes) and so appear to represent unique characters of these stem taxa. © 2015 by the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology.

ABSTRACT: Reproductive investment during the chick-rearing period is an important contributor to lifetime fitness. Key to chick-rearing is the success of parental foraging, as food deliveries affect chick growth and survival up until fledging. For seabirds, oceanographic conditions including factors such as sea surface temperature are known to influence foraging decisions, but few studies have examined the physiological variables that might affect those decisions. We used global positioning systems (GPS), time-depth recorders (TDR), and physiological sampling techniques to explore links between ocean temperature, diving behavior, and foraging success in chick-rearing female macaroni penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus. We then explored correlations between these foraging variables and measures of individual physiological condition, specifically aerobic capacity (hematocrit) and metabolic state (corticosterone). In GPS-tracked penguins, 2 principal foraging tactics were observed: penguins made deep dives in cool, near-shore areas surrounding the breeding colony at Bird Island, South Georgia, or they traveled farther to dive shallower in warmer shelf-break areas. TDR-equipped penguins showed similar patterns. Blood sampling of TDR penguins at the onset of trips revealed strong positive correlations between hematocrit and the mean duration of foraging trips, the ocean temperature experienced during these trips, and the relative efficiency of foraging activity in terms of the number of foraging behaviors recorded per dive. These results suggest that aerobic capacity might be an important determinant of foraging trip range, as well as workload. Corticosterone was unrelated to diving behavior, which counters previous studies examining the effects of experimental increases of this hormone on foraging behavior, and we discuss reasons for this disparity. © Inter-Research 2015.

ABSTRACT: During the breeding season, seabirds are central place foragers and have to adapt their foraging behaviour in response to environmental variation to maximize efficiency and reproductive output. Due to its small size and swimming mode of transport, the little penguin (Eudyptula minor) is expected to be greatly susceptible to such fluctuations. The links between local-, meso- and macro-scale environmental conditions and inter-annual variation in foraging behaviour and reproductive performance of little penguins were investigated during three consecutive breeding seasons at two colonies in south-eastern Australia marked by contrasting oceanographic conditions. At a local scale, foraging effort was correlated positively with wind direction and negatively with wave height. At a regional scale, foraging effort of individuals from both colonies was negatively correlated with higher sea surface temperature (SST) off the Bonney Coast in the previous Austral summer, suggesting a weaker Bonney Upwelling event and a cascade of effects throughout the Bass Strait region. At a larger scale, the El Niño Southern Oscillation was also found to correlate with foraging behaviour, with lower foraging effort being observed during La Niña event. Although individuals increased their foraging effort during years with poorer conditions, they were not able to maintain high breeding success. In addition, peak egg-laying was found to coincide with a decrease in local SST and a peak of sea surface chlorophyll-a concentration. In conclusion, these results highlight how different environmental conditions could influence foraging behaviour and ultimately reproductive success of little penguins. It also showed that under certain circumstances, these individual strategies were not sufficient to cope with environmental variability. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.

ABSTRACT: Measurement of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGMs) has become a useful and widely-accepted method for the non-invasive evaluation of stress in vertebrates. In this study we assessed the adrenocortical activity of five captive African Penguins (Spheniscus demersus) by means of FGM evaluation following a biological stressor, i.e. capture and immobilization. In addition, we detected individual differences in secretion of FGMs during a stage of the normal biological cycle of penguins, namely the breeding period, without any external or induced causes of stress. Our results showed that FGM concentrations peaked 5.5-8. h after the induced stress in all birds, and significantly decreased within 30. h. As predictable, the highest peak of FGMs (6591. ng/g) was reached by the youngest penguin, which was at its first experience with the stressor. This peak was 1.8-2.7-fold higher compared to those of the other animals habituated to the stimulus. For the breeding period, our results revealed that the increase in FGMs compared to ordinary levels, and the peaks of FGMs, varied widely depending on the age and mainly on the reproductive state of the animal. The bird which showed the lowest peak (2518. ng/g) was an old male that was not in a reproductive state at the time of the study. Higher FGM increases and peaks were reached by the two birds which were brooding (male: 5552%, 96,631. ng/g; female: 1438%, 22,846. ng/g) and by the youngest bird (1582%, 39,700. ng/g). The impact of the reproductive state on FGM levels was unexpected compared to that produced by the induced stress. The EIA used in this study to measure FGM levels proved to be a reliable tool for assessing individual and biologically-relevant changes in FGM concentrations in African Penguin. Moreover, this method allowed detection of physiological stress during the breeding period, and identification of individual differences in relation to the reproductive status. The increase in FGM levels as a response to capture and immobilization suggests that the measured metabolites are appropriate indicators of adrenal activity in these birds. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Penguins both forage and travel in the marine environment and so spend a much greater proportion of their lives in this environment than other seabirds. This maximises their exposure to an increasing range of threats compared with other seabirds. From late 2003 to 2012, necropsies were performed on 159 Little Penguins found in the Perth region, Western Australia. Given the close proximity of the colonies to increasingly populated urban areas, the aims of this study were to: (1) determine the causes of mortality; (2) determine the proportion of deaths attributable to anthropogenic causes; (3) use this information to help guide management strategies; and (4) identify potential threats to coastal seabirds in general. In most cases, cause of mortality could be assigned to one of 11 categories. Trauma, most likely from watercraft, was the main cause of mortality. The next most common cause, starvation, was more likely to occur in spring and summer. Management strategies for colonies of Little Penguins near high levels of watercraft activity should take into account the risk of injury or death from watercraft strikes. © BirdLife Australia 2016.

ABSTRACT: The tarsometatarsus, a compound bone from the lower leg in birds, is the most important skeletal element in fossil penguin taxonomy, especially in the case of early members of this group. However, any attempt to go beyond the problem of mere classification obviously requires the better understanding of osteological traits under consideration. This in turn touches on the issue of interplay between bone and concomitant soft-tissue structures, such as muscles, tendons and vessels. This paper focuses on the more holistic comprehension of the tarsometatarsal section of the Eocene penguin foot, based on the analysis of the myology and the vascular system of its modern counterparts. A number of graphical reconstructions are provided with a discussion of the role of the hypotarsus and intermetatarsal foramina. © 2015 Polish Academy of Sciences.

ABSTRACT: Nonhuman animals in zoos are exposed to a continuous human presence, which affects their behaviors and welfare. However, little is known about what role the “visitor effect” has on penguins in captivity. The African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) is an endangered species commonly housed in zoos worldwide. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the abundance of human bathers could reduce the average time spent in the water of a colony of African penguins housed in an exhibit where their pond habitat was adjacent to a swimming pool. Observations were carried out on 7 penguins in the summer of 2009. Data were collected during 3 time periods (Time 1 [T1] = opening of the swimming season, Time 2 [T2] = core of the season, Time 3 [T3] = late season) of 14 days each. The human disturbance caused by bathers strongly reduced the pond use by penguins at T1 and T2, especially when there were large numbers of visitors. However, at T3, we observed that the overall use of the pond by penguins increased, and the average duration of their diving was no longer dependent on the number of visitors. © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC, 2014.

ABSTRACT: Unlike penguins of the genera Spheniscus, Eudyptula and Megadyptes, which brood their eggs in holes underground or crevices between rocks and tree stumps, but also King- and Emperor penguins that balance their eggs on their feet, Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) lay their eggs into shallow nests in the open, formed by a ring of pebbles. Defaecation streaks around these nests radiate in no particular direction up to 50 cm away from the edge of the nest. It remains to be explained whether the penguins deliberately change the directions during venting, whether the direction of the wind is involved, or whether the faecal expulsion streaks are indicative of a territorial claim around the nest. The second unsolved problem deals with the shell thickness of the Adélie penguin egg, which if compared with that of the egg shells of other birds is considerably thicker. Rather than having only something to do with heat regulation or the prevention of physical damage, it is speculated that the thicker shell's purpose could be to avoid excessive water loss in the dry Antarctic air. The third insufficiently examined problem relates to the claim that some penguin species use UV-signals on their beaks and plumage for intra-specific communication. This view is challenged on the basis of a lack of electrophysiological data and the fact that at the beginning of the mating season UVradiation is very low and other signals (vocalizations, smell, movements) are likely to convey messages more clearly. The fourth and last problem needing to be examined in more detail relates to the fact that penguins running instead of hopping or tobogganing on an icy surface rarely slip. The underside of their feet contains very small knoblike protuberances that could be involved in reducing slippage and warrant further attention. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Persistent organic pollutants were assessed in fat samples of the Gentoo (Pygoscelis papua), Chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarcticus) and Adélie (Pygoscelis adeliae) penguins collected during the austral summers of 2005/06 and 2006/07 in Admiralty Bay, King George Island, Antarctica. The predominant organic pollutants were PCB (114 to 1115), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (60.1 to 238.7), HCB (<0.3 to 132.2) and BDE-47 (<1.0 to 10.7) in ng g-1 wet weight. The mean concentrations of the majority of organic pollutants were similar among the three species of penguins. Chicks of all three species showed similar profiles of PCB congeners, with predominance of lower chlorinated compounds. The distribution of PAHs was similar in all birds, with a predominance of naphthalene and alkyl-naphthalene, which are the main constituents of arctic diesel fuel. These data contribute to the monitoring of the continued exposure to organic pollutants in the Antarctic biota. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Antibiotic-resistant bacteria can be detected in pristine environments and animals. Tetracycline (TC) is frequently used for wide areas of veterinary medicine, which selects TC-resistant bacteria. The TC resistance genes are known from natural environments, and tet(M) is the broadest host range tet gene. Here, we report that TC-resistant bacteria and the TC resistance gene tet(M) were diverse in Adélie penguin intestines, even within a single penguin colony. Total bacterial counts were as high as 107 CFU g−1, and TC-resistant bacteria ranged from 1.4 × 102 to 6.6 × 103 CFU g−1 intestinal contents, which was 0–0.54 % of the total viable count. Phylogenetic affiliation of TC-resistant bacteria revealed a variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The tet(M) gene was identified in 32.3 % of TC-resistant strains, and two tet(M) genotypes were identified within one penguin colony, suggesting various contamination origins of tet(M). © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Background: Animal movement exhibits self-similarity across a range of both spatial and temporal scales reminiscent of statistical fractals. Stressors are known to induce changes in these statistical patterns of behavior, although the direction and interpretation of such changes are not always clear. We examined whether the imposition of known hydrodynamic disruptors, bio-logging devices and flipper bands, induces changes in the temporal organization (complexity) of foraging sequences in two penguin species, little penguins (Eudyptula minor) and Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae). Results: Detrended fluctuation analysis showed that foraging sequences produced by little penguins carrying larger loggers were more complex, i.e., were more erratic tending toward greater stochasticity, than those carrying smaller loggers. However, logger size did not affect complexity in foraging sequences of Adélie penguins. Logger position was associated only weakly with altered complexity in little penguins, with individuals carrying loggers in the middle of their backs displaying slightly more complex dive sequences than those carrying loggers lower on their backs. Finally, despite their known negative effects on penguin fitness, flipper bands were not associated with dive sequence complexity in little penguins. Conclusions: Despite that externally attached devices can disrupt certain behavioral parameters in diving seabirds, we found mixed evidence in support of the hypothesis that such devices significantly disrupt the time-structured organizational properties of foraging sequences in the two penguin species investigated. However, smaller species carrying larger loggers, and perhaps those positioned higher on their backs, may experience an added element of noise in their behavioral sequences that may indicate a departure from foraging behavior observed under normal, unburdened conditions. © 2015 Meyer et al.

ABSTRACT: The logistical challenges of Antarctic field work and the increasing availability of very high resolution commercial imagery have driven an interest in more efficient search and classification of remotely sensed imagery. This exploratory study employed geographic object-based analysis (GEOBIA) methods to classify guano stains, indicative of chinstrap and Adélie penguin breeding areas, from very high spatial resolution (VHSR) satellite imagery and closely examined the transferability of knowledge-based GEOBIA rules across different study sites focusing on the same semantic class. We systematically gauged the segmentation quality, classification accuracy, and the reproducibility of fuzzy rules. A master ruleset was developed based on one study site and it was re-tasked "without adaptation" and "with adaptation" on candidate image scenes comprising guano stains. Our results suggest that object-based methods incorporating the spectral, textural, spatial, and contextual characteristics of guano are capable of successfully detecting guano stains. Reapplication of the master ruleset on candidate scenes without modifications produced inferior classification results, while adapted rules produced comparable or superior results compared to the reference image. This work provides a road map to an operational "image-to-assessment pipeline" that will enable Antarctic wildlife researchers to seamlessly integrate VHSR imagery into on-demand penguin population census. © 2016 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Humboldt Penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) are globally Vulnerable due to the decline of the population and to a decline in the number of breeding sites in comparison to historical records. In 2010, we observed a few thousand Humboldt Penguins nesting in a surface-nest colony on Isla Santa Rosa in southern Perú. This number was unexpected because this site has never been listed as an important Humboldt Penguin breeding ground. We visited this island again in June 2011 and 2012, and counted 1,965 and 1,745 active nests, respectively. These numbers indicate not only the presence of at least 3,500-4,000 Humboldt Penguins, but places Isla Santa Rosa among the five largest Humboldt Penguin colonies within its entire range. The need for recognition of Isla Santa Rosa as a major Humboldt Penguin refuge is crucial for the conservation of the species, as the island has remained untouched from guano harvesting since 1996. This has resulted in a significant accumulation of guano likely to be legally collected in the next few years. Unsupervised guano harvesting could cause a Humboldt Penguin exodus and jeopardize the existence of this colony. Under this scenario, it is recommended that Isla Santa Rosa be closed to guano harvesting until a surveillance program to protect the Humboldt Penguins can be established and proven to work under the conditions found on Isla Santa Rosa. © 2015, The Waterbird Society.

ABSTRACT: We investigated the variation in male advertising calls of two subspecies of little penguins (Eudyptula minor minor and Eudyptula minor iredalei), which live in two different regions within New Zealand. We found that the call frequency in both exhalation and inhalation phrases in male advertising calls differed between the two subspecies. Further, we conducted a reciprocal playback experiment to examine how females at the two geographical locations respond to the local and non-local male calls. Females tended to approach towards their regional calls, indicating that females recognize and might prefer their local male calls. Interestingly, E. minor iredalei females responded vocally to their local calls and took a longer time when approaching, while E. minor minor females did not use any vocalization during the approach and selected their local calls within a shorter time. However, given our limited sample size, we cannot exclude the possibility that these observed differences might be due to individual differences. Thus, further research is required to evaluate whether male mating signals and female responses to the male calls have diverged between the two subspecies. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg and ISPA.

ABSTRACT: In birds, the adaptive significance of hatching asynchrony has been under debate for many years and the parental effects on hatching asynchrony have been largely assumed but not often tested. Some authors suggest that hatching asynchrony depends on the incubation onset and many factors have been shown to influence hatching asynchrony in different species. Our objective was to analyze the exact timing of the onset of incubation and if this affects hatching asynchrony; and, in addition, which other factors (brood patch development, incubation position, adult body condition, intra-clutch egg dimorphism, laying date and year) affect hatching asynchrony in Magellanic penguins Spheniscus magellanicus. We first estimated the eggshell temperature at which embryo development starts, with a non-destructive and novel method. We then recorded individual egg temperatures in 61 nests during incubation, and related them, and other breeding parameters, to hatching asynchrony. We also observed incubation positions in 307 nests. We found a significant positive relationship between hatching asynchrony and the temperature that the first-laid egg experienced during egg laying and between hatching asynchrony and the initial brood patch area. We also found a negative relationship between hatching asynchrony and the difference in temperature between second and first-laid eggs within a clutch, measured after the egg-laying period was finished. We ruled out position of the eggs during incubation, adult body condition, egg volume, laying date, and study year as factors influencing hatching asynchrony. The egg temperature during laying and the difference in temperature between eggs of a clutch are determinants of hatching asynchrony in Magellanic penguins. © 2016 Nordic Society Oikos.

ABSTRACT: The Magellanic penguin Spheniscus magellanicus has recently colonized two new coastal sites (Islote Lobos and El Pedral), increasing the number of colonies in northern Patagonia, Argentina. Assuming foraging parameters during the breeding season to be valid short-term indicators of population health, we studied several foraging parameters of penguins from the two new established sites and from an older and well-established colony (Punta Norte) also localized in the north of Patagonia. Penguins from the recently formed colonies performed shorter foraging trips and visited waters closer to their colony than birds from Punta Norte, with penguins from Punta Norte spending almost twice the time at sea spent by penguins from El Pedral. Penguins from Punta Norte also spent more time underwater, spent a higher proportion of the complete diving cycle searching for prey, performed more wiggles (indicative of prey capture) and had fewer estimated prey captures per unit time underwater than penguins from Islote Lobos and El Pedral. This information suggests that, given no limitations on nest-site availability and no prevalence of predators, the good foraging conditions around El Pedral and Islote Lobos may be implicated in the increase in these two relatively new colonies. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015

ABSTRACT: Fight-or-flight stress responses allow animals to cope adaptively to sudden threats by mobilizing energy resources and priming the body for action. Because such responses can be costly and redirect behavior and energy from reproduction to survival, they are likely to be shaped by specific life-history stages, depending on the available energy resources and the commitment to reproduction. Here, we consider how heart rate (HR) responses to acute stressors are affected by the advancing breeding season in a colonial seabird, the king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus). We subjected 77 birds (44 males, 33 females) at various stages of incubation and chick-rearing to three experimental stressors (metal sound, distant approach and capture) known to vary both in their intensity and associated risk, and monitored their HR responses. Our results show that HR increase in response to acute stressors was progressively attenuated with the stage of breeding from incubation to chick-rearing. Stress responses did not vary according to nutritional status or seasonal timing (whether breeding was initiated early or late in the season), but were markedly lower during chick-rearing than during incubation. This pattern was obvious for all three stressors. We discuss how fight-or-flight responses may be modulated by considering the energy commitment to breeding, nutritional status and reproductive value of the brood in breeding seabirds. © 2015 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Eggshell blue-green colouration (BGC) is caused by the pigment biliverdin which has antioxidant capacities. Eggshell BGC has therefore been interpreted as being costly for the female and therefore a signal of female quality (‘sexual signalling hypothesis’). Southern rockhopper penguins Eudyptes chrysocome exhibit both a reversed hatching asynchrony and a brood reduction strategy. First-laid (A-)eggs are smaller and hatch on average 1 day after second-laid (B-)eggs, with B-eggs usually producing the only surviving chick. According to the sexual signalling hypothesis, we predicted a positive relationship between BGC and both female body mass and egg mass, and consequently within clutches a stronger BGC in B-eggs than A-eggs. Furthermore, we expected a negative relationship between BGC and clutch initiation date. Contrasting these expectations, we found no effect of female body mass or egg mass on BGC, and BGC in A-eggs increased with clutch initiation date, while there was no effect in B-eggs. Within clutches, A-eggshells were more intensely blue-green coloured than B-eggshells. Concluding, our results appear to contradict the sexual signalling hypothesis. We, however, did not measure pigment concentrations and solely relied on BGC from eggshell photospectrometry, assuming that biliverdin concentrations were positively correlated with BGC. We therefore caution that before precluding the sexual signalling hypothesis, future studies that include measurements of eggshell pigment concentrations in addition to BGC are necessary. Altogether, a better understanding of the biological meaning of biliverdin, its biochemical synthesis and antioxidative function in the avian body is urgently needed. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: The association of ticks (Acarina) and seabirds provides an intriguing system for assessing the influence of long-distance dispersal on the evolution of parasitic species. Recent research has focused on host-parasite evolutionary relationships and dispersal capacity of ticks parasitising flighted seabirds. Evolutionary research on the ticks of non-flighted seabirds is, in contrast, scarce. We conducted the first phylogeographic investigation of a hard tick species (Ixodes eudyptidis) that parasitises the Little Blue Penguin (Eudyptula minor). Using one nuclear (28S) and two mitochondrial (COI and 16S) markers, we assessed genetic diversity among several populations in Australia and a single population on the South Island of New Zealand. Our results reveal two deeply divergent lineages, possibly representing different species: one comprising all New Zealand samples and some from Australia, and the other representing all other samples from Australian sites. No significant population differentiation was observed among any Australian sites from within each major clade, even those separated by hundreds of kilometres of coastline. In contrast, the New Zealand population was significantly different to all samples from Australia. Our phylogenetic results suggest that the New Zealand and Australian populations are effectively isolated from each other; although rare long-distance dispersal events must occur, these are insufficient to maintain trans-Tasman gene flow. Despite the evidence for limited dispersal of penguin ticks between Australia and New Zealand, we found no evidence to suggest that ticks are unable to disperse shorter distances at sea with their hosts, with no pattern of population differentiation found among Australian sites. Our results suggest that terrestrial seabird parasites may be quite capable of short-distance movements, but only sporadic longer-distance (trans-oceanic) dispersal. © 2015 Moon et al.

ABSTRACT: The Galápagos is a flourishing yet fragile ecosystem whose health is particularly sensitive to regional and global climate variations. The distribution of several species, including the Galápagos Penguin, is intimately tied to upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich water along the western shores of the archipelago. Here we show, using reliable, high-resolution sea surface temperature observations, that the Galápagos cold pool has been intensifying and expanding northward since 1982. The linear cooling trend of 0.8°C/33 yr is likely the result of long-term changes in equatorial ocean circulation previously identified. Moreover, the northward expansion of the cold pool is dynamically consistent with a slackening of the cross-equatorial component of the regional trade winds - leading to an equatorward shift of the mean position of the Equatorial Undercurrent. The implied change in strength and distribution of upwelling has important implications for ongoing and future conservation measures in the Galápagos. ©2015. American Geophysical Union.

ABSTRACT: The concealed and widely dispersed nests of the rare and endangered Yellow-eyed Penguin Megadyptes antipodes, or hoiho, have been considered to reflect an essential requirement for the visual isolation of nest sites from conspecifics. However, this may be a consequence of selection for habitat features that provide protection from insolation, thereby minimising the risk of heat stress. To help improve the understanding of hoiho nesting requirements and the effectiveness of habitat restoration, we aimed to determine whether visual isolation from conspecifics or protection from insolation is the primary driver of hoiho nest site selection. We compared the mean maximum distance of visibility and the mean percentage insolation cover of active nests with randomly sampled unused sites in flax Phormium tenax and Hebe elliptica coastal scrub at Boulder Beach, and in coastal forest at Hinahina Cove, New Zealand, 2006-2007. Results of univariate tests and the evaluation of logistic regression models suggested that the amount of insolation cover was more important than visibility for hoiho nest site selection, particularly in flax and scrub. In addition, Spearman's correlations indicated that decreasing insolation cover significantly increased the visibility of nests in the forest habitat, and had a similar effect on inter-nest distance in flax. We infer that hoiho nest site selection and distribution are influenced primarily by the location and density of micro-habitat features (particularly within 1 m of the ground) that provide optimal protection from insolation, possibly along with other important features such as a firm backing structure. Strong selection for these features results in the typical but non-essential visual isolation of nest sites from conspecifics. Restoration of nesting habitats with a relatively high density and diversity of vegetation and solid structures within 1 m of the ground may eventually provide an optimal availability and quality of suitable nest sites. © 2014 BirdLife International.

ABSTRACT: Many marine birds dive to catch prey in water. The gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua), a specialized diving seabird that preys on krill and fish, is distributed from the sub-Antarctic islands to Antarctic regions. Here, we observed the diving behavior of breeding gentoo penguins on King George Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. Using a time–depth recorder, we collected diving depths every second from seven gentoo breeders for 5–21 days during the chick-rearing period and analyzed their diving characteristics. Most dives occurred in shallow water, although the dive efficiency (=bottom duration time/[dive duration + post-dive surface time]) was highest at depths of 30–35 m and decreased as the penguins dove deeper. Gentoo penguins did not dive more frequently during the day than at night, but during nighttime, most dives occurred in shallow water (<20 m) and the dive efficiency was also higher at this time. As penguins repeated their foraging trips, the number of dives, depth of dives, and trip duration did not change significantly. Our results suggest that the diel dive patterns of gentoo penguins might be related to the vertical migration of krill (upward to the surface at night). In addition, we observed that gentoo penguins could perform active diving behavior even at night, possibly aided by civil twilight during the chick-rearing period in Antarctic regions. © 2015 Korean Society for Integrative Biology.

ABSTRACT: Recent studies on olfaction in penguins have focused on their use of odours while foraging. It has been proposed for some seabirds that an olfactory landscape shaped by odours coming from feeding areas exists. Islands and colonies, however, may also contribute to the olfactory landscape and may act as an orienting map. To test sensitivities to a colony scent we studied whether King penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) could detect the smell of sand, feathers or feces by holding presentations beneath their beaks while they naturally slept on the beach. Penguins had a significantly greater response to the feathers and feces presentations than to sand. Although only a first step in exploring a broader role of olfaction in this species, our results raise the possibility of olfaction being used by King penguins in three potential ways: (1) locating the colony from the water or the shore, (2) finding the rendezvous zone within the colony where a chick or partner may be found, or (3) recognizing individuals by scent, as in Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus demersus). © 2015.

ABSTRACT: King penguins exhibit mutual color ornamentation of feathers and beak color. They breed in dense colonies and produce a single chick every 2 years. Thus, males and females must choose partners carefully to be reproductively successful, and auricular patches of males and UV coloration of beak spots have been shown to influence mate choice. Position in the breeding colony is also important to reproductive success, with pairs on the edge of the colony less successful than those in the center. We studied the mutual ornaments, individual condition, and position of pairs in their breeding colony. Males were significantly larger than females in size, body mass, and auricular patch size. Within pairs, auricular patch size of males and females were significantly correlated, and male auricular patch size and body mass were significantly associated, suggesting a link between this ornament and male body condition. Moving from the edge to the center of the colony, pairs had larger yellow-orange auricular patches, indicating a link between this ornament and settlement in higher quality territories in the center of the colony. Pairs were also less brightly brown colored on the breast and less saturated in UV color of the beak spot. Since we observed pairs that were settling for egg laying, location in the colony may have reflected aspects of pair condition, rather than later jockeying for positioning using ornaments as signals of behavioral dominance. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: On 27-28 February 2014, at the Balleny Islands in Antarctica, penguins on two islands were observed by close approach via zodiac craft, and counts of all pelagic bird species were made from a passing ship. Most penguins on Sabrina Island and Chinstrap Islet were Adelie Penguins Pygoscelis adeliae. Percentage of Chinstrap Penguins P. antarcticus to Adelie Penguins was 7.3 on Sabrina Island and 10.7 on Chinstrap Islet. Four species-Campbell Albatross Thalassarche impavida, White-headed Petrel Pterodroma lessonii, Mottled Petrel P. inexpectata, and King Penguin Aptenodytes patagonicus-were recorded for the Balleny Islands for the first time.

ABSTRACT: Identifying variation in survival probabilities is fundamental to understanding population dynamics. We quantified variation in survival of Little Penguins (Eudyptula minor) at Oamaru, New Zealand, over 19 years from 1993-2011. Specifically survival in relation to age and breeding status were investigated. We used a multi-state capture-mark-recapture model to examine survival and recapture probabilities of known age penguins flipper-banded as chicks, and breeding penguins of unknown age banded as adults. The survival probability of Little Penguins in their first year averaged 0.42 and was lower than all older ages. The mean annual survival probability of breeding adult penguins was 0.86. The observed proportion of fledglings that later recruited into the breeding population in the study colony mirrored first-year survival estimates from the model. Survival was lower for pre-breeding penguins than for breeding penguins of the same age. We detected no significant effect of age on survival for breeding penguins. The comprehensive, long-term monitoring program in place at Oamaru resulted in very high recapture rates of breeding penguins that generated accurate estimates of survival. © BirdLife Australia 2016.

ABSTRACT: Closely related species with similar ecological requirements should exhibit segregation along spatial, temporal, or trophic niche axes to limit the degree of competitive overlap. For migratory marine organisms like seabirds, assessing such overlap during the non-breeding period is difficult because of long-distance dispersal to potentially diffuse foraging habitats. Miniaturization of geolocation devices and advances in stable isotope analysis (SIA), however, provide a robust toolset to quantitatively track the movements and foraging niches of wide ranging marine animals throughout much of their annual cycle. We used light-based geolocation tags and analyzed stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes from tail feathers to simultaneously characterize winter movements, habitat utilization, and overlap of spatial and isotopic niches of migratory chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarctica) and Adélie (P. adeliae) penguins during the austral winter of 2012. Chinstrap penguins exhibited a higher diversity of movements and occupied portions of the Southern Ocean from 138° Wto30° W within a narrow latitudinal band centered on 60° S. In contrast, all tracked Adélie penguins exhibited smaller-scale movements into the Weddell Sea and then generally along a counter-clockwise path as winter advanced. Inter-specific overlap during the non-breeding season was low except during the months immediately adjacent to the summer breeding season. Intra-specific overlap by chinstraps from adjacent breeding colonies was higher throughout the winter. Spatial segregation appears to be the primary mechanism to maintain inter-and intra-specific niche separation during the nonbreeding season for chinstrap and Adélie penguins. Despite low spatial overlap, however, the data do suggest that a narrow pelagic corridor in the southern Scotia Sea hosted both chinstrap and Adélie penguins for most months of the year. Shared occupancy and similar isotopic signatures of the penguins in that region suggests that the potential for inter-specific competition persists during the winter months. Finally, we note that SIA was able to discriminate eastward versus westward migrations in penguins, suggesting that SIA of tail feathers may provide useful information on population-level distribution patterns for future studies. © 2015 Hinke et al.

ABSTRACT: How individuals allocate resources to reproduction is a fundamental concept in animal life history theory. While it is crucial to quantify the relative allocation of somatic reserves to reproduction by avian females; variation at the individual and intra-clutch level has generally been neglected. We investigated nutrient allocation to eggs of little penguins (Eudyptula minor, Forster, 1781) using automated body-mass recording and natural δ13C and δ15N values for plasma and blood cells of incubating females, and down feathers of their chicks. Further, we evaluated the role of female age (a proxy for experience or senescence) and condition as drivers of individual strategies within this population. Little penguins increased their body masses during a short period prior the onset of reproduction, suggesting that they were accumulating resources to cope with reproductive requirements. Estimated endogenous contribution to eggs was relatively low (~20%), and female age was revealed as a major factor modulating individual variations in resource allocation strategies. Older females accumulated larger amounts of reserves before laying (up to 40% body mass increases) and relied more on endogenous resources (up to 45%) for clutch production than younger females. Our findings suggest that females were able to adjust their endogenous investment between their two chicks, with somatic reserve inputs to heavier siblings showing a bimodal distribution (mean±SD; 16.7±5.9% and 36.5±4.4%) that contrasted with the unimodal distribution observed for lighter siblings (17.8±8.7%). Here, we provide evidence pointing to age and age-related changes as major factors modulating individual decisions on the amount of somatic reserves allocated to eggs. We additionally identified two distinct allocation strategies at the intra-clutch level that may favour siblings with greater chances to fledge, revealing a novel clutch size reduction strategy in seabirds that produce two eggs of similar size but involving a differential nutrient investment in eggs. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Sexual coercion is the use of force to achieve mating, while reproductive interference encompasses many forms of interspecific interactions during mating. We describe three new occurrences of the sexual coercion of king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) by Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) on sub-Antarctic Marion Island. These recurrent observations follow a common pattern where the seal chases, captures and mounts the penguin, followed by copulation attempts. These observations are similar to a previously published observation from the same island, and we suggest that this may be an emergent behaviour. Two hypotheses directed at possible drivers for these coercive actions are examined: it may be learned behaviour associated with some sort of reward or it may be an extreme case of reproductive interference that can be explained by the ‘mate deprivation hypothesis’, resulting from the continued growth of the A. gazella population on the island. Reporting of similar occurrences from a range of species may allow more robust inference towards the ultimate drivers of the behaviour. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: This report presents a new case of mucormycosis encountered in penguin characterized by morphological variation of hyphae and presence of sporangia with numerous sporangiospores. A 4.5-year-old Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) died after exhibiting anorexia, poor nutritional condition and dyspnea. Multiple nodular lesions were observed in the thoracic and abdominal regions. Histopathologically, hyphae of various sizes were seen in the lungs, air sac and nodular lesions. Myriad sporangiospores and several sporangia were observed in/around the bronchi or parabronchi. The very narrow and short hyphae in the nodules were not consistent with the characteristics of Mucorales. However, for most hyphae, including those in the nodules, sporangiospores and sporangia, immunohistochemistry revealed Mucorales-positive reactions. In addition, these fungi were identified as Rhizomucor pusillus by gene analysis. © 2015 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: Abstract Monitoring trace metal and metalloid concentrations in marine animals is important for their conservation and could also reliably reflect pollution levels in their marine ecosystems. Concentrations vary across tissue types, with implications for reliable monitoring. We sampled blood and moulted feathers of the Little Penguin (Eudyptula minor) from three distinct colonies, which are subject to varying levels of anthropogenic impact. Non-essential trace metal and metalloid concentrations in Little Penguins were clearly linked to the level of industrialisation adjacent to the respective foraging zones. This trend was more distinct in blood than in moulted feathers, although we found a clear correlation between blood and feathers for mercury, lead and iron. This study represents the first reported examination of trace metals and metalloids in the blood of any penguin species and demonstrates that this high trophic feeder is an effective bioindicator of coastal pollution. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Rehabilitation is an important strategy for the conservation of the Endangered African penguin Spheniscus demersus, and disease has been raised as a concern in the management of the species, both in the wild and in rehabilitation centres. We report 8 cases of herpes - virus-like respiratory infection in African penguin chicks undergoing rehabilitation between 2010 and 2013 at a facility in Cape Town, South Africa. Infection was confirmed through the identification of viral inclusions in the tracheal epithelium and demonstration of particles consistent with herpesvirus by electron microscopy, whereas virus isolation in eggs, serology and PCR testing failed to detect the virus. Only penguin chicks were affected; they were in poor body condition, and in 2 cases infection occurred prior to admission to the rehabilitation centre. The role played by the herpesvirus-like infection in the overall respiratory disease syndrome is uncertain, due to identification of lesions in only a small proportion of the chicks as well as to the occurrence of other concurrent pathological processes. Further studies are advised to characterise the specific virus involved through the development of sensitive diagnostic methods and to clarify the epidemiology and significance of these infections in wild African penguins. © Inter-Research 2015.

ABSTRACT: Captive management of ex situ populations of endangered species is traditionally based on pedigree information derived from studbook data. However, molecular methods could provide a powerful set of complementary tools to verify studbook records and also contribute to improving the understanding of the genetic status of captive populations. Here, we compare the utility of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and microsatellites (MS) and two analytical methods for assigning parentage in ten families of captive African penguins held in South African facilities. We found that SNPs performed better than microsatellites under both analytical frameworks, but a combination of all markers was most informative. A subset of combined SNP (n = 14) and MS loci (n = 10) provided robust assessments of parentage. Captive or supportive breeding programs will play an important role in future African penguin conservation efforts as a source of individuals for reintroduction. Cooperation among these captive facilities is essential to facilitate this process and improve management. This study provided us with a useful set of SNP and MS markers for parentage and relatedness testing among these captive populations. Further assessment of the utility of these markers over multiple (>3) generations and the incorporation of a larger variety of relationships among individuals (e.g., half-siblings or cousins) is strongly suggested. © 2015 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Aim: To infer the potential for competition between an important Antarctic predator, the macaroni penguin, and the krill fishery by examining the spatial overlap in prey consumption and catches. Location: Scotia Sea and adjacent waters. Methods: The study focused on the winter period as this is the only time of the year when spatio-temporal overlaps between macaroni penguin foraging and the krill fishery can occur. We tracked adult macaroni penguins from a colony in South Georgia using global location sensors to determine winter distribution, and bioenergetics models to calculate the biomass of food consumed during the winter period. We combined these to produce a surface of the tonnes of krill consumed, which could be compared directly with the spatial distribution of the tonnes of krill caught by the fishery. Results: Adult macaroni penguins from South Georgia consumed 135,826 tonnes of krill (95% CIs: 83,446-188,140) during the winter, which is similar to the 98,431 tonnes caught by fisheries over the same period. However, macaroni penguins had a very wide pelagic distribution across the Scotia Sea, whereas the fishery was restricted to three small areas on shelf edges, such that their spatial overlap was negligible. The proportion of the estimated krill stock taken by macaroni penguins and the krill fishery was small at both the scale of the Scotia Sea and the local areas within which the fisheries operate. Main conclusions: Competition between macaroni penguins and the krill fishery is low under current management and far less than that among the various species of krill predators that occur in the Scotia Sea. Our method will allow quantification of changes in competition between macaroni penguins and krill fisheries should the latter expand in the future, and provides a framework for assessing predator-fishery competition in other systems.

ABSTRACT: The arrival of iceberg B09B in Commonwealth Bay, East Antarctica, and subsequent fast ice expansion has dramatically increased the distance Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) breeding at Cape Denison must travel in search of food. This has provided a natural experiment to investigate the impact of iceberg stranding events and sea ice expansion along the East Antarctic coast. As part of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition 2013-14, the Adélie penguin colony at Cape Denison was censused to compare to historic counts. Whilst some 5520 pairs still bred at Cape Denison there has been an order of magnitude decline in Adélie numbers in the area in comparison to the first counts a century ago and, critically, recent estimates based on satellite images and a census in 1997. In contrast, an Adélie population on the eastern fringe of Commonwealth Bay just 8 km from the fast ice edge was thriving, indicating the arrival of B09B and fast ice expansion was probably responsible for the observed recent population decline. In conclusion, the Cape Denison population could be extirpated within 20 years unless B09B relocates or the now perennial fast ice within the bay breaks out. Our results have important implications for wider East Antarctic if the current increasing sea ice trend continues. © Antarctic Science Ltd 2016.

ABSTRACT: In marine habitats, increasing ocean temperatures due to global climate change may distinctly reduce nutrient and consequently food availability for seabirds. Food availability is a known driver of body mass and reproductive investment in birds, but these traits may also depend on individual effects. Penguins show extreme intra-annual body mass variation and rely on accumulated body reserves for successful breeding. However, no study so far has tested individual consistency and phenotypic responses in body mass and reproductive investment in this taxon. Using a unique dataset on individually marked female and male southern rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome) across six years, we investigated 1) the individual consistency in body mass (measured at egg laying), body condition and reproductive investment across years, subsequently 2) identified the bestexplanatory temperature-related environmental variables for female and male body mass, and 3) tested the effect of female and male body mass on reproductive investment. Body mass, body condition and reproductive investment were all highly repeatable. As body condition should control for the structural size of the birds, the similarly high repeatability estimates for body mass and body condition suggested that the consistent between-individual body mass differences were independent of structural size. This supported the use of body mass for the subsequent analyses. Body mass was higher under colder environmental conditions (positive Southern Annular Mode), but the overall phenotypic response appeared limited. Reproductive investment increased with female but not male body mass. While environmental effects on body mass in our study period were rather small, one can expect that ongoing global climate change will lead to a deterioration of food availability and we might therefore in the long-term expect a phenotypical decline in body mass and reproductive investment. © 2015 Dehnhard et al.

ABSTRACT: Dynamic ornamental signals that vary over minutes, hours or weeks can yield continuous information on individual condition (e.g., energy reserves or immune status), and may therefore be under strong social and/or sexual selection. In vertebrates, the coloration of the integument is often viewed as a dynamic ornament, which in birds can be apparent in the beak. King penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) are monomorphic seabirds that possess conspicuous yellow–orange (YO) and ultraviolet (UV) beak spots that are used by both males and females in mate choice. We studied the dynamicity of beak spot sexual traits, and to what extent they reflected changes in individual condition in fasting king penguins and in penguins treated with an anti-parasitic drug. We also describe the maturation of this colorful ornament during the yearly catastrophic moult. On a time-scale of days to weeks, beak spot coloration changed in response to fasting and experimental changes in parasite load. Beak spot UV brightness decreased over a 10-day fast in breeding birds. For birds caught during courtship and held in captivity YO chroma decreased after a 24-day fast. Birds that were treated with an anti-parasitic solution showed an increase in UV coloration after parasite removal. Altogether, our results show that beak spot coloration is a dynamic ornament that reflects multiple dimensions of changes in individual condition in breeding-fasting penguins. © 2016 Oxford University Press.

ABSTRACT: Strong pair bonds generally increase fitness in monogamous organisms, but may also underlie the risk of hampering it when re-pairing fails after the winter season. We investigated whether partners would either maintain contact or offset this risk by exploiting sex-specific favourable niches during winter in a migratory monogamous seabird, the southern rockhopper penguin Eudyptes chrysocome. Using light-based geolocation,we showthat although the spatial distribution of both sexes largely overlapped, pair-wise mates were located on average 595+260 km (and up to 2500 km) apart during winter. Stable isotope data also indicated a marked overlap between sex-specific isotopic niches (δ13C and δ15N values) but a segregation of the feeding habitats (δ13C values) within pairs. Importantly, the tracked females remained longer (12 days) at sea than males, but all re-mated with their previous partners after winter. Our study provides multiple evidence that migratory species maywell demonstrate pair-wise segregation even in the absence of sex-specific winter niches (spatial and isotopic).We suggest that dispersive migration patterns with sex-biased timings may be a sufficient proximal cause for generating such a situation in migratory animals. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Eight captive female Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) were monitored over a 10 week period, commencing at 5 weeks prior to egg lay (EL), to increase our understanding of the species' reproductive biology. Females in cordoned nest sites underwent cloacal artificial insemination (AI) every 4-7 days with different semen donors for each insemination. The EL interval was 97.9 ± 3.6 h (range: 84-108 h) and paternity analyses revealed that conceptive inseminations occurred from 11.5 to 4.5 days before oviposition. A biphasic pattern of estradiol, testosterone, progesterone and the biochemical analytes triglyceride, iron, calcium and phosphorus occurred in relation to EL, with values increasing (P< 0.05) to maximal concentrations during the three weeks preceding oviposition, then decreasing (P< 0.05) rapidly after oviposition completion. In comparison with post-lay (baseline) values, concentrations of estradiol and testosterone relative to the first oviposition were elevated at Week-5, and those of triglyceride, a yolk formation index, as well as iron, calcium and phosphorus, became elevated at Week-4 (P< 0.05). Collective data indicate an estimated total egg formation interval of 29. days, with oviducal transit of the ovulated ovum occurring over the majority of the ∼4. day EL interval. These findings indicate that egg formation is prolonged with folliculogenesis initiated at 5. weeks or more prior to oviposition. Consequently, the period of folliculogenesis and egg formation is estimated to overlap with the final ∼3. weeks that wild females spend at sea prior to returning to land for breeding. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Blood parasites are potential threats to the health of penguins and to their conservation and management. Little penguins Eudyptula minor are native to Australia and New Zealand, and are susceptible to piroplasmids (Babesia), hemosporidians (Haemoproteus, Leucocytozoon, Plasmodium) and kinetoplastids (Trypanosoma). We studied a total of 263 wild little penguins at 20 sites along the Australian southeastern coast, in addition to 16 captive-bred little penguins. Babesia sp. was identified in seven wild little penguins, with positive individuals recorded in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania. True prevalence was estimated between 3.4% and 4.5%. Only round forms of the parasite were observed, and gene sequencing confirmed the identity of the parasite and demonstrated it is closely related to Babesia poelea from boobies (Sula spp.) and B. uriae from murres (Uria aalge). None of the Babesia-positive penguins presented signs of disease, confirming earlier suggestions that chronic infections by these parasites are not substantially problematic to otherwise healthy little penguins. We searched also for kinetoplastids, and despite targeted sampling of little penguins near the location where Trypanosoma eudyptulae was originally reported, this parasite was not detected. © 2015 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Growing evidence suggests that telomeres, non-coding DNA sequences that shorten with age and stress, are related in an undefined way to individual breeding performances and survival rates in several species. Short telomeres and elevated shortening rates are typically associated with life stress and low health. As such, telomeres could serve as an integrative proxy of individual quality, describing the overall biological state of an individual at a given age. Telomere length could be associated with the decline of an array of physiological traits in age-controlled individuals. Here, we investigated the links between individuals’ relative telomere length, breeding performance and various physiological (body condition, natural antibody levels) and life history (age, past breeding success) parameters in a long-lived seabird species, the king penguin Aptenodytes patagonicus. While we observed no link between relative telomere length and age, we found that birds with longer telomeres arrived earlier for breeding at the colony, and had higher breeding performances (i.e. the amount of time adults managed to maintain their chicks alive, and ultimately breeding success) than individuals with shorter telomeres. Further, we observed a positive correlation between telomere length and natural antibody levels. Taken together, our results add to the growing evidence that telomere length is likely to reflect individual quality difference in wild animal. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus), which have declined over the past two decades, are considered near threatened by the IUCN Red List. Virus research in this migratory population identified a diversity of virus pathogens within the free-living reproductive active population in Argentina and in the beached rescued population along the Brazilian Coast. Rehabilitating and releasing seabirds are important tools to minimize anthropogenic impacts in the sustainability of threatened species. Infectious diseases can be serious threats for the success of such initiatives, especially since knowledge on pathogens affecting those species in the wild is usually scarce. Avipoxvirus infection causing local cutaneous lesions was reported by Kane et al., (2012) in the Argentinian breeding colonies. A different avipoxvirus causing cutaneous and diphtheritic lesions in the oesophagus and bronchioli was reported by Niemeyer et al., (2013) in penguins housed in outdoor enclosures in a Rehabilitation Centre located at Florianópolis, Santa Catarina State, Brazil. By that time, the authors suspected of a spillover effect based on the divergence between the Brazilian penguinpoxvirus (Canarypox clade) and the avipoxvirus (Folwpox clade) described in the Argentinian breeding colonies. The Rehabilitation Centre kept monitoring and diagnosing based on clinical signs, histo- pathology, the use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing. The knowledge regarding the virus strain diversity was very important to avoid the introduction of a novel virus into the wild population by releasing rehabilitated infected birds. In 2011, a novel herpesvirus was identified in rescued oiled penguins that died within a respiratory outbreak at a Rehabilitation Centre located in the south of the Brazilian Coast (Niemeyer C., 2014). Sampling apparently healthy and reproductive active Magellanic penguins in Argentinian Patagonia, Niemeyer, C. (2014) identified a different herpesvirus. Meanwhile, different strains of coronavirus and herpesvirus were identified in asymptomatic rescued Magellanic penguins along the Brazilian Coast's beaches. PCR identification and partial virus sequencing allow us to identify pathogens related to mortality and morbidity. The aim of this chapter was to contribute to the knowledge and identification of viruses capable of infecting both free-living apparently healthy penguins, and the pathogens that may be related to the release of rehabilitated penguins and the implication of these agents in the conservation of species. The knowledge about the occurrence of virus infection in the species is crucial to determine conservation policies and management of a population that deal with different threats across the oceans. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The importance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in remote sensing is rapidly growing. However, knowledge about their potential impact on wildlife is scant, especially in Antarctica, where they are a new tool used in ecological research and monitoring. In this preliminary study potential effects of wildlife disturbance by fixed-wing UAVs are investigated. In austral summer 2014/15, UAV overflights were conducted in the Adelié penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) breeding colony at Point. Thomas (Western Shore of Admiralty Bay, King George Island, Antarctica, Subarea 48.1). The impacts of electric and piston engine UAVs flying at 350 m altitude above ground level (AGL) over the colony were compared to the undisturbed colony (control group), and to natural disturbance (skua-Stercorarius sp. flying over nesting penguins). Penguin behaviour was divided into: resting behaviour, comfort behaviour, vigilance/anxiety and aggression. Percentages of birds exhibiting different types of behaviour, time spent on each type of behaviour and number of different types of behaviour displayed by one bird during the observation periods were compared. No differences were found between the control group and overflights by electric UAVs. During the overflight by a UAV powered by piston engine, symptoms of vigilance were observed with penguins looking up and around for a few seconds when the UAV was overhead. Similar symptoms of vigilance were observed when skuas flew (approximately 5 m AGL) over penguin colony without trying to attack nesting birds. No increase in aggressive behaviour was observed during the overflights by either electric or piston engine UAVs. Plans for a systematic monitoring of UAV impact on wildlife, as well as preliminary guidelines for the next field season, were formulated. © Commission for Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources 2016, All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The koilin membrane, formed by the secretions of the ventricular and pyloric glands, functions as a protective layer in the gizzards of most bird species. However, the ecological functions of koilin have never been studied in freeranging penguins. During the two austral summers from 2012 to 2014, we observed the regurgitated koilins of chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarcticus) at Narȩbski Point on King George Island, South Shetland Islands, and we detected a significant difference in the daily accumulation of regurgitated koilins between the pre-hatching and post-hatching periods in the rookery. We also found 233 gastrointestinal parasites, all Stegophorus macronectes (Nematoda, Acuariidae), from 26 out of 45 koilins freshly regurgitated by chinstrap penguins.We suggest that the regurgitation of koilins may benefit adult chinstrap penguins in the wild by reducing parasitic loads when they fast during incubation; it may also help decrease the risk of parasite transmission to chicks. Our results present the first observations of regurgitated koilins among breeding chinstrap penguins. How koilin regurgitation functions in penguins requires further study. Among the gentoo penguins (P. papua) co-occurring at the study site, we observed no regurgitated koilin layers. © 2016 H.-K. Kim et al.

ABSTRACT: Molecular genetic analyses present powerful tools for elucidating demographic and biogeographic histories of taxa. Here we present genetic evidence showing a dynamic history for two cryptic lineages within Eudyptula, the world's smallest penguin. Specifically, we use a suite of genetic markers to reveal that two congeneric taxa ('Australia' and 'New Zealand') co-occur in southern New Zealand, with only low levels of hybridization. Coalescent modelling suggests that the Australian little penguin only recently expanded into southern New Zealand. Analyses conducted under time-dependent molecular evolutionary rates lend support to the hypothesis of recent anthropogenic turnover, consistent with shifts detected in several other New Zealand coastal vertebrate taxa. This apparent turnover event highlights the dynamic nature of the regionâ€™s coastal ecosystem. © 2015 Grosser et al.

ABSTRACT: Social thermoregulation is a cooperative strategy in which animals actively aggregate to benefit from the warmth of conspecifics in response to low ambient temperatures. Emperor penguins, Aptenodytes forsteri, use this behaviour to ensure their survival and reproduction during the Antarctic winter. An emperor penguin colony consists of a dynamic mosaic of compact zones, the so-called huddles, included in a looser network of individuals. To maximize energy savings, birds should adjust their huddling behaviour according to environmental conditions. Here, we examined the dynamics of emperor penguin aggregations, based on photo and video records, in relation to climatic factors. Environmental temperature, wind and solar radiation were the main factors contributing to huddle formation. The analysis of individual movements showed that birds originating from loose aggregations continually joined huddles. Sometimes, a small number of birds induced a movement that propagated to the entire huddle, causing its breakup within 2 min and releasing birds, which then integrated into looser aggregations. Different parts of the colony therefore appeared to continually exchange individuals in response to environmental conditions. A likely explanation is that individuals in need of warmth join huddles, whereas individuals seeking to dissipate heat break huddles apart. The regular growth and decay of huddles operates as pulses through which birds gain, conserve or lose heat. Originally proposed to account for reducing energy expenditure, the concept of social thermoregulation appears to cover a highly dynamic phenomenon that fulfils a genuine regulatory function in emperor penguins. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: Little is known about non-human bipedal gaits. This is probably due to the fact that most large animals are quadrupedal and that non-human bipedal animals are mostly birds, whose primary form of locomotion is flight. Very little research has been conducted on penguin pedestrian locomotion with the focus instead on their associated high energy expenditure. In animals, tri-axial accelerometers are frequently used to estimate physiological energy cost, as well as to define the behaviour pattern of a species, or the kinematics of swimming. In this study, we showed how an accelerometer-based technique could be used to determine the biomechanical characteristics of pedestrian locomotion. Eight king penguins, which represent the only family of birds to have an upright bipedal gait, were trained to walk on a treadmill. The trunk tri-axial accelerations were recorded while the bird was walking at four different speeds (1.0, 1.2, 1.4 and 1.6. km/h), enabling the amplitude of dynamic body acceleration along the three axes (amplitude of DBA. x, DBA. y and DBA. z), stride frequency, waddling and leaning amplitude, as well as the leaning angle to be defined. The magnitude of the measured variables showed a significant increase with increasing speed, apart from the backwards angle of lean, which decreased with increasing speed. The variability of the measured variables also showed a significant increase with speed apart from the DBA. z amplitude, the waddling amplitude, and the leaning angle, where no significant effect of the walking speed was found. This paper is the first approach to describe 3D biomechanics with an accelerometer on wild animals, demonstrating the potential of this technique. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Knowledge regarding interactions between predators and their prey is fundamental for understanding underlying links between climate change and ecosystem responses, including predator demographics, in the Southern Ocean. This study reports data on reproductive performance, total population size and diet composition for macaroni and chinstrap penguins breeding at Nyroysa on Bouvetoya during the summers of 1996-97, 1998-99, 2000-01 and 2007-08. The breeding populations of these two species at Nyroysa decreased significantly over the study period, with an 80% decline for chinstraps and a 50% decline for macaroni penguins, despite relatively high levels of chick production. During this period macaroni penguins at this site ate a diverse diet, dominated by myctophid fish and two krill species, whereas chinstrap penguins were Antarctic krill specialists. The population changes are probably primarily due to the expanding Antarctic fur seal population, and also to landslides that are the result of increased melting on the island which have destroyed penguin breeding sites. Additional impacts from global warming of the ocean might also be playing a role and could exacerbate the decline in these penguin populations if krill and other prey are negatively impacted in the future in this region. The local chinstrap penguin population would probably be most heavily affected given its narrow feeding niche and small current population size. © 2015 Antarctic Science Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Taxonomic studies were performed on a novel carotenoid-producing strain, designated AJ003T, isolated from faeces of Antarctic penguins. Cells of strain AJ003T were aerobic, Gram-stainpositive, cocci-shaped and orange. Strain AJ003T was capable of growing in a broad temperature range, including sub-zero growth (below 220 to 30 °C). 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strain AJ003T was closely related to Planococcus halocryophilus Or1T (97.4% similarity), Planococcus antarcticus DSM 14505T (97.3%), Planococcus kocurii NCIMB 629T (97.3%), and Planococcus donghaensis JH1T (97.1%). The predominant cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C15: 0, and iso-C16: 0.MK-7 and MK-8 were the quinones identified, and the major pigment was glycosyl-4,4'-diaponeurosporen-4'-ol-4-oic acid. The major polar lipid was phosphatidylglycerol. DNA–DNA relatedness of strain AJ003T with respect to its closest phylogenetic neighbours was 38.2±0.5% for Planococcus halocryophilus DSM 24743T, 32.2±0.2% for Planococcus antarcticus DSM 14505T, 21.0±0.3% for Planococcus kocurii DSM 20747T and 18.6±1.4% for Planococcus donghaensis KCTC 13050T. The DNA G+C content of strain AJ003T was 40.0±0.6 mol%. Based on the phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic data, strain AJ003T is concluded to represent a novel species of the genus Planococcus, for which the name Planococcus faecalis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is AJ003T (=KCTC 33580T=CECT 8759T). © 2015 IUMS.

ABSTRACT: The relationship between ammonia (NH3) concentrations downwind from a penguin colony and local surface greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes was investigated on the remote sub-Antarctic Bird Island (54°00'S, 38°03'W) during summer 2010 (November and December). A Macaroni penguin (Eudyptes chrysolophus) colony (40,000 pairs) at Goldcrest Point is a large point source of NH3 on the island and a measurement transect of 23 m, 36 m, 70 m, 143 m and 338 m was set up downwind from the colony. Atmospheric NH3 concentrations measured by passive diffusion samplers declined from 23 μg m-3 close to the colony to less than 1 μg m-3 338 m downwind. As increased nitrogen (N) deposition can affect soil carbon (C) and N cycling, it can therefore potentially influence GHG and nitric oxide (NO) emission rates. However, in this study, a clear correlation between surface GHG fluxes and atmospheric NH3 concentrations could not be established. Average fluxes for nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) over the entire transect and the eight week study period ranged from 7 to 23 μg N2O-N m-2 h-1, -5.5-245 μg CH4 m-2 h-1, and CO2 respiration rates averaged 2.2 μmol m-2 s-1. Laboratory studies using intact soil cores from the transect also did not show any significant correlation between atmospheric NH3 concentrations and N2O, NO, CH4 emissions or CO2 respiration rates. Overall, fluxes measured in the laboratory study reflected the high variability measured in the field. Large changes in soil depth along the transect, due to the topography of the island, possibly influenced fluxes more than NH3 concentration and seabirds appeared to have a more localised input (e.g. ground nesting birds). However, warmer temperatures might have a large potential to increase GHG fluxes in this ecosystem. This study confirms that GHG fluxes do occur in these ornithogenic ecosystems, however, the scale of the impact remains largely unquantified due to high uncertainties and high spatial variability. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Studies of physiology can provide important insight into how animals are coping with challenges in their environment and can signal the potential effects of exposure to human activity in both the short and long term. In this study, we measured the physiological and behavioural response of little penguins (Eudyptula minor) that were naïve to human activity over 30 min of capture and handling. We assessed relationships between corticosterone secretion, behaviour, sex and time of day in order to characterize the determinants of the natural stress response. We then compared the response of these naïve penguins with the responses of female little penguins that had been exposed to research activity (bimonthly nest check and weighing) and to both research activity (monthly nest check and weighing) and evening viewing by tourists. We found that corticosterone concentrations increased significantly over 30 min of capture, with naïve penguins demonstrating a more acute stress response during the day than at night. Penguins that had previously been exposed to handling at the research and research/ visitor sites showed elevated corticosterone concentrations and consistently more aggressive behaviour after 30 min compared with naïve birds, although there were no significant differences in baseline corticosterone concentrations. Our findings demonstrate that these little penguins have not habituated to routine capture, but rather mount a heightened physiological and behavioural response to handling by humans. Less invasive research monitoring techniques, such as individual identification with PIT tags and automatic recording and weighing, and a reduction in handling during the day should be considered to mitigate some of the potentially negative effects of disturbance. Given the paucity of data on the long-term consequences of heightened stress on animal physiology, our study highlights the need for further investigation of the relationship between the corticosterone stress response and fitness outcomes, such as breeding success and survival. © The Author 2016.

ABSTRACT: Substantial changes in bone histology accompany the secondary adaptation to life in the water. This transition is well documented in several lineages of mammals and non-avian reptiles, but has received relatively little attention in birds. This study presents new observations on the long bone microstructure of penguins, based on histological sections from two extant taxa (Spheniscus and Aptenodytes) and eight fossil specimens belonging to stem lineages (†Palaeospheniscus and several indeterminate Eocene taxa). High bone density in penguins results from compaction of the internal cortical tissues, and thus penguin bones are best considered osteosclerotic rather than pachyostotic. Although the oldest specimens sampled in this study represent stages of penguin evolution that occurred at least 25 million years after the loss of flight, major differences in humeral structure were observed between these Eocene stem taxa and extant taxa. This indicates that the modification of flipper bone microstructure continued long after the initial loss of flight in penguins. It is proposed that two key transitions occurred during the shift from the typical hollow avian humerus to the dense osteosclerotic humerus in penguins. First, a reduction of the medullary cavity occurred due to a decrease in the amount of perimedullary osteoclastic activity. Second, a more solid cortex was achieved by compaction. In extant penguins and †Palaeospheniscus, most of the inner cortex is formed by rapid osteogenesis, resulting an initial latticework of woven-fibered bone. Subsequently, open spaces are filled by slower, centripetal deposition of parallel-fibered bone. Eocene stem penguins formed the initial latticework, but the subsequent round of compaction was less complete, and thus open spaces remained in the adult bone. In contrast to the humerus, hindlimb bones from Eocene stem penguins had smaller medullary cavities and thus higher compactness values compared with extant taxa. Although cortical lines of arrested growth have been observed in extant penguins, none was observed in any of the current sampled specimens. Therefore, it is likely that even these 'giant' penguin taxa completed their growth cycle without a major pause in bone deposition, implying that they did not undergo a prolonged fasting interval before reaching adult size. © 2015 Anatomical Society.

ABSTRACT: Sixteen polymorphic microsatellite loci were isolated and characterized for the chinstrap penguin, Pygoscelis antarctica. The number of alleles per locus ranged from two to nine. The observed and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.136 to 0.864 and from 0.208 to 0.831, respectively. Cross-species amplification was successful in other penguin species, including Pygoscelis papua, Pygoscelis adelie, and Eudyptes chrysolophus. The microsatellite markers developed in this study can be used in future conservation studies. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

ABSTRACT: Until roughly 200 years ago, the Antarctic was untouched by humankind. With ratification of the Antarctic Treaty in 1961, this region was set aside forever for peaceful purposes and as a science preserve. However, Antarctic national programs and tourism activities are growing, increasing the risks of introduction of infectious diseases into wildlife within the Antarctic Treaty area. The immunological naïveté of Antarctic species makes them vulnerable to pathogen’s commonplace in other parts of the world. We review past disease investigations of Antarctic penguins, and outline potential drivers of future disease emergence. Efforts to establish the nature of disease agents in Antarctic penguins, although ongoing since the late 1950s, remain not only patchy and limited in scope but are a lower priority issue for the majority of Antarctic Treaty parties. Pollution, increased connectivity, and global environmental change affecting pathogens and vectors at high latitudes are likely to drive future disease emergence in this region. However, a coordinated plan for disease emergence monitoring is lacking with no formally established programs in place, and surveillance is currently left up to individual interested research groups. We propose possible steps toward the goal of establishing baseline data and tracking infectious diseases in Antarctic penguin species, with the anticipated further increase in human activity and environmental changes in the Antarctic in mind. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: We examined 185 metabolites in 30 adult Humboldt Penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) nesting at the Punta San Juan Marine Protected Area, Peru, in order to examine gender differences in metabolome profiles, particularly those involved in metabolism and energetics. The majority of the compounds identified were fatty (26% of total identified compounds), organic (19%), and amino (16%) acids. We were able to differentiate male and female penguins with 96.6% accuracy on the basis of 12 metabolites, most of which are involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. These included 2-oxoglutarate, erythronic acid, GABA, mannitol, sedoheptulose 7-phosphate, and serine and six metabolites present in higher concentrations in females compared to males (2-aminoadipic acid, O-phosphorylethanolamine, glycerol 2-phosphate, glycerol 3-phosphate, pantothenic acid, and creatinine). Of these, 2-oxoglutarate and glycerol 3-phosphate were key metabolites distinguishing gender. Our results indicated that male and female Humboldt Penguins were characterized by differing metabolic states. Such differences could be important to individual and brood survival in times of environmental stress. © 2015 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: After the breeding season, penguins must replenish body condition and accumulate sufficient energy stores before their annual moult ashore; failure to do so may lead to starvation. Knowing where and how adult penguins find adequate resources during this energy-intensive stage is vital to understanding their susceptibility to ecosystem changes. GPS and TDR loggers were used to track movements and record diving behaviour of macaroni Eudyptes chrysolophus and eastern rockhopper E. chrysocome filholi penguins from Marion Island (46°S, 37°E) during the pre-moult foraging trip in 2012, 2013 and 2014. Both species consistently travelled in a southerly direction to forage in cooler (~3.5 °C) Antarctic Zone waters south of the Antarctic Polar Front where they associated with mesoscale eddies and sub-mesoscale filaments. Dives were predominantly to depths of 30 to 60 m, but macaroni penguins dived deeper more often. Mean trip durations of both species were similar (33 ± 6 days), but maximum foraging ranges of macaroni penguins (903 ± 165 km) were greater than eastern rockhopper penguins (696 ± 152 km). Spatial overlap of core foraging areas between species was high, but a 2- to 3-week difference in departure dates reduced potential interspecific competition at sea. Trip durations were longer in 2014 compared to 2013, when decreased productivity may have reduced prey availability, forcing penguins to remain longer at sea. Continued monitoring is vital to understand how crested penguins at Marion Island adapt to the predicted southward shift of major frontal boundaries. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: A translocation of wild-bred and captive-bred Little Penguin Eudyptula minor fledglings was trialled to reinforce (augment) an urban population of this species in Sydney Harbour, Australia. Over three breeding seasons (2004/05 to 2006/07), a total of 44 wild-bred fledglings from nearby Lion Island and 19 captive-bred fledglings from local zoos were translocated to Store Beach, North Harbour, within Sydney Harbour. All translocated birds were implanted with a numbered microchip before release. During the same period, the North Harbour colony produced at least 327 fledglings, of which 113 were implanted with microchips prior to fledging. The North Harbour colony was monitored between 2005 and 2013 to identify any returning translocated or locally wild-bred birds. Three translocated wild-bred birds and 12 locally wild-bred birds are known to have returned to North Harbour, but no translocated captive-bred birds. One translocated wild-bred bird returned to Store Beach while the remaining two returned to adjacent headlands. The number of pairs of Little Penguin breeding on Store Beach, where threats are intensively managed, has increased from one in 2004 to nine in 2013. This study demonstrated that translocation of wild-bred fledglings is feasible. However, because of naturally low return rates, translocations of Little Penguins need to involve a large number of individuals, preferably taken from a sizeable donor colony, to be effective in reinforcing a threatened or declining population. The effectiveness of releasing captive-bred Little Penguins has yet to be demonstrated. © 2015, Marine Ornithology. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Knowledge about parasitic organisms in Antarctica is scarce and fragmentary. The study reported here adds to the knowledge of gastrointestinal parasites of the Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) (Sphenisciformes), from 25 de Mayo/ King George Island (South Shetlands), Bahia Esperanza (Hope Bay) and Avian Island (Antarctica). Thirty-five freshly dead specimens (20 chicks and 15 adults) were collected from December 2007 to December 2014 and examined for internal macroparasites. Three adult parasite species were found: one Cestoda, Parorchites zederi, and two Nematoda, Stegophorus macronectes and Tetrameres sp. Immature Tetrabothrius sp. were found in hosts from Avian Island. Helminth communities are known to be related to host feeding behaviours. Low parasite richness observed in Adélie penguins could be related to the stenophagic and pelagic diet of this host species, which feeds almost exclusively on krill. © 2016 J.I. Diaz et al.

ABSTRACT: Ross Island, Antarctica, is home to the southernmost breeding colonies of Adélie penguins, with associated ornithogenic nutrient enrichment to soil. Most of our knowledge about ornithogenic soils in Antarctica comes from studies of the Peninsula region, with much less known about soils in the Ross Sea region of continental Antarctica where climate is more extreme and biological communities are less diverse. We measured soil properties (pH, salinity, total and organic C and N, extractable mineral N and P), microbial biomass, and CO2 flux at three penguin rookeries on Ross Island differing in colony size and along gradients of penguin activity extending from the colony to soils lacking visible penguin influence. We determined both in situ and potential rates of CO2 flux, as well as the nutrient limitations on C cycling by fertilizing soils with N and P, in controlled laboratory incubations. Larger pools of soil C, N, and P along with elevated soil CO2 flux were found in soils with high penguin activity as compared to areas of low or no apparent activity. In laboratory incubations, CO2 flux was stimulated by addition of C with N or P, but not with N or P alone, suggesting that even with the deposition of large amounts of penguin guano, soil biota are not released from C limitation. The influence of penguin activity was not directly related to colony size but rather to the intensity of activity within the rookery (e.g., frequency of penguin presence). Our results show that penguin-influenced soils are biogeochemical hot spots where altered nutrient pools are associated with increased CO2 flux. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Marine no-take zones can have positive impacts for target species and are increasingly important management tools. However, whether they indirectly benefit higher order predators remains unclear. The endangered African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) depends on commercially exploited forage fish. We examined how chick survival responded to an experimental 3-year fishery closure around Robben Island, South Africa, controlling for variation in prey biomass and fishery catches. Chick survival increased by 18% when the closure was initiated, which alone led to a predicted 27% higher population compared with continued fishing. However, the modelled population continued to decline, probably because of high adult mortality linked to poor prey availability over larger spatial scales. Our results illustrate that small no-take zones can have bottom-up benefits for highly mobile marine predators, but are only one component of holistic, ecosystem-based management regimes. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Climate change is likely to result in continued warming of the oceans and an in - crease in the frequency and intensity of storms. To gain some insight into how such changes might affect little penguins, we studied how variation in sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a concentrations and the occurrence of severe storms affected little penguin Eudyptula minor breeding and survival at Oamaru, New Zealand. We examined the impact of prolonged, extreme storms using the 99th percentile of significant wave heights. Long durations of such wave heights at Oamaru were associated with a reduction in the number of penguins arriving ashore each evening and a reduction in adult survival. Ocean productivity positively influenced the penguins: increases in chlorophyll a were reflected by increases in survival of breeders, and by earlier onset of egg laying that generated increases in breeding success. Global climate change is highly likely to have negative impacts on the population of little penguins at Oamaru through impacts from storms. It is unclear, however, how climate change will influence chlorophyll a concentrations, and so we cannot predict what impact this will have on little penguins. Potential increases in chlorophyll a via increased nutrient input from the land may have positive effects on the penguins. © Inter-Research 2015.

ABSTRACT: Background: Major, long-term environmental changes are projected in the Southern Ocean and these are likely to have impacts for marine predators such as the Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae). Decadal monitoring studies have provided insight into the short-term environmental sensitivities of Adélie penguin populations, particularly to sea ice changes. However, given the long-term nature of projected climate change, it is also prudent to consider the responses of populations to environmental change over longer time scales. We investigated the population trajectory of Adélie penguins during the last glacial-interglacial transition to determine how the species was affected by climate warming over millennia. We focussed our study on East Antarctica, which is home to 30 % of the global population of Adélie penguins. Methods: Using mitochondrial DNA from extant colonies, we reconstructed the population trend of Adélie penguins in East Antarctica over the past 22,000 years using an extended Bayesian skyline plot method. To determine the relationship of East Antarctic Adélie penguins with populations elsewhere in Antarctica we constructed a phylogeny using mitochondrial DNA sequences. Results: We found that the Adélie penguin population expanded 135-fold from approximately 14,000 years ago. The population growth was coincident with deglaciation in East Antarctica and, therefore, an increase in ice-free ground suitable for Adélie penguin nesting. Our phylogenetic analysis indicated that East Antarctic Adélie penguins share a common ancestor with Adélie penguins from the Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia Arc, with an estimated age of 29,000 years ago, in the midst of the last glacial period. This finding suggests that extant colonies in East Antarctica, the Scotia Arc and the Antarctic Peninsula were founded from a single glacial refuge. Conclusions: While changes in sea ice conditions are a critical driver of Adélie penguin population success over decadal and yearly timescales, deglaciation appears to have been the key driver of population change over millennia. This suggests that environmental drivers of population trends over thousands of years may differ to drivers over years or decades, highlighting the need to consider millennial-scale trends alongside contemporary data for the forecasting of species' abundance and distribution changes under future climate change scenarios. © 2015 Younger et al.

ABSTRACT: Aspergillosis, an opportunistic mycosis caused by the Aspergillus genus, affects mainly the respiratory system and is considered one of the most significant causes of mortality in captive penguins. This study aimed to examine a 6-yr period of cases of aspergillosis in penguins at the Centro de Recuperação de Animais Marinhos (CRAM-FURG), Rio Grande, Brazil. A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the institution's records of penguins received from January 2004 to December 2009. Animals were categorized according to the outcome "aspergillosis," and analyzed by age group, sex, oil fouling, origin, prophylactic administration of itraconazole, period in captivity, body mass, hematocrit, and total plasma proteins. A total of 327 Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) was studied, 66 of which died of aspergillosis. Proportionate mortality by aspergillosis was 48.5%, and incidence density was 7.3 lethal aspergillosis cases per 100 penguins/mo. Approximately 75% of the aspergillosis cases occurred in penguins that had been transferred from other rehabilitation centers, and this was considered a significant risk factor for the disease. Significant differences were also observed between the groups in regard to the period of time spent in captivity until death, hematocrit and total plasma proteins upon admission to the center, and body mass gain during the period in captivity. The findings demonstrate the negative impacts of aspergillosis on the rehabilitation of Magellanic penguins, with a high incidence density and substantial mortality. © Copyright 2015 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: The sustainable and responsible exploitation of natural populations for subsistence requires a scientific basis for management. Eggs of the Endangered Northern Rockhopper Penguin (Eudyptes moseleyi) in the Tristan da Cunha archipelago have been harvested since the 19th century with no restrictions on which (A- or B-eggs) can be harvested, despite the larger B-egg being much more likely to produce fledged offspring. Our objective was to create a discriminant function to predict the laying order of harvested eggs. We found that the discriminant function of D≤0.58×Length+0.39×Breadth -57.48 successfully classified 91% of eggs as A- or B-eggs. When applied to previously collected harvest data, the discriminant function identified at least 36% of eggs as B-eggs. The method we describe here provides a mechanism around which one aspect of a management framework for the sustainable harvest of Northern Rockhopper Penguin eggs can be built. © BirdLife Australia 2016.

ABSTRACT: Telomeres are emerging as a biomarker for ageing and survival, and are likely important in shaping life-history trade-offs. In particular, telomere length with which one starts in life has been linked to lifelong survival, suggesting that early telomere dynamics are somehow related to life-history trajectories. This result highlights the importance of determining the extent to which telomere length is inherited, as a crucial factor determining early life telomere length. Given the scarcity of species for which telomere length inheritance has been studied, it is pressing to assess the generality of telomere length inheritance patterns. Further, information on how this pattern changes over the course of growth in individuals living under natural conditions should provide some insight on the extent to which environmental constraints also shape telomere dynamics. To fill this gap partly, we followed telomere inheritance in a population of king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus). We tested for paternal and maternal influence on chick initial telomere length (10 days old after hatching), and how these relationships changed with chick age (at 70, 200 and 300 days old). Based on a correlative approach, offspring telomere length was positively associated with maternal telomere length early in life (at 10 days old). However, this relationship was not significant at older ages. These data suggest that telomere length in birds is maternally inherited. Nonetheless, the influence of environmental conditions during growth remained an important factor shaping telomere length, as the maternal link disappeared with chicks' age. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The winged pearl oyster, Pteria penguin, is cultured primarily to produce half-pearls (mabé). The mabé quality is influenced by culture techniques, but there is limited information in this field. P. penguin with mean (±SE) dorso-ventral height of 250 ± 6.5 mm were used to investigate the influence of culture period and nucleus position on mabé quality. Oysters were relaxed using 1-propylene phenoxetol, and five nuclei were glued at different positions to the inner surfaces of the oyster shells; three on the more concave left valve and two on the right valve. Nucleated oysters were then cultured for 10 months under commercial pearl farming conditions at Savusavu in Fiji. Nacre deposited at the base and top of the nuclei was measured monthly, from the 6th to the 10th months of culture and the different qualities of mabé produced at different positions were scrutinized. Nacre thicknesses at the base and top of the resulting mabé were significantly different at different months (P < 0.05) and the rate of nacre deposition was highest during the warmer months. The different positions of nuclei on the valve greatly affected the quality of mabé formed. After a 10-month culture period, around 1 mm of nacre covered the nuclei although the best quality mabé were obtained after 9 months. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Cumulative human impacts across the world's oceans are considerable. We therefore examined a single model taxonomic group, the penguins (Spheniscidae), to explore how marine species and communities might be at risk of decline or extinction in the southern hemisphere. We sought to determine the most important threats to penguins and to suggest means to mitigate these threats. Our review has relevance to other taxonomic groups in the southern hemisphere and in northern latitudes, where human impacts are greater. Our review was based on an expert assessment and literature review of all 18 penguin species; 49 scientists contributed to the process. For each penguin species, we considered their range and distribution, population trends, and main anthropogenic threats over the past approximately 250 years. These threats were harvesting adults for oil, skin, and feathers and as bait for crab and rock lobster fisheries; harvesting of eggs; terrestrial habitat degradation; marine pollution; fisheries bycatch and resource competition; environmental variability and climate change; and toxic algal poisoning and disease. Habitat loss, pollution, and fishing, all factors humans can readily mitigate, remain the primary threats for penguin species. Their future resilience to further climate change impacts will almost certainly depend on addressing current threats to existing habitat degradation on land and at sea. We suggest protection of breeding habitat, linked to the designation of appropriately scaled marine reserves, including in the High Seas, will be critical for the future conservation of penguins. However, large-scale conservation zones are not always practical or politically feasible and other ecosystem-based management methods that include spatial zoning, bycatch mitigation, and robust harvest control must be developed to maintain marine biodiversity and ensure that ecosystem functioning is maintained across a variety of scales. © 2014 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Uropygial, or preen, glands are found in a variety of avian species including penguins. These glands have a multitude of functions and can develop a variety of conditions including impaction, rupture, adenitis, squamous metaplasia, and neoplasia of various types, with squamous cell carcinoma the most commonly reported. A case series of uropygial gland squamous cell carcinoma in five penguins at the Wildlife Conservation Society's Central Park Zoo is described. Most birds were aged (>10 yr) with a history of chronic, recurrent uropygial gland problems including impaction, rupture, abscess formation, or a combination of conditions. Before and after neoplasia diagnosis, these cases were managed conservatively, and palliative care was provided. Because many of these cases were preceded by chronic inflammation, it is possible this inflammation predisposed the uropygial gland to neoplastic transformation, and more aggressive treatment early in the disease process may therefore be warranted.

ABSTRACT: Quantifying prey consumption by top predators is a crucial component of ecosystem-based management in the Southern Ocean. In this study, we developed a bioenergetics model to estimate prey consumption by a top predator, the Adélie penguin Pygoscelis adeliae. Our model predicts prey consumption throughout the breeding season and incorporates uncertainty in model parameters using Monte Carlo simulation. The model was parameterized with data obtained at Béchervaise Island, the site of a long-term monitoring program in East Antarctica. We parameterized the model (1) using 13 yr of penguin population data, (2) for a year in which penguins successfully reared their chicks (2001-2002) and (3) for a year with low breeding success (1998-1999). Daily per capita energy consumption during the breeding season averaged 4269 kJ d-1 (95% CI: 4187-4352 kJ d-1) and 4684 kJ d-1 (95% CI: 4596-4771 kJ d-1) for males and females, respectively. Over the entire breeding season a male breeder consumes 470 MJ (95% CI: 461-479 MJ) compared to 515 MJ (95% CI: 506-525 MJ) for a female. On average, the Béchervaise Island population of 1836 breeding pairs consumes 16 447 MJ d-1 which amounts to 1 809 224 MJ during the breeding season. On the basis of variable breeding success and the proportion of krill and fish in their diet, we estimate that this population consumes 78 to 406 t of krill and 4 to 46 t of fish each breeding season. Our results demonstrate clear periods of peak consumption associated with the penguins' breeding cycle. © Inter-Research 2015.

ABSTRACT: Comparing baseline and stress-induced glucocorticoid hormone levels in animals is a popular tool to assess differences in stress experienced among groups. Wecompare corticosterone levels in Magellanic Penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus (J.R. Forster, 1781)) in situations where we hypothesize differences in stress patterns may exist. We compared penguins both within and between breeding seasons, birds breeding at two different locations, penguins at three different ages, penguins that had shown evidence of recent fighting, and, finally, howstress patterns differed for four different penguin species. Throughout a breeding season (settlement, incubation, and chick-rearing), we found no differences in either baseline or stress-induced hormone concentrations. Chick, juvenile, and adult penguins did not differ in baseline corticosterone levels, but juveniles had a reduced stress response. Penguins in one season showed a stress response to capture, likely due to a recent severe weather event. Wefound no differences in baseline or stress-induced hormone titers for birds from two different breeding locations. Evidence of recent fighting also did not alter baseline corticosterone levels. Finally, among four species of penguins measured (Magellanic, Humboldt (Spheniscus humboldti Meyen, 1834), Galápagos (Spheniscus mendiculus Sundevall, 1871), and Rockhopper (Eudyptes chrysocome (J.R. Forster, 1781)), baseline levels were always consistent, while stress-induced levels were significantly higher in the Rockhopper Penguin only. © Published by NRC Research Press 2015.

ABSTRACT: Sex identification is a fundamental work for studying the behavioural ecology in animals. Although recent molecular sexing techniques have enabled us to distinguish the sexes, it is still convenient to discriminate the sexes with morphological traits especially when surveying colonial animals under harsh field conditions. For chinstrap and gentoo penguins in Antarctica, previous studies developed several morphological discriminant functions, but many studies did not adopt molecular sexing methods for deciding sexes. In this study, we tested previous morphology-based sexing methods to determine their applicability to adult chinstrap and gentoo penguins breeding at Narębski Point (Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 171) in Barton Peninsula on King George Island. Furthermore, we aimed to develop alternative morphological features to reliably discriminate penguin sexes. Our results showed that the accuracies of previously suggested functions varied among discriminant functions in both species (approximately 64–82%). Here, we developed new functions to discriminate sexes in chinstrap and gentoo penguins, using bill and middle toe size which are easily acquired and less error-prone. The classification accuracy of the discriminant functions derived in this study was >90% for both species. Also, it was successfully applicable to another chinstrap population. © 2015, © 2015 Korean Society for Integrative Biology.

ABSTRACT: Body size, mass and condition can affect an organism's ability to cope with variation in resource availability or metabolic demand, particularly as juveniles reach independence. It follows that changes to parental provisioning efficiency (size and frequency of meals) through intraspecific competition or environmental conditions that affect prey availability may affect chick size, mass and condition and ultimately post-fledging survival. We examined how Adélie penguin chick size, mass and condition varied among colonies of different sizes on Ross Island during a 15 yr period of high environmental variability and varying intraspecific competition. Aiding the study was a natural experiment in which the presence of 2 giant icebergs midway through the study abnormally increased sea ice concentration (SIC), altering adults' access to food. Concurrently, the colonies were rapidly increasing in size; based on previous work, this indicated increased trophic competition near colonies, a trend likely indicating a changing food web in the greater region. Results showed that increased amounts of sea ice, which reduced the ability of adults to access food, had a negative effect on the size and mass of chicks. However, a greater proportion of fish (vs. krill) in the diet had a positive effect on chick size. Moreover, in some cases, increased intraspecific competition may be a more important driver of provisioning rate and chick size than abiotic factors, with chicks showing the effects of reduced food delivery at larger colonies. Understanding these patterns will allow better understanding of how factors such as climate change and altered food webs may affect Adélie penguin populations. © Inter-Research 2015.

ABSTRACT: Changes in penguin abundance and distribution can be used to understand the response of species to climate change and fisheries pressures, and as a gauge of ecosystem health. Traditionally, population estimates have involved direct counts, but remote sensing and digital mapping methodologies can provide us with alternative techniques for assessing the size and distribution of penguin populations. Here, we demonstrate the use of a field-based digital mapping system (DMS), combining a handheld geographic information system with integrated geographical positioning system as a method for: (a) assessing penguin colony area and (b) ground-truthing colony area as derived from satellite imagery. Work took place at Signy Island, South Orkneys, where colonies of the three congeneric pygoscelid penguins: Adélie Pygoscelis adeliae, chinstrap P. antarctica and gentoo P. papua were surveyed. Colony areas were derived by mapping colony boundaries using the DMS with visual counts of the number of nesting birds made concurrently. Area was found to be a good predictor for number of nests for all three species of penguin. Using a maximum likelihood multivariate classification of remotely sensed satellite imagery (QuickBird2, 18 January 2010; Digital Globe ID: 01001000B90AD00), we were able to identify penguin colonies from the spectral signature of guano and differentiate between colonies of Adélie and chinstrap penguins. The area classified (all species combined) from satellite imagery versus area from DMS data was closely related (R2 = 0.88). Combining these techniques gives a simple and transferrable methodology for examining penguin distribution and abundance at local and regional scales. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) usually arrive in poor body conditions at Brazilian beaches during the winter. Hematology provides valuable information about clinical and immunity status of the animals. The aims of this study were to determine the hematologic, total plasma protein (TPP) and fibrinogen profiles of young and adult magellanic penguins in PROAMAR and CETAS-SC, relating these results with the state of health and survival possibility of the animals. In Paraná 14 animals were evaluated in pre and eight in post-rehabilitation and 29 animals were evaluated in Santa Catarina after rehabilitation. Before rehabilitation, all animals showed weakness. In hematological exams of these animals, we found that anemia was present in 83% of the penguins that died and 50% of those which survived. The heterophils/lymphocytes (H/L) ratio was 3.87±0.57 in animals that died, significantly higher than the average of 2.20±0.30 for animals that survived. These two parameters are useful to assess the survival possibility of animals to rehabilitation. The body condition score was positively correlated with hematocrit and TPP, and negatively correlated with H/L ratio. After rehabilitation, the values were similar to other animals of the family Spheniscidae, with averages ranging from 1.64 to 1.90x106 erythrocytes/μL; 43.38 to 48.80% of hematocrit; 12.45 to 13.52g/dL of hemoglobin; 8,684 to 14,011 leukocytes/ μL; 4,767 to 8,041 heterophils/μL; 3,215 to 4,951 lymphocytes/μL; 95 to 655 eosinophils/ μl; 179.8 to 277.9 monocytes/μL; 141 to 184.9 basophils/μL; and 1.26 to 1.74 of H/L ratio. These parameters can therefore be used as reference values and release parameters for young and adult Magellanic penguins in captivity on the rehabilitation centers.

ABSTRACT: Penguin colonies are highly visited worldwide. Although several studies have addressed how penguins behaviorally respond to tourist visitation at a point in time, nothing is known about their response across the entire breeding season. Furthermore, behavioral responses are driven by complex physiological processes and the basal physiological state of the individual might affect the way it responds to stimuli. To test the hypothesis that annual changes in corticosterone result from animals having different requirements for expressing (or not) the glucocorticoid-mediated behaviors at different times of the year in the context of tourist visitation, we examined circulating and stress-induced corticosterone in Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) from non-visited areas from the San Lorenzo colony, Peninsula Valdes, Argentina across the breeding season. We also examined the behavioral responses of penguins to a pedestrian approach in tourist-visited and non-visited areas of the colony across the season. Our results showed that circulating levels of corticosterone did not vary across the season; however, stress-induced corticosterone was lowest during molt. Our behavioral results showed that penguins displayed different behavior responses at varying distances depending on the area (visited or non-visited) and stage in the season. Penguins in the tourist area were more tolerant to a human approach than penguins in the non-tourist area. During settlement and molt, penguins showed higher occurrence of behaviors related to self-survival (such as standing, moving farther into the nest, and fleeing), whereas during incubation and chick rearing, penguins displayed mostly a behavior associated with defense and vigilance (such as alternate head turns). Furthermore, penguins allowed a closer approach during incubation, but elicited a subsequent behavior quicker than in the rest of the stages, suggesting that they would be particularly sensitive in this stage. Overall, our results suggest that corticosterone release across the season is more associated with penguins' survival in an extreme environment than with behavioral regulation. From a conservation perspective, we identified that penguins were more sensitive to human approach during incubation, but also molt should be considered as a vulnerable stage because corticosterone secretion is suppressed. © 2014 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2014.

ABSTRACT: The rate of vocalisations in Little Penguin Eudyptula minor was documented to determine whether human presence (handling of penguins), gender and weight influenced vocal production. Observations were conducted during volunteer research nights and a total of 50 penguins were studied at the St Kilda penguin colony. Focal individual penguins were observed for vocal rate continuously within 1 minute focal scans. Rates of vocalisations were documented as rate of vocalisation per penguin and correlated with capture experience, gender and weight. Rates of vocalisation were significantly influenced by capture experience and handling time and suggest vocalisations may be used as a gauge to assess impact (e.g. human presence) across time in avian tourism settings. Levels of tolerance (reducing or ceasing to respond to the stimulus) may be indicative of habituation and such data could be valuable for the management of avian tourism. © 2014, Field Naturalists Club of Victoria.

ABSTRACT: Feeding strategies can affect the balance between the production of reactive oxygen species and antioxidant defences (i.e. oxidative status). This is ecologically relevant, as variation in oxidative status can in turn strongly affect fitness. However, how animals regulate their oxidative status through their feeding behaviour under natural conditions remains poorly understood. Thus, relating the isotopic values of free-ranging animals to their oxidative status may prove useful. Here, we considered three colonies of gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) in which we measured (1) δ13C and δ15N values, and (2) antioxidant defences and oxidative damage. We found that colonies with the highest δ13C and δ15N values also had the highest levels of antioxidant defences and oxidative damage, resulting in positive relationships between isotopic values and markers of oxidative status. As a result, colony segregation in terms of isotopic values was reflected by segregation in terms of oxidative markers (although more markedly for oxidative damage than for antioxidant defences). Interestingly, variation in the estimated contribution of krill in the diet of penguins followed an opposite pattern to that observed for markers of oxidative status, providing evidence that inter-population differences in terms of foraging strategies can result in inter-population differences in terms of oxidative status. More studies examining simultaneously oxidative status, isotopic signature, foraging behaviour and food allocation between parents and young are, however, needed to understand better the interplay between the foraging strategies adopted by animals in their natural habitat and their oxidative status. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Research in to short-term cardio-respiratory changes in animals in reaction to a psychological stressor typically describes increases in rate of oxygen consumption () and heart rate. Consequently, the broad consensus is that they represent a fundamental stressor response generalizable across adult species. However, movement levels can also change in the presence of a stressor, yet studies have not accounted for this possible confound on heart rate. Thus the direct effects of psychological stressors on the cardio-respiratory system are not resolved. We used an innovative experimental design employing accelerometers attached to king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) to measure and thus account for movement levels in a sedentary yet free-to-move animal model during a repeated measures stress experiment. As with previous studies on other species, incubating king penguins (N=6) exhibited significant increases in both and heart rate when exposed to the stressor. However, movement levels, while still low, also increased in response to the stressor. Once this was accounted for by comparing periods of time during the control and stress conditions when movement levels were similar as recorded by the accelerometers, only significantly increased; there was no change in heart rate. These findings offer evidence that changing movement levels have an important effect on the measured stress response and that the cardio-respiratory response per se to a psychological stressor (i.e. the response as a result of physiological changes directly attributable to the stressor) is an increase in without an increase in heart rate. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

ABSTRACT: We studied the influence of marine resources during a year of abundance and another of extreme scarcity, on sexually selected ornaments of the king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus), a seabird with striking coloured ornaments in both sexes. Displaying birds started their breeding cycle with similar mean body mass each year, but both sexes had significantly larger yellow/orange auricular patches in the year of abundant resources. Colours of the auricular patches and breast were more pure in the good year, and both UV and yellow/orange colours of beak spots were brighter. Comparison of the mating process suggested lower levels of choosiness in both sexes during the unfavourable year, perhaps in order to pair more quickly and partly compensate for a marked delay in breeding initiation. Our results suggest that the expression of sexual traits may substantially vary under different environmental conditions, a predication of some models of mate choice and sexual selection. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2015.

ABSTRACT: An aquarium-housed, 6-mo-old African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) presented with acute respiratory distress. Auscultation revealed a grade II-III systolic murmur in the absence of adventitial sounds, and an enlarged heart without pulmonary edema was seen radiographically. Echocardiographic evaluation revealed atrioventricular (AV) valvular dysplasia and ventricular enlargement. The penguin was treated with enalapril, furosemide, and pimobendan but died within 3 wk of detection of the murmur. Congenital dysplasia of the right AV valve with right atrial and ventricular dilation and ventricular hypertrophy were diagnosed on postmortem examination. © Copyright 2014 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: We report on the first global census of the Adélie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae), achieved using a combination of ground counts and satellite imagery, and find a breeding population 53% larger (3.79 million breeding pairs) than the last estimate in 1993. We provide the first abundance estimates for 41 previously unsurveyed colonies, which collectively contain 420,000 breeding pairs, and report on 17 previously unknown colonies, 11 of which may be recent colonizations. These recent colonizations represent ∼5% of the increase in known breeding population and provide insight into the ability of these highly philopatric seabirds to colonize new breeding territories. Additionally, we report on 13 colonies not found in the survey, including 8 that we conclude have gone extinct. We find that Adélie Penguin declines on the Antarctic Peninsula are more than offset by increases in East Antarctica. Our global population assessment provides a robust baseline for understanding future changes in abundance and distribution. These results are a critically needed contribution to ongoing negotiations regarding the design and implementation of Marine Protected Areas for the Southern Ocean.

ABSTRACT: Long-term population monitoring has become an important tool for conservation management and indicator of environmental change. In many species nest counts are used as an index of population numbers. A pilot study using double-counts in Fiordland crested penguins (Eudyptes pachyrhynchus) found that up to 12% of nests had failed following the first count, raising concerns about search-related disturbance effects and the reliability of long-term monitoring data. Here, we assess the impact of nest counts, and provide recommendations on how to reduce human disturbance effects during nest searches. In 2011, miniature temperature loggers (iButtons) were deployed into 120 nests to quantify temporary and permanent nest abandonment. Observations at nest sites allowed subsequent analysis of a range of factors potentially affecting penguin disturbance responses. In almost a third of all nests both first and second searches caused temporary nest abandonment that lasted up to 4.5 h, creating considerable predation opportunities. To reduce the likelihood of nest abandonment, counts are best conducted during the second half of the incubation period when nests are attended by single, wellestablished adults. Steep nesting areas proved suboptimal for long-term monitoring. Actual nest failure rates were low in 2011 (about 2% per search) and not all failures were immediately related to search disturbance. Hence, double-counts may be used in Fiordland crested penguins to improve nest count reliability as long as predation pressure is low and field protocols are adapted to minimise disturbance impact of nest searches. We show that well-designed research projects can inform and improve management decisions. For gathering reliable long-term population data, we encourage the reassessment of best-practice protocols to minimise monitoringrelated disturbance effects. © New Zealand Ecological Society.

ABSTRACT: During the years 2009–2012, faeces of African penguins (Spheniscus demersus L.) from South African rehabilitation centres were examined for helminths. In total, 46 out 555 samples (8.29 %), mostly belonging to adult birds, were found to contain oval schistosome eggs with a spine on one pole. Their dimensions were 153.21 ± 9.07 × 87.14 ± 8.67 μm. Selected DNA fragments (18S, 28S and ITS rDNA) were sequenced and compared to other schistosome isolates deposited in GenBank. The shape of the eggs suggests that they belong to the genus Gigantobilharzia; however, due to the insufficient stage of knowledge of the genus and limited number of species available for comparison, we were not able to assign the isolate unambiguously to this genus based on either the egg morphology or the results of molecular analysis. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Since the mid-1980s, observations of marine animals with alopecia have been reported worldwide, although in most cases specific causes and consequences have not been elucidated. Adding to that list, an unprecedented feather loss condition affecting ∼1 in 1000 adult Adelie penguins was observed at the beginning of December 2011 at each of three colonies on Ross Island, Antarctica. Feather loss was again observed in 2012-13 and 2013-14. The condition was characterised by irregular patches of bare skin on various parts of the body well before the usual period of moult. Blood samples, plucked feathers and cloacal swabs were obtained to investigate the cause or causes of this abnormal loss of feathers. No ectoparasites were detected on physical inspection of any birds or by scanning electron microscopy of feathers removed from birds experiencing feather loss. Blood smears were negative for hemoparasites. There was statistical support for mild lymphocytosis and moderate basophilia from the results of white blood-cell differentials in penguins with feather loss compared with those with no feather loss. Blood samples were negative to a PCR diagnostic specific for beak and feather disease virus. Three new putative RNA viruses were detected by high-throughput sequencing of cloacal samples, showing similarity to rotaviruses, astroviruses and picornaviruses. Although the significance of these viruses is not known, extended investigation into this feather loss condition is needed.

ABSTRACT: We investigated life history responses to extreme variation in physical environmental conditions during a long-term demographic study of Adélie penguins at 3 colonies representing 9% of the world population and the full range of breeding colony sizes. Five years into the 14-year study (1997-2010) two very large icebergs (spanning 1.5 latitude degrees in length) grounded in waters adjacent to breeding colonies, dramatically altering environmental conditions during 2001-2005. This natural experiment allowed us to evaluate the relative impacts of expected long-term, but also extreme, short-term climate perturbations on important natural history parameters that can regulate populations. The icebergs presented physical barriers, not just to the penguins but to polynya formation, which profoundly increased foraging effort and movement rates, while reducing breeding propensity and productivity, especially at the smallest colony. We evaluated the effect of a variety of environmental parameters during breeding, molt, migration and wintering periods during years with and without icebergs on penguin breeding productivity, chick mass, and nesting chronology. The icebergs had far more influence on the natural history parameters of penguins than any of the other environmental variables measured, resulting in population level changes to metrics of reproductive performance, including delays in nesting chronology, depressed breeding productivity, and lower chick mass. These effects were strongest at the smallest, southern-most colony, which was most affected by alteration of the Ross Sea Polynya during years the iceberg was present. Additionally, chick mass was negatively correlated with colony size, supporting previous findings indicating density-dependent energetic constraints at the largest colony. Understanding the negative effects of the icebergs on the short-term natural history of Adélie penguins, as well as their response to long-term environmental variation, are important to our overall understanding of climate change effects in this and other species facing both rapid and persistent environmental change. © 2014 Dugger, Ballard, Ainley, Lyver and Schine.

ABSTRACT: The wide geographic distribution of penguins (Order Sphenisciformes) throughout the Southern Hemisphere provided a unique opportunity to use a single taxonomic group as biomonitors of mercury among geographically distinct marine ecosystems. Mercury concentrations were compared among ten species of penguins representing 26 geographically distinct breeding populations. Mercury concentrations were relatively low (≤2.00. ppm) in feathers from 18/26 populations considered. Population-level differences in trophic level explained variation in mercury concentrations among Little, King, and Gentoo penguin populations. However, Southern Rockhopper and Magellanic penguins breeding on Staten Island, Tierra del Fuego, had the highest mercury concentrations relative to their conspecifics despite foraging at a lower trophic level. The concurrent use of stable isotope and mercury data allowed us to document penguin populations at the greatest risk of exposure to harmful concentrations of mercury as a result of foraging at a high trophic level or in geographic 'hot spots' of mercury availability. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Physiologically demanding and energetically expensive life-events, such as incubation, chick-rearing and moult, may cause a trade-off with costly immune defences and, in turn, decrease immune function. We examined innate immunity in Little Penguins (Eudyptula minor) during the physiologically demanding periods of incubation, chick-guarding, chick-rearing and moult using a bacterial-killing assay and white blood-cell counts. The capacity of individuals to kill Escherichia coli varied significantly in relation to life-stage, with bacterial killing significantly higher during incubation compared with late chick-rearing, the most energetically expensive period in the annual cycle of Little Penguins. The elevated bacterial-killing capacity during nesting stages could be particularly beneficial for protection from the presumed high pathogen (bacterial) loads in nests. However, this relationship remains to be tested. Counts of white blood cells varied during breeding but were significantly higher in chicks compared to adults during guarding and post-guarding stages, and significantly higher at the end of moult compared to all other stages, which could indicate inflammation from infection, or dehydration. These results suggest that immune function may be adversely affected during energetically demanding life-stages but may also offer protection from bacteria encountered in the nesting environment.

ABSTRACT: The present study estimated hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) as a sum of three main isomers (α, β, and γ) and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) in African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) from Gdansk Zoo and in their sole food, Baltic herring (Clupea harengus), from Gdansk Bay. The average concentration of HBCD in whole herring was 22.0 ± 9.9 ng/g lw, whereas TBBPA was approximately 10-fold lower (2.3 ± 1.3 ng/g lw). Brominated flame retardants (BFRs) were also found in muscle and liver of herring. The estimated daily dietary exposure of the penguins to HBCD was 252.9 ± 113.7 ng, whereas for TBBPA it was 26.3 ± 14.9 ng. The ability of BFRs to accumulate in the liver, muscles, fatty tissue, and brain of penguin was confirmed. The highest concentrations of HBCD (326.9 ng·g-1 lw) and TBBPA (14.8 ng·g-1 lw) were found in the brain of an adult penguin. The strongest accumulation factor for BFRs was also established for brain tissue, but it showed stronger magnification in muscle than in liver. HBCD and TBBPA were found in penguin guano and eggs, thus showing effective removal from the birds' systems. BFRs content in yolk was approximately ten times greater than in albumen indicating the lipophilic character of these compounds. © 2014 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Summary: Newcastle disease is a contagious and often fatal disease, capable of affecting all species of birds. A velogenic Newcastle disease virus (vNDV) outbreak occurred in an Israeli zoo, in which Little owls (Athene noctua) and African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) were found positive for presence of NDV. Some of them have died. The diagnostic process included: post-mortem examination, histopathology, real-time RT-PCR assay, virus isolation, serology, intracerebral pathogenicity index and phylogenetic analysis. A vNDV was diagnosed and found to be closely related to isolates from vNDV outbreaks that occurred in commercial poultry flocks during 2011. All isolates were classified as lineage 5d. © 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

ABSTRACT: Identifying marine features that support high foraging performance of predators is useful to determine areas of ecological importance. This study aimed to identify marine features that are important for foraging of chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarcticus), an abundant upper-trophic level predator in the Antarctic Peninsula region. We investigated the foraging locations of penguins breeding on King George Island using GPS-depth loggers. Tracking data from 18 birds (4232 dives), 11 birds (2095 dives), and 19 birds (3947 dives) were obtained in 2007, 2010, and 2015, respectively. In all three years, penguins frequently visited an area near a seamount (Orca Seamount) in Bransfield Strait. The percentage of dives (27.8% in 2007, 36.1% in 2010, and 19.1% in 2015) and depth wiggles (27.1% in 2007, 37.2% in 2010, and 22.3% in 2015) performed in this area was higher than that expected from the size of the area and distance from the colony (8.4% for 2007, 14.7% for 2010, and 6.3% for 2015). Stomach content analysis showed that the penguins fed mainly on Antarctic krill. These results suggest that the seamount provided a favorable foraging area for breeding chinstrap penguins, with high availability of Antarctic krill, possibly related to local upwelling. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR.

ABSTRACT: Foraging site fidelity has profound consequences for individual fitness, population processes and the effectiveness of species conservation measures. Accordingly, quantifying site fidelity has become increasingly important in animal movement and habitat selection studies. To assess foraging site fidelity in king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) breeding at the Falkland Islands (51.48°S, 57.83°W), we measured overlap in time spent in foraging areas (at a 0.1° × 0.1° grid resolution) between successive foraging trips and foraging route consistency during the crèche period. In total, 30 complete foraging trips from seven king penguins were recorded between April and October 2010. King penguins predominantly foraged on the highly productive Patagonian slope, to the north of the Falkland Islands [median foraging trip distance 213 km (SD = 215 km) and duration 12.8 days (SD = 14.7 days)]. Overlap in time spent in an area on consecutive foraging trips ranged between 2 and 73 % (mean 27 %, SD = 22 %). Bearing during the outbound portion of foraging trips was typically highly repeatable for individual birds, but foraging trip duration and distance were not. Travel during the outbound phase of foraging trips was consistent with the direction of the northward-flowing Falkland Current that may act as a directional cue or facilitate rapid transit to foraging areas. Flexibility in foraging trip distances and durations may be a response to changes in resource availability and changes in the energetic requirements of adults and chicks over an extended breeding cycle. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Fault transmissibility derived from lateral connectivity between compartments and changes with depletion was recognised as key subsurface uncertainty in the field. Therefore, structural logging and analyses (fault tip extensions), microstructural and petrophysical property analyses were carried out on cores obtained from 2 wells in the field, in order to assess their impacts on hydrocarbon recovery. Results of the sub-seismic fault characterisation and structural analyses were integrated into a structural modelling and dynamic fault seal project to aid in understanding current production behaviour, and predict possible infill locations. The modelling effort involved using the Petrel 3D Static reservoir models, underpinned by measured fault properties from Rock Deformation Research (RDR, 2000) on Brent and Triassic reservoirs. The result of this work showed that majority of the faults will act as strong baffles in production timescale, however, low, base and high fault permeability and thickness parameters were selected for dynamic simulations. Dynamic simulation sensitivities carried out with the range of potential fault properties bracketed the historical production behaviour observed in the field. Using the historically observed data (production, pressures) the uncertainty ranges for the fault properties were constrained and a suite of history matched models created to allow optimisation of potential infill wells.

ABSTRACT: The food-borne bacterial gastrointestinal infection is a serious public health threat. Defensins are evolutionarily conserved innate immune components with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity that do not easily induce resistance. AvBD103b, an avian defensin with potent activity against Salmonella enteritidis, was isolated from the stomach contents of the king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus). To elucidate further the antibacterial mechanism of AvBD103b, its effect on the S. enteritidis CVCC3377 cell membrane and intracellular DNA was researched. The cell surface hydrophobicity and a N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine uptake assay demonstrated that AvBD103b treatment increased the cell surface hydrophobicity and outer membrane permeability. Atomic absorption spectrometry, ultraviolet spectrophotometry, flow cytometry, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicated that AvBD103b treatment can lead to the release of the cellular contents and cell death through damage of the membrane. DNA gel retardation and circular dichroism analysis demonstrated that AvBD103b interacted with DNA and intercalated into the DNA base pairs. A cell cycle assay demonstrated that AvBD103b affected cellular functions, such as DNA synthesis. Our results confirmed that AvBD103b exerts its antibacterial activity by damaging the cell membrane and interfering with intracellular DNA, ultimately causing cell death, and suggested that AvBD103b may be a promising candidate as an alternative to antibiotics against S. enteritidis. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Knowledge of seabirds’ diet at each breeding site and its temporal variation is key to understanding and evaluating how changes in marine resources affect each seabird population. In this study, we determined the diet of Magellanic penguins (MP, Spheniscus magellanicus) at Martillo Island, accounting for sex, breeding stage and year. We analyzed a total of 144 stomach contents during three consecutive breeding seasons (2006–2007, 2007–2008 and 2008–2009) and stages (incubation, early and late chick-rearing). MP fed mainly on fuegian sprat (Sprattus fuegensis), which represented 75 % of the biomass consumed by birds during the entire study. The next important prey was squat lobster (Munida gregaria), followed by Patagonian squid (Loligo gahi). Both sexes consumed similar prey items. We observed variation in diet relative composition among breeding years and stages. Fuegian sprat consumption decreased throughout the years whereas squat lobster increased. Penguins consumed a higher proportion of squat lobster and Patagonian squid during the incubation stage than in the chick-rearing stages, whereas fuegian sprat was almost the only prey item consumed during the late chick-rearing stage. MPs show certain flexibility in the use of resources probably as a response to changes in prey populations. Variability in the diet among different reproductive stages could be related to changes in the distribution and abundance of their main prey near the colony during the breeding season together with changes in the energy requirements of seabirds. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: The energetic costs of animal movement change with body condition, although the consequences of this for foraging efficiency are rarely considered. We deployed externally attached devices to Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus), known to increase the costs of swimming via increased drag in a consistent manner, and noted, however, that foraging behaviour and efficiency varied dramatically between years. We used our results to construct an energetics-based model and found that small increases in drag due to the attachment of externally attached tags predicted accelerating harm as prey availability decreased, which accorded with our observations. This explains earlier observations of differential breeding success in tagged versus untagged penguins in particular years, highlights the importance of understanding how animal body condition may affect population processes in general and advocates caution in interpretations of tag-derived data over variable environmental conditions. © 2015 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare.

ABSTRACT: There is growing evidence that during the past 100 years the climate of the Antarctic Peninsula has changed from a relatively cold environment to an increasingly warmer one. The penguins that breed in the region are sensitive to oceanographic environmental and climatic conditions. They are considered the bellwether sentinels of the ocean because of their sensitivity to environmental changes. The present study aimed to determine the evolutionary history of the Gentoo Penguin (Pygoscelis papua) and Adélie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) at Admiralty Bay, King George Island. A population genetics approach was used to examine the genetic variability of the two penguin species, searching to infer their demographics histories. The D-loop region from the mitochondrial DNA was sequenced in Adélie (n = 53) and Gentoo (n = 29) penguins. These species showed high genetic diversity, reflecting a large ancestral population size. The results also revealed that the Gentoo Penguin has had a stable population over the last 500,000 years, whereas Adélie Penguins showed a signal of population expansion estimated to have occurred between 300,000 to 400,000 years ago. Results indicate that penguin species respond differently to climate change and that Adélie Penguins are more sensitive to such changes. High genetic diversity and stability of the populations in recent centuries could be important for predicting the response to future events.

ABSTRACT: Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) predict changes in the sea ice environment and in atmospheric precipitations over larger areas of Antarctica. These changes are expected to affect the population dynamics of seabirds and marine mammals, but the extent of this influence is not clear. We investigated the future population trajectories of the colony of Adélie penguins at Edmonson Point, in the Ross Sea, from 2010 to 2100. To do so, we incorporated the relationship between sea ice and demographic parameters of the studied colony into a matrix population model. Specifically, we used sea ice projections from AOGCMs and a proxy for snowfall precipitation. Simulations of population persistence under future climate change scenarios showed that a reduction in sea ice extent (SIE) and an increase in precipitation events during the breeding season will drive the population to extinction. However, the population growth rate estimated by the model was lower than the population growth rate observed during the last decades, suggesting that recruits from other colonies maintain the observed population dynamics at Edmonson Point. This local "rescue" effect is consistent with a metapopulation dynamic for Adélie penguins in the Ross Sea, in which neighboring colonies might exhibit contrasting population trends and different density-dependent effects. In the hypothesis that connectivity with larger source colonies or that local recruitment would decrease, the sink colony at Edmonson Point is predicted to disappear. © 2015 Ballerini, Tavecchia, Pezzo, Jenouvrier and Olmastroni.

ABSTRACT: Competition for food resources can result in spatial and dietary segregation among individuals from the same species. Few studies have looked at such segregations with the combined effect of sex and age in species with short foraging ranges. In this study we examined the 3D spatial use of the environment in a species with a limited foraging area. We equipped 26 little penguins (Eudyptula minor) of known age, sex, and breeding output with GPS (location) and accelerometer (body acceleration and dive depth) loggers. We obtained dietary niche information from the isotopic analysis of blood tissue. We controlled for confounding factors of foraging trip length and food availability by sampling adults at guard stage when parents usually make one-day trips. We observed a spatial segregation between old (>11 years old) and middle-aged penguins (between 5 and 11 years old) in the foraging area. Old penguins foraged closer to the shore, in shallower water. Despite observing age-specific spatial segregation, we found no differences in the diving effort and foraging efficiency between age classes and sexes. Birds appeared to target similar prey types, but showed age-specific variation in their isotopic niche width. We hypothesize that this age-specific segregation was primarily determined by a “cohort effect” that would lead individuals sharing a common life history (i.e. having fledged and dispersed around the same age) to forage preferentially together or to share similar foraging limitations. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Specialization is a common mechanism of niche differentiation that can lead to ecological co-existence among species. However, species with specialized habitat or dietary requirements often exhibit a high degree of sensitivity to environmental change. Understanding patterns of specialization and niche segregation among Antarctic marine predators is of increased importance because of recent climate-driven reductions in a key prey species, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. We examined the stomach contents and stable isotope values of sympatric chinstrap Pygoscelis antarctica and gentoo P. papua penguins across 5 breeding seasons at Cape Shirreff, Livingston Island, Antarctica. Our goal was to examine foraging niche segregation and the degree of specialization between species during the chick-rearing period. Dietary and isotopic foraging niches indicated consistent niche partitioning with higher krill consumption and greater use of offshore foraging habitats by chinstrap relative to gentoo penguins. While chinstrap penguin diets were dominated by krill with little variation, gentoo penguins exhibited broader dietary and isotopic niches with a higher degree of variation. There was little evidence that shifts in the availability of adult krill influenced penguin diets or foraging niches during our study, though the contrasting foraging strategies identified provide insight into the differing population trends observed between penguin species. The narrower foraging niche observed in declining chinstrap penguin populations indicates that they are likely highly sensitive to declines in the abundance of Antarctic krill. In contrast, the generalist niche exhibited by recently expanding gentoo penguin populations is likely better suited to the rapidly changing environmental conditions in the Antarctic Peninsula. © The authors 2015.

ABSTRACT: The penguin tetra (Thayeria boehlkei) is one of the most popular aquarium fish and belongs to the family of Characidae. The composition, phylogeny, and classification of this family are uncertain. Here, the complete mitogenome of T. boehlkei was reported to be 16, 524 bp in length. It contains 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA genes and 2 ribosomal RNA genes. Comparing the mitochondrial genome of T. boehlkei with its congener Astyanax mexicanus revealed high-sequence similarity. The mitochondrial genome of T. boehlkei will contribute to conservation studies and evolution analysis of Characidae family. © 2015 Informa UK Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) breeding population at Stranger Point, King George Island (25 de Mayo), increased in number from 1965/66 until 1980/81 after which it started to decrease almost continuously up to the present. A significant decrease in the number of breeding pairs and chicks crèched was observed between 1995/96 and 2013/14 (75% and 78%, respectively), although the rate of this decrease has slowed since 2006/07. Over the last seven years, larger interannual fluctuations were recorded in the number of breeding pairs and chicks in crèches, as well in the breeding success. The values for the index of breeding success during 2007/08, 2009/10 and 2012/13 were low and this parameter showed higher temporal fluctuation in the period 2007/08 to 2013/14. The reduction in breeding success and the number of chicks reared to crèche will unfavourably impact on future population size at Stranger Point through the reduction of new recruits. Although Adélie penguin population trends on the Antarctic Peninsula are linked to the marine environment variability (i.e. reduction in sea ice affecting the availability of prey), breeding success is also influenced by the amount of snow fall which has increased in recent years. © Antarctic Science Ltd 2015.

ABSTRACT: Most effects of environmental and climate variability on predator life history traits and population dynamics result from indirect effects mediated through the food chain. There is growing evidence that wind strength might affect seabirds while foraging at sea. Here, we investigated the effect of wind speed on the foraging performance of a flightless marine predator, the little penguin (Eudyptula minor). To this end, we used satellitederived wind data collected over 11 breeding seasons during which the daily attendance and body mass changes of more than 200 penguins breeding at Phillip Island (Victoria, Australia) were recorded by an automated penguin monitoring system. Over 17 363 foraging trips, we found that wind speed had important effects on foraging and provisioning parameters in breeding adults. During incubation and chick-guard, stronger winds were associated with decreased foraging efficiency (lower body mass gain). During chick-guard, stronger winds were furthermore associated with lower meal sizes provided to the chicks, but parental body reserves appeared unaffected. Under extreme wind conditions (>14 m/s) during the post-guard phase, adults maintained their body reserves by shifting towards longer foraging trips, while providing chicks with smaller meals. Chick meal size and foraging trip duration during chick rearing had direct effects on breeding success, suggesting that the influence of wind on individual fitness was mediated by changes in foraging performances and success. Furthermore, using a long-term wind data series spanning 150-yr from a coastal wind station, we found a slight decline in wind speed and a decrease in wind speed variability in the Bass Strait where little penguins forage. Interestingly, based on this wind data, we found birds to be more directly affected by punctual events of strong winds (e.g. storms or gales), than by an overall change in wind patterns over time. Potential candidate mechanisms mediating the effects of wind speed on foraging efficiency may include swell formation, energy costs of travelling and thermoregulation, and a possible disruption of thermoclines, which may be important for little penguins. Plasticity in foraging strategies allowed parents to partially compensate for negative wind effects. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.

ABSTRACT: Multiple studies have shown that human disturbance can have negative impacts on wild penguin populations. Penguins in zoos may also be susceptible to negative impacts from humans, but this has not previously been investigated. We examined the visitor effect on a group of 25 little penguins, Eudyptula minor, by randomly imposing two treatments: (1) no visitor contact, which was achieved by closing the penguin exhibit on study days and (2) exposure to visitors, with the penguin exhibit open as usual. Treatments were imposed for 1-day periods, with five replicates of each treatment (total of 10 study days). Instantaneous point sampling and continuous sampling were used to record penguin behaviour including proximity to visitor viewing area, surface swimming, diving, vigilance, visibility, resting and intra-group aggression during a total of 3 h on each of the 10 study days. When exposed to visitors, penguins showed increased levels of aggression (P = 0.02), huddling (P = 0.049) and behaviours indicative of avoidance of visitors including increased time spent positioned behind enclosure features (P = 0.024) and increased distance from the visitor viewing area (P = 0.002). These behavioural results suggest that the presence of visitors or some aspect of visitor behaviour may have been fear-provoking for these penguins. To generalize beyond this group of animals and this enclosure requires further research. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Global climate change requires species to adapt to increasing environmental variability, rising air and ocean temperatures and many other effects, including temperatureassociated phenological shifts. Species may adapt to such rapid changes by microevolutionary processes and/or phenotypic plasticity. The speed of microevolutionary adaptation may critically be enhanced by between-individual differences in phenotypic plasticity. However, such betweenindividual differences have rarely been shown, especially for long-lived and migratory species that appear particularly vulnerable to phenological shifts. Southern rockhopper penguins Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome are migratory, long-lived seabirds with a 'vulnerable' conservation status. We studied clutch initiation date (CID) and investment into egg mass in individually marked females in response to broad-scale and local climate variables across 7 yr. We thereby distinguished within-individual and between-individual variation and tested the existence of between-individual differences in the expression of phenotypic plasticity. Because of both within-individual and between-individual variation, CID was significantly advanced under high Southern Annular Mode (SAM), reflecting colder environmental conditions and higher food availability. Total clutch mass increased under low local sea surface temperatures (significant withinindividual effect) but was mostly accounted for by female identity. Intra-clutch egg-mass dimorphism was not affected by environmental variables at all. We found no indication of be tween-individual differences in phenotypic plasticity and overall, the expression of phenotypic plasticity appeared to be limited. This raises the question whether between-individual differences in phenotypic plasticity exist in other long-lived species and whether rockhopper penguins show sufficient phenotypic plasticity to adapt to predicted climate changes. © Inter-Research 2015, www.int-res.com.

ABSTRACT: The African Penguin population has drastically declined over the last 100. years. Changes in food availability due to over-fishing and other oceanographic changes seem to be major causes. However, it has also been 30. years since organic pollutants as a potential factor have been assessed. We analysed penguin eggs collected in 2011 and 2012 from two breeding colonies 640. km apart: Robben Island near Cape Town on the Atlantic Ocean coast, and Bird Island near Port Elizabeth on the Indian Ocean coast of South Africa. We quantified organochlorine pesticides, brominated flame retardants, and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs). Compared to 30. years ago, concentrations of σDDT have remained about the same or slightly lower, while σPCBs declined almost four-fold. The use of DDT in malaria control is unlikely to have contributed. PFCs were detected in all eggs. Indications (non-significant) of eggshell thinning associated with σDDT and σPCB was found. It seems therefore that the concentrations of measured organic pollutants the African Penguin eggs are not contributing directly to its current demise, but concerns remain about thinner shells and desiccation. Effects of combinations of compounds and newer compounds cannot be excluded, as well as more subtle effects on reproduction, development, and behaviour. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The hard tick Ixodes uriae parasitises a wide range of seabird species in the circumpolar areas of both Northern and Southern hemispheres and has been shown to be infected with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, the bacterial agents of Lyme borreliosis. Although it is assumed that seabirds represent viable reservoir hosts, direct demonstrations of infection are limited to a single study from the Northern hemisphere. Here, the blood of 50 tick-infested adult king penguins (. Aptenodytes patagonicus halli) breeding in the Crozet Archipelago (Southern Indian Ocean) was examined for B. burgdorferi sl exposure by serology and for spirochetemia by in vitro DNA amplification. Four birds were found positive by serology, whereas B. burgdorferi sl DNA was detected in two other birds. Our data therefore provide the first direct proof of Borrelia burgdorferi sl spirochetes in seabirds of the Southern hemisphere and indicate a possible reservoir role for king penguins in the natural maintenance of this bacterium. Although the bacterial genetic diversity present in these hosts and the infectious period for tick vectors remain to be elucidated, our results add to a growing body of knowledge on the contribution of seabirds to the complex epizootiology of Lyme disease and the global dissemination of B. burgdorferi sl spirochetes. © 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

ABSTRACT: Infectious diseases such as aspergillosis, avian malaria, and viral infections are significant threats to the conservation of penguins, leading to morbidity and mortality of these birds both in captivity and in the wild. The immune response to such infectious diseases is dependent on different mechanisms mediated by cells and soluble components such as antibodies. Antibodies or immunoglobulins are glycoproteins that have many structural and functional features that mediate distinct effector immune functions. Three distinct classes of antibodies have been identified in birds: immunoglobulin A (IgA), immunoglobulin M (IgM), and immunoglobulin Y (IgY). In this study we aim to establish an efficient laboratory method to obtain IgM and IgY antibodies from plasma samples of healthy adult Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus). The protocol was developed combining plasma delipidation, sequential precipitation with caprylic acid and ammonium sulfate, and size-exclusion chromatography. The efficiency of the protocol and the identity of the purified IgM and IgY antibodies were confirmed through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blotting, one-dimensional and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and lectin binding assay. Structural and physicochemical properties of IgM and IgY from Magellanic penguins were consistent with those of other avian species. This purification protocol will allow for more detailed studies on the humoral immunity of penguins and for the development of high specificity serologic assays to test Magellanic penguins for infectious pathogens. © American Association of Avian Pathologists.

ABSTRACT: We conducted annual counts of moulting Humboldt Penguins roosting on the mainland coast and on offshore islands in north and central Chile during 1999–2008. The census area included the known major breeding colonies in Chile, where many penguins moult, as well as other sites. Population size was relatively stable across years, with an average of 33 384 SD 2 372 (range: 28 642–35 284) penguins counted, but the number of penguins found at any individual site could vary widely. Shifting penguin numbers suggest that penguins tend to aggregate to moult where food is abundant. While many of the major breeding sites are afforded some form of protected status, two sites with sizable penguin populations, Tilgo Island and Pájaros-1 Island, have no official protection. These census results provide a basis upon which future population trends can be compared. © 2015, Marine Ornithology. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: An important scientific question in ecology is how to differentiate males from females that have similar morphology. In penguins, due to their monomorphic plumage, it is difficult to determine gender. So far, most approaches to address this problem have focused on using sex based discriminant functions combined with DNA based tools as a validation method. As discriminant functions can be species and locality specific, in this study we explored the feasibility of using flow cytometry to determine the sex of two species of penguins, Pygoscelis antarctica and Pygoscelis papua. Our results for sex assessment determined by flow cytometry were compared with those obtained using morphological characters (bill length and depth), and DNA based methods (using the PL/PR primer pair) were used to validate both approaches. For both species, statistically significant differences were observed between males and females, with males presenting on average 2.1% more nuclear DNA than females. Flow cytometry enabled similar or better rates of correct sex assignment (86.4% and 80.0%) than sex discriminant functions (31.8% and 90.0%) for P. antarctica and P. papua, respectively, and thus may be considered as a promising alternative to the use of morphological data for sex identification. Nevertheless, some individuals with intermediate genome size values were observed, which increased the difficulty of categorically assigning their sex. Therefore, flow cytometry alone cannot be considered in all cases, but if used together with DNA-based methods in targeted samples, it can be used to efficiently estimate the gender of, at least, these two penguin species, with the potential to be used in other species. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The order Sphenisciformes consists of 18 species representing six genera. Penguins are flightless birds that possess highly specialized anatomical and physiological features suitable for their pelagic lifestyle. Most penguin species may be captured by hand. Penguins are relatively robust and can tolerate periods of restraint for noninvasive procedures; however, procedures must be planned so that they are performed quickly and efficiently, in order to reduce the risk of development of hyperthermia. The medial metatarsal vein is easily accessible in penguins, but may be small, and the wound site is easily contaminated by fecal pathogens from unsanitary conditions in a rookery. This chapter discusses techinques for endotracheal intubation, and explains preanesthetic considerations. Inhalation anesthesia, using isoflurane or sevoflurane, is frequently used for induction and maintenance in penguins. The chapter describes conditions to be monitored under anesthesia. Gaseous anesthetic agents generally result in a more rapid recovery from anesthesia than injectable agents. © 2014 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Background: Bumblefoot, referring to bed-sore-like foot lesions, is one of the most important clinical complications in captive birds and has a multifactorial etiology. Photodynamic therapy has been proposed as an alternative treatment for localized infections in response to the escalating problem of antibiotic resistance. The aim of this study was to compare outcomes in a group of captive Spheniscus magellanicus with bumblefoot lesions treated with photodynamic therapy (PDT) or antibiotics (ATB). Methods: Ten captive Magellanic penguins with preexisting stage III bumblefoot lesions were selected and randomly divided into one PDT and one ATB group, each including 11 pelvic-limb lesions. All animals underwent surgical debridement of lesions. In the ATB group, antibiotic ointment was applied topically three times a week, and systemic antibiotic and anti-inflammatory drugs were administered daily. In the PDT group, photodynamic therapy was applied three times a week without the use of topical or systemic medication. Lesion areas were photographed, and swabs were collected for culture and sensitivity, on the first day and every 14 days for a total of 84 days. The four species of bacteria showing the most resistance to the antibiotics screened on the antibiogram were used to determine resistance to PDT with an in vitro test. Results: There were significant differences in healing rate and average healing time between the PDT and ATB groups (63.62% vs. 9.09% and 42 vs. 70 days, respectively). Conclusion: The findings of this study attest to the effectiveness of photodynamic therapy for the treatment of stage III bumblefoot in Spheniscus magellanicus. © 2015 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarcticus) show little sexual dimorphism and sexing by direct observation can be difficult. Through molecular techniques, male and female adults were identified at Stinker Point, Elephant Island, South Shetland Islands, in the 2011-12 and 2012-13 breeding seasons. In the assessment of sexual dimorphism using morphological characteristics, males were 6.0-9.4% larger than females. From the most significant morphological measurements, a discriminant function was formulated that classified 80.6% of the birds correctly. In addition, our data on bill length and depth were compared with those in the literature to evaluate sexual dimorphism between different breeding locations and to test the performance of the discriminant function. There were no differences in sexual dimorphism between breeding locations. However, the discriminant function should be used with caution because some penguins may be misclassified. Therefore, when there is doubt about the accuracy of morphometric approaches, application of molecular sexing techniques is recommended. © 2015 Antarctic Science Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Background: In the open ocean, eddies and associated structures (fronts, filaments) have strong influences on the foraging activities of top-predators through the enhancement and the distribution of marine productivity, zooplankton and fish communities. Investigating how central place foragers, such as penguins, find and use these physical structures is crucial to better understanding their at-sea distribution. In the present study, we compared the travel heading and speed of the world's most abundant penguin, the Macaroni penguin (Eudyptes chrysolophus), with the distribution of surface physical structures (large-scale fronts, eddies and filaments). Results: The study was performed during December 2012 in the Crozet Archipelago (46.42° S; 51.86° E), South Indian Ocean. Six males at incubation stage were equipped with GPS loggers to get their trajectories. We used Eulerian and Lagrangian methods to locate large-scale fronts, mesoscale eddies (10-100 km) and part of the sub-mesoscale structures (< 10 km, filaments) at the surface of the ocean. By comparing the positions of birds and these structures, we show that Macaroni penguins: i) target the sub Antarctic Front; ii) increase their foraging activity within a highly dynamic area, composed of eddy fields and filamentary structures; and iii) travel in the same direction as the predominant currents. Conclusions: We show that penguins adjust their travel speed and movement during their whole trips in relation with the oceanographic structures visited. At a large scale, we hypothesize that Macaroni penguins target the sub Antarctic Front to find profitable patches of their main prey. At finer scale, Macaroni penguin may adopt a horizontal drifting behavior in strong currents, which could be a way to minimize costs of displacement. © 2015 Bon et al.

ABSTRACT: It is established that haematological and biochemical parameters provide important data to assess the physiological condition and health status of wild birds. To undertake conservation physiology or ecophysiology work, it is therefore essential to establish baseline physiological parameters and how these parameters change with age and life history events. In this work, we determined and compared baseline haematology and serum biochemistry between adults and chicks of three Antarctic penguin species of the genus Pygoscelis: gentoo (P. papua), Adélie (P. adeliae) and chinstrap (P. antarcticus). Differences in adults among species were observed in haemoglobin and biochemical parameters such as total proteins, glucose and alkaline phosphatase activity. In addition, differences between adults and chicks in haematocrit, haemoglobin, total proteins and glucose concentration were determined. Moreover, we evaluated the electrophoretic protein profiles between adults and chicks of the genus Pygoscelis, and a conserved protein pattern was observed among species and ages in the genus. Altogether, the results suggest that biochemical and haematological differences among pygoscelids may be related to the nutritional status and energetic expenditure during breeding as well as their feeding habits and development stage. © 2015 A.E.

ABSTRACT: Compound-specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) of amino acids (AA) has rapidly become a powerful tool in studies of food web architecture, resource use, and biogeochemical cycling. However, applications to avian ecology have been limited because no controlled studies have examined the patterns in AA isotope fractionation in birds. We conducted a controlled CSIA feeding experiment on an avian species, the gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua), to examine patterns in individual AA carbon and nitrogen stable isotope fractionation between diet (D) and consumer (C) (Δ13CC-D and Δ15NC-D, respectively). We found that essential AA δ13C values and source AA δ15N values in feathers showed minimal trophic fractionation between diet and consumer, providing independent but complimentary archival proxies for primary producers and nitrogen sources respectively, at the base of food webs supporting penguins. Variations in nonessential AA Δ13CC-D values reflected differences in macromolecule sources used for biosynthesis (e.g., protein vs. lipids) and provided a metric to assess resource utilization. The avian-specific nitrogen trophic discrimination factor (TDFGlu-Phe = 3.5 ± 0.4‰) that we calculated from the difference in trophic fractionation (Δ15NC-D) of glutamic acid and phenylalanine was significantly lower than the conventional literature value of 7.6‰. Trophic positions of five species of wild penguins calculated using a multi-TDFGlu-Phe equation with the avian-specific TDFGlu-Phe value from our experiment provided estimates that were more ecologically realistic than estimates using a single TDFGlu-Phe of 7.6‰ from the previous literature. Our results provide a quantitative, mechanistic framework for the use of CSIA in nonlethal, archival feathers to study the movement and foraging ecology of avian consumers. Compound-specific stable isotope analysis of amino acids has rapidly become a powerful tool in studies of food web architecture, resource use, and biogeochemical cycling. We conducted a controlled feeding experiment on gentoo penguins to examine patterns in individual amino acid carbon and nitrogen isotope fractionation in non-lethal, archival feathers.

ABSTRACT: A morphologic and molecular epidemiologic investigation was conducted on a captive African black-footed penguin (Spheniscus demersus) colony with a history of Plasmodium infections at La Palmyre Zoo (France). Each penguin received 12.5 mg of pyrimethamine twice a week as a prophylaxis every year from April to November. Although Plasmodium parasites were not detected in blood smears and tissues collected from the penguins, various blood parasites were recorded in blood smears from wild Eurasian magpies (Pica pica) and carrion crows (Corvus corone) sampled at the same time in the study area. These parasites consisted of several Plasmodium spp. (P. lenoblei, P. dorsti, P. bioccai, P. relictum, P. dherteae, P. beaucournui, P. maior, P. tranieri, and P. snounoui), Parahaemoproteus spp., Trypanosoma spp., and Leucocytozoon spp. On the other hand, nested polymerase chain reaction enabled detection of Plasmodium DNA in 28/44 (64%) penguins, 15/25 (60%) magpies, and 4/9 (44%) crows. Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses indicated that the parasite DNA amplified from the penguins, magpies, and crows were similar. Magpies and crows could therefore act as a reservoir for penguin Plasmodium infections, which may be more prevalent than previously thought. Morphologic characterization of the Plasmodium spp. detected in the penguins, as well as further biological and epidemiologic studies, are needed to fully understand the transmission of Plasmodium parasites to captive penguins. © 2014 American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this work is to increase the information on trace metals in seabirds and coastal soils in the Antarctica. Concentrations (mg kg-1 dry weight) of Cd, Cu, Cr, Ni, Mn, Zn and Pb were determined by ICP-MS in fresh excreta and feathers of Gentoo penguins as well as in soils around the nesting sites where this species inhabits. Samples were collected in four locations throughout the Antarctic Peninsula (January 2014): O'Higgins Base, Stranger Point, Neko Harbor and Doumer Island. The highest levels of elements were found in excreta from O'Higgins Base (2.92, 266.83, 2.99, 44.75, 18.15, 1.68 and 317.92 for Cd, Cu, Cr, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn, respectively) and Stranger Point (1.97, 222.51, 2.98, 36.62, 13.41, 1.46 and 201.18 for Cd, Cu, Cr, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn, respectively. Similarly, the highest levels were found in feathers from O'Higgins Base (0.21, 20.89, 1.44, 1.19, 5.90, 0.63 and 64.07 for Cd, Cu, Cr, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn, respectively) and Stranger Point (0.14, 19.65, 1.47, 1.23, 3.85, 0.60 and 64.19 for Cd, Cu, Cr, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn, respectively). In soils, the highest levels were found in O'Higgins Base (4.31, 421.94, 64.75, 404.76, 28.13, 281.54 and 484.99 for Cd, Cu, Cr, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn, respectively), whereas the lowest levels were found in Neko Harbor and Doumer Island. These results observed could be related to the major human presence in the northern area of the Antarctic Peninsula and large-scale transport of pollutants. The metals detected in the excreta of the Gentoo penguin can contribute to increase the contamination of coastal terrestrial ecosystems, which could also affect other living organisms. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.

ABSTRACT: Nacreous layers of pearl oyster are one of the major functional biominerals. By participating in organic compound-crystal interactions, they assemble into consecutive mineral lamellae-like photonic crystals. Their biomineralization mechanisms are controlled by macromolecules; however, they are largely unknown. Here, we report two novel lectins termed PPL2A and PPL2B, which were isolated from the mantle and the secreted fluid of Pteria penguin oyster. PPL2A is a hetero-dimer composed of α and γ subunits, and PPL2B is a homo-dimer of β subunit, all of which surprisingly shared sequence homology with the jacalin-related plant lectin. On the basis of knockdown experiments at the larval stage, the identification of PPLs in the shell matrix, and in vitro CaCO3 crystallization analysis, we conclude that two novel jacalin-related lectins participate in the biomineralization of P. penguin nacre as matrix proteins. Furthermore, it was found that trehalose, which is specific recognizing carbohydrates for PPL2A and is abundant in the secreted fluid of P. penguin mantle, functions as a regulatory factor for biomineralization via PPL2A. These observations highlight the unique functions, diversity and molecular evolution of this lectin family involved in the mollusk shell formation. © 2014 Naganuma et al.

ABSTRACT: Ammonia volatilized from penguin rookeries is a major nitrogen source in Antarctic coastal terrestrial ecosystems. However, the spatial extent of ammonia dispersion from rookeries and its impacts have not been quantified previously. We measured ammonia concentration in air and lichen ecophysiological response variables proximate to an Adèlie penguin rookery at Cape Hallett, northern Victoria Land. Ammonia emitted from the rookery was 15N-enriched (δ15N value +6.9) and concentrations in air ranged from 36–75 µg m−3 at the rookery centre to 0.05 µg m−3 at a distance of 15.3 km. δ15N values and rates of phosphomonoesterase (PME) activity in the lichens Usnea sphacelata and Umbilicaria decussata were strongly negatively related to distance from the rookery and PME activity was positively related to thallus N:P mass ratio. In contrast, the lichen Xanthomendoza borealis, which is largely restricted to within an area 0.5 km from the rookery perimeter, had high N, P and 15N concentrations but low PME activity suggesting that nutrient scavenging capacity is suppressed in highly eutrophicated sites. An ammonia dispersion model indicates that ammonia concentrations sufficient to significantly elevate PME activity and δ15N values (≥0.1 µg NH3 m−3) occurred over c. 40–300 km2 surrounding the rookery suggesting that penguin rookeries potentially can generate large spatial impact zones. In a general linear model NH3 concentration and lichen species identity were found to account for 72 % of variation in the putative proportion of lichen thallus N originating from penguin derived NH3. The results provide evidence of large scale impact of N transfer from a marine to an N-limited terrestrial ecosystem. © 2014, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Over the past decade, populations of little penguins (Eudyptula minor) have been seriously declining across South Australia for reasons still not fully understood. In the present study, I investigated breeding performance and return rates of little penguins on Granite Island for 17 years in relation to patterns of population decline. I focussed on the impacts of human disturbance, breeding site, abandonment and predation on breeding success. The average breeding success was 1.05±0.12 fledglings per pair; and breeding success increased since 1990, despite population decline. Breeding site was the main factor affecting breeding success. I found no effect of predation or abandonment on breeding success, but there was a negative effect of predation on the number of dead chicks found. In addition, I found a negative effect of human disturbance. Despite the observed increase in breeding success, return rates were extremely low for both adults (16.3%) and fledglings (2.3%). Population modelling confirmed the observed population decline on Granite Island, with subadult survival being the most critical variable affecting population growth. The present study thus highlighted the need for further studies into factors affecting survival of adults and subadults. © CSIRO 2015.

ABSTRACT: Seabirds and other land-breeding marine predators are considered to be useful and practical indicators of the state of marine ecosystems because of their dependence on marine prey and the accessibility of their populations at breeding colonies. Historical counts of breeding populations of these higher-order marine predators are one of few data sources available for inferring past change in marine ecosystems. However, historical abundance estimates derived from these population counts may be subject to unrecognised bias and uncertainty because of variable attendance of birds at breeding colonies and variable timing of past population surveys. We retrospectively accounted for detection bias in historical abundance estimates of the colonial, land-breeding Adélie penguin through an analysis of 222 historical abundance estimates from 81 breeding sites in east Antarctica. The published abundance estimates were de-constructed to retrieve the raw count data and then re-constructed by applying contemporary adjustment factors obtained from remotely operating time-lapse cameras. The re-construction process incorporated spatial and temporal variation in phenology and attendance by using data from cameras deployed at multiple sites over multiple years and propagating this uncertainty through to the final revised abundance estimates. Our re-constructed abundance estimates were consistently higher and more uncertain than published estimates. The re-constructed estimates alter the conclusions reached for some sites in east Antarctica in recent assessments of long-term Adélie penguin population change. Our approach is applicable to abundance data for a wide range of colonial, land-breeding marine species including other penguin species, flying seabirds and marine mammals. © 2015 Southwell et al.

ABSTRACT: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of detection of anti-Aspergillus fumigatus antibodies in captive penguins by double radial agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) for the aspergillosis diagnosis. We included 134 Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) in rehabilitation at the Center for Recovery of Marine Animals (CRAM / FURG). All of them were monitored by AGID weekly until its final destination (death or release), totalizing 660 serum samples studied. All animals were clinically accompanied and post-mortem examinations was performed in penguins that died during the studied period. A total of 28% (37/134) of the penguins died, 89.2% (33/37) due to aspergillosis, 11% (4/37) by other causes and 97 were released. From the 33 animals with proven aspergillosis, 21 presented anti- A. fumigatus antibodies by AGID, being the average interval between death and positive AGID 16.4 days. Twelve animals with negative serology died of aspergillosis. The sensitivity and specificity rates were 63.6% and 95% respectively, and the positive and negative predictive values were 80.7% and 88.9% respectively. These data demonstrate that the serological monitoring for detection of antibodies by AGID can be an important tool for the diagnosis of aspergillosis in penguins.

ABSTRACT: We investigated the paternity of 39 Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) hatched at the Port of Nagoya Public Aquarium between 1995 and 2005 breeding seasons using microsatellite DNA markers. Among the 13 microsatellite marker loci tested in this study, eight markers amplified and were found to be polymorphic in the colony's founders of the captive population (n=26). Multiple marker analysis confirmed that all the hatchlings shared alleles with their social fathers and that none of them were sired by any male (all males ≥4 years old in the exhibit tank during each reproductive season; n=9-15) other than the one carrying out parental duties, except in the case of two inbred hatchlings whose half-sibling parents shared the same father. These results demonstrated that extra-pair paternity (EPP) did not occur in this captive population and that even if EPP has been detected among them, the probability of excluding all other possible fathers in the exhibit tank is extremely high based on paternity exclusion probabilities across the investigated loci. The paternity exclusion probabilities were almost the same between 1994 and 2005. The probability of identity across the investigated loci declined between the two time points, but was still high. These results are reflected in a very short history of breeding in this captive population. In other words, the parentage analyses using a suite of microsatellite markers will be less effective as generations change in small closed populations, such as zoo and aquarium populations.

ABSTRACT: Little is known about viruses associated with Antarctic animals, although they are probably widespread. We recovered a novel polyomavirus from Adé lie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) faecal matter sampled in a subcolony at Cape Royds, Ross Island, Antarctica. The 4988 nt Adé lie penguin polyomavirus (AdPyV) has a typical polyomavirus genome organization with three ORFs that encoded capsid proteins on the one strand and two non-structural protein-coding ORFs on the complementary strand. The genome of AdPyV shared ~60% pairwise identity with all avipolyomaviruses. Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis of the large T-antigen (T-Ag) amino acid sequences showed that the T-Ag of AdPyV clustered with those of avipolyomaviruses, sharing between 48 and 52% identities. Only three viruses associated with Adé lie penguins have been identified at a genomic level, avian influenza virus subtype H11N2 from the Antarctic Peninsula and, respectively, Pygoscelis adeliae papillomavirus and AdPyV from capes Crozier and Royds on Ross Island. © 2015 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The fledging mass of penguin chicks can be an indicator of food availability and environmental conditions at a penguin colony. For the period 1989 to 2011, we analyzed predictor variables of environmental and food resource factors acting on multiple spatial scales near Palmer Station, Antarctica, that may influence the interannual variability in Adélie penguin chick fledging mass (CFM). To understand the influence of parental Adélie penguin diet on CFM, we modeled the energy density and krill demographics of penguin diet samples. We found a weak but significant positive relationship between the proportion of immature krill in adult penguin diets and CFM, which may indicate that krill recruitment and prey availability to adults influences CFM. However, the impact of large-scale climate and local weather outweighed the impact of parental diet characteristics on CFM. CFM was negatively associated with a positive Antarctic Oscillation (or Southern Annular Mode) and increased westerly winds and was positively associated with increased air temperature. The mechanistic relationship between climate, local weather, and CFM could include direct and indirect impacts, such as increased thermo-regulative costs for unattended chicks, decreased chick feeding frequency, and smaller meal mass for chicks driven by the geophysical transport of krill by climate and wind events. © Inter-Research 2014

ABSTRACT: The anatomy and volume of the penguin respiratory system contribute significantly to pulmonary baroprotection, the body O2 store, buoyancy and hence the overall diving physiology of penguins. Therefore, three-dimensional reconstructions from computerized tomographic (CT) scans of live penguins were utilized to measure lung volumes, air sac volumes, tracheobronchial volumes and total body volumes at different inflation pressures in three species with different dive capacities [Ade?lie (Pygoscelis adeliae), king (Aptenodytes patagonicus) and emperor (A. forsteri) penguins]. Lung volumes scaled to body mass according to published avian allometrics. Air sac volumes at 30 cm H2O (2.94 kPa) inflation pressure, the assumed maximum volume possible prior to deep dives, were two to three times allometric air sac predictions and also two to three times previously determined end-of-dive total air volumes. Although it is unknown whether penguins inhale to such high volumes prior to dives, these values were supported by (a) body density/buoyancy calculations, (b) prior air volume measurements in free-diving ducks and (c) previous suggestions that penguins may exhale air prior to the final portions of deep dives. Based upon air capillary volumes, parabronchial volumes and tracheobronchial volumes estimated from the measured lung/airway volumes and the only available morphometry study of a penguin lung, the presumed maximum air sac volumes resulted in air sac volume to air capillary/ parabronchial/tracheobronchial volume ratios that were not large enough to prevent barotrauma to the non-collapsing, rigid air capillaries during the deepest dives of all three species, and during many routine dives of king and emperor penguins. We conclude that volume reduction of airways and lung air spaces, via compression, constriction or blood engorgement, must occur to provide pulmonary baroprotection at depth. It is also possible that relative air capillary and parabronchial volumes are smaller in these deeper-diving species than in the spheniscid penguin of the morphometry study. If penguins do inhale to this maximum air sac volume prior to their deepest dives, the magnitude and distribution of the body O2 store would change considerably. In emperor penguins, total body O2 would increase by 75%, and the respiratory fraction would increase from 33% to 61%. We emphasize that the maximum pre-dive respiratory air volume is still unknown in penguins. However, even lesser increases in air sac volume prior to a dive would still significantly increase the O2 store. More refined evaluations of the respiratory O2 store and baroprotective mechanisms in penguins await further investigation of species-specific lung morphometry, start-of-dive air volumes and body buoyancy, and the possibility of air exhalation during dives. © 2015.

ABSTRACT: Determining where, when and how much animals eat is fundamental to understanding their ecology. We developed a technique to identify a prey capture signature for little penguins from accelerometry, in order to quantify food intake remotely. We categorised behaviour of captive penguins from HD video and matched this to time-series data from back-mounted accelerometers. We then trained a support vector machine (SVM) to classify the penguins' behaviour at 0.3 s intervals as either 'prey handling' or 'swimming'. We applied this model to accelerometer data collected from foraging wild penguins to identify prey capture events. We compared prey capture and non-prey capture dives to test the model predictions against foraging theory. The SVM had an accuracy of 84.95±0.26% (mean ± s.e.) and a false positive rate of 9.82±0.24% when tested on unseen captive data. For wild data, we defined three independent, consecutive prey handling observations as representing true prey capture, with a false positive rate of 0.09%. Dives with prey captures had longer duration and bottom times, were deeper, had faster ascent rates, and had more 'wiggles' and 'dashes' (proxies for prey encounter used in other studies). The mean (±s.e.) number of prey captures per foraging trip was 446.6±66.28. By recording the behaviour of captive animals on HD video and using a supervised machine learning approach, we show that accelerometry signatures can classify the behaviour of wild animals at unprecedentedly fine scales. © 2014.

ABSTRACT: Malignant melanomas are aggressive neoplasms that are relatively common in penguins compared to other avian species. In this study, the clinical and pathologic characteristics of melanocytic neoplasms in five macaroni (Eudyptes chrysolophus), three rock hopper (Eudyptes chrysocome), and two Humboldt (Spheniscus humboldti) penguins are described. Tumors most commonly occurred in the skin of the foot or hock, and were seen in the subcutaneous muscle, especially near the beak/oral cavity. Gross lesions were usually heavily pigmented, becoming raised and ulcerated over time. Humboldt penguins had a unique presentation, forming variably pigmented, cornified lesions in the inguinal area. Original case materials were obtained from all but two cases, and were assessed to define the characteristics of malignancy, evaluate four immunohistochemical markers for melanoma, and look for factors useful to informing prognosis and clinical decisions. Diagnosis was made histologically, based on morphologic features and pigmentation. Though not necessary for diagnosis, PNL-2 was found to be a useful immunohistochemical marker. HMB-45 showed unreliable positive labelling and S-100, Melan-A and Ki67 were not useful. Several factors were associated with prognosis, including gross surface dimension, mitotic index, depth of neoplastic cell invasion, and degree of surface ulceration. Metastatic spread occurred to the liver, lung, adrenal gland, brain, and bone; all lesions showed positive labelling to PNL-2. The average survival after diagnosis was 7 mo, though complete surgical excision of tumors less than 2.0 cm was curative in two cases and radiation therapy prolonged survival in one penguin. The underlying pathogenesis associated with the high prevalence of melanocytic neoplasms in captive penguins could not be identified. Three different molecular methods were performed to look for viral particles and results were negative. Advanced age is the most probable associated risk factor; ultraviolet light and chlorine exposure, viral induction, and genetic predisposition were ruled out or considered unlikely. © 2014 American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: The world’s smallest penguin, Eudyptula minor, exhibits substantial mtDNA differentiation among populations, suggesting the possibility of multiple taxa. We developed 20 new microsatellite loci that potentially provide a powerful system for assessing nuclear genetic differentiation and taxonomic status of Eudyptula populations. Alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 26 and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.317 to 0.939. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

ABSTRACT: Inter-annual variation in tissue mercury concentrations in birds can result from annual changes in the bioavailability of mercury or shifts in dietary composition and/or trophic level. We investigated potential annual variability in mercury dynamics in the Antarctic marine food web using Pygoscelis penguins as biomonitors. Eggshell membrane, chick down, and adult feathers were collected from three species of sympatrically breeding Pygoscelis penguins during the austral summers of 2006/2007–2010/2011. To evaluate the hypothesis that mercury concentrations in penguins exhibit significant inter-annual variation and to determine the potential source of such variation (dietary or environmental), we compared tissue mercury concentrations with trophic levels as indicated by δ15N values from all species and tissues. Overall, no inter-annual variation in mercury was observed in adult feathers suggesting that mercury exposure, on an annual scale, was consistent for Pygoscelis penguins. However, when examining tissues that reflected more discrete time periods (chick down and eggshell membrane) relative to adult feathers, we found some evidence of inter-annual variation in mercury exposure during penguins’ pre-breeding and chick rearing periods. Evidence of inter-annual variation in penguin trophic level was also limited suggesting that foraging ecology and environmental factors related to the bioavailability of mercury may provide more explanatory power for mercury exposure compared to trophic level alone. Even so, the variable strength of relationships observed between trophic level and tissue mercury concentrations across and within Pygoscelis penguin species suggest that caution is required when selecting appropriate species and tissue combinations for environmental biomonitoring studies in Antarctica. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: Seabird life history is typified by low fecundity, high adult survival rates, and relatively long lives. Such traits act as buffers, enabling persistence of populations under variable environmental conditions. Numerous studies, however, have suggested strong sensitivity of seabirds to environmental variability. In the Antarctic Peninsula region, for example, Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) populations have declined during the last three decades, attributed largely to rapid changes in environmental conditions and food availability. We use 30 years of mark-recapture data from known-age individuals in the South Shetland Islands and capture-mark-recapture models to estimate survival rates with respect to such environmental variation. We investigated specifically whether negative trends in survival rates were evident and whether indices of global, regional, and local environmental conditions considered important for Adélie penguin survival explained the variability in survival rates. Overall, negative trends in juvenile survival were evident, but adult survival rates exhibited high interannual variability. Indices of sea ice extent had the strongest correlations with survival rates, particularly Weddell Sea ice extent during spring among adults (r = 0.62) and during winter for juveniles (r = 0.46). An analysis of deviance, however, suggested that single environmental covariates explained <30 % of the observed variation in the full mark-recapture models. Despite positive effects of sea ice extent on survival rates of Adélie penguins, limited explanatory power of several environmental conditions previously identified as important for Adélie penguin survival underscores the difficulty of predicting future population responses in this region of rapid environmental change. © 2014, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: In general, the knowledge on parasites infecting Antarctic birds is scarce. The present study intends to extend the knowledge on gastrointestinal parasites of Emperor Penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) at the Atka Bay, Antarctica. Fecal samples of 50 individual Emperor Penguins were collected at the Atka Bay and analyzed using the sodium-acetate-formaldehyde (SAF) method for the identification of intestinal helminth eggs and/or protozoan parasite stages. In addition, coproantigen ELISAs were performed to detect Cryptosporidium and Giardia infections. Overall, 13 out of 50 penguins proved parasitized (26 %). The following stages of gastrointestinal parasites were identified: One Capillaria sp. egg, Tetrabothrius spp. eggs, Diphyllobothrium spp. eggs, and proglottids of the cestode Parorchites zederi. The recorded Capillaria infection represents a new host record for Emperor Penguins. All coproantigen ELISAs for the detection of Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp. were negative. This paper provides current data on parasites of the Emperor Penguin, a protected endemic species of the Antarctica. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Lipid biomarkers of microorganism and vegetation preserved in penguin droppings record historical changes in the West Antarctic climate and environment. n-Alkanes, fatty acids and coprostanols have been determined in sediment core AD6 from penguin droppings in Ardley Island, West Antarctica, using GC or GC/MS/SIM. For n-alkanes, the main carbon number was nC23 with single-peak pattern, ΣC21−/ΣC22+ value was from 0.27 to 0.61, the carbon preference index (CPI) was from 2.97 to 6.12 with significant odd-even predominance (OEP), and these indicate that the vegetation was dominated by mosses and lichens. For fatty acids, the main carbon numbers were nC16:0 and nC24:0 with double-peak pattern, ΣC21−/ΣC22+ value was from 0.35 to 0.77, and the relative abundance ratio of even:odd carbon (CPIA) was from 2.88 to 6.40 with significant OEP. Bacteria invasion index ((iC15:0 + aC15:0)/nC15:0 for fatty acids) showed high contribution of bacteria during 1977-1982, 1948-1953 and 1920-1925, indicating enhanced microbial activities. Meanwhile, CPIA values decreased and extreme microbes contributed fatty acids with low carbon number to penguin dropping strata. Furthermore, the concentration of cholestanol and ratio of cholestanol/ cholesterol in penguin dropping strata changed correspondingly, indicating that the microbial degradation played a major role in the increasing ratio of cholestanol/cholesterol during the sedimentation process. The down-core profiles of n-alkanes, fatty acids and coprostanols in penguin dropping strata indicate that extreme microorganism and bacteria play important roles in the relatively simple Antarctic ecological system associated with climate conditions. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Ecological Society of China.

ABSTRACT: Introduction: The Magellanic Penguin migrates on the ocean currents from its reproduction colonies in Patagonia to seek abundant food on the Brazilian continental shelf. The pineal gland, an endocrine gland, whose secretions are affected by the light-darkness photoperiod, has a basic function in the biological processes of migrating animals. Melatonin, the hormone synthesized and secreted by the pineal gland affects the circadian, circannual and seasonal cycle that directly affects the migration processes of land and sea birds. Materials and Methods: Specimens were collected on the southern coast of Brazil, morphometric assessments and histological analyses of the glands were undertaken. Results: The pineal gland of the Magellanic Penguin lies in a triangular space between the brain hemispheres and the cerebellum and close to the cavernous sinus that follow the region´s dura mater. The average of the pineal gland of the penguins under analysis was 11.16mm and 1,69mm for length and thickness respectively. Test t and the coefficients of co-relationship (r) between the analyzed variables demonstrated that there was no co-relationship between the morphometric variables and the size of the pineal gland (p < 0.05). The Magellanic penguin´s pineal gland has a club-like sacular shape with cells in threads, involved and interlaced by fibrous conjunctive tissues. Conclusion: Results corroborated data in the literature and showed that the pineal gland of these birds is relatively greater than that of other birds and its tissue composition is similar to that of other vertebrates. © 2015, Brazilian Society of Anatomy.

ABSTRACT: During the austral winter the appearance of the Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) is common on the southern coast of Brazil. The oil pollution constitutes a major cause of death of these birds. The monitoring of the weight and blood variables is important to make decisions during the rehabilitation and release of these animals. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the penguins' survival during rehabilitation and the values of hematocrit (Hct), total plasma protein (TPP) and body weight (BW) of the birds received at Centro de Recuperação de Animais Marinhos (Recovery Centre for Sea Animals) between 2006 and 2009. The analysis took place weekly, and penguins were classified according to the outcome of the rehabilitation process, when 101 specimens were rehabilitated and released, and 67 died. Released animals showed a decrease in the Hct in the second and third weeks (41±6% and 40±5% respectively) followed by recovery of the values in the fourth and fifth week (41±4% and 43±4% respectively). TPP levels increased steadily over the collections, stabilizing at 7.3±0.8g/dL in the fourth week. On the other hand, animals that died, although following the same response for TPP, showed no significant difference in Hct between collections, and showed a tendency for loss of BW in the last weeks of rehabilitation. The curves of BW and Hct during rehabilitation were considered a potential prognostic indicator of penguins in rehabilitation. Animals that arrived at the recovery centre with BW, Hct and TPP above 2.700g, 45% and 5.6 g / dL, respectively, have a greater chance of recovery, making these parameters crucial points in decision making regarding the treatment to be conducted during rehabilitation.

ABSTRACT: Site fidelity is an important evolutionary trait to understand, as misinterpretation of philopatric behavior could lead to confusion over the key drivers of population dynamics and the environmental or anthropogenic factors influencing populations. Our objective was to explore the hypothesis that emperor penguins are strictly philopatric using satellite imagery, counts from aerial photography, and literature reports on emperor penguin distributions. We found six instances over three years in which emperor penguins did not return to the same location to breed. We also report on one newly-discovered colony on the Antarctic Peninsula that may represent the relocation of penguins from the Dion Islands, recently confirmed as having been abandoned. Using evidence from aerial surveys and the historical literature, we suggest that emigration may have been partly responsible for the population decline at Pointe Géologie during the 1970s. Our study is the first to use remote sensing imagery to suggest that emperor penguins can and do move between, and establish new, colonies. Metapopulation dynamics of emperor penguins have not been previously considered and represent an exciting, and important, avenue for future research. Life history plasticity is increasingly being recognized as an important aspect of climate change adaptation, and in this regard our study offers new insight for the long-term future of emperor penguins. © 2014 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) are listed as near threatened by the IUCN. At their largest colony, Punta Tombo, Chubut, Argentina, active nests declined >30% over 30years. Reproductive success is low, many penguins forage far from the colony, and starvation, the major cause of chick death, kills 39% of chicks on average each year. A 210-ha provincial reserve protects part of the breeding colony but there is no marine protected area (MPA) around Punta Tombo. An MPA protecting the foraging area of adults with small chicks could reduce chick starvation, increase reproductive success, and reduce adult mortality. The Province of Chubut wants an MPA to protect penguins at Punta Tombo but when and where would an MPA be most effective? We used our long-term dataset to determine that most chicks starve within 20-30days after hatching (November and December).We used satellite tags to track penguins foraging for chicks <20days of age in 1997-2001 and 2006-2009. Core foraging areas for penguins whose chicks did not starve (successful) and those whose chicks starved (unsuccessful) partially overlapped. Unsuccessful penguins, however, foraged farther from the colony (59±27km, N=39 penguins, 115 trips) and had a larger core foraging area (554 km2) than successful penguins (46±19km, N=23 penguins, 78 trips, P=0.002; 375km2). Unsuccessful parents took longer to return to feed their chicks, increasing chick starvation. There is a limited window of opportunity to secure protection through adequate management of a critical foraging area for penguins and the rich assemblage of other marine species using the same area. Increases in chick growth and survival would demonstrate the effectiveness of the MPA. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Among the outcomes of the drastic changes aff ecting the Earth's ecosystems, nothing is more telling than a complete failure in the reproductive success of a sentinel species: a 'zero' year. Here, we found that unusual environmental conditions in the Terre Adlie sector of Antarctica disrupted the breeding activity of Adé lie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae on land-but also their foraging activity at sea-to such a degree that no chicks survived in the 2013/2014 breeding season. Uncommonly heavy precipitation for this normally dry desert killed chicks en masse, while weak katabatic winds maintained a persistent sea ice around the colony, thereby impacting chick provisioning by adults. Extreme events such as this have direct repercussions for the species in question, and may also aff ect the wider sea-ice dependent food web. Understanding the nature, frequency, and consequences of such events are central to the management and conservation of this remote yet crucial ecosystem. © 2014 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: A fully automated weighbridge using a new algorithm and mechanics integrated with a Radio Frequency Identification System is described. It is currently in use collecting data on Macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus) at Bird Island, South Georgia. The technology allows researchers to collect very large, highly accurate datasets of both penguin weight and direction of their travel into or out of a breeding colony, providing important contributory information to help understand penguin breeding success, reproductive output and availability of prey. Reliable discrimination between single and multiple penguin crossings is demonstrated. Passive radio frequency tags implanted into penguins allow researchers to match weight and trip direction to individual birds. Low unit and operation costs, low maintenance needs, simple operator requirements and accurate time stamping of every record are all important features of this type of weighbridge, as is its proven ability to operate 24 hours a day throughout a breeding season, regardless of temperature or weather conditions. Users are able to define required levels of accuracy by adjusting filters and raw data are automatically recorded and stored allowing for a range of processing options. This paper presents the underlying principles, design specification and system description, provides evidence of the weighbridge's accurate performance and demonstrates how its design is a significant improvement on existing systems. © 2015 Afanasyev et al.

ABSTRACT: We investigated central place foraging (CPF) in the context of optimal foraging theory in Adélie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae of the southern Ross Sea by using satellite tracking and time-depth recorders to explore foraging at two spatio-temporal scales: within the day-to-day (sub-mesoscale: single foraging trip, 10s of km2) and the entire breeding season (mesoscale: trips by multiple individuals across the collective foraging area, 100s of km2). Specifically, we examine whether three basic assumptions of the Orians-Pearson CPF model, shown to occur in other CPF species, are met: 1) within a patch, the rate of prey acquisition declines with time spent in that patch; 2) food is distributed in discrete patches and is not available between those patches; and 3) CPF species have knowledge of the potential (or average, at least) feeding rate within their universe of patches, and use this knowledge to determine their foraging strategy when planning or engaging in a foraging trip. We found that prey consumption rates did not decline with time spent in patches, and penguins foraged to some degree most of the time when at sea. Food availability, as measured by foraging dive rate, appeared to be predictable within the same day at the same location, but predictability broke down after 2 d at distances > 10 km away. We conclude that the assumptions of the Orians-Pearson CPF model are not a good fit to the circumstances of Ross Sea penguins, which clearly are central place foragers. © 2014 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: There are few publications on the clinical haematology and biochemistry of African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) and these are based on captive populations. Baseline haematology and serum biochemistry parameters were analysed from 108 blood samples from wild, adult African penguins. Samples were collected from the breeding range of the African penguin in South Africa and the results were compared between breeding region and sex. The haematological parameters that were measured were: haematocrit, haemoglobin, red cell count and white cell count. The biochemical parameters that were measured were: sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, inorganic phosphate, creatinine, cholesterol, serum glucose, uric acid, bile acid, total serum protein, albumin, aspartate transaminase and creatine kinase. All samples were serologically negative for selected avian diseases and no blood parasites were detected. No haemolysis was present in any of the analysed samples. Male African penguins were larger and heavier than females, with higher haematocrit, haemoglobin and red cell count values, but lower calcium and phosphate values. African penguins in the Eastern Cape were heavier than those in the Western Cape, with lower white cell count and globulin values and a higher albumin/globulin ratio, possibly indicating that birds are in a poorer condition in the Western Cape. Results were also compared between multiple penguin species and with African penguins in captivity. These values for healthy, wild, adult penguins can be used for future health and disease assessments. © 2015. The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The diving physiology of aquatic animals at sea began 50 years ago with studies of the Weddell seal. Even today with the advancements in marine recording and tracking technology, only a few species are suitable for investigation. The first experiments were in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. In this paper are examples of what was learned in Antarctica and elsewhere. Some methods employed relied on willingness of Weddell seals and emperor penguins to dive under sea ice. Diving depth and duration were obtained with a time depth recorder. Some dives were longer than an hour and as deep as 600 m. From arterial blood samples, lactate and nitrogen concentrations were obtained. These results showed how Weddell seals manage their oxygen stores, that they become reliant on a positive contribution of anaerobic metabolism during a dive duration of more than 20 min, and that nitrogen blood gases remain so low that lung collapse must occur at about 25 to 50 m. This nitrogen level was similar to that determined in elephant seals during forcible submersion with compression to depths greater than 100 m. These results led to further questions about diving mammal’s terminal airway structure in the lungs. Much of the strengthening of the airways is not for avoiding the “bends,” by enhancing lung collapse at depth, but for reducing the resistance to high flow rates during expiration. The most exceptional examples are the small whales that maintain high expiratory flow rates throughout the entire vital capacity, which represents about 90% of their total lung capacity. © 2015 the American Physiological Society.

ABSTRACT: Energy conservation is a key priority for organisms that live in environments with seasonal shortages in resource supplies or that spontaneously fast during their annual cycle. The aim of this study was to determine whether the high fasting endurance of winteracclimatized king penguin chicks (Aptenodytes patagonicus) is associated with an adjustment of mitochondrial bioenergetics in pectoralis muscle, the largest skeletal muscle in penguins. The rates of mitochondrial oxygen consumption, and ATP synthesis and mitochondrial efficiency (ATP/O ratio) were measured in winteracclimatized chicks. We used pyruvate/malate and palmitoyl-Lcarnitine/malate as respiratory substrates and results from naturally fasted chicks were compared to experimentally re-fed chicks. Bioenergetics analysis of pectoralis muscle revealed that mitochondria are on average 15% more energy efficient in naturally fasted than in experimentally fed chicks, indicating that fasted birds consume less nutrients to sustain their energy-demanding processes. We also found that moderate reductions in temperature from 38°C to 30°C further increase by 23% the energy coupling efficiency at the level of mitochondria, suggesting that king penguin chicks realize additional energy savings while becoming hypothermic during winter. It has been calculated that this adjustment of mitochondrial efficiency in skeletal muscle may contribute to nearly 25% of fasting-induced reduction in mass-specific metabolic rate measured in vivo. The present study shows that the regulation of mitochondrial efficiency triggers the development of an economical management of resources, which would maximize the conservation of endogenous fuel stores by decreasing the cost of living in fasted winteracclimatized king penguin chicks. © 2014.

ABSTRACT: The determination of activity-specific energy expenditure of wild animals is key in ecology and conservation sciences. Energy management is crucial for seabirds during the breeding season when they need to maintain a positive balance between energy intake and the metabolic costs for them and their young. We analysed information from accelerometers to estimate the energy expenditure of Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) foraging at sea during the early chick-rearing period from four Patagonian colonies (i.e. Punta Norte, Bahía Bustamante, Puerto Deseado and Puerto San Julián). We studied how activity-specific energy consumption affected total energy expenditure during foraging and considered how this related to the current status and trends of breeding populations. The derived diving energy expenditure of penguins differed between sites, with inter-colony differences being primarily due to variability during the bottom and ascent phases of the dives: bottom phase energy expenditure was largely determined by the total distances travelled during the search, pursuit, and capture of prey, rather than the time per se allocated to this phase. Those colonies where the rate of population change was lowest also expended the most energy per trip due to greater times spent underwater and/or undertaking a higher number of dives per trip. Finally, the total energy consumption as well as the rate of energy expenditure per trip was good indicators of trends in breeding populations. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Antarctic Krill Euphausia superba is a key component of the Antarctic coastal marine ecosystem. Investigations into stable isotopic values of krill in predation hotspots are important in facilitating our understanding of the feeding environments of krill in a local coastal ecosystem. In this study we investigated stable isotopic values and maturity and size composition of krill at a small spatial scale, by logging GPS tracks of five Chinstrap Pygoscelis antarcticus and seven Gentoo P. papua penguins, and analyzing their stomach contents. The study was conducted at a penguin colony on Barton Peninsula, King George Island, Antarctica. The main food item of both species was Antarctic Krill (>98% wet mass). One Chinstrap and four Gentoo penguin foraging trips were classified as “on-shelf” trips, and four Chinstrap and three Gentoo Penguin foraging trips were classified as “off-shelf” trips. Krill collected from off-shelf trips had higher δ15N (4.22±0.28‰) values than those from on-shelf trips (3.78±0.29‰). The δ13C of the krill samples did not differ between the two penguin species or between trip types. The proportion of juvenile krill taken was higher for Chinstrap (13.04±4.97%) than Gentoo penguins (3.33±2.43%). Our results suggest that the main food source of the krill in our sample originated as non benthic planktonic/suspended organic matter, and that krill in off-shelf habitat may occasionally consume higher trophic level prey compared to those in on-shelf habitats. © The Ornithological Society of Japan 2015.

ABSTRACT: Context Egg depredation is a major cause of reproductive failure among birds and can drive population declines. In this study we investigate predatory behaviour of a corvid (little raven; Corvus mellori) that has only recently emerged, leading to widespread and intense depredation of eggs of a burrow-nesting seabird (little penguin; Eudyptula minor). Aims The main objective of this study was to measure the rate of penguin egg depredation by ravens to determine potential threat severity. We also examined whether penguin burrow characteristics were associated with the risk of egg depredation. Ravens generally employ two modes of predatory behaviour when attacking penguin nests; thus we examined whether burrow characteristics were associated with these modes of attack. Methods Remote-sensing cameras were deployed on penguin burrows to determine egg predation rates. Burrow measurements, including burrow entrance and tunnel characteristics, were measured at the time of camera deployment. Key results Overall, clutches in 61% of monitored burrows (n≤203) were depredated by ravens, the only predator detected by camera traps. Analysis of burrow characteristics revealed two distinct types of burrows, only one of which was associated with egg depredation by ravens. Clutches depredated by ravens had burrows with wider and higher entrances, thinner soil or vegetation layer above the egg chamber, shorter and curved tunnels and greater areas of bare ground and whitewash near entrances. In addition, 86% were covered by bower spinach (Tetragonia implexicoma), through which ravens could excavate. Ravens used two modes to access the eggs: they attacked through the entrance (25% of burrow attacks, n≤124); or dug a hole through the burrow roof (75% of attacks, n≤124). Burrows that were subject to attack through the entrance had significantly shorter tunnels than burrows accessed through the roof. Conclusions The high rates of clutch loss recorded here highlight the need for population viability analysis of penguins to assess the effect of egg predation on population growth rates. Implications The subterranean foraging niche of a corvid described here may have implications for burrow-nesting species worldwide because many corvid populations are increasing, and they exhibit great capacity to adopt new foraging strategies to exploit novel prey.

ABSTRACT: Background: Marine predators are ecosystem sentinels because their foraging behaviour and reproductive success reflect the variability occurring in the lower trophic levels of the ecosystem. In an era of environmental change, monitoring top predators species can provide valuable insights into the zones of ecological importance that need to be protected. In this context, we monitored the Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) as a bio-indicator near Dumont d'Urville, an area of the East Antarctic sector currently being considered for the establishment of a Marine Protected Area (MPA), using GPS-based tracking tags during the 2012/13 austral summer breeding season. Results: The habitat use and foraging areas of the penguins differed by breeding stage and sex and were strongly associated with patterns in bathymetry and sea-ice distribution. The first trips, undertaken during the incubation phase, were longer than those during the guard phase and were associated with the northern limit of the sea-ice extent. During the guard phase, birds strongly depended on access to a polynya, a key feature in Antarctic marine ecosystem, in the vicinity of the colony. The opening of the ice-free area was synchronous with the hatching of chicks. Moreover, a sex-specific use of foraging habitat observed only after hatching suggests sex-specific differences in the diet in response to intra-specific competition. Conclusions: Sea-ice features that could be affected by the climate change were important factors for the use of foraging habitat by the Adélie penguins. The extent of the foraging area observed in this study is congruent with the area of the proposed MPA. However, both penguin behavior and their environment should be monitored carefully. © 2015 Widmann et al.

ABSTRACT: The present review aims to improve the scope and coverage of the phylogenetic matrices currently in use, as well as explore some aspects of the relationships among Paleogene penguins, using two key skeletal elements, the humerus and tarsometatarsus. These bones are extremely important for phylogenetic analyses based on fossils because they are commonly found solid specimens, often selected as holo- and paratypes of fossil taxa. The resulting dataset includes 25 new characters, making a total of 75 characters, along with eight previously uncoded taxa for a total of 48. The incorporation and analysis of this corrected subset of morphological characters raise some interesting questions considering the relationships among Paleogene penguins, particularly regarding the possible existence of two separate clades including Palaeeudyptes and Paraptenodytes, the monophyly of Platydyptes and Paraptenodytes, and the position of Anthropornis. Additionally, Noto-dyptes wimani is here recovered in the same collapsed node as Archaeospheniscus and not within Delphinornis, as in former analyses. © 2014 Walter de Gruyter GmbH.

ABSTRACT: The Magellanic Penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) is the most abundant and widely distributed top marine predator of Atlantic Ocean waters off the Patagonian coast. During the breeding season, this species consumes thousands of tonnes of its prey and has a significant effect on populations of fish and squid near the Penguin's breeding colonies. We combined data on stomach contents, known habitat preferences of their prey, stable isotope analysis and a geographic information system to describe the diet of Magellanic Penguins in their austral distribution. On this basis, we present a comprehensive analysis of the trophic ecology of the species, the diet of which is poorly known (only a few analyses of stomach contents). Stable isotopes revealed a mean trophic level of 5.3 (range 4.5-5.8) and a diet in accordance with spatio-temporal overlap analysis. This study shows that Magellanic Penguins forage on few prey species not targeted by commercial fisheries in this region, mostly Patagonian Sprat and Longfin Squid. Moreover, we demonstrated that a combination of complementary tools can be used to describe the trophic relationships of wide-ranging marine predators, such as seabirds. © 2015 BirdLife Australia.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To describe ophthalmic examination findings and standard diagnostic test results in 2 penguin species. Animals Studied: Macaroni & Southern Rockhopper Penguins. Procedure: Complete ophthalmic examinations including Schirmer tear test (STT), modified phenol red thread test (PTT), tonometry, and echobiometry were performed on penguins housed at the Detroit Zoo. Mean and standard deviation of ophthalmic tests are reported and compared for significance using two sample t-tests with significance set at P < 0.05. Correlations between variables were assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Results: Cataracts were the most common finding, present in 64% of Macaroni Penguins, and 68% of Rockhopper Penguins. There were anterior segment anomalies in all eyes with cataracts consistent with lens-induced uveitis. The mean modified PTT for the Macaronis was 24.7 ± 6.37 mm/15 s and 25.1 ± 7.07 mm/15 s in the Rockhoppers. The mean STT value for the Macaronis was 12.1 ± 5.43 mm/min and 11.0 ± 3.96 mm/min in the Rockhoppers. Mean intraocular pressure (IOP) for the Macaronis was 21.9 ± 7.05 mmHg measured by applanation tonometry and 29.1 ± 7.16 mmHg using rebound tonometry. The Rockhoppers had a mean IOP of 20.0 ± 5.77 mmHg and 24.1 ± 5.09 mmHg for applanation and rebound tonometry, respectively. In both populations, there was a significant difference in IOP measurement between the two instruments. In the Macaroni penguins, the presence of cataracts correlated significantly with increased age and lower IOP readings. Anterior chamber distance and axial globe length were significantly greater in males than in females in both penguin species. © 2013 American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists.

ABSTRACT: It has been demonstrated that persistent organic pollutants (POPs) can affect the immune system of mammals and birds. In this study, the concentration of different POPs and leukocytes in blood samples from three chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica) populations was analysed in order to assess the impact on haematological parameters. Using blood sample smears, basophils, eosinophils, heterophils, lymphocytes and monocytes were quantified. Mature and immature red blood cells were counted and cell alterations in both white and red blood cells were analysed. At the same time, whole blood was analysed for POPs. The results showed that contaminants, such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and its metabolites (ΣDDT), as well as polychlorinated biphenyls (ΣPCB), had significant correlations to eosinophils, lymphocytes and heterophils. This indicates possible immunohaematological alterations derived from exposure to such contaminants. Cytological alterations were also observed, such as cytotoxic granules, toxic heterophils, and atypical and granulated lymphocytes, which would demonstrate that these seabirds are being exposed to stress agents that could be producing some alterations at a leukocytary cellular level. © 2015 Antarctic Science Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Prehistoric faunal extinctions dramatically reshaped biological assemblages around the world. However, the timing of such biotic shifts is often obscured by the fragmentary nature and limited temporal resolution of fossil records. We use radiocarbon-dating and ancient-DNA analysis of prehistoric (caA.D. 1450-1834) Megadyptes penguin specimens to assess the time-frame of biological turnover in coastal New Zealand following human settlement. These data suggest that the final extirpation of the endemic Megadyptes waitaha, and subsequent replacement by the previously sub-Antarctic-limited Megadyptes antipodes, likely occurred within a narrow temporal window (e.g. a century or less). This transition represents one of the most rapid prehistoric faunal turnover events documented, and is likely linked to human demographic and cultural transitions during the 15th Century. Our results suggest that anthropogenic forces can trigger rapid biogeographic shifts. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: A 25-year-old female macaroni penguin (Eudyptes chrysolophus) was diagnosed with exophthalmos secondary to retrobulbar neoplasia through use of computed tomography (CT). Histopathologic examination of the mass supported a diagnosis of malignant round cell neoplasia. Immunohistochemical (IHC) labeling was applied to determine cell origin; the neoplastic cells did not label with T-cell marker CD3 or B-cell marker BLA.36 and could not be further characterized. The scleral ossicles precluded evaluation of the retrobulbar space by ultrasonography; therefore, CT scanning is recommended for examination of intraorbital structures in penguin and other avian species. © 2015 by the Association of Avian Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: The African penguin Spheniscus demersus has an "Endangered" conservation status and a decreasing population. Following abandonment, 841 African penguin chicks in 2006 and 481 in 2007 were admitted to SANCCOB (Southern African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds) for hand-rearing from colonies in the Western Cape, South Africa, after large numbers of breeding adults commenced molt with chicks still in the nest. Of those admitted, 91% and 73% respectively were released into the wild. There were veterinary concerns about avian malaria, airsacculitis and pneumonia, feather-loss and pododermatitis (bumblefoot). Post-release juvenile (0.32, s.e. = 0.08) and adult (0.76, s.e. = 0.10) survival rates were similar to African penguin chicks reared after oil spills and to recent survival rates recorded for naturally-reared birds. By December 2012, 12 birds had bred, six at their colony of origin, and the apparent recruitment rate was 0.11 (s.e. = 0.03). Hand-rearing of abandoned penguin chicks is recommended as a conservation tool to limit mortality and to bolster the population at specific colonies. The feasibility of conservation translocations for the creation of new colonies for this species using hand-reared chicks warrants investigation. Any such program would be predicated on adequate disease surveillance programs established to minimize the risk of disease introduction to wild birds.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To determine the central corneal thickness (CCT) by ultrasonic pachymetry and the effect of these values on the measurements of intraocular pressures (IOP) with rebound tonometry (TonoVet®) in a captive flock of black-footed penguins (Spheniscus dermersus). Variations in CCT by age and weight, and variations in IOP by age were compared. Animal studied: Both eyes of 18 clinically normal black-footed penguins (Spheniscus dermersus) were used. Procedure: The IOP was measured by the TonoVet® in both eyes of all the penguins. CTT measurements were performed 5 min later in all eyes using an ultrasound pachymeter. Results: The mean IOP values ± SD were 31.77 ± 3.3 mm Hg (range of mean value: 24-38). The mean CCT values were 384.08 ± 30.9 μm (range of mean value: 319-454). There was no correlation between IOP and CCT values (P = 0.125). There was no difference in CCT measurements by age (P = 0.122) or weight (P = 0.779). A correlation was observed (P = 0.032) between IOP values and age. The coefficient of correlation was negative (ρ = -0.207). Conclusions: Ultrasound pachymetry has shown to be a reliable and easy technique to measure CCT in penguins. No correlation was observed between IOP and CCT values in this study. IOP showed a significant but weak decrease as age increased in the black-footed penguin. © 2014 American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists.

ABSTRACT: Major population changes of marine mega-fauna are ongoing as global warming, and other anthropogenic drivers affect prey availability. The historical stronghold of the Eastern Rockhopper Penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome filholi) was New Zealand’s sub-Antarctic Campbell Island, but the population declined by 94 % between 1942 and 1984. The apparent mechanism of collapse was warm ocean temperatures causing an inadequate food supply. Eudyptes penguin population declines are ongoing at some breeding sites, highlighting the need to investigate the population trend on Campbell Island since 1984. We estimated the Eastern Rockhopper Penguin breeding population size through physical and photo-counts of birds and nests in 2012, and changes in colony area relative to 1984 and 1996 photographs. We estimated the 2012 population size at 33,239 breeding pairs, a 21.8 % decrease from an (adjusted) estimate of 42,528 pairs in 1984. Although substantial, the recent 1984–2012 decline occurred at a much slower rate (λ = 0.991) than the 1942–1984 decline (λ = 0.940). Despite great variation in trends between colonies ostensibly linked to differences in predation rates, the recent decline occurred primarily between 1984 and 1996, and thereafter the overall population grew. A 100-year time series of extended reconstructed sea surface temperatures (ERSST) confirmed that the population declined during warm periods and increased during cool periods, but that the initial decline began before increases in regional ERSST. Population growth after 1996 appears related to the current global warming hiatus, lower ERSST, and increased abundance of a key prey species. We predict a continuation of the long-term population decline after warming resumes. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: The stomach contents of juvenile Magellanic penguins, Spheniscus magellanicus, stranded along the Atlantic coast (21-23°S) during the extreme mortality event of 2008 were analysed. The isotopic profiles of this species and their prey in a wintering area are presented to identify trophic relationships and to evaluate whether the prey species recovered in the stomach contents were assimilated. The prey groups recorded were molluscs (cephalopods and gastropods), teleost fish, and, to a lesser extent, crustaceans (decapods and isopods). Cephalopods were the most representative prey, and Argonauta nodosa was the most abundant species. Plant remains and solid waste were atypical items found in the stomach contents. The nitrogen isotope (δ15N) values found in this study confirm the higher trophic position of the penguins (14.5‰) relative to their prey (11.7-12.3‰). The carbon isotope (δ13C) measurements of all species are characteristic of marine coastal environments (-18.7 to -16.8‰). A Bayesian approach applied to stable isotope mixing models showed that cephalopods are assimilated to a greater extent than fish. However, the poor nutritional condition of specimens that reach the Brazilian coast, especially at the northern limit of migration (~21°S), indicates that prey ingestion is not sufficient for the maintenance of body weight. © 2014 Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.

ABSTRACT: Because glucocorticoid (stress) hormones fundamentally affect various aspects of the behaviour, life history and fitness of free-living vertebrates, there is a need to understand the environmental factors shaping their variation in natural populations. Here, we examined whether spatial heterogeneity in breeding territory quality affected the stress of colonial king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus). We assessed the effects of local climate (wind, sun and ambient temperature) and social conditions (number of neighbours, distance to neighbours) on the baseline levels of plasma total corticosterone (CORT) in 77 incubating and 42 chick-brooding birds, breeding on territories of central or peripheral colony location. We also assessed the oxidative stress status of a sub-sample of central vs. peripheral chick-brooders to determine whether chronic stress arose from breeding on specific territories. On average, we found that brooders had 55 % higher CORT levels than incubators. Regardless of breeding status, central birds experienced greater social density (higher number of neighbours, shorter distance between territories) and had higher CORT levels than peripheral birds. Increasing social density positively explained 40 % of the variation in CORT levels of both incubators and brooders, but the effect was more pronounced in brooders. In contrast, climate was similar among breeding territories and did not significantly affect the CORT levels of breeding birds. In brooders, oxidative stress status was not affected by local density or weather conditions. These results highlight that local heterogeneity in breeding (including social) conditions may strongly affect the stress levels of breeding seabirds. The fitness consequences of such variation remain to be investigated. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: In diving seabirds, sexual dimorphism in size often results in sex-related differences of foraging patterns. Previous research on Magellanic penguins, conducted during the breeding season, failed to reveal consistent differences between the sexes on foraging behavior, despite sexual dimorphism. In this paper, we tested the hypothesis that male and female Magellanic penguins differ in diet and foraging patterns during the non-breeding period when the constraints imposed by chick rearing activities vanish. We used stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen in feather and bone to characterize the diet and foraging patterns of male and female penguins in the South Atlantic at the beginning of the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 post-breeding seasons (feathers) and over several consecutive breeding and migratory seasons (bone). The mean δ13C and δ15N values of feathers showed no differences between the sexes in any of the three regions considered or in the diet composition between the sexes from identical breeding regions; however, Bayesian ellipses showed a higher isotopic niche width in males at the beginning of the post-breeding season. Stable isotope ratios in bone revealed the enrichment of males with δ13C compared with females across the three regions considered. Furthermore, the Bayesian ellipses were larger for males and encompassed those of females in two of the three regions analyzed. These results suggest a differential use of winter resources between the sexes, with males typically showing a larger diversity of foraging/migratory strategies. The results also show that dietary differences between male and female Magellanic penguins may occur once the constraints imposed by chick rearing activities cease at the beginning of the post-breeding season. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Little is known about migration of Magellanic Penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) in the Pacific Ocean. We used satellite telemetry to determine the post-breeding movement patterns of recently molted male Magellanic Penguins (n = 6) at Puñihuil, southern Chile, in 2006. Five individuals went north, stopping at two separate wintering areas along the coast, while one went 300 km south to waters inland of the island of Chiloé, Chile. The most commonly used wintering area (n = 3) was 600-800 km north of the breeding colony, near the Gulf of Arauco, Chile, where high levels of primary productivity are common. Magellanic Penguin wintering areas coincided with important areas for other seabirds and overlapped with human fisheries.

ABSTRACT: The body condition of altricial seabird chicks is directly related to the amount of food received from their parents, which depends on feeding conditions at sea. An index of body condition is therefore a useful tool for assessing variation in food availability between different breeding colonies. Quantile regression techniques were used to develop a body condition index for African penguin Spheniscus demersus chicks, based on maximum and minimum growth relative to structural size. This is considered the most appropriate index for comparing the body condition of groups of chicks, varying in size and of unknown age, between breeding colonies. Based on this study, recommendations are made with regard to morphometric measurements, sample size and the sampling interval required to compare effectively the condition of African penguin chicks between breeding colonies throughout their distributional range. © 2014 Copyright © NISC (Pty) Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) is one of the world's most endangered seabirds. In Japan, although the number of African penguins in captivity continues to increase, genetic data have not been collected for either wild or captive populations. To reveal genetic diversity and characterization in captive African penguins, we analyzed the nucleotide sequences of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from a sample of 236 African penguins. Analysis of 433 bp of the control region and 1,140 bp of cytochrome b sequences revealed the existence of two mtDNA clades. Control region haplotypes were much more divergent (d=3.39%) between the two clades than within each clade. The divergence of these clades may reflect differences at the subspecies or geographical population level in African penguins. These findings suggest that at least two distinct maternal lineages exist in the wild populations of the African penguin. © 2014 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: We report evidence of both philopatry and natal dispersal in Humboldt Penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) from a colony in central Chile. Between 1994 and 2001, we tagged 241 Humboldt Penguin chicks with subcutaneous transponder chips. Seven birds (3%) were found as adults at their natal colony: five were breeding (philopatric birds) and two were prospecting for nest-sites. Another four birds (2%) were found breeding at other colonies up to 90km from the natal colony. Philopatric birds bred at 3.6- 6.1 years old (mean±s.d.≤4. 8±1 years) at nests located 5-80m from their natal nests (30±25m). Most philopatric and the prospecting birds used the same types of nests as their natal ones and we suggest that birds breeding for the first time may use cues of structural aspects of their natal nest when choosing a nesting site for the first time.

ABSTRACT: Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) are important predators of krill (Euphausia spp.) and Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarctica) during summer, are a key indicator of the status of the Southern Ocean ecosystem, and are therefore a focal species for the Committee for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) Ecosystem Monitoring Program. The ability to monitor the population size of species potentially affected by Southern Ocean fisheries, i.e., the Adélie penguin, is critical for effective management of those resources. However, for several reasons, direct estimates of population size are not possible in many locations around Antarctica. In this study, we combine high-resolution (0.6 m) satellite imagery with spectral analysis in a supervised classification to estimate the sizes of Adélie penguin breeding colonies along Victoria Land in the Ross Sea and on the Antarctic Peninsula. Using satellite images paired with concurrent ground counts, we fit a generalized linear mixed model with Poisson errors to predict the abundance of breeding pairs as a function of the area of current-year guano staining identified in the satellite imagery. Guano-covered area proved to be an effective proxy for the number of penguins residing within. Our model provides a robust, quantitative mechanism for estimating the breeding population size of colonies captured in imagery and identifies terrain slope as a significant component influencing apparent nesting density. While our high-resolution satellite imagery technique was developed for the Adélie penguin, these principles are directly transferrable to other colonially nesting seabirds and other species that aggregate in fixed localities. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Understanding the dynamics and causes of population trends are essential for seabird conservation. Long-term studies of seabirds at high-latitude (Antarctic, sub-Antarctic and Arctic) regions have shown contrasting species-specific trends in population size in response to climate change and anthropogenic pressures. We have studied for the last 20 years (1992-2012) the population trends of seven seabird species that breed in the Beagle Channel, south-eastern Tierra del Fuego and at Staten Island, a sub-Antarctic region in southern Argentina. The numbers of Magellanic and Gentoo Penguins increased significantly since 1992 (by >15 % year-1). In comparison, the populations of Imperial Cormorants, Dolphin Gulls and Kelp Gulls increased at slower rates (<5 % year-1), while the Rock Cormorant population even decreased by 1.3 % year-1. At Staten Island, the numbers of Rockhopper Penguins decreased by 24 % between the censuses of 1998 and 2010, whereas the population of Magellanic Penguins increased by 227 % during the same period. Over the study period, air and sea-surface temperatures remained stable in our study area, suggesting that the detected population changes are not driven by the climate. This finding contrasts with the detected links between increasing temperature trends and seabird population changes reported from Antarctic and Arctic regions. The level of tourism and size of the permanent human population has increased in the Beagle Channel area during the last 20 years and could be responsible for the increase of gull populations. The seabird species that received the highest number of visitors (Imperial Cormorants and penguin species) seem to be adapted or at least indifferent to pressures exerted by tourism, as their populations increased during the study period. In addition, increasing numbers of seabirds in the area may generally be leading to higher abundances of scavenging species (e.g. gulls). © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: We are conducting a multi-platform field study to investigate the impact of local physical processes on Adélie penguin foraging ecology in the vicinity of Palmer Deep off Anvers Island, Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). Guided by real-time remotely sensed surface current measurements of convergence derived from a network of high-frequency radars (HFRs), we adaptively sample the distribution and biomass of phytoplankton and Antarctic krill, which influence Adélie penguin foraging ecology, to understand how local oceanographic processes structure the ecosystem. The recent application of ocean observing and animal telemetry technology over Palmer Deep has led to new understanding and many new questions related to polar ecosystem processes. The HFR coastal surface current mapping network is uniquely equipped to resolve local circulation patterns over Palmer Deep. The surface current measurements enable identification of regions of convergence and divergence in real time. Guided by these maps, our field study adaptively samples the measured convergence and divergence zones within the context of semi-diurnal and diurnal mixed tidal regimes. The in situ sampling includes (a) a mooring deployment, (b) multiple underwater glider deployments, (c) small boat acoustic surveys of Antarctic krill, and (d) penguin ARGOS-linked satellite telemetry and temperature-depth recorders (TDRs). The combination of real-time surface convergencemaps with adaptive in situ sampling introduces HFR to the Antarctic in a way that allows us to rigorously and efficiently test the influence of local tidal processes on top predator foraging ecology. © 2014, Asociacion Geologica Argentina.

ABSTRACT: A new fossil penguin skeleton from the La Meseta Formation collected at the locality DPV 13/84 (Seymour Island, Antarctic Peninsula) from the crinoid horizon located 40m above the base of the 145m-thick Submeseta Allomember (Late Eocene-Early Oligocene?) is described. The specimen is assigned to the species Palaeeudyptes klekowskii Myrcha, Tatur and del Valle, 1990; it is the most complete penguin skeleton ever recovered from Antarctica. Discoveries like this one are significant for the study of the anatomy and evolution of penguins, in particular regarding the Antarctic species included in the genus Palaeeudyptes Huxley, 1859. P. klekowskii closely resembles its smaller congeneric species P.. gunnari (Wiman, 1905), with only the relative concavity of the margo medialis distinguishing the tarsometatarsi of both taxa. However, the results of a geometric morphometric analysis show some intra- and inter-specific variations, making possible the systematic assignment of the majority of the specimens. Size variation is congruent with the presence of two different species. © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

ABSTRACT: Glucocorticoid hormones (GCs) are important mediators of physiological and behavioral responses to stress. While many studies have evaluated the environmental, behavioral, or physiological correlates of GCs and their effects on reproductive performances, further work is needed to clarify the relationship between GCs and fitness. Assessing the effects of increased GC levels on specific behaviors of breeding animals should improve our understanding of how GCs affect parental care. In this experimental study, we measured the effects of an experimental increase in corticosterone (CORT, the main avian GC) levels on the behavior of free-living male Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) within the colony, their reproductive output, and the indirect consequences of both on the behavior of their partners. We show that increased CORT levels in males decreased their foraging time at sea while increased their attendance at the nest, although their attentiveness toward the nest itself decreased. In addition, treated males spent more time on comfort behaviors (e.g., preening), vocalizing, and engaging in positive social interactions relative to controls. Treatment further affected the behavior of their partners, but not chick begging and feeding rates. Penguins with increased CORT levels also exhibited decreased reproductive output. Previous studies of Adélie penguins in different life history stages and environmental conditions suggest that the consequences of CORT treatment on reproductive performance are context-dependent. In addition to the potential delay in the effects of increased CORT levels on reproduction, this context dependence should be taken into account when studying the behavior of free-living animals in relation to stress-inducing situations. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: New Zealand's subantarctic Antipodes Islands are of international significance for breeding seabirds. However, penguin populations on the islands are declining. Uncertainty about the extent of this decline has been accentuated by a lack of accurate information on the population size and nest distribution of the penguin species, and the absence of an appropriate methodology for their long-term monitoring. We surveyed the nest abundance and distribution of eastern rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes flholi) and erect-crested penguins (E. sclateri) on the Antipodes Islands from 22 October to 6 November 2011 and compared counts with historical censuses from 1978 to 1995. Presence or absence of colonies previously known to have existed was recorded and counts of all nests within colonies around the islands were undertaken. In total, 42 689 nests of both species were counted over 103 colonies. Of these, 86% of nests (2475 rockhopper and 34 226 erect-crested) were counted accurately from on land. Overall, 24 entire colonies have ceased to exist since 1978, and there was an estimated 23% decline in the number of penguin nests between 1995 and 2011. Despite differences in methodology between surveys, there appears to have been a significant decline in penguins nesting on the Antipodes Islands. Worldwide, most crested penguin species (Eudyptes spp.) are in decline. Since New Zealand is a world hotspot for endemic penguin species, a consistent monitoring system needs to be developed and a monitoring schedule put in place to allow quantification of the scale of these declines. The causes of the declines on the Antipodes also need to be investigated, as they are unlikely to be a result of on-land predation by introduced mammals and human habitat disturbance or destruction, as occurs on the New Zealand mainland. © New Zealand Ecological Society.

ABSTRACT: We describe a new breeding behaviour discovered in emperor penguins; utilizing satellite and aerial-survey observations four emperor penguin breeding colonies have been recorded as existing on ice-shelves. Emperors have previously been considered as a sea-ice obligate species, with 44 of the 46 colonies located on sea-ice (the other two small colonies are on land). Of the colonies found on ice-shelves, two are newly discovered, and these have been recorded on shelves every season that they have been observed, the other two have been recorded both on ice-shelves and sea-ice in different breeding seasons. We conduct two analyses; the first using synthetic aperture radar data to assess why the largest of the four colonies, for which we have most data, locates sometimes on the shelf and sometimes on the sea-ice, and find that in years where the sea-ice forms late, the colony relocates onto the ice-shelf. The second analysis uses a number of environmental variables to test the habitat marginality of all emperor penguin breeding sites. We find that three of the four colonies reported in this study are in the most northerly, warmest conditions where sea-ice is often sub-optimal. The emperor penguin's reliance on sea-ice as a breeding platform coupled with recent concerns over changed sea-ice patterns consequent on regional warming, has led to their designation as "near threatened" in the IUCN red list. Current climate models predict that future loss of sea-ice around the Antarctic coastline will negatively impact emperor numbers; recent estimates suggest a halving of the population by 2052. The discovery of this new breeding behaviour at marginal sites could mitigate some of the consequences of sea-ice loss; potential benefits and whether these are permanent or temporary need to be considered and understood before further attempts are made to predict the population trajectory of this iconic species. © 2014 Fretwell et al.

ABSTRACT: Pododermatitis is currently one of most frequent and important clinical complications in seabirds kept in captivity or in rehabilitation centers. In this study, five Magellanic penguins with previous pododermatitis lesions on their footpad were treated with photodynamic therapy (PDT). All PDT treated lesions successfully regressed and no recurrence was observed during the 6-month follow-up period. PDT seems to be an inexpensive and effective alternative treatment for pododermatitis in Magellanic penguins encouraging further research on this topic. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: An important feature of <2. Ma Hawaiian volcanoes is that they define two sub-parallel spatial trends known as the Loa- and Kea-trends. On the Island of Hawaii, the <1.5. Ma shield lavas on the Loa and Kea spatial trends have distinctive geochemical characteristics that are designated as Loa-type and Kea-type. These geochemical differences are clearly expressed in Sr, Nd, Hf and Pb isotopic ratios, major element contents, and ratios of incompatible elements. They are interpreted to reflect varying proportions of sediment, basalt, gabbro and peridotite in subducted oceanic lithosphere. Pb isotopic ratios indicate that the Loa-type component reflects ancient subduction, >2.5. Ga, whereas the Kea-type component reflects younger subduction, <1.5. Ga. To evaluate the temporal persistence of these geochemical differences in the source of Hawaiian shield lavas, we analyzed lavas from the ~1.5 to 2. Ma Molokai Island volcanoes, East and West Molokai, and the adjacent submarine Penguin Bank. The three volcanoes form a nearly east-west trend that crosscuts the Loa and Kea spatial trends at a high angle; consequently we can determine if these older lavas are Kea-type in the east and Loa-type in the west. All lavas collected from the subaerial flanks of East Molokai, a Kea-trend volcano, have Kea-type geochemical characteristics; however, dive samples collected from Wailau landslide blocks, probably samples of the East Molokai shield that are older than those exposed on the subaerial flanks, include basalt with Loa-type geochemical features. Shield lavas from West Molokai and Penguin Bank, both on the Loa-trend, are dominantly Loa-type, but samples with Kea-type compositions also erupted at these Loa-trend volcanoes. The Loa-trend volcanoes, Mahukona, West Molokai, Penguin Bank, and Koolau, have also erupted lavas with Kea-type geochemical characteristics, and the Kea-trend volcanoes, Mauna Kea, Kohala, Haleakala, and East Molokai, have erupted lavas with Loa-type geochemical characteristics. The presence of both Loa- and Kea-type lavas in a volcano provides constraints on the distribution of geochemical heterogeneities in the source of Hawaiian shield basalts. Two plausible models are: (1) source components with Loa- and Kea-type geochemical characteristics are present in the sources of all <2. Ma shields, but the Kea-to-Loa proportion is higher beneath Kea-trend than Loa-trend volcanoes, or (2) the magma source contains a uniform proportion of Loa- and Kea-type components, but these components have different solidi. Magmas derived from the low-temperature regions of the source preferentially sample the component with the lower solidus temperature and form Loa-type lavas. In contrast, magmas derived from the relatively high-temperature regions of the source sample both low and high solidus components in the source and form Kea-type lavas. This model is supported by the linear correlations between isotopic ratios and calculated temperatures of estimated primary magmas. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The population size of emperor penguins at the land-based Taylor Glacier colony was monitored over 54 years from 1957 to 2010 by intermittent ground counts from 1957 to 1975 and annual photographic counts from 1988 to 2010 of males attending the colony in winter and chicks in early summer. The breeding population in the early years averaged 3,684 ± 492 pairs compared with 2,927 ± 320 pairs from 1988-2010, a reduction of 20.5 %. The exact timing and magnitude of the change is unknown because there was a 13-year gap between the end of the historical counts and start of the contemporary counts. From 1954 to 2010 no real or inferred warming event that may have been linked to the decrease was evident at Australia's Mawson station, 95 km from Taylor Glacier colony. From 1988 to 2010, variation in breeding population size and breeding success were not related to variation in the distance between the colony and open water. In this period, the number of pairs breeding fluctuated annually and overall showed signs of a gradual decrease. The Taylor Glacier colony is one of only three emperor penguin colonies where populations have been monitored in winter over the long term. Given the threat of climate warming to the future of this ice-dependent species it is imperative that the annual monitoring programme at Taylor Glacier continues well into the future. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: A tarsometatarsus and a fragmented humerus of striking dimensions recently collected in the Late Eocene locality DPV 13/84 Submeseta Formation-level 38 Submeseta II-, Seymour (Marambio) Island, Antarctic Peninsula were both assigned to Palaeeudyptes klekowskii. According to estimates, the tarsometatarsus would belong to the largest and most massive penguin described so far. This bird was probably a piscivorous penguin, with high diving ability for catching prey. Although the humerus is not an appropriate element for body mass or body length assessments, it also belonged to a huge penguin. © 2014 Académie des sciences.

ABSTRACT: This account presents the first known observations of Cape Gannet Morus capensis fledgling mortalities as a result of aggressive nest defence behaviour by African Penguins Spheniscus demersus. Observations were conducted in 2013 on Bird Island, Algoa Bay, South Africa – the world's largest breeding colony of Cape Gannets. Twentyeight attacks were witnessed between 21 March and 18 May 2013 of which 16 resulted in mortality. The absence of previous observations of this phenomenon may be due to an unusually high proportion of African Penguin chicks being present relatively early on in the breeding season, associated with a potential for increased nest defence at this stage, and a larger number of gannet fledglings that year compared to previous years over the same period. © 2014, Copyright © NISC (Pty) Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The African Penguin (Spheniscus demersus) is a highly social and vocal seabird. However, currently available descriptions of the vocal repertoire of African Penguin are mostly limited to basic descriptions of calls. Here we provide, for the first time, a detailed description of the vocal behaviour of this species by collecting audio and video recordings from a large captive colony. We combine visual examinations of spectrograms with spectral and temporal acoustic analyses to determine vocal categories. Moreover, we used a principal component analysis, followed by signal classification with a discriminant function analysis, for statistical validation of the vocalisation types. In addition, we identified the behavioural contexts in which calls were uttered. The results show that four basic vocalisations can be found in the vocal repertoire of adult African Penguin, namely a contact call emitted by isolated birds, an agonistic call used in aggressive interactions, an ecstatic display song uttered by single birds, and a mutual display song vocalised by pairs, at their nests. Moreover, we identified two distinct vocalisations interpreted as begging calls by nesting chicks (begging peep) and unweaned juveniles (begging moan). Finally, we discussed the importance of specific acoustic parameters in classifying calls and the possible use of the source-filter theory of vocal production to study penguin vocalisations. © 2014 Favaro et al.

ABSTRACT: AIM: To investigate an outbreak of severe craniofacial deformity in yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes, hōiho) chicks at a single breeding site on the Otago Peninsula in the South Island of New Zealand.METHODS: Morbidity and mortality of yellow-eyed penguins breeding on the coastal regions of Otago was monitored from November 2008 to March 2009. Dead chicks and unhatched eggs were recovered and examined. Between October and December 2008 32 eggs were recorded at 17 nests in the Okia Reserve. Eleven chicks survived to about 90 days of age, of which eight were found to have moderate to severe craniofacial deformity. The six most severe chicks were subject to euthanasia and examined in detail at necropsy, and the remaining two affected chicks were released to the wild after a period of care in a rehabilitation centre. Post-mortem samples were analysed for inorganic and organic toxins.RESULTS: The six deformed chicks all had severe shortening of the mandible and maxilla by 20-50 mm. The rostral and caudal regions of the skull were approximately 40 and 80% of normal length, respectively. Other, more variable lesions included crossbill deformity, malformed bill keratin, microphthalmia with misshapen scleral ossicles and oral soft tissue excess thought to be secondary to bony malformations. During the same year, mild sporadic bill deformities were also reported in 10 unrelated chicks from >167 chicks at other breeding sites on the southern Otago coast. Concentrations of organic toxins and heavy metals in body tissues from affected chicks were apparently similar to those in unaffected chicks on other beaches.CONCLUSIONS: No cause of this outbreak of craniofacial deformity could be established although the high prevalence at a single site suggests that it was due to an unidentified local teratogen. © 2014 © 2014 New Zealand Veterinary Association.

ABSTRACT: The complete mitochondrial genome of the Chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarcticus) was sequenced and compared with other penguin mitogenomes. The genome is 15,972bp in length with the number and order of protein coding genes and RNAs being very similar to that of other known penguin mitogenomes. Comparative nucleotide analysis showed the Chinstrap mitogenome shares 94% homology with the mitogenome of its sister species, Pygoscelis adelie (Adélie penguin). Divergence at nonsynonymous nucleotide positions was found to be up to 23 times less than that observed in synonymous positions of protein coding genes, suggesting high selection constraints. The complete mitogenome data will be useful for genetic and evolutionary studies of penguins. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd. All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

ABSTRACT: To add data on trace metal contamination of Humboldt penguins in the South Pacific, levels of trace metals (As, Hg, Pb, Cu, Zn, and Cd) and porphyrins (copro-, uro-, and proto-) in excreta of Humboldt penguins that inhabit some important nesting sites on the northern coast of Chile were determined. Fresh excreta were collected on Pan de Azúcar Island, Chañaral Island, and Cachagua Island, from December 2011 to January 2012. Concentration of metals was determined by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry, whereas porphyrins levels were measured by fluorimetric analysis. Concentrations (dry weight) of Cu (199.67 μg g-1), As (7.85 μg g-1), and Pb (12.78 μg g-1) were higher (p≤0.05) in Cachagua Island. Colonies from Pan de Azúcar Island showed the highest levels of Hg (0.76 μg g -1), Cd (47.70 μg g-1), and Zn (487.10 μg g -1). Samples from Cachagua Island showed the highest (p≤0.05) levels of copro- (2.16 nmol g-1), uro- (2.20 nmol g-1), and protoporphyrins (2.23 nmol g-1). There was a positive correlation between the metals As, Pb, and Cu with uro-, copro-, and protoporphyrins. The results indicated that penguin colonies from Cachagua Island are more exposed to metal contamination than penguin colonies from Pan de Azúcar and Chañaral Islands, thus being more likely to develop certain diseases caused by contamination with metals. Considering biomagnification, the metals detected in the excreta of Humboldt penguins can be a source of contamination from marine environments to terrestrial ecosystems, which could also affect other living organisms. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media.

ABSTRACT: Reliable estimates of survival and dispersal are crucial to understanding population dynamics, but for seabirds, in which some individuals spend years away from land, mortality and emigration are often confounded. Multistate mark-recapture methods reduce bias by incorporating movement into the process of estimating survival. We used a multistate model to provide unbiased age-specific survival and movement probabilities for the Endangered African Penguin Spheniscus demersus based on 5281 nestlings and 31 049 adults flipper-banded and resighted in the Western Cape, South Africa, between 1994 and 2012. Adult survival was initially high (≥ 0.74) but declined after 2003-2004 coincident with a reduction in the availability of Sardine Sardinops sagax and Anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus on the west coast of South Africa. Juvenile survival was poorly estimated, but was lower and more variable than adult survival. Fidelity to the locality of origin varied over time, but was high in adults at Robben and Dassen islands (≥ 0.88) and above 0.55 for juvenile and immature Penguins at all localities. Movement occurred predominantly during 1994-2003 and was indicative of immigration to Robben and Dassen islands. Our results confirm that a prolonged period of adult mortality contributed to the observed decline in the African Penguin population and suggest a need for approaches operating over large spatial scales to ensure food security for marine top predators. © 2014 British Ornithologists' Union.

ABSTRACT: Conservation of migratory species requires an understanding of their migration path and pattern. We used band returns and satellite tracking to characterize the seasonal migration of Magellanic penguins breeding in southern Argentina, with the purpose of identifying an effective conservation approach for this species. Band returns show these penguins migrate annually to the coastal waters of northern Argentina, Uruguay, and southern Brazil, an average one-way distance of approximately 2000. km, and a modal distance of 2300-2400. km. Satellite data indicate that the penguins follow a migration corridor within 250. km of shore. Mean migration distance varied among years. Juveniles migrated farther on average than older birds, although migration distance of different age classes overlapped substantially. Mortality rates during migration were higher among younger birds, and juvenile mortality rate during migration was inversely correlated with cohort survival, indicating that mortality during migration is an important determinant of population recruitment. A minimum of 13% of the migration-period mortality we recorded resulted from fisheries bycatch and oil pollution. Because of the penguin's mode of travel (swimming at or near the surface), the large spatial extent of its migration, and the intensity of human use of the area, effective conservation through conventional coastal marine reserves is unlikely. Marine zoning is an alternative that could provide the spatial scale and flexibility necessary to accommodate both penguin migration and human activities. As the waters traversed by Magellanic penguins are among the most threatened in Latin America, zoning for protection of this wide-ranging and charismatic species can also protect regional biodiversity. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Incidental capture at trawlers has been recognized as a significant source of seabird mortality, and is considered one of the main threats to seabirds at sea. The understanding of seabird-fishery interactions and of factors influencing individual mortality is fundamental to develop management actions and help protect seabird populations. We quantified seasonal and annual variability in Magellanic Penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) incidental captures and explored factors which may be influencing their by-catch at coastal trawlers targeting either Argentine Red Shrimp (Pleoticus muelleri) or Argentine Hake (Merluccius hubbsi) in the Isla Escondida fishing area, Argentina, for the months encompassing most of the penguin's breeding period (October-February) of the 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2012 fishing seasons (n=2336 hauls). A total of 203 penguins were incidentally caught in nets, with rates that varied between months and years. Mean monthly capture rate was 0.087 birds haul-1, and ranged between 0.01 and 2.07 birds per haul. All captured penguins were adult individuals. Incidental capture occurred almost exclusively when targeting Argentine Hake (97.5% of cases) and during 2009. Incidental captures were more likely to occur when vessels operated closer to penguin colonies, with 85% of incidental captures occurring at less than 45km. Vessels targeting hake operated significantly closer to the colonies than those targeting shrimp. Incidental capture of Magellanic Penguins in coastal trawlers in the study area appears to be highly variable and relatively low. Our results suggest that in the event Magellanic Penguin mortality at coastal trawlers becomes a conservation issue, spatial and temporal closures focused on the Argentine hake could be used as potential measures to reduce penguin by-catch, complementing the effective implementation of a marine protected area. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Summary: The exceptionally long (c. 11 months) growth period of king penguin chicks (Aptenodytes patagonicus) is interrupted by the Austral winter. As a consequence, penguin chicks born late in the breeding season have little time to build-up their energy reserves before the drastic energy bottleneck they experience during winter and face greater risks of mortality than early-born chicks. Whereas it is well known that breeding adults alternate between early- and late-breeding attempts, little is known on the phenotype of early- and late-chicks, and on the potential existence of specific adaptive phenotypic responses in late-born individuals. We investigated phenotypic differences between early- and late-chicks and tested their survival correlates both before the winter and at fledgling. Chicks were sampled 10 days after hatching to measure body mass, plasma corticosterone levels, oxidative stress parameters and telomere length. Late-chicks were heavier than early-chicks at day 10. Late-chicks also had higher corticosterone and oxidative stress levels, shorter telomere lengths and suffered from higher mortality rates than early-chicks. For both early- and late-chicks, high body mass close to hatching was a strong predictor of survival up to, and over, the winter period. In late but not early-chicks, high corticosterone levels and long telomeres were significant predictors of survival up to winter and fledging, respectively. Our study provides evidence that late- and early-king penguin chicks showed marked phenotypic differences 10 days after hatching. We provide an integrative discussion on whether these differences may be adaptive or not, and to what extent they may be driven by active maternal effects, indirectly induced by environmental effects, or stem from individual differences in parental quality. © 2013 British Ecological Society.

ABSTRACT: How natural climate cycles, such as past glacial/interglacial patterns, have shaped species distributions at the high-latitude regions of the Southern Hemisphere is still largely unclear. Here, we show how the post-glacial warming following the Last Glacial Maximum (ca 18 000 years ago), allowed the (re)colonization of the fragmented sub-Antarctic habitat by an upperlevel marine predator, the king penguin Aptenodytes patagonicus. Using restriction site-associated DNA sequencing and standard mitochondrial data, we tested the behaviour of subsets of anonymous nuclear loci in inferring past demography through coalescent-based and allele frequency spectrum analyses. Our results show that the king penguin population breeding on Crozet archipelago steeply increased in size, closely following the Holocene warming recorded in the Epica Dome C ice core. The following population growth can be explained by a threshold model in which the ecological requirements of this species (year-round ice-free habitat for breeding and access to a major source of food such as the Antarctic Polar Front) were met on Crozet soon after the Pleistocene/Holocene climatic transition. © 2014 The Authors Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Patterns of species abundance distribution (SAD) are driven by a given species’ physiology, life history attributes and environmental variables, and this is true of the Humboldt Penguin Spheniscus humboldti. Climate variability such as El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has impacted this species and other marine fauna in the eastern South Pacific Ocean. After reviewing manuscripts and reports, we identified 80 Humboldt Penguin breeding colonies, distributed from La Foca Island (05°12′S, 81°12′W) in Peru to Metalqui Island (42°12′S, 74°09′W) in Chile, but reduced the number to 73 after fieldwork surveys in northern Chile. At least three Humboldt Penguin colonies at the southern end of the Humboldt Penguin’s range also include Magellanic Penguins S. magellanicus. The Humboldt Penguin population of the main breeding colony in Peru, Punta San Juan, decreased 51% from 1980 to 2008, with notable decreases during El Niño. On the other hand, the population of Chañaral Island to the south increased 89% during the same period, which could be a result of irruption from more northern populations as well as past underestimation. The SAD does not follow the expected unimodal log-normal shaped model, and its shape has recently shifted significantly southward. This change is consistent with the species’ pattern of long distance movement during ENSO, reduced population genetic structure and long-distance gene flow between colonies, indicating the absence of philopatry, a decrease in population size in the main colonies in Peru and an increase in population size in colonies along northern Chile. The change in SAD might result from interactions between consecutive El Niño events, human activities and climate change. To better understand this pattern, further studies are required in population genetic structure, species physiology, and environmental variables in space and time. © 2014, Marine Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: Taxonomic studies were performed on an agarase-producing strain, designated WV33T, isolated from faeces of Antarctic penguins. Cells of strain WV33T were Gram-staining-negative, strictly aerobic, orange and rod-shaped. Strain WV33T displayed agarase activity and was able to utilize galactose as a sole carbon source. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strain WV33T was closely related to Flavobacterium algicola TC2T (98.0 % similarity), F. frigidarium ATCC 700810T (96.9 %) and F. frigoris LMG 21922T (96.1 %). The predominant cellular fatty acids were iso-C15: 1 G, iso-C15: 0, C15: 0, C16: 0 and summed feature 3 (comprising iso-C15: 0 2-OH and/or C16: 1ω7c). Menaquinone 6 (MK-6) was the sole quinone identified, and the major pigment was zeaxanthin. The major polar lipid was phosphatidylethanolamine. DNA-DNA relatedness of strain WV33T with respect to its closest phylogenetic neighbours was 25 % for F. algicola NBRC 102673T, 23 % for F. frigidarium DSM 17623T and 21 % for F. frigoris DSM 15719T.

ABSTRACT: Heart rate (H) contributes to control of blood oxygen (O2) depletion through regulation of the magnitude of pulmonary gas exchange and of peripheral blood flow in diving vertebrates such as penguins. Therefore, we measured H during foraging trip dives of emperor penguins Aptenodytes forsteri equipped with digital electrocardiogram (ECG) recorders and time depth recorders (TDRs). Median dive H (total heartbeats/duration, 64 beats min1) was higher than resting H (56 beats min1) and was negatively related to dive duration. Median dive H in dives greater than the 5.6 min aerobic dive limit (ADL; dive duration associated with the onset of a net accumulation of lactic acid above resting levels) was significantly less than the median dive H of dives less than the ADL (58 vs. 66 beats min1). H profile patterns differed between shallow (<50 m) and deep dives (>250 m), with values usually declining to levels near resting H in shallow, short-duration dives, and to levels as low as 10 beats min1 during the deepest segments of deep dives. The total number of heartbeats in a dive was variable in shallow dives and consistently high in deep dives. A true bradycardia (H below resting levels) during segments of 31% of shallow and deep dives of emperor penguins is consistent with reliance on myoglobin-bound O2 stores for aerobic muscle metabolism that is especially accentuated during the severe bradycardias of deep dives. Although H is low during the deepest segments of deep dives, the total number and distribution of heartbeats in deep, long dives suggest that pulmonary gas exchange and peripheral blood flow primarily occur at shallow depths. © Inter-Research 2014.

ABSTRACT: The tongue of birds presents diversified morphologic characteristics, related directly their feeding habits and may be adapted to food capture. Penguins of the Spheniscidae family are pelagic birds that are totally adapted to the marine environment. The objective of this study was to describe the morphology of the tongue in Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus). In order to investigate these characteristics, six tongues of juvenile S. magellanicus were collected and their morphology analyzed macroscopically and microscopically. The tongue of the Magellanic penguin has a fusiform shape with a round apex that is narrower than the root, following the shape of the beak. The epithelium of the tongue of the Magellanic penguin showed to be stratified and very keratinized, with the presence of lingual papillae that showed a caudally inclined apex. The neighboring connective tissue showed absence of mucous glands. The cartilaginous skeleton was observed in the medial region of the tongue, extending from the base to the apex. The structure of the tongue of the Magellanic penguin showed to be similar to that of other penguin species, but also showed peculiar characteristics that were not observed in other bird families. © 2014, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

ABSTRACT: Yellow-eyed penguins (hoiho, Megadyptes antipodes) are a Nationally Vulnerable species, restricted in distribution to the lower South Island, Stewart Island/Rakiura, and the New Zealand sub-Antarctic islands. The foraging behaviour of penguins is considered an indicator of marine ecosystems because when breeding they rely on the availability of prey close to their nests. Time-depth recorders were attached to eight nesting hoiho at Port Pegasus/Pikihatiti, Stewart Island. While at sea, hoiho spent 55% of their time diving in water > 3 m deep. Their mean dive depth was 61 ± 6.1 m with mean dive duration 2 ± 0.1 min. Based on bathymetric charts, hoiho could undertake these dives < 10 km from their nesting sites. There was significant variability in hoiho foraging behaviour within New Zealand depending on bathymetry and anthropogenic impacts. Understanding hoiho foraging behaviours could help to determine to what extent they impact on this species' life history and its role as an ecosystem indicator. © 2014 © 2014 The Royal Society of New Zealand.

ABSTRACT: We present a design for a simple, inexpensive leg band for mounting GLS tags on penguins. It causes a low level of injury and can be made from materials and tools that are readily available. We provide information on captive and field trials and outline deployment strategies that improve recovery rates. This device should facilitate further studies of penguin winter movements using geolocation.

ABSTRACT: Pseudaptenodytes macraei is redescribed in detail using current avian anatomical terminology. The age of the species is constrained to the late Miocene, and two humeral autapomorphies are identified for the species: a flattened elliptical ventral portion of the fossa tricipitalis and a curved margo cranialis lacking a preaxial angle. Pseudaptenodytes macraei is a distinct taxon based on a diagnostic-type specimen, but it is recommended that the nominal congener Pseudaptenodytes minor be designated a nomen dubium pending the discovery of more complete material © 2014 Association of Australasian Palaeontologists.

ABSTRACT: Life-history variables evolve in response to cost-benefit trade-offs. For birds, larger eggs are thought to be beneficial for development of offspring but are energetically costly to produce. Further, egg-size dimorphism within or between clutches can vary with proximate and ultimate causes. We undertook a correlational study to evaluate parental investment in eggs by Magellanic Penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) and how it affects the growth and survival of nestlings in Puerto Deseado, Argentina, over 3 years. We evaluated the variables that affected egg-volume and yolk-area (using a non-destructive technique), and determined the effects of egg-volume and yolk-area on growth and survival of young. Females in good body-condition laid larger second eggs and, in good years (i.e. years of high reproductive success in the colonies of the study area), yolk-area of second eggs was larger than that of first eggs. We found a positive association between egg-volume and nestling body-size and yolk-area was positively related to nestling survival. Our results suggest that the size of eggs within clutches varied with year and female body-condition. Moreover we demonstrate for the first time that yolk-area is a strong predictor of nestling survival in Magellanic Penguins. © BirdLife Australia 2014.

ABSTRACT: The loss of the expedition ship SY Endurance, and the subsequent dispersal of staff and crew, resulted in very little scientific information emerging from the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition 1914-1917. Among surviving records were the charts and diaries maintained by the ship's master, F.A. Worsley. During the voyage in January 1915 along the ice cliffs of the Weddell Sea coast, Worsley recorded the ship's daily progress, soundings and trawling and dredging activities, and also daily encounters with seals, whales and seabirds, On 12 January he noted a group of fledgling emperor penguin chicks (Aptenodytes forsteri) on an ice foot, clearly a remnant of what was then only the third-known breeding colony of the species. Shackleton's first published account of the expedition mentioned the chicks only in a brief note (one that was omitted from later editions), and no further report covering Worsley's observations appeared in scientific literature. In consequence the discovery of the breeding colony and records of emperor penguin distribution along the Weddell Sea coast have since been overlooked by avian biologists, regrettably including the present author. This paper discusses the identity of the colony, Worsley's observations that foreshadowed the later discovery of more breeding concentrations along the coast, and a possible reason why colonies occur at points of particular glaciological disturbance. © Cambridge University Press 2013.

ABSTRACT: Papillomaviruses are epitheliotropic viruses that have circular dsDNA genomes encapsidated in non-enveloped virions. They have been found to infect a variety of mammals, reptiles and birds, but so far they have not been found in amphibians. Using a next-generation sequencing de novo assembly contig-informed recovery, we cloned and Sanger sequenced the complete genome of a novel papillomavirus from the faecal matter of Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) nesting on Ross Island, Antarctica. The genome had all the usual features of a papillomavirus and an E9 ORF encoding a protein of unknown function that is found in all avian papillomaviruses to date. This novel papillomavirus genome shared ~60 % pairwise identity with the genomes of the other three known avian papillomaviruses: Fringilla coelebs papillomavirus 1 (FcPV1), Francolinus leucoscepus papillomavirus 1 (FlPV1) and Psittacus erithacus papillomavirus 1. Pairwise identity analysis and phylogenetic analysis of the major capsid protein gene clearly indicated that it represents a novel species, which we named Pygoscelis adeliae papillomavirus 1 (PaCV1). No evidence of recombination was detected in the genome of PaCV1, but we did detect a recombinant region (119 nt) in the E6 gene of FlPV1 with the recombinant region being derived from ancestral FcPV1-like sequences. Previously only paramyxoviruses, orthomyxoviruses and avian pox viruses have been genetically identified in penguins; however, the majority of penguin viral identifications have been based on serology or histology. This is the first report, to our knowledge, of a papillomavirus associated with a penguin species. © 2014 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Juvenile survival is an important demographic parameter. Southern Rockhopper Penguins Eudyptes chrysocome have undergone a dramatic population decline in the past century across their distribution, but the demographic processes are poorly understood. To estimate juvenile annual survival probabilities, Rockhopper Penguin chicks from two cohorts on New Island, Falkland Islands, were marked with transponders and recorded in subsequent years using an automated gateway. We first estimated annual survival and detection probabilities using a Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) model, and found that both probabilities were extremely high (81% in the first and 98% in the second, third and fourth years of life), even in comparison with adult birds. Because detection probability after 3 years was effectively 1, and our sample size (n = 114) was too small to explore the effects of individual traits on survival in a CJS model, we assessed whether sex, cohort, body mass and laying sequence affected whether juveniles returned to the colony during their first 3 years of life using a simple generalized linear model that assumed perfect detection. Juveniles from the first cohort and males showed a higher return probability than juveniles from the second cohort and females. There was no clear effect of fledging body mass on return rate, probably related to the favourable environmental conditions during the study period. The laying sequence did not markedly affect the return probability of chicks, indicating that, once fledged, first-laid A-chicks have the same probability to return as second-laid B-chicks despite a much larger initial maternal investment in B-eggs in this species. This study demonstrates extraordinarily high juvenile survival probabilities and will help to understand the recent changes in the population dynamics of the Falkland Islands Southern Rockhopper Penguins. © 2014 British Ornithologists' Union.

ABSTRACT: Background: Sexual segregation in vertebrate foraging niche is often associated with sexual size dimorphism (SSD), i.e., ecological sexual dimorphism. Although foraging behavior of male and female seabirds can vary markedly, differences in isotopic (carbon, δ13C and nitrogen, δ15N) foraging niche are generally more pronounced within sexually dimorphic species and during phases when competition for food is greater. We examined ecological sexual dimorphism among sympatric nesting Pygoscelis penguins asking whether environmental variability is associated with differences in male and female prebreeding foraging niche. We predicted that all Pygoscelis species would forage sex-specifically, and that higher quality winter habitat, i.e., higher or lower sea ice coverage for a given species, would be associated with a more similar foraging niche among the sexes. Results: P2/P8 primers reliably amplified DNA of all species. On average, male Pygoscelis penguins are structurally larger than female conspecifics. However, chinstrap penguins were more sexually dimorphic in culmen and flipper features than Adélie and gentoo penguins. Adélies and gentoos were more sexually dimorphic in body mass than chinstraps. Only male and female chinstraps and gentoos occupied separate δ15N foraging niches. Strong year effects in δ15N signatures were documented for all three species, however, only for Adélies, did yearly variation in δ15N signatures tightly correlate with winter sea ice conditions. There was no evidence that variation in sex-specific foraging niche interacted with yearly winter habitat quality. Conclusion: Chinstraps were most sexually size dimorphic followed by gentoos and Adélies. Pre-breeding sex-specific foraging niche was associated with overall SSD indices across species; male chinstrap and gentoo penguins were enriched in δ15N relative to females. Our results highlight previously unknown trophic pathways that link Pygoscelis penguins with variation in Southern Ocean sea ice suggesting that each sex within a species should respond similarly in pre-breeding trophic foraging to changes in future winter habitat. © 2014 Gorman et al.

ABSTRACT: The African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) population in southern Africa has experienced rapid decline in the 20th century and as of 2010 is listed as "endangered" on the IUCN Red List. There is an urgent need for decision support tools to enable effective management of colonies. We present a system dynamics model of the penguin population on Robben Island, South Africa, that combines a demographic simulation with the modelling of multiple pressures including food availability and food competition by commercial fisheries, oil spills, predation by terrestrial and marine predators, and extreme climate events. The model is stochastic, stage-specific and resource-driven, and incorporates both well-defined, quantitative field data and qualitative expert opinion. Survival rates for eggs, chicks, immatures and adults were adapted from field data and an earlier model of this population to create a simulation of a stable population used in a variety of scenarios and sensitivity tests. The modelled population was found to be strongly driven by food availability and to a lesser degree by oiling and marine predation, while climate events and terrestrial predation had low impacts. Food biomass levels (small pelagic fish) in the penguins' foraging area around the island (used during nesting) and further afield (used during the rest of the year) had an equal influence in driving population development in the short and long run. The impact of short-term (three years) fishing restrictions currently being trialled around the island was found to be generally beneficial to the modelled population, but easily masked by food-driven variability in population growth. The model produced population dynamics similar to those observed in 1988-2009 when immigration and a plausible change in predation pressure during this period were simulated. The model is being extended to other colonies to provide tools for specific management decisions and to enable the study of meta-populations by modelling migration between colonies. Our results suggest that improving food availability and mitigating the impact of oiling would have the highest beneficial impact on this penguin population. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: We studied leucocyte levels in several Antarctic and non-Antarctic penguins. A total of 107 blood samples of chinstrap Pygoscelis antarctica, gentoo P. papua and Ad61ie P. adeliae penguins at Isla 25 de Mayo/King George Island (South Shetland Islands, Antarctica) and Magellanic penguins Spheniscus magellanicus at Peninsula Valdás (Chubut, Argentina), were collected and analysed during the 2009-2010 breeding season. We observed that chinstrap and Ad61ie penguins had lower total leucocyte counts than Magellanic and gentoo penguins. We provide some potential explanations for species differences in leucocyte levels.

ABSTRACT: Conflicts may arise within a moving animal group if its members have different preferred destinations. Many theoretical models suggest that in maintaining group cohesion conflicting preferences can have an overwhelming influence on decision making. However, empirical studies, especially on wild animals, remain limited. Here, we introduce a new study system for investigating collective decision making: king penguins, Aptenodytes patagonicus. Their gregarious lifestyle, the colony's organization into subgroups and group travel make king penguins especially interesting for studying collective movements. Chicks spend their first year of life in groups with other chicks (crèches), and if displaced will return to their crèche. We examined how different levels of navigational conflict affect such homing, by comparing the performance of pairs of chicks from the same crèche with pairs from different crèches. The majority of chicks in both treatments travelled at least part of the journey together; when doing so they were more efficient and faster than individuals travelling alone. Chicks took turns in leading and following. Chicks with a common destination (same-crèche pairs) were more precise at homing and less likely to split up than those with a conflict over preferred destinations (different-crèche pairs). Our results support some, but not all, predictions derived from theoretical models. © 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: The spinal column of early Antarctic penguins is poorly known, mainly due to the scarcity of articulated vertebrae in the fossil record. One of the most interesting segments of this part of the skeleton is the transitional series located at the root of the neck. Here, two such cervicodorsal series, comprising reinterpreted known material and a new specimen from the Eocene of Seymour Island (Antarctic Peninsula), were investigated and contrasted with those of modern penguins and some fossil bones. The new specimen is smaller than the counterpart elements in recent king penguins, whereas the second series belonged to a large-bodied penguin from the genus Palaeeudyptes. It had been assigned by earlier researchers to P. gunnari (a species of "giant" penguins) and a Bayesian analysis-a Bayes factor approach based on size of an associated tarsometatarsus-strongly supported such an assignment. Morphological and functional studies revealed that mobility within the aforementioned segment probably did not differ substantially between extant and studied fossil penguins. There were, however, intriguing morphological differences between the smaller fossil specimen and the comparative material related to the condition of the lateral excavation in the first cervicodorsal vertebra and the extremely small size of the intervertebral foramen located just prior to the first "true" thoracic vertebra. The former feature could have resulted from discrepancy in severity of external pneumatization. Both fossils provided valuable insights into the morphology and functioning of the axial skeleton in early penguins. © 2014 P. Jadwiszczak.

ABSTRACT: Seabirds have to deal with environmental variability and are predicted to modulate foraging behavior to maximize fitness, with particularly strong selection pressure for optimal behavior during chick provisioning when energy demands are high. We reported data from 42 breeding birds equipped during the early chick-rearing period with depth recorders at four different colonies [Punta Norte (42°S), Bahía Bustamante (45°S), Puerto Deseado (47°S) and Puerto San Julián (49°S)] in patagonian Argentina. Although Magellanic penguins are purported to show little flexibility in foraging behavior, we discovered marked inter-colony differences in diving behavior. Even though the southern marine ecosystems, in general, and the area exploited by Magellanic penguins from the studied colonies, in particular, are usually characterized by their stability, we cannot entirely exclude that interannual differences may have also affected our results. The colonies located in the center of the breeding distribution, Bahía Bustamante and Puerto Deseado, showed the greatest diving and foraging effort with Bahía Bustamante penguins having the deepest and longest dives of all birds and requiring the longest post-dive recovery durations at the surface. Puerto Deseado had the birds with the highest values of diving effort parameters. Penguins from both colonies also had the highest descent and ascent rates during dives. We assume that the clear variation in diving behavior reflects the response of the birds to the varying prey types and availability around the different colonies, but note that, despite this, some colonies fare markedly better than others in breeding. © 2014 Dt.

ABSTRACT: Understanding how top predators respond to natural and anthropogenically induced changes in their environment is a major conservation challenge especially in marine environments. We used a multidisciplinary approach to explore the mechanisms through which a typical central-place forager, the Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) from the Chubut province of Argentina, responds to variations in oceanic conditions and prey resources. We combined habitat and species distribution modeling with isotopic dietary reconstructions based on blood λ13C and λ15N values to quantify the role of bathymetry, sea-surface temperature and chlorophyll-a concentration, abundance of conspecifics, and extent of fisheries activities in explaining the foraging and feeding ecology of individuals breeding at different colonies. The at-sea distribution of penguins was tightly coupled with the spatial distribution of their staple prey species, anchovies (Engraulis anchoita), especially in areas over the continental shelf (>200 m depth), with relatively warm water (from 16 to 21C), and moderate abundances of conspecifics (from 50 to 250 individuals). Competition with conspecifics and human fisheries were also identified as important factors explaining penguin diet with decreasing relative contributions of anchovies with increasing abundance of conspecifics and fishing activity. Our multifactorial approach allowed us to simultaneously explore different physical, biological and anthropogenic features likely affecting marine resource availability, and, consequently, driving the feeding and foraging ecology of this central-place forager. Our approach can be extended to a large suite of central-place foragers, thus providing important advances in the way we investigate how to effectively conserve and manage these species. © 2014 Ramírez et al.

ABSTRACT: Current research on seabirds suggests a key role of hormones in the trade-off between self-maintenance and parental investment through their influence on foraging decisions during the breeding period. Although prolactin is known to have major effects on parental care, its role in foraging behavior has rarely been investigated in seabirds to date. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of an experimental decrease in prolactin levels on foraging decisions and its consequences on breeding success in free-living seabirds. To achieve this, we implanted bromocriptine (an inhibitor of prolactin secretion) in male Adélie penguins ( Pygoscelis adeliae), monitored their foraging behavior using time-depth recorders over several trips, and recorded their reproductive output.On average 8 ± 0.5. days after implantation, we showed that bromocriptine administration led to an efficient decrease in prolactin levels. However, no differences were seen in foraging trip durations between bromocriptine-implanted birds and controls. Moreover, the time spent diving and the number of dives performed per trip were similar in both groups. By contrast, all diving parameters (including diving efficiency) were negatively affected by the treatment during the first at-sea trip following the treatment. Finally, the treatment did not affect adult body condition or chick growth and survival.Our study highlights the short-term negative effect of low prolactin levels on diving effort, but indicates that a short-term and/or low-magnitude decrease in prolactin levels alone is not sufficient to modify consistently the body maintenance or the parental investment of Adélie penguins. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Over the past two decades, behavioural biologists and ecologists have made effective use of the comparative method, but have often stopped short of adopting an explicitly phylogenetic approach. We examined 68 behaviour and life history (BLH) traits of 15 penguin species to: (i) infer penguin phylogeny, (ii) assess homology of behavioural characters, and (iii) evaluate hypotheses about character evolution and ancestral states. Parsimony analysis of the BLH dataset found either two shortest trees (characters coded as unordered) or a single shortest tree (characters coded as a combination of unordered and Dollo). The BLH data had significant structure. Kishino-Hasegawa tests indicated that BLH trees were significantly different from most previous estimates of penguin phylogeny. The BLH phylogeny generated from Dollo characters appeared to be less accurate than the tree derived from the completely unordered dataset. Dividing BLH data into display and non-display traits resulted in no significant differences in level of homoplasy and no difference in the accuracy of phylogeny. Tests for homology of BLH traits were performed by mapping the characters onto a molecular tree. Assuming that independent gains are less likely than losses of character states, 65 of the 68 characters were likely to be homologous across taxa, and at least several characters appeared to have been stable since the origin of modern penguins around 30 Myr. Finally, the likely BLH traits of the most recent common ancestor of extant penguins were reconstructed from character states along the internal branch leading to the penguins. This analysis suggested that the "proto-penguin" probably had a similar life history to current temperate penguins but few ritualized behaviours. A southern, cool-temperate origin of penguins is suggested. © The Willi Hennig Society 2013.

ABSTRACT: Plotopterids (Aves: Plotopteridae) are extinct flightless birds that were endemic to the North Pacific Ocean. As flightless, wing-propelled diving birds they exhibit similar skeletal morphology to Sphenisciformes (penguins), especially in their wings. In contrast to the similarity, Plotopteridae have been placed in (traditional) Pelecaniformes in most palaeontological and phylogenetic studies, based on shared characters that are absent in penguins. The postcranial morphology of Plotopteridae has been well studied, but little is known about the cranial morphology, particularly the nervous system. The brain morphology of Plotopteridae, compared with other water birds, could prompt a reconsideration of those previous phylogenetic hypotheses, as the cranial morphology is conservative and could provide powerful signals for the phylogenetic reconstruction. In order to compare the brain morphology of Plotopteridae with that in other water birds (Ciconiiformes, Pelecaniformes, Suliformes, Procellariiformes, and Sphenisciformes), we generated virtual endocasts of Plotopteridae and extant water birds. We investigated the brain morphology of those birds using three-dimensional geometric morphometric and linear measuring methods. The width of the cerebellum and the length of the floccular lobe varied considerably among water birds, and the relative lengths separate Procellariiformes+Sphenisciformes from Ciconiiformes+Pelecaniformes+Suliformes. The former group had a relatively wider cerebellum and longer floccular lobe, whereas the latter group had a relatively narrower cerebellum and shorter floccular lobe. The relative width of the cerebellum and length of the floccular lobe in Plotopteridae was comparable with that of the former group, in addition to many morphological similarities to the Sphenisciformes brain. On the basis of brain morphology alone, we dare not conclude that Plotopteridae forms a clade with, or belongs to, Sphenisciformes; however, the brain configuration of Plotopteridae is distinctly close to that of penguins, and could possibly reflect their phylogenetic relationship. © 2013 The Linnean Society of London.

ABSTRACT: Summary African Penguins Spheniscus demersus naturally breed in guano burrows which provide shelter from predators and extreme weather conditions. Past guano harvesting has removed this habitat and artificial nests of different types have been deployed, with previous research identifying variable success of these different types. We investigated climatic conditions in two types of artificial nests, and compared them to natural burrows and surface nests for two weeks in the incubation and early chick-rearing phases of the 2012 summer breeding season on Bird Island, Algoa Bay, South Africa. We also compared breeding success since 2009 between some of these nest types. Natural burrows remained the best insulated from extremes of temperature and humidity, with temperatures consistently higher and humidity consistently lower than in exposed nests and the two types of artificial nests. Fibreglass nests retained temperatures > 30°C, when Spheniscus penguins start being heat-stressed, for the longest periods of time. Sustained high temperatures will induce increased energy expenditure associated with active thermoregulation for birds in these nests. The combination of high temperatures and low humidity could also have contributed to damaging water loss in the eggs and reduced egg survival, as suggested by the consistent lower hatching success in the fibreglass nests. Cement nests had more moderate temperatures than fibreglass nests and higher breeding success, possibly due to superior ventilation. Vegetation cover had no effect on the temperature regime inside fibreglass nests. To maximise conservation efforts for these endangered penguins, additional research should be conducted towards engineering artificial nests that better mimic the conditions of natural burrows. © BirdLife International 2014.

ABSTRACT: Understanding the demographic response of free-living animal populations to different drivers is the first step towards reliable prediction of population trends. Penguins have exhibited dramatic declines in population size, and many studies have linked this to bottom-up processes altering the abundance of prey species. The effects of individual traits have been considered to a lesser extent, and top-down regulation through predation has been largely overlooked due to the difficulties in empirically measuring this at sea where it usually occurs. For 10 years (2003-2012), macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus) were marked with subcutaneous electronic transponder tags and re-encountered using an automated gateway system fitted at the entrance to the colony. We used multistate mark-recapture modelling to identify the different drivers influencing survival rates and a sensitivity analysis to assess their relative importance across different life stages. Survival rates were low and variable during the fledging year (mean = 0·33), increasing to much higher levels from age 1 onwards (mean = 0·89). We show that survival of macaroni penguins is driven by a combination of individual quality, top-down predation pressure and bottom-up environmental forces. The relative importance of these covariates was age specific. During the fledging year, survival rates were most sensitive to top-down predation pressure, followed by individual fledging mass, and finally bottom-up environmental effects. In contrast, birds older than 1 year showed a similar response to bottom-up environmental effects and top-down predation pressure. We infer from our results that macaroni penguins will most likely be negatively impacted by an increase in the local population size of giant petrels. Furthermore, this population is, at least in the short term, likely to be positively influenced by local warming. More broadly, our results highlight the importance of considering multiple causal effects across different life stages when examining the survival rates of seabirds. © 2014 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Long-term dietary monitoring of seabirds can be used to relate population fluctuations to at-sea events. Stomach flushing is a conventional dietary monitoring technique, but has a number of disadvantages. Stable isotope analysis (SIA) is a less invasive method that provides unbiased dietary information over a longer period. We evaluated stable isotope analysis as a potential tool for monitoring long-term little penguin Eudyptula minor diet. We determined diet composition during the chick feeding stage using stomach flushing and SIA at three separate colonies, using spatial variation in diet as a surrogate for potential temporal variation. Bayesian isotopic mixing models were generated for blood and feathers to evaluate their ability to discriminate broad-scale (fish, squid, crustaceans) and fine-scale (individual prey species) diet composition. Differences in stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios were found between colonies: broad-scale isotopic mixing models predicted different proportional contributions of broad taxa (fish, cephalopod, crustacean) to diet than was indicated by stomach samples, reflecting the bias incurred by one-off stomach contents analysis. Fine-scale isotopic mixing models predicted proportional contributions of prey items with less certainty. Blood isotopic mixing models had narrower confidence intervals than models for feathers, but trends in δ15N for feathers mirrored those for blood. Our results suggest that relying on stomach contents analysis to detect shifts in prey consumption in little penguins could be very misleading, resulting in a less-than-complete idea of total prey consumption. SIA of little penguin tissues could be used to monitor dietary shifts across dissimilar taxa that may affect population numbers, but would fail to detect shifts between fish species. © 2014 Ecological Society of Australia.

ABSTRACT: To accommodate seasonal effects that change from year to year into models for the size of an open population we consider a time-varying coefficient model. We fit this model to a capture-recapture data set collected on the little penguin Eudyptula minor in south-eastern Australia over a 25. year period using Jolly-Seber type estimators and nonparametric P-spline techniques. The time-varying coefficient model identified strong changes in the seasonal pattern across the years which we further examined using functional data analysis techniques. To evaluate the methodology we also conducted several simulation studies that incorporate seasonal variation. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Numbers of gentoo penguins Pygoscelis papua and Crozet shags Phalacrocorax [atriceps] melanogenis breeding annually at Marion Island, one of South Africa's Prince Edward Islands in the South-West Indian Ocean, were strongly correlated over 19 split-years from 1994/1995 to 2012/2013. Both species decreased between the mid-1990s and the mid-2000s, exhibited a partial recovery in the late-2000s and then decreased to their lowest recorded levels in 2012/2013. In both instances, the partial recoveries in the late-2000s were associated with improved breeding success. At a colony of gentoo penguins, breeding success was negatively correlated with the date of arrival of adults to breed. Gentoo penguins and Crozet shags are demersal feeders in inshore waters around Marion Island and there is considerable overlap in the composition of their diets. Therefore, trends in their populations may be driven by food availability, which is likely to be influenced by benthic production around the island. We propose that, in South Africa, and based on the current assessment, the Crozet shag, which elsewhere breeds only at the Crozet Islands, is now Critically Endangered, and the more widely ranging gentoo penguin is Endangered. © 2014 Copyright © NISC (Pty) Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Summary: For seabirds that forage at sea but breed while fasting on land, successful reproduction depends on the effective management of energy stores. Additionally, breeding often means aggregating in dense colonies where social stress may affect energy budgets. Male king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) fast for remarkably long periods (up to 1·5 months) while courting and incubating ashore. Although their fasting capacities have been well investigated in captivity, we still know very little about the energetics of freely breeding birds. We monitored heart rate (HR, a proxy to energy expenditure), body temperature and physical activity of male king penguins during their courtship and first incubation shift in a colony of some 24 000 freely breeding pairs. Males were breeding either under low but increasing colony density (early breeders) or at high and stable density (late breeders). In early breeders, daily mean and resting HR decreased during courtship but increased again 3 days before egg laying and during incubation. In late breeders, HR remained stable throughout this same breeding period. Interestingly, the daily increase in resting HR we observed in early breeders was strongly associated with a marked increase in colony density over time. This finding remained significant even after controlling for climate effects. In both early and late breeders, courtship and incubation were associated with a progressive decrease in physical activity, whereas core body temperature remained unchanged. We discuss the roles of decreased physical activity and thermoregulatory strategies in sustaining the long courtship-incubation fast of male king penguins. We also draw attention to a potential role of conspecific density in affecting the energetics of breeding-fasting seabirds, that is, a potential energy cost to coloniality. © 2013 British Ecological Society.

ABSTRACT: Background: Two novel avipoxviruses from South Africa have been sequenced, one from a Feral Pigeon (Columba livia) (FeP2) and the other from an African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) (PEPV). We present a purpose-designed bioinformatics pipeline for analysis of next generation sequence data of avian poxviruses and compare the different avipoxviruses sequenced to date with specific emphasis on their evolution and gene content.Results: The FeP2 (282 kbp) and PEPV (306 kbp) genomes encode 271 and 284 open reading frames respectively and are more closely related to one another (94.4%) than to either fowlpox virus (FWPV) (85.3% and 84.0% respectively) or Canarypox virus (CNPV) (62.0% and 63.4% respectively). Overall, FeP2, PEPV and FWPV have syntenic gene arrangements; however, major differences exist throughout their genomes. The most striking difference between FeP2 and the FWPV-like avipoxviruses is a large deletion of ~16 kbp from the central region of the genome of FeP2 deleting a cc-chemokine-like gene, two Variola virus B22R orthologues, an N1R/p28-like gene and a V-type Ig domain family gene. FeP2 and PEPV both encode orthologues of vaccinia virus C7L and Interleukin 10. PEPV contains a 77 amino acid long orthologue of Ubiquitin sharing 97% amino acid identity to human ubiquitin.Conclusions: The genome sequences of FeP2 and PEPV have greatly added to the limited repository of genomic information available for the Avipoxvirus genus. In the comparison of FeP2 and PEPV to existing sequences, FWPV and CNPV, we have established insights into African avipoxvirus evolution. Our data supports the independent evolution of these South African avipoxviruses from a common ancestral virus to FWPV and CNPV. © 2014 Offerman et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Analgesia is an important part of veterinary medicine, but until recently there have been limited studies on analgesic drugs in avian species. Tramadol represents an orally administered opioid drug that has shown analgesic potential in numerous species, including mammals, birds, and reptiles. The objective of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of tramadol and its primary metabolite, O-desmethyltramadol (M1), after oral administration of tramadol hydrochloride (HCl) in African penguins (Spheniscus demersus). A dose of 10 mg/kg of tramadol HCl was administered orally to 15 birds, and blood was collected at various time points from 0 to 36 hr. Tramadol and M1 concentrations were determined and were consistent with therapeutic concentrations in humans through 12 hr in 9/15 birds for tramadol and 36 hr in 14/15 birds for M1. Based on these findings and a comparison with other avian studies, an oral dose of 10 mg/kg of tramadol once daily appears to be a promising analgesic option for African penguins. © American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Most species of penguins are sexual monomorphic and therefore it is difficult to visually identify their genders for monitoring population stability in terms of sex ratio analysis. In this study, we evaluated the suitability using melting curve analysis (MCA) for high-throughput gender identification of penguins. Preliminary test indicated that the Griffiths's P2/P8 primers were not suitable for MCA analysis. Based on sequence alignment of Chromo-Helicase-DNA binding protein (CHD)-W and CHD-Z genes from four species of penguins (Pygoscelis papua, Aptenodytes patagonicus, Spheniscus magellanicus, and Eudyptes chrysocome), we redesigned forward primers for the CHD-W/CHD-Z-common region (PGU-ZW2) and the CHD-W-specific region (PGU-W2) to be used in combination with the reverse Griffiths's P2 primer. When tested with P. papua samples, PCR using P2/PGU-ZW2 and P2/PGU-W2 primer sets generated two amplicons of 148- and 356-bp, respectively, which were easily resolved in 1.5% agarose gels. MCA analysis indicated the melting temperature (Tm) values for P2/PGU-ZW2 and P2/PGU-W2 amplicons of P. papua samples were 79.75°C-80.5°C and 81.0°C-81.5°C, respectively. Females displayed both ZW-common and W-specific Tm peaks, whereas male was positive only for ZW-common peak. Taken together, our redesigned primers coupled with MCA analysis allows precise high throughput gender identification for P. papua, and potentially for other penguin species such as A. patagonicus, S. magellanicus, and E. chrysocome as well. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

ABSTRACT: Research was conducted to examine seasonal seminal traits and to establish short-term and long-term sperm preservation methods in the king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus) for use in genome banking and artificial insemination (AI). Spermic ejaculates (n=87) obtained using a cooperative method were collected across multiple (n=6, Male 1) and a single (Male 2) breeding season(s). Non-contaminated ejaculates (n=69) were 0.36±0.32ml at 56.3±62.7×107sperm/ml with 85.3±10.6% total motility (TMot), 52.5±12.9% progressive motility (PMot), 86.6±24.3μm/sec average path velocity (VAP) and 92.3±3.7% plasma membrane intact. In vitro quality of chilled semen was best maintained over 48hr at 5°C than 21°C, with decreased (P<0.05) motility and morphology parameters observed by 24 and 6hr, respectively. A comparison of two freezing methods (straw [STR] vs. directional [DF]) demonstrated similar effects on post-thaw quality at 0 and 3hr, with the exception of plasma membrane integrity which was higher (P<0.05) at 0hr for DF (48.7±6.5%) than STR (41.2±7.0%). At 0hr post-thaw, DF samples retained 46%, 69%, and 52% of their initial PMot, VAP, and plasma membrane integrity, respectively. Normal morphology of motile cells was reduced (P<0.05) during freeze-thawing from 84% post-collection to 37% and 34% at 0 and 3hr post-thaw, respectively. Results indicate that chilled and cryopreserved semen from the king penguin has potential for use in AI. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Climate change has been projected to affect species distribution and future trends of local populations, but projections of global population trends are rare. We analyse global population trends of the emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri), an iconic Antarctic top predator, under the influence of sea ice conditions projected by coupled climate models assessed in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) effort. We project the dynamics of all 45 known emperor penguin colonies by forcing a sea-ice-dependent demographic model with local, colony-specific, sea ice conditions projected through to the end of the twenty-first century. Dynamics differ among colonies, but by 2100 all populations are projected to be declining. At least two-thirds are projected to have declined by >50% from their current size. The global population is projected to have declined by at least 19%. Because criteria to classify species by their extinction risk are based on the global population dynamics, global analyses are critical for conservation. We discuss uncertainties arising in such global projections and the problems of defining conservation criteria for species endangered by future climate change. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

ABSTRACT: Objective-To determine the effects of recumbency on air sac volume, lung volume, and lung densities in CT images of healthy, conscious and anesthetized spontaneously breathing Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti). Animals-25 adult (13 male and 12 female) Humboldt penguins. Procedures-CT images of conscious penguins in ventral recumbency and anesthetized penguins in dorsal, ventral, and right lateral recumbency were obtained. Air sac volume, lung volume, and lung densities in CT images were calculated. A paired samples t test was used to determine whether right and left lung densities differed among recumbencies. Repeated-measures ANOVA (controlled for sex and order of recumbencies during CT) was used to determine whether air sac or lung volumes differed among recumbencies. Results-Recumbency had a significant effect on air sac volume but not lung volume. Air sac volume was largest in conscious penguins in ventral recumbency (mean ± SD, 347.2 ± 103.1 cm3) and lowest in anesthetized penguins in dorsal recumbency (median, 202.0 cm3; 10th to 90th percentile, 129.2 to 280.3 cm3). Lung densities were highest in anesthetized penguins in dorsal recumbency (right lung median, 0.522 g/cm3; left lung median, 0.511 g/ cm3) and lowest in anesthetized penguins in ventral recumbency (right lung median, 0.488 g/cm3; left lung median, 0.482 g/cm3). Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Results indicated that anesthetized Humboldt penguins had the lowest air sac volume and highest lung densities in dorsal recumbency. Therefore, this recumbency may not be recommended. Minimal changes in lung volume were detected among recumbencies or between conscious and anesthetized penguins.

ABSTRACT: The synsacrum is an important element of the axial skeleton in birds, both volant and flightless. Little is known about the maturation of this complex bone in penguins. In this work, the supposedly ontogenetically youngest known synsacrum of early penguins was described. The analysis of this specimen, collected within the Eocene La Meseta Formation of Seymour (Marambio) Island, Antarctic Peninsula, revealed that this bird had attained at least the fledging stage of growth. Studies of three mature synsacra recovered from the same formation focused on the synsacral canals and, using indirect reasoning, their contents. These analyses revealed that the lumbosacral intumescence of the spinal cord and its extensions, the transverse canals, had been developed roughly like those in extant penguins (and also swifts and cormorants). The neural spine extensions (a non-nervous tissue) tracing the transverse grooves of the dorsal wall of the synsacral canal are currently considered as involved in the control of walking. The presented data suggest that such a sense organ gained its current penguin configuration by the late Eocene.

ABSTRACT: Sex-biased mortality can increase the risk of extinction of threatened populations. Numbers of the endangered African penguin Spheniscus demersus are decreasing rapidly and the smaller size of females, associated with their higher foraging effort during the breeding season, may place them at greater risk than males. Using records for the period 2004-2012 from a seabird rehabilitation centre in Cape Town, South Africa, we investigated the sex ratio of African penguins that died at the centre according to age class (adult, juvenile or chick) and cause of death (starvation/ parasitism/disease, injury/trauma or oiling). The large majority of adult and juvenile birds that died at the centre did so following starvation, parasitism or disease, rather than injury or oiling, and most of them (>60%) were females, whereas mortality of sexes was similar among chicks. Oiled birds received at the centre had high survival and release rates (93%); hence sex-biased mortality could not be determined for oiled birds. Female-biased mortality in African penguins could skew the adult sex ratio, which may further accelerate the rapid rate of decline of this species. © 2014 Copyright © NISC (Pty) Ltd.

ABSTRACT: We study the effects of heat loss and nest site quality on fecundity in a chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica) colony on Deception Island, Antarctica. During the austral summers of 1990-1991, 1993-1994, and 1995-1996, 441 randomly selected nests were analyzed. Penguins breeding in the center of subcolonies hatched significantly earlier and had larger broods and than those nesting near or at the edge of the subcolonies. These differences, however, were significantly affected by interaction between year and nest location, being highly significant in colder years, when peripheral nests produce fewer young. Analysis of the rate of heat loss showed that penguins breeding at the edge of subcolonies lost heat twice as rapidly as those breeding in the interior of the subcolony. In a re-occupation experiment, evacuated center nests were re-occupied almost ten times as rapidly as edge nests. An analysis of mean fecundity in the period 1991-1996 and mean wind chill suggested that most of the variability in fecundity among years was related to differences in the rate of heat loss. Subcolonies tend to be as circular as possible, thereby decreasing the proportion of edge nests as the size of subcolony increases. Our results support the site-dependent fecundity hypothesis. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: The presence of metals in Antarctica is becoming an issue that needs to be more investigated as human presence is increasing in the region, especially in the Antarctic Peninsula, where most of the polar animals, scientific bases and tourists are concentrated. Penguins are endemic species of Antarctica situated at the top of food web and are useful sentinels of pollution. To improve data of trace metal contamination in the Antarctic Peninsula region, concentrations of Cd, Pb, As, Cu and Zn in fresh excrement of penguins were determined by atomic absorption. Samples were collected in several locations during the 2011/2012 austral summer: eight sites (O'Higgins Station, Yankee Harbour, Mikkelsen Harbor, Danco Island, Gonzalez Videla Base, Yelcho Station and Brown Station) from gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) colonies and four locations (Hydrurga Rocks, Cape Shirreff, Narebski Point and Kopaitic Island) from chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica) colonies. Data showed that gentoo penguin colonies had higher levels of metals (μg g-1 dw) like Pb, Cu and Zn at locations such as O'Higgins (2.89 for Pb, 199.95 for Cu and 379.99 for Zn) and Gonzalez Videla (2.74 for Pb and 222.51 for Cu). Levels of Cd in excreta of chinstrap penguins were higher at Narebski Point (3.13 μg g-1). The levels of Pb, As, Cd, Cu and Zn were similar or even higher to those reported in excreta of the same species by previous studies at Antarctica. Data suggest that metals ingested by these two penguin species feeding in the sea end up in terrestrial ecosystems. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Ornithogenic or bird-formed soils haveaccumulated inmany coastal regions around Antarctica as a result of breeding activities by pygoscelid penguins, especially the Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae). These soils are often deep, range from hundreds to thousands of years old, and contain a natural archive of penguin tissues and those of their prey. In some regions, these tissues are extremely well preserved by the dry, cold environment and include complete and partial penguin mummies, feathers, bone, and eggshell. Hard parts of prey (fish bones, otoliths, and squid beaks) also commonly occur in these deposits from the penguin guano as it accumulates during soil development. Here,wereviewhowresearch on these soils and the tissues they contain has progressed since they were first identified and described. These studies have provided not only valuable information on penguin occupation history with climate change since the Pleistocene, but also whole ecosystemresponses to perturbations such as the 'krill surplus' that is hypothesized to have occurred following historic depletion of seals and whales in the 18the20th centuries. New findings in the Ross Sea indicate how penguin occupation and abandonment cycles have progressed over millennia in relation to climate change. In addition, stable isotope analysis of δ15N and δ13C in ancient and modern Adélie penguin tissues (feathers, bone, eggshell and membrane) and guano support the 'krill surplus' hypothesis in showing a dietary shift from fish to krill over the past ~200 years. Other recent studies have focused on stable isotope analyses of penguin prey remains, as well as ancient DNA and mercury analyses of penguin tissues recovered from ornithogenic soils. An analysis of fish otoliths recovered from ancient guano provide a means to investigate values of otolith carbonate δ18O, which correlates with other paleoclimatic records, and can be used as a proxy for changing ocean temperatures through time. In addition, measurements of total mercury (Hg) in penguin egg membrane from abandoned colonies up to 800 years old indicate significantly higher mercury levels in the past compared to modern penguins, likely due to a greater reliance on higher trophic prey prior to the proposed 'krill surplus'. All of these studies indicate that ornithogenic soils and the natural archive of tissues they contain provide a unique means to integrate both terrestrial and marine records with ecosystem studies and climate change, past and present, in Antarctica. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

ABSTRACT: A 13-yr-old male African black-footed penguin (Spheniscus demersus) presented thrice over 7 mo with gastrointestinal obstruction secondary to cloacolithiasis. Clinical signs consistently resolved with cloacolith removal and supportive care. However, 10 mo after initial presentation, it presented with similar signs, plus significant weight loss. No cloacolith was found, and it subsequently died. Significant gross findings included bilateral cecal masses, colonic perforation, and marked secondary coelomitis, multifocal tan to pale hepatic nodules, and pale kidneys with miliary white foci. Histopathologic diagnoses were intestinal lymphosarcoma with hepatic and renal metastases, secondary intestinal rupture, and subacute severe bacterial coelomitis. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first full report of either cloacolithiasis or lymphosarcoma in a penguin. © 2014 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Penguins play important roles in the biogeochemical cycle between Antarctic Ocean and land ecosystems. The roles of emperor penguin Aptenodytes forsteri, however, are usually ignored because emperor penguin breeds in fast sea ice. In this study, we collected two sediment profiles (EPI and PI) from the N island near a large emperor penguin colony at Amanda Bay, East Antarctic and performed stable isotope and element analyses. The organic C/N ratios and carbon and nitrogen isotopes suggested an autochthonous source of organic materials for the sediments of EPI (C/N=10.21±0.28, n=17; δ13C=-13.48±0.50‰, δ15N=8.35±0.55‰, n=4) and an allochthonous source of marine-derived organic materials for the sediments of PI (C/N=6.15±0.08, δ13C=-26.85±0.11‰, δ15N=21.21±2.02‰, n=20). The concentrations of total phosphorus (TP), selenium (Se), mercury (Hg) and zinc (Zn) in PI sediments were much higher than those in EPI, the concentration of copper (Cu) in PI was a little lower, and the concentration of element lead (Pb) showed no difference. As measured by the geoaccumulation indexes, Zn, TP, Hg and Se were from moderately to very strongly enriched in PI, relative to local mother rock, due to the guano input from juvenile emperor penguins. Because of its high trophic level and transfer efficiency, emperor penguin can transport a large amount of nutrients and contaminants from ocean to land even with a relatively small population, and its roles in the biogeochemical cycle between ocean and terrestrial environment should not be ignored. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses were performed on modern and Holocene Adélie penguin guano samples collected from ornithogenic soils along the Scott Coast (Southern Victoria Land, Antarctica), from Cape Irizar to Dunlop Island, and at Cape Bird (Ross Island). Guano samples also were sieved and sorted under stereomicroscope in order to select penguin dietary remains, such as fish bones and otoliths. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope composition, coupled with the taxonomic identification of fish otoliths from Scott Coast Holocene samples, indicated a mainly fish-based diet for this area, with Pleuragramma antarcticum as the most eaten prey throughout the investigated period (from 390cal BP to ca 7300cal BP). The isotopic values of Ross Island samples (from modern to 3850cal BP) showed a krill consumption increase in the samples younger than 2000cal BP, with the maximum in modern samples. Scott Coast and Ross Island Holocene samples showed δ13C and δ15N trends similar to those previously published from Terra Nova Bay (northern Victoria Land), whereas modern samples from Ross Island have similar δ15N composition but different δ13C values. This δ13C divergence started at ca 2000 BP and follows the abandonment of the Scott Coast colonies. The δ13C trend observed in Ross Island and Terra Nova Bay samples and the abandonment of the Scott Coast colonies could suggest the stability and the persistence of the previous oceanographic conditions (i.e. polynya) for the Terra Nova Bay area and the establishment of new conditions for water circulation in the Southern Ross Sea since ~2000 BP when persistent sea-ice sealed the Scott Coast. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Aim: Competition for food among populations of closely related species and conspecifics that occur in both sympatry and parapatry can be reduced by interspecific and intraspecific spatial segregation. According to predictions of niche partitioning, segregation is expected to occur at habitat boundaries among congeners and within habitats among conspecifics, while negative relationships in the density of species or populations will occur in areas of overlap. We tested these predictions by modelling the winter distributions of two crested penguin species from three colonies in the south-western Atlantic. Location: Penguins were tracked from two large colonies on the Falkland Islands and one in South Georgia, from where they dispersed through the South Atlantic, Southern Ocean and south-eastern Pacific. Methods: Forty macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus) from South Georgia and 82 southern rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome) from two colonies in the Falkland Islands were equipped with global location sensors which log time and light, allowing positions to be estimated twice-daily, from April to August in 2011. Positions were gridded and converted into maps of penguin density. Metrics of overlap were calculated and density was related to remote-sensed oceanographic variables and competitor density using generalized additive models. Results: Macaroni penguins from western South Georgia and southern rockhopper penguins from Steeple Jason Island, Falkland Islands, were spatially segregated by differences in their habitat preferences thus supporting our first prediction regarding interspecific segregation. However, southern rockhopper penguins from Beauchêne Island showed a marked spatial overlap with macaroni penguins as the two had similar habitat preferences and strong mutual associations when controlling for habitat. Contrary to our predictions relating to intraspecific segregation, southern rockhopper penguins from Beauchêne Island and Steeple Jason Island were segregated by differences in habitat selection. Main conclusions: Morphological differentiation probably allows macaroni penguins from South Georgia and southern rockhopper penguins from Beauchêne Island to coexist in areas of spatial overlap, whereas segregation of the two Falkland rockhopper penguin populations may have arisen from two distinct lineages retaining cultural fidelity to ancestral wintering areas. © 2014 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The complete mitochondrial genome of the African Penguin (Spheniscus demersus) was sequenced. The molecule was sequenced via next generation sequencing and primer walking. The size of the genome is 17,346. bp in length. Comparison with the mitochondrial DNA of two other penguin genomes that have so far been reported was conducted namely; Little blue penguin (Eudyptula minor) and the Rockhopper penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome). This analysis made it possible to identify common penguin mitochondrial DNA characteristics. The S. demersus mtDNA genome is very similar, both in composition and length to both the E. chrysocome and E. minor genomes. The gene content of the African penguin mitochondrial genome is typical of vertebrates and all three penguin species have the standard gene order originally identified in the chicken. The control region for S. demersus is located between tRNA-Glu and tRNA-Phe and all three species of penguins contain two sets of similar repeats with varying copy numbers towards the 3' end of the control region, accounting for the size variance. This is the first report of the complete nucleotide sequence for the mitochondrial genome of the African penguin, S. demersus. These results can be subsequently used to provide information for penguin phylogenetic studies and insights into the evolution of genomes. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Dyer Island, South Africa, supported the largest African penguin Spheniscus demersus colony in 1979 (22 655 breeding pairs), but population dynamics of the species have not followed the trends of adjacent colonies in years of high fish abundance or shifts in prey distribution. Less than 1 500 pairs were breeding on Dyer Island in 2013. Available knowledge on demographic parameters was collated and ecological processes were quantified. Juvenile and adult survival probabilities estimated for birds ringed on Dyer Island between 2005 and 2011 were 0.247 (SE 0.06) and 0.545 (SE 0.05) respectively. Juveniles had a high probability (0.918; SE 0.077) of moving away from Dyer Island. Predation by seals and kelp gulls, as well as oiling, are currently important top-down pressures on penguins on Dyer Island. Numbers of birds breeding on the island were negatively correlated with purse-seine catches 20 nautical miles around it. However, it seems that once the colony size is <3 500 breeding pairs, the importance of fishing pressure diminishes, suggesting that once a colony has been reduced to a relatively small size, its growth is limited by pressures other than fishing. From the review of available knowledge presented here, we recommend a number of management options that should be tested in a suitable model. © 2014 Copyright © NISC (Pty) Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Fossil penguins (Aves, Spheniscidae) are widely recorded throughout the Southern Hemisphere and are especially well represented from the Eocene to present in Patagonia. There are currently three Miocene specimens that include preservation of part of the skull and mandibles: Paraptenodytes antarcticus, Madrynornis mirandus and MLG 3400 (cf. Spheniscus). Osteological appraisals relative to extant taxa and a morphometric analysis were employed to infer possible dietary preferences. The results suggest that Paraptenodytes antarcticus and cf. Spheniscus were piscivores but used different strategies for prey capture. Madrynornis, on the other hand, might have had a mixed diet comprising both small fish and crustaceans. © 2014 Association of Australasian Palaeontologists.

ABSTRACT: The emperor penguin colony at Coulman Island is reputedly the largest known. This reputation is based on intermittent ground and aerial surveys performed since 1958. From an aerial survey obtained on 28 October 2010 we discovered that the total number of chicks was 56% of the lowest previous estimate of 2006 and only 41% of the most recent estimate in 2008. All of the counts tallied since 1983 were determined either by ground counts or from aerial film or digital photographs, or estimates from adult counts. We also determined the sea ice conditions in autumn, which is close to the time the adults arrive to breed. We present three hypotheses of what might have happened from 2008-10 to cause the step change in chick production, the small recovery of chick numbers in 2011, and the complete recovery of number of adults from 2010-11. We conclude that local circumstances may have strongly influenced the breeding behaviour of the emperor penguins in 2010 and to a lesser degree in 2011 when many adults elected not to breed. © Antarctic Science Ltd 2013.

ABSTRACT: Food is heterogeneously distributed in nature, and understanding how animals search for and exploit food patches is a fundamental challenge in ecology. The classic marginal value theorem (MVT) formulates optimal patch residence time in response to patch quality. The MVT was generally proved in controlled animal experiments; however, owing to the technical difficulties in recording foraging behaviour in the wild, it has been inadequately examined in natural predator-prey systems, especially those in the three-dimensional marine environment. Using animal-borne accelerometers and video cameras, we collected a rare dataset in which the behaviour of a marine predator (penguin)was recorded simultaneously with the capture timings of mobile, patchily distributed prey (krill).We provide qualitative support for theMVT by showing that (i) krill capture rate diminished with time in each dive, as assumed in the MVT, and (ii) dive duration (or patch residence time, controlled for dive depth) increased with short-term, dive-scale krill capture rate, but decreased with long-term, bout-scale krill capture rate, as predicted from the MVT. Our results demonstrate that a single environmental factor (i.e. patch quality) can have opposite effects on animal behaviour depending on the time scale, emphasizing the importance of multi-scale approaches in understanding complex foraging strategies. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Adenoviruses (family Adenoviridae) infect various organ systems and cause diseases in a wide range of host species. In this study, we examined multiple tissues from Chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica), collected in Antarctica during 2009 and 2010, for the presence of novel adenoviruses by PCR. Analysis of a 855-bp region of the hexon gene of a newly identified adenovirus, designated Chinstrap penguin adenovirus 1 (CSPAdV-1), showed nucleotide (amino acid) sequence identity of 71.8% (65.5%) with South Polar skua 1 (SPSAdV-1), 71% (70%) with raptor adenovirus 1 (RAdV-1), 71.4% (67.6%) with turkey adenovirus 3 (TAdV-3) and 61% (61.6%) with frog adenovirus 1 (FrAdV-1). Based on the genetic and phylogenetic analyses, CSPAdV-1 was classified as a member of the genus, Siadenovirus. Virus isolation attempts from kidney homogenates in the MDTC-RP19 (ATCC® CRL-8135™) cell line were unsuccessful. In conclusion, this study provides the first evidence of new adenovirus species in Antarctic penguins. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: Capsule: Using simulations in a geographical information system our results showed that systematic sampling with quadrats was the most accurate, precise and cost-effective method to survey Magellanic Penguin colonies. Aims: To determine which sampling method gives better estimations of penguin abundance. Methods: A virtual colony was generated deriving spatial parameters from a real survey and applying Kriging interpolation. Three sampling methods were then applied on this virtual colony: random sampling with quadrats; systematic sampling with quadrats; systematic sampling with fixed-width transects. The estimated abundance for each trial was compared to the abundance of the virtual colony to have a measure of accuracy and precision. Results: Systematic sampling with quadrats estimated penguin abundance better than random or systematic sampling with transects since it achieved 100% accuracy and great precision after sampling only 2.1% of the virtual colony. Conclusion: The use of a simulated colony allowed the comparison of several sampling methods traditionally used in Magellanic Penguin surveys. The results of this study are important in order to standardize sampling protocols for Magellanic Penguins and to have more comparable estimations to detect trends over time. Also, the methodological approach used here could be used to assess sampling methods for other colonial bird species. © 2014 British Trust for Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: The annual moult creates the highest physiological stress during a penguin's breeding-cycle and is preceded by a period of hyperphagia at sea. Although crucial to individual survival, foraging strategies before moult have been little investigated in keystone marine consumers in the Southern Ocean. The Macaroni Penguin Eudyptes chrysolophus demonstrates how individuals may adjust their foraging strategies during this period in line with constraints such as potential intraspecific competition between localities, foraging ability between dimorphic sexes and timing at sea between breeding and non-breeding population components. We recorded pre-moult behaviour at sea for 22 Macaroni Penguins from Crozet and Kerguelen Islands (southern Indian Ocean) during 2009 and 2011, using light-based geolocation and stable isotope analysis. Penguins were distributed in population-specific oceanic areas with similar surface temperatures (3.5 °C) south of the archipelagos, where they foraged at comparable trophic levels based on stable isotopes of their blood. Bayesian 'broken stick' modelling with concurrent analysis of seawater temperature records from the animal-borne devices showed that within each population, females remained 6 days longer than males in the colder waters before heading back towards their colonies. Finally, 17 other non-breeding individuals that moulted earlier had a higher mean blood δ15N value than did post-breeding birds, meaning that early moulters probably fed more on fish than did late moulters. Our findings of such adjustments in foraging strategies developed across locality, sex and breeding status help understanding of the species' contrasted pre-moult biology across its range and its ecology in the non-breeding period. © 2014 British Ornithologists' Union.

ABSTRACT: Eocene Antarctic penguins, at least 10 species in six genera, are known only from the La Meseta Formation, Seymour Island, Antarctic Peninsula. They are most numerous (in terms of individuals, body sizes and taxa) in Late Eocene strata. Specimens from three species and phylogenetic analysis presented in this work shed new light on the systematics and evolution of Antarctic Sphenisciformes. The earliest reported bones of giant penguins from the genus Anthropornis set the conservative estimate of its divergence time at c. 53 Ma (Early Eocene). They also document the oldest known appearance of quite a high diversity of Sphenisciformes; altogether, three morphotypes (differing in size) have been found within the same sampling locality. A newly described, relatively small and intriguingly elongated, tarsometatarsus from the Late Eocene of the La Meseta Formation, belonging to another genus of large-sized Antarctic penguins (Palaeeudyptes), suggests the possible existence of an unnamed species within this long-established genus. The phylogenetic analysis based on tarsometatarsal features shows that the relationship between 'Archaeospheniscus' wimani and three species of Delphinornis (all of them co-existed during the Late Eocene time period) does not appear to be close enough to justify merging them into a single genus (as was recently postulated). © The Geological Society of London 2013.

ABSTRACT: Here we provide a morphological and molecular analysis of the taxonomic status of Cyathostoma (Cyathostoma) phenisci Baudet, 1937, a rare nematode parasite of African penguin Spheniscus demersus. Taxonomical evaluation is supplemented wi th ecological and epidemiological analysis of the nematode's occurrence in the African penguin's population. Tracheae and air sacs of 13 among the 94 necropsied birds (overall prevalence 13.8%) contained a total of 33 nematode specimens (20 females, 13 males). The highest prevalence was observed in juveniles (6 infected, 25%) and "blues" (6 infected, 14.3%), followed by nestlings (1 infected, 7.7%); no nematodes were found in adults. Our morphological and morphometric analysis shows that C. phenisci is closely related to another species, Cyathostoma (Cyathostoma) verrucosum (Hovorka & Macko, 1959). The doubtful status of the latter species was confirmed by molecular data: comparison of ITS2 sequence of C. phenisci with previously deposited sequences of C. verrucosum showed 96.3% similarity in this region. On this basis, we recognized Cyathostoma (Cyathostoma) verrucosum (Hovorka & Macko, 1959) as a synonym of Cyathostoma (Cyathostoma) phenisci Baudet, 1937. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Scullin and Murray monoliths are thought to hold the largest concentration of breeding seabirds in East Antarctica. The monoliths were designated as an Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA No. 164) in 2005 in recognition of the global importance of the seabird assemblages and to protect their outstanding ecological and scientific values. The management plan for the Scullin and Murray Monoliths ASPA encourages regular seabird population monitoring using methods such as aerial photography, but the complex logistics of accessing this remote site has until now limited quantitative assessment of the seabird populations to a single survey in 1986/87. In December 2010 we photographed the Adélie penguin population to provide the population counts presented here. We discuss the potential biases and uncertainties in estimating the breeding population from both the recent and 1980s population count data. © 2012 Antarctic Science Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The Falkland Islands currently supports one of the largest Southern Rockhopper Penguin (Eudyptes c. chrysocome) populations. Archipelago-wide censuses conducted in 2000 and 2005 revealed that the number of breeding pairs had declined by 30 % during this period. To establish whether the breeding population continued to decline, an archipelago-wide census was conducted in 2010. We report a conservative estimate of 319,163 ±SD 24,820 pairs breeding at the Falkland Islands in 2010. This represents a 51 % increase when compared with the number counted in 2005. A simple stochastic population model was developed to investigate the extent to which changes in demographic parameters between 2005 and 2010 could account for the increase in breeding pairs. The population model predicted a 38 % increase in the number of breeding pairs over a 5-year period (289,431 ±SD 24,615). The increase in the number of breeding pairs was therefore probably attributed to improved vital rates in the period between the 2005 and 2010 archipelago-wide censuses in combination with other factors such as a reduction in the proportion of adult birds that abstained from breeding. Based on the 2010 Falkland Islands estimate, the global population of the subspecies E. c. chrysocome is now closer to 870,000 breeding pairs of which the Falkland Islands accounts for approximately 36 %, the second largest proportion after Chile. We conclude that despite fluctuations, the number of Southern Rockhopper Penguins breeding at the Falkland Islands has increased over the last 15 years and suggest that the 'Vulnerable' conservation status of the species be re-assessed. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Stable isotope ratios (13C:12C and 15N:14N) increasingly are being used to infer information about the movements and trophic positions of birds. Feathers, blood, muscle, bone and other tissues frequently are sampled, allowing insights at a range of temporal scales, linked to tissue-specific turnover rates. Non-destructive sampling typically is limited to feathers and blood, but some studies have used claws. An experiment was performed manipulating the diet of captive African Penguins (Spheniscus demersus) to test the turnover rates and discrimination factors (δ=δtissue-δdiet) of claws, blood, plasma and erythrocytes. Eight penguins previously fed sardines (Sardinops sagax) were switched to a diet of small hakes (Merluccius paradoxus/capensis) for 49days. The two fish differed in their 15N values but not 13C. Blood and its fractions had half-lives similar to those reported in other studies, with plasma showing a faster turnover rate (7.6±0.7days) than erythrocytes (14.3±1.6days). Claw growth averaged 0.8±0.2mmweek-1, suggesting that the visible portion of penguin nail takes approximately 126days to be replaced. However, no shift in the nitrogen isotope value was detected, despite monitoring nails for 157days after the diet switch. Discrimination factors varied among tissues, with claws having the lowest factor: δ15Nclaw-sardine=+1.5±0.7‰. Although claws can be sampled non-destructively, they need to be used with caution for isotope analyses because they appear to be relatively insensitive to short to medium-term diet shifts. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: King penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) live in large and densely populated colonies, where navigation can be challenging because of the presence of many conspecifics that could obstruct locally available cues. Our previous experiments demonstrated that visual cues were important but not essential for king penguin chicks' homing. The main objective of this study was to investigate the importance of non-visual cues, such as magnetic and acoustic cues, for chicks' orientation and short-range navigation. In a series of experiments, the chicks were individually displaced from the colony to an experimental arena where they were released under different conditions. In the magnetic experiments, a strong magnet was attached to the chicks' heads. Trials were conducted in daylight and at night to test the relative importance of visual and magnetic cues. Our results showed that when the geomagnetic field around the chicks was modified, their orientation in the arena and the overall ability to home was not affected. In a low sound experiment we limited the acoustic cues available to the chicks by putting ear pads over their ears, and in a loud sound experiment we provided additional acoustic cues by broadcasting colony sounds on the opposite side of the arena to the real colony. In the low sound experiment, the behavior of the chicks was not affected by the limited sound input. In the loud sound experiment, the chicks reacted strongly to the colony sound. These results suggest that king penguin chicks may use the sound of the colony while orienting towards their home. © 2013. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The most common penguin species found along the coast of Brazil is the Magellanic Penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus). These penguins spend most of their time foraging for food in the oceans. This information is vital to the maintenance of this species in captivity. The goal of this study was to evaluate the behavioral response of a group of Magellanic Penguins (S. magellanicus) in two different conditions of water-fresh and salt. The work was divided into two phases. First, animals were kept in enclosures with access to freshwater. Then they were housed with access to saltwater. Behaviors were recorded by scan sampling per interval of time, totaling 7,200 records for each animal. The results show that the use of saltwater for this group of animals kept in captivity was more effective for increasing the time the animals spent in the water, increasing foraging behavior, stimulating swimming, and providing display of typical behaviors of the species, showing that access to a saltwater environment is an important tool in trying to provide well-being for this species in captivity. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Colonial breeding is characteristic of seabirds but nesting at high density has both advantages and disadvantages and may reduce survival and fecundity. African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) initiated breeding at Robben Island, South Africa in 1983. The breeding population on the island increased in the late 1990s and early 2000s before decreasing rapidly until 2010. Before the number breeding peaked, local nest density in the areas where the colony was initiated plateaued, suggesting that preferred nests sites were mostly occupied, and the area used by breeding birds expanded. However, it did not contract again as the population decreased, so that nesting density varied substantially. Breeding success was related positively to the prey available to the breeding birds and negatively to local nest density, particularly during the chick-rearing period, suggesting a density-dependence operating through social interactions in the colony, possibly exacerbated by poor prey availability when the breeding population was large. Although nest density at Robben Island was not high, nesting burrows, which probably reduce the incidence of aggressive encounters in the colony, are scarce and our results suggest that habitat alteration has modified the strength of density-dependent relationships for African penguins. Gaining a better understanding of how density dependence affects fecundity and population growth rates in colonial breeders is important for informing conservation management of the African penguin and other threatened taxa. © 2013 The Society of Population Ecology and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: Antarctic skulls attributable to fossil penguins are rare. Three new penguin crania from Antarctica are here described providing an insight into their feeding function. One of the specimens studied is largely a natural endocast, slightly damaged, and lacking preserved osteological details. Two other specimens are the best preserved fossil penguin crania from Antarctica, enabling the study of characters not observed so far. All of them come from the uppermost Submeseta Allomember of the La Meseta Formation (Eocene-?Oligocene), Seymour (Marambio) Island, Antarctic Peninsula. The results of the comparative studies suggest that Paleogene penguins were long-skulled birds, with strong nuchal crests and deep temporal fossae. The configuration of the nuchal crests, the temporal fossae, and the parasphenoidal processes, appears to indicate the presence of powerful muscles. The nasal gland sulcus devoid of a supraorbital edge is typical of piscivorous species.

ABSTRACT: Data-logging devices are commonly used to study the foraging behaviour of individual seabirds. Such studies need to examine the potential effects of using devices on instrumented individuals, not only for ethical reasons but also to ensure the validity of data gathered. We studied the effects of two types of device (time-depth recorder and global positioning system) on little penguins (Eudyptula minor) during the 2010 and 2011 breeding season at Oamaru, New Zealand. Mixed-effect models were used to test for effects of devices by comparing changes in body weight, chick growth and breeding performance between instrumented and control individuals. We found no detectable effects of the attached devices on body weight change, hatching success, fledging success, chick growth parameters or adult survival. We conclude that it is possible to attach data-logging devices to adult little penguins for extended periods during the breeding season with minimal impacts. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: This paper presents the first fossil penguin from East Antarctica, and the only one known south of the Antarctic Circle. It is represented by two well-preserved elements of the wing skeleton, humerus and radius, obviously assignable to the extant genus Spheniscus. They were found in the glaciomarine succession of the Fisher Bench Formation (Fisher Massif, Prince Charles Mountains, Mac. Robertson Land), which was dated using Strontium Isotope Stratigraphy to be Late Miocene in age (10.2 Ma). They are only slightly younger than the oldest remains undoubtedly attributable to this taxon. The X-ray diffraction and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy indicate diagenetic alteration of the original bone bioapatite under dominantly marine conditions. The Late Miocene was a period of ice margin retreat and marine incursion into the Lambert embayment that followed Middle Miocene cooling of the Antarctic climate. The fossils strongly suggest that variable climatic and environmental conditions in East Antarctica may have been an important factor in the evolution of penguins there during the Neogene. © 2012 Antarctic Science Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Drastic recent decreases in numbers of the 'Endangered' African Penguin Spheniscus demersus highlight the need for conservation efforts to reverse this trend. Habitat reduction due to former guano scraping forces penguins to breed in surface nests, which are vulnerable to predation by Kelp Gulls Larus dominicanus and to extreme weather events. Here I compare gull predation and the success of penguins breeding in surface nests and two types of artificial nests, before (2009) and after (2010-2011), the removal of predatory gulls from Bird Island, South Africa. Both culling gulls and providing artificial nests improved penguin chick survival, but post-culling chick survival was lower in surface nests than in artificial nests, suggesting a major impact of weather on chick mortality. Success of artificial nests was design-dependent, with poor hatching success in fibreglass burrows (probably due to high ambient temperatures), but nests under 50 cm cement pipes cut in half had the highest breeding success. Therefore, appropriately designed artificial nests can enhance African Penguin breeding success, shielding them from both predation and extreme weather events. Where implementing such nests is constrained, controlling Kelp Gulls can also enhance penguin production, especially during years of low food availability when the vulnerability of chicks to predation is exacerbated. Such a strategy would, however, require ongoing management, as territories freed by culled gulls are constantly filled with new individuals. The alarming trend in African Penguin numbers justifies robust conservation strategies, although these should also be concomitant with limiting oil spills and increasing food availability around their colonies. © BirdLife International 2012.

ABSTRACT: One hundred and thirty four Little Penguin (Eudyptula minor) carcases found since 2004 in south west Australia were necropsied. The livers and spleens from ten of the penguins exhibited varying degrees of multifocal, randomly scattered areas of necrosis and varying numbers of parasites were associated with these areas. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly were noted in many of these ten cases. Necrosis and parasites were also observed in the cardiac muscle of four of the cases and in the lung tissue in one of the penguins. Using PCR, the parasites were positively identified in four of the cases as Haemoproteus spp. and morphologically identical tissue stage parasites associated with histopathological changes were observed in all ten dead penguins. This is the first study to demonstrate both the in situ presence of the Haemoproteus parasite in any member of the Sphensicidae family and mortality due to its presence. We postulate the involvement of anomalous environmental conditions in a potential increase in local vectors. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Breeding distribution of the Adélie penguin, Pygoscelis adeliae, was surveyed with Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data in an area covering approximately 330° of longitude along the coastline of Antarctica. An algorithm was designed to minimize radiometric noise and to retrieve Adélie penguin colony location and spatial extent from the ETM+ data. In all, 9143 individual pixels were classified as belonging to an Adélie penguin colony class out of the entire dataset of 195 ETM+ scenes, where the dimension of each pixel is 30m by 30m, and each scene is approximately 180km by 180km. Pixel clustering identified a total of 187 individual Adélie penguin colonies, ranging in size from a single pixel (900m2) to a maximum of 875 pixels (0.788km2). Colony retrievals have a very low error of commission, on the order of 1% or less, and the error of omission was estimated to be ~3 to 4% by population based on comparisons with direct observations from surveys across east Antarctica. Thus, the Landsat retrievals successfully located Adélie penguin colonies that accounted for ~96 to 97% of the regional population used as ground truth. Geographic coordinates and the spatial extent of each colony retrieved from the Landsat data are available publically. Regional analysis found several areas where the Landsat retrievals suggest populations that are significantly larger than published estimates. Six Adélie penguin colonies were found that are believed to be previously unreported in the literature. © 2013 .

ABSTRACT: The juvenile phase is poorly known in Antarctic seabirds, despite being a critical period for individual survival. To better understand the ecology of young Antarctic seabirds, we surveyed for the first time the three-dimensional habitat use of six juvenile emperor penguins during their post-natal dispersal from Terre Adélie, using bio-telemetric tags. The tags transmitted location and activity data for nearly 100 days on average. One individual was followed during eight months and covered 7000 km, which represents the longest continuous individual survey for the species. Studied individuals first dispersed away from Antarctica, up to 54.7°S and 1250 km north of the pack-ice edge, in the Polar Frontal Zone. This highlighted a much looser association with sea ice and a greater at-sea range compared to previous knowledge on breeding adults. Juvenile penguins then moved southwards close to the extending pack-ice during autumn and winter. Over the survey duration, juveniles showed a contrasting use of marine habitats, with less mobility, less time underwater, and shallower dives (generally not over 50-100 m) in the pack ice, versus greater distances travelled, more time spent underwater, especially deeper than 100 m (up to 250-300 m) in open water. We discuss hypotheses which could explain the northward exodus of juvenile emperor penguins across contrasting habitats. © Antarctic Science Ltd 2013.

ABSTRACT: Eight microsatellite markers were developed via pyrosequencing of a microsatellite-enriched library for the African Penguin (Spheniscus demersus). These microsatellite loci displayed 2-6 alleles with expected heterozygosity values ranging between 0. 316 and 0. 782 and observed heterozygosity between 0. 381 and 0. 84. These loci may be suitable for assessing patterns of genetic variability in African penguin. This is the first development of species-specific markers for the African penguin. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

ABSTRACT: At-sea shifts in food quality and availability can affect populations of marine birds; however, it is difficult to evaluate the impacts of changes in prey composition and availability without some baseline information on diet composition. The little penguin (Eudyptula minor) is a common inshore-feeding seabird in New Zealand and Australia. To date, only two dietary studies have been undertaken on the little penguin in New Zealand, at two widely separated locations. This study recorded diet of little penguins during the chickrearing stage of breeding at three colonies in southern New Zealand. Sixty-nine stomach samples were acquired via the stomach flushing technique at Banks Peninsula, Oamaru, and Stewart Island. Prey composition differed between each site: (1) at Oamaru, Graham's gudgeon (Grahamichthys radiata) occurred most frequently (100%) and contributed the most to meal mass (92.1%); (2) at Banks Peninsula arrow squid (Nototodarus sloanii) occurred most frequently (87.5%), but two fish species - slender sprat (Sprattus antipodum) (33.9%) and ahuru (Auchenoceros punctatus) (37.4%) - contributed most to meal mass; and (3) at Stewart Island arrow squid occurred most frequently (91.3%), and contributed most to meal mass (73.1%). Little penguins take a wide diversity of species, and may switch between species, probably in response to temporal variation in availability. In New Zealand, little penguins ate higher proportions of lower quality cephalopods than those in Australia. As top predators in the marine ecosystem, changes in little penguin diet may indicate changes occurring in the inshore marine ecosystem. © New Zealand Ecological Society.

ABSTRACT: Eudyptes penguins (six species) are uniquely characterized by a two-egg clutch with extreme intraclutch egg-size dimorphism (ESD): the first-laid A-egg is 17.5%-56.9% smaller than the B-egg. Although A-eggs are viable, they almost never produce fledged chicks (genus average!1%). Using classical life-history theory and phylogenetic comparative methods, we demonstrate a marked slowdown in the life history of Eudyptes: age of first reproduction is 52% later and annual fecundity 48% lower compared with other two-egg clutch penguin species. All six Eudyptes species have retained a twoegg clutch, despite this pronounced life-history slowdown; this suggests evolutionary mismatch between clutch size and chicks fledged per clutch. Consistent with this, we show that Eudyptes fledge 43% fewer chicks per clutch than other two-egg clutch penguin species. Extreme intraclutch ESD in Eudyptes is associated primarily with a uniform (5%) increase in relative B-egg size, and B-egg size has evolved in accord with life history. We further show that intraclutch ESD is positively correlated with age of first reproduction in Eudyptes but not in other two-egg clutch penguin species. We argue that Eudyptes' persistent failure to evolve a one-egg clutch constitutes a unique genus-wide evolutionary maladaptation and that extreme intraclutch ESD evolved as a correlated response to selection favoring a slower life history imposed by their extreme pelagic overwintering and migration ecology. © 2013 by The University of Chicago.

ABSTRACT: Estimating long-term population trends is vital for the conservation and management of species, yet few trends exist and fewer still are verified with independent measures. We compared three independent measures of change in population size over 27 years (1984-2011) for a significant Little Penguin Eudyptula minor colony in south-eastern Australia: (1) a series of 13 colony-wide surveys conducted in eight separate years, (2) mean nightly counts of penguins returning to breeding sites (365 counts × 27 years) and (3) population growth rates from a demographic model based on survival and recruitment rates measured at three sites each year. Colony-wide surveys of burrows were used as a benchmark of change in population size in the 8 years they were conducted as they were a robust measure of population size corrected for intra-annual variation in burrow occupancy using mark-recapture modelling at six reference sites. However, the demographic model matched the trend from colony-wide surveys with greater resolution in years and with less effort. Beach counts were unreliable for monitoring trends for the entire population due to its singular and peripheral location in the colony. Trends indicate a doubling of the population from 1984 to 2011 despite a marked population contraction linked to a mass mortality of a key prey species. The colony appears secure but remains subject to changes in the marine and terrestrial environments in the longer term. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

ABSTRACT: Optimal foraging theories predict that air-breathing, diving foragers should maximize time spent at feeding depths, and minimize time spent travelling between surface and depth (transits). The second part of this hypothesis was tested in free-ranging king penguins Aptenodytes patagonicus using measurements of vertical speed, swimming speed, body angle and flipper stroke frequency during transits in relation to an index of foraging success (number of wiggles), during the bottom and the ascent phases of the dive. We found that, except for flipper stroke frequency, all measured variables increased with diving depth and foraging activity. The change in vertical speed was driven mainly by a change in body angle and a slight change in swimming speed. These results suggest a shortening of transit duration in response to increased foraging activity. Whereas the time spent commuting between the surface and foraging depths was reduced when foraging activity was high, vertical speed was only at its maximum over a small part of both ascent and descent phases of the dive. Within the first 10m of descent, vertical speed increased with maximum dive depth and an index of foraging activity, suggesting that penguins anticipated their diving depth and foraging activity. Our results show that foraging king penguins adjust their diving behaviour in response to both diving depth and foraging activity. Further studies should consider ecological, physiological or mechanical constraints as factors that may limit foraging optimization. © 2013 The Zoological Society of London.

ABSTRACT: A 20-year-old Gentoo penguin was found dead with a clinical history of inappetence and dyspnoea. At necropsy, the lungs showed severe congestion/hemorrhage and atelectasis. Histopathologically, fibrosis was observed exclusively around parabronchi with severe collagen deposition. In fibrotic lesions, there were numerous depositions of crystalline structures accompanied by epithelioid cells and multinucleated giant cells (foreign body type). In addition to irregularly lamellar structures as the morphology, the crystals were demonstrated calcium oxalate (CaOx) by the Alizarin red S staining with and without polarized light and von Kossa's staining. Myocobacteria and fungi were not found by special and immuohistochemical stainings. Pulmonary dystrophic oxalosis is a very rare lesion in Gentoo penguin. © 2013 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: Bernard, K. S., and Steinberg, D. K. 2013. Krill biomass and aggregation structure in relation to tidal cycle in a penguin foraging region off the Western Antarctic Peninsula. - ICES Journal of Marine Science, 70: 834-849Antarctic krill are a key component of the diet of Adélie penguins inhabiting the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), yet our understanding of the variability of krill distribution patterns within nearshore penguin feeding grounds is limited. A recent study of the foraging patterns of penguins breeding in the northern WAP suggests that tidal phase plays a role in foraging distance. We used acoustics to examine biomass and aggregation structure of krill in the penguin foraging grounds off Palmer Station during diurnal and semi-diurnal tides. Nearshore, integrated krill biomass during diurnal tides was significantly higher than during semi-diurnal tides. Krill aggregations were also shallower, closer together, and larger in dimension during diurnal tides. Conversely, krill aggregations had higher volumetric biomass and abundance during semi-diurnal tides. Further offshore, at the head of the Palmer Deep canyon, krill aggregations were similar to those observed nearshore during diurnal tides (i.e. shallow, close together, and large in dimension). Since krill aggregation structure strongly influences availability as a potential prey source, we suggest that foraging behavior of Adélie penguins in this region is strongly linked to the variability in nearshore krill aggregation structure as well as biomass. © 2013 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

ABSTRACT: Handling, including blood collection, has often been discouraged in molting penguins because it is considered an additional stress imposed on birds already experiencing major physiologic stress associated with molting. To evaluate the degree of physiologic stress posed by molting, we compared the hematologic and plasma biochemical values and hormone levels of molting and nonmolting African penguins, Spheniscus demersus. Five male and 5 female penguins randomly chosen were given complete physical examinations, were weighed, and blood samples were taken at 7 time points before, during, and after the molt. Data were analyzed by linear mixed-model analysis of variance. Throughout the study, behavior and appetite remained normal. Catecholamine levels were highly variable within and among subjects, whereas mean corticosterone levels were significantly different between baseline, molt, and postmolt values. Significant differences from baseline values were observed in many of the hematologic analytes; however, only decreases in hematocrit and red blood cell count values were considered clinically significant. Anemia due to experimentally induced blood loss as a possible cause of the significant hematologic changes was ruled out based on results of a follow-up control study during the nonmolt season, which showed no significant changes in hematocrit level or total red blood cell counts when using similar sampling protocols, which indicates that these changes were associated with molt. © 2013 by the Association of Avian Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Middle Cenozoic marine fossil-bearing beds crop out in the Cerro Plataforma (western Chubut Province, Argentina) at about 1,400 m a.s.l. They are located 500 km far from the modern Atlantic coast and only 50 km from the Pacific Ocean. Well preserved penguin bones and a shark tooth were found therein. Invertebrates include corals, bryozoans, abundant mollusks, echinoids, and crabs. Morphogeometric analysis and comparative description confirmed that the penguin humerus is referable to Palaeospheniscus bergi Moreno and Mercerat, 1891. Most of the fossils indicate a Miocene age. However, there is a debate about if the bearing beds are of Pacific or Atlantic origin. Fossil invertebrates identifiable at species level reveal Pacific affinity, the shark species is cosmopolitan, and Palaeospheniscus bergi is known from early Miocene Atlantic units of southern South America. Yet, Palaeospheniscus Moreno and Mercerat, 1891 is also known from Miocene Pacific beds but it has not been identified at specific level yet. This is the highest site in topographic terms in which penguin fossils occur. This indicates a remarkable uplift for the area, probably from the middle Miocene.

ABSTRACT: Diet strongly influences the chemistry of vertebrate soft and hard tissues. Bird bone and eggshell mineral preserve reliable records of prey consumption, even beyond the life of the predator, and analyses of hard tissues have usefully reconstructed avian diet. Here, we assess the feasibility of a non-destructive method for distinguishing krill-poor from krill-rich diets in penguins. Krill (Euphausiaceae) are fluoride-rich, and penguins that consume krill produce fluoride-rich bones. The chemistry of bone mineral may be elucidated using Raman spectroscopy without recourse to specialised sample preparation. Published data from the diet of six penguin species were compared to a fluoride-informative spectral band (phosphate symmetric stretch, ν1-PO43-) in the Raman spectra of penguin humeri. Penguins that consume abundant krill (e.g. Adélie and emperor) have ν1-PO43--band positions higher than 963 cm-1, whereas penguins that primarily eat teleost fish or cephalopods (e.g. Fiordland crested, Humboldt, little blue and yellow-eyed) have ν1-PO43--band positions lower than 963 cm-1. A krill-rich diet can therefore be determined from the Raman spectra of penguin bones. Raman spectroscopy could be a useful supplement to existing diet analysis techniques. © 2013 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: We defined incubation period as the time from the laying of an egg to its hatching (Rebstock and Boersma 2011) because this full period is ecologically important and matters to both parents' and offspring's fitness. Birds have many patterns of incubation onset and various degrees of egg neglect following onset of incubation. Onset of incubation is difficult to measure in the field and even if known, ignoring the period before onset of incubation misses many of the selective forces acting on incubation patterns and periods. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2013.

ABSTRACT: Venous blood gas-carrying properties were compared in the three captive species of penguins (king, gentoo and rockhopper) at Océanopolis (France). Captivity permitted to control environmental influences. Given their different ecology and diving behaviour in the wild, it was wondered whether milder conditions and dive privation have repercussions on parameters determining oxygen storage and acid-base status of these birds. In addition, this work provided the opportunity to study the effects of moulting in king penguins. This annual event that imposes deep metabolic adjustments is liable to affect blood gas levels. Because of the regular food supply and probably also of the blood sampling conditions, the blood pH of captive penguins was low. This effect was increased in moulting penguins and supposedly due to both the decreased energetic metabolism and the production of uric acid resulting from new feather synthesis. The decrease in the anion gap also revealed the use of plasmatic albumin for this synthesis. The elevated venous PO2 in all birds is not likely due to stress caused by sampling conditions. The other data, in accordance with those in the literature, show neither major influence of captivity nor fundamental interspecific differences, despite potential diving aptitude. © 2013.

ABSTRACT: The fourth archipelago-wide census of Gentoo Penguins Pygoscelis papua breeding at the Falkland Islands was conducted from 24 October to 8 December 2010. The number of Gentoo Penguins breeding in 2010 was estimated to be 132 321 ± 2 015, the highest number of breeding pairs recorded for this species at the Falkland Islands since the first survey in 1933. The global population of Gentoo Penguins is conservatively estimated to be about 384 000 breeding pairs, of which the Falkland Islands accounts for 34%, probably the largest component of the global population. Annually monitored study colonies accounted for 20% of the total number of Gentoo Penguin breeding pairs at the Falkland Islands in 2010 and proved to be a reliable proxy for archipelago-wide changes in the number of breeding pairs. Recent trends at annually monitored study colonies, combined with archipelago-wide trends, indicate that the number of Gentoo Penguins breeding at the Falkland Islands has increased between 2005 to 2010. However, annual monitoring data also revealed large inter-annual variability in the number of breeding pairs, which makes assessing systematic population changes challenging.

ABSTRACT: A novel avipoxvirus caused diphtheritic lesions in the oesophagus of five and in the bronchioli of four Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) and also cutaneous lesions in eight Magellanic penguins housed in outdoor enclosures in a Rehabilitation Centre at Florianópolis, Santa Catarina State, Brazil. At the same time, another avipoxvirus strain caused cutaneous lesions in three Magellanic penguins at a geographically distinct Rehabilitation Centre localized at Vila Velha, Espírito Santo State, Brazil. Diagnosis was based on clinical signs, histopathology and use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Clinical signs in the penguins included cutaneous papules and nodules around eyelids and beaks, depression and restriction in weight gain. The most common gross lesions were severely congested and haemorrhagic lungs, splenomegaly and cardiomegaly. Histological examination revealed Bollinger inclusion bodies in cutaneous lesions, mild to severe bronchopneumonia, moderate periportal lymphocytic hepatitis, splenic lymphopenia and lymphocytolisis. Other frequent findings included necrotizing splenitis, enteritis, oesophagitis, dermatitis and airsacculitis. Cytoplasmic inclusion bodies were seen within oesophageal epithelial cells in five birds and in epithelial cells of the bronchioli in four penguins. DNA from all samples was amplified from skin tissue by PCR using P4b-targeting primers already described in the literature for avipoxvirus. The sequences showed two different virus strains belonging to the genus Avipoxvirus of the Chordopoxvirinae subfamily, one being divergent from the penguinpox and avipoxviruses already described in Magellanic penguins in Patagonia, but segregating within a clade of canarypox-like viruses implicated in diphtheritic and respiratory disease. © 2013 © 2013 Houghton Trust Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The questions of whether carotenoids are mobilized from storage organs or the blood during food shortages or in stressful situations and the amount of carotenoids available in these situations remain contentious. We study the amount of carotenoids circulating in the blood stream in Gentoo Penguins (Pygoscelis papua), taking advantage of the physiological stress produced by fasting during moulting. Carotenoids are not detectable in the blood after 1 week of fasting during moulting in Gentoo Penguins, whereas breeding adults and chicks show a high concentration of astaxanthin. Our results suggest that carotenoids are consumed in physiologically stressful processes other than ornamentation. © 2012 Dt. Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.

ABSTRACT: Defining species boundaries, due to morphological variation, often represents a significant challenge in paleozoology. In this paper we report results from multi- and univariate data analyses, such as enhanced clustering techniques, principal coordinates ordination method, kernel density estimations and finite mixture model analyses, revealing some morphometric patterns within the Eocene Antarctic representatives of Palaeeudyptes penguins. These large-sized birds were represented by two species, P. gunnari and P. klekowskii, known mainly from numerous isolated bones. Investigations focused on tarsometatarsi, crucial bones in paleontology of early penguins, resulted in a probability-based framework allowing for the "fuzzy" partitioning the studied specimens into two taxa with partly overlapping size distributions. Such a number of species was supported by outcomes from both multi- and univariate studies. In our opinion, more reliance should be placed on the quantitative analysis of form when distinguishing between species within the Antarctic Palaeeudyptes.

ABSTRACT: Many animals extract, synthesize and refine chemicals for colour display, where a range of compounds and structures can produce a diverse colour palette. Feather colours, for example, span the visible spectrum and mostly result from pigments in five chemical classes (carotenoids, melanins, porphyrins, psittacofulvins and metal oxides). However, the pigment that generates the yellow colour of penguin feathers appears to represent a sixth, poorly characterized class of feather pigments. This pigment class, here termed 'spheniscin', is displayed by half of the living penguin genera; the larger and richer colour displays of the pigment are highly attractive. Using Raman and mid-infrared spectroscopies, we analysed yellow feathers from two penguin species (king penguin, Aptenodytes patagonicus; macaroni penguin, Eudyptes chrysolophus) to further characterize spheniscin pigments. The Raman spectrum of spheniscin is distinct from spectra of other feather pigments and exhibits 17 distinctive spectral bands between 300 and 1700 cm21. Spectral bands from the yellow pigment are assigned to aromatically bound carbon atoms, and to skeletal modes in an aromatic, heterocyclic ring. It has been suggested that the penguin pigment is a pterin compound; Raman spectra from yellow penguin feathers are broadly consistent with previously reported pterin spectra, although we have not matched it to any known compound. Raman spectroscopy can provide a rapid and non-destructive method for surveying the distribution of different classes of feather pigments in the avian family tree, and for correlating the chemistry of spheniscin with compounds analysed elsewhere. We suggest that the sixth class of feather pigments may have evolved in a stem-lineage penguin and endowed modern penguins with a costly plumage trait that appears to be chemically unique among birds. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: The ontogeny of pectoralis muscle bioenergetics was studied in growing Adélie penguin chicks during the first month after hatching and compared with adults using permeabilized fibers and isolated mitochondria. With pyruvatemalate- succinate or palmitoyl-carnitine as substrates, permeabilized fiber respiration markedly increased during chick growth (3-fold) and further rose in adults (1.4-fold). Several markers of muscle fiber oxidative activity (cytochrome oxidase, citrate synthase, hydroxylacyl- CoA dehydrogenase) increased 6- to 19-fold with age together with large rises in intermyofibrillar (IMF) and subsarcolemmal (SS) mitochondrial content (3- to 5-fold) and oxidative activities (1.5- to 2.4-fold). The proportion of IMF relative to SS mitochondria increased with chick age but markedly dropped in adults. Differences in oxidative activity between mitochondrial fractions were reduced in adults compared with hatched chicks. Extrapolation of mitochondrial to muscle respirations revealed similar figures with isolated mitochondria and permeabilized fibers with carbohydrate-derived but not with lipid-derived substrates, suggesting diffusion limitations of lipid substrates with permeabilized fibers. Two immunoreactive fusion proteins, mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) and optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), were detected by Western blots on mitochondrial extracts and their relative abundance increased with age. Muscle fiber respiration was positively related with Mfn2 and OPA1 relative abundance. Present data showed by two complementary techniques large ontogenic increases in muscle oxidative activity that may enable birds to face thermal emancipation and growth in childhood and marine life in adulthood. The concomitant rise in mitochondrial fusion protein abundance suggests a role of mitochondrial networks in the skeletal muscle processes of bioenergetics that enable penguins to overcome harsh environmental constraints. © 2013 the American Physiological Society.

ABSTRACT: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the helminth fauna found in the Magellanic penguin, Spheniscus magellanicus, relating parasite population and community ecological parameters to life aspects of the host species. The study involved 237 specimens of S. magellanicus taken from the northern shore of the state of São Paulo (23° 46' S, 45° 57' W) and southern shore of the state of Rio de Janeiro (23° 02' S, 44° 13' W), Brazil. The following helminth fauna were found: the nematode Contracaecum pelagicum (core species), found in the stomach; the digenetic Cardiocephaloides physalis and the cestode Tetrabothrius lutzi (satellite species), both collected from the initial portion of the small intestine. Comparisons using the Shannon Diversity Index revealed that the parasite community in juvenile penguins is less diverse in the migratory season than the breeding season. Parasitological studies on penguins and other migratory animals provide important information on species during the time in which they remain pelagic and constitute a useful tool for the acquisition of data that is difficult to obtain through other means, thereby favoring the conservation of the species.

ABSTRACT: Darwin devised sexual selection theory to explain sexual dimorphisms. Further developments of the theory identified the operational sex-ratio (OSR) as one of its cornerstones, and it was commonly admitted that an OSR biased toward one sex would lead to stronger selection pressures toward that sex. Recent theoretical developments have challenged this view and showed that the OSR alone does not determine the direction of sexual selection, more particularly in mutually ornamented species exhibiting high and similar parental investment by both sexes. These developments, however, focused on mutual intersexual selection, and little is known about intrasexual selection of both males and females in species exhibiting such characteristics. The first aim of our study was to test the relative involvement of males and females in same-sex contest over mates in the king penguin, a species exhibiting mutual ornamentation of the sexes, high parental investment by both sexes, and a male-biased OSR. We investigated the sex composition of trio parades, which are groups of three individuals that compete for mates during pair formation. We found that these trios consist of a female trailed by two fighting males in 19 of 20 cases; the 20th trio was all male. The second aim of our study was to investigate the existence of within-sex differences in colour ornaments between individuals involved in such trios and individuals already paired. While limited sample sizes precluded detection of statistically significant differences between trios vs. pairs, reflectance measurements suggested that the beak spot of males in trios were more strongly ultraviolet than the beak spot of males in pairs. We concluded that intrasexual selection in our colony follows the typical pattern of mate competition observed in species in which sexual dimorphisms and OSR are male biased, and discussed the ultraviolet difference within the framework of the king penguins' colour perception. © 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

ABSTRACT: A parasite species of the genus Plasmodium has recently been documented in the endangered Galapagos penguin (Spheniscus mendiculus). Avian malaria causes high mortality in several species after initial exposure and there is great concern for the conservation of the endemic Galapagos penguin. Using a Plasmodium spp. circumsporozoite protein antigen, we standardized an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to test the level of exposure in this small population, as indicated by seroprevalence. Sera from adult and juvenile Galapagos penguins collected between 2004 and 2009 on the Galapagos archipelago were tested for the presence of anti-Plasmodium spp. antibodies. Penguins were also tested for the prevalence of avian malaria parasite DNA using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening. Total seroprevalence of malarial antibodies in this sample group was 97.2%, which suggests high exposure to the parasite and low Plasmodium-induced mortality. However, total prevalence of Plasmodium parasite DNA by PCR screening was 9.2%, and this suggests that parasite prevalence may be under-detected through PCR screening. Multiple detection methods may be necessary to measure the real extent of Plasmodium exposure on the archipelago. © 2013 American Society of Parasitologists.

ABSTRACT: Seabirds have been used extensively as bioindicators of mercury (Hg) contamination in the marine environment, although information on flightless species like penguins remains limited. In order to assess the use of penguins as bioindicators of Hg contamination in subantarctic and Antarctic marine ecosystems, Hg concentrations were evaluated in the feathers of the four species that breed on the Kerguelen Islands in the southern Indian Ocean. Compared to other seabirds, adult Kerguelen penguins had low to moderate feather Hg concentrations, with an average ranging from 1.96±0.41μgg-1 dry weight in the southern rockhopper penguin to 5.85±3.00μgg-1 dry weight in the gentoo penguin. The species was a major determinant of Hg contamination, with feather Hg concentrations being lower in the oceanic species (king and crested penguins) than in the coastal one (gentoo penguin). In all species however, feather Hg concentrations were higher in adults than in chicks, reflecting the different periods of Hg bioaccumulation in the internal tissues of the two age classes. The relationship between adult penguin trophic ecology and Hg burdens was investigated using stable isotopes. Feeding habits (reflected by δ15N values) had a greater effect on adult feather Hg concentrations when compared to foraging habitats (reflected by δ13C values), indicating Hg biomagnification in Kerguelen neritic and oceanic waters. Dietary preferences were crucial in explaining individual feather Hg concentrations, as highlighted by intra-specific variation in Hg levels of gentoo penguins sampled at two different breeding sites of the archipelago. Penguins appear to reflect Hg bioavailability reliably in their foraging environment and could serve as efficient bioindicators of Hg contamination in the Southern Ocean on different spatial and temporal scales.© 2013 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Rebstock and Boersma (2011) recently explored variation in the temperature and incubation period of eggs within clutches of the Magellanic Penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus). They defned incubation period as "the time from the laying of an egg to its hatching" and concluded that parental behavior explained why the incubation period of second eggs was shorter than that of first eggs and controlled asynchronous hatching. While we agree that parents infuenced asynchronous hatching by delaying the onset of incubation, we argue that their conclusions are based on an unconventional definition of incubation period. They included the period before the delayed onset of incubation in the incubation period, which leads to confusion. We state that the incubation period cannot include the time before the (delayed) onset of incubation when parents are not warming the eggs. As regards this latter and widely accepted definition, Rebstock and Boersma (2011) provided a large dataset showing that incubation consistently lasted for 39 days, whenever the onset of incubation, for both first and second eggs. The divergence in the definition of "incubation period" and the failure to consider the "onset of incubation" for a species in which the first egg is not incubated immediately after laying led to confusion in the interpretation of the results and conclusions from Rebstock and Boersma (2011). © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2013.

ABSTRACT: Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and salps (mainly Salpa thompsoni) are main components of Southern Ocean ecosystem, but little is known about their coastal distribution at a fine scale (<1 km). We deployed miniaturised cameras on breeding chinstrap (n = 9 birds) and gentoo penguins (n = 9 birds) in the Antarctic Peninsula region and obtained 2,333 krill images, 93 salp images and 609 sea floor images from 1,843 dives. 51.2 % of penguin dives that had salps present in the images occurred near the dives with krill images (within 5 min). The vertical distribution of salp images showed overlap with the upper depth zone of krill images. While 16.3 % of dives with krill images were associated in time with the sea floor, only 1.2 % of dives with salp images did. These results revealed close proximity between krill and salps within the penguin’s foraging range in an Antarctic coastal ecosystem. These results also imply that krill patches were common in both pelagic and benthic habitat, whereas salps were common mainly in pelagic habitat. If the effects of deployments are similar between the years or regions, inter-annual or regional comparison using the penguinmounted camera will be valid for characterising prey environment in the penguin foraging area. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.

ABSTRACT: The soils impacted by sea animal excreta are important sources of nutrients in Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems, and soil microorganisms are the principal drivers of carbon and nitrogen cycling. However, microbial diversity and enzyme activities in these soils have still received little attention. In this paper, we investigated the distribution characteristics of bacterial community in four penguin and seal colony soil profiles collected in East Antarctica, using 16S rDNA-DGGE and real-time quantitative PCR. Soil microbial biomass carbon (Cmic), soil respiration (SR), and enzyme activities involved in carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus metabolisms were also measured. Overall soil Cmic, SR, enzyme activities, and bacterial abundance decreased with depth. The bacterial abundance had a significant correlation with soil organic carbon and total nitrogen and highly corresponded to the relative content of penguin guano or seal excreta in these soil profiles. The 16S rDNA-DGGE revealed the complicated bacterial community structure in penguin and seal colony soils, and the band richness and dominant bands decreased with soil depth. Cluster analysis of DGGE profiles indicated that bacterial community in those soil profiles were divided into four main categories with the bacterial genetic similarity of 22 %, and the majority of the sequenced bands were Proteobacteria (α, β, γ), Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Deinococcus-Thermus, Chloroflexi, and Firmicutes. Our results indicated that the deposition of penguin guano or seal excreta, which caused the variability in soil soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, pH, and soil moisture, might have an important effect on the vertical distribution pattern of bacterial abundance and diversity in Antarctic soil profiles. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Land-breeding marine animals such as penguins, flying seabirds and pinnipeds are important components of marine ecosystems, and their abundance has been used extensively as an indication of ecosystem status and change. Until recently, many efforts to measure and monitor abundance of these species' groups have focussed on smaller populations and spatial scales, and efforts to account for perception bias and availability bias have been variable and often ad hoc. We describe a suite of new methods, technologies and estimation procedures for cost-effective, large-scale abundance estimation within a general estimation framework and illustrate their application on large Adélie penguin populations in two regions of East Antarctica. The methods include photographic sample counts, automated cameras for collecting availability data, and bootstrap estimation to adjust counts for the sampling fraction, perception bias, and availability bias, and are applicable for a range of land-breeding marine species. The methods will improve our ability to obtain population data over large spatial and population scales within tight logistic, environmental and time constraints. This first application of the methods has given new insights into the biases and uncertainties in abundance estimation for penguins and other land-breeding marine species. We provide guidelines for applying the methods in future surveys. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Little Penguin (Eudyptula minor) populations on the south-eastern coastline of the South Island, New Zealand, thrive at locations where they are protected from predation by introduced mammals and disturbance by people. Our objective was to investigate the reproductive performance of a population of Little Penguins at Oamaru over a period of 19 years. Long-term monitoring of the population began in 1993 and involved a weekly check of all nests in the breeding colony to record the numbers of adult penguins, eggs and chicks present. All breeding adults and fledged chicks were flipper-banded. Breeding seasons with an early onset of egg-laying had more double brooding. Annual breeding success through 19 breeding seasons (1994-2012) averaged 1.89 chicks per female, the highest recorded for the species. The study showed that an early onset of egg-laying and the occurrence of double brooding resulted in high breeding success at the Oamaru population. © 2013 Dt. Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.

ABSTRACT: Historically wildlife conservation was based on habitat protection and exploitation control. Only recently have diseases been considered an important issue. However, pathogens are usually described during or after disease outbreaks, but to determine which pathogens may be emerging, surveys of wildlife health are critical in a given time. This study deals with the health status of gentoo penguins Pygoscelis papua in two localities at the Antarctica Peninsula and one at Ardley Island off the South Shetland Islands. Cloacal swaps, fresh fecal samples, ectoparasites, and blood smears were collected. We examined and dissected 14 penguin corpses found dead. Fecal samples were positive for Campylobacter, Escherichia coli and in the carcasses four endoparasitic species were found: Diphyllobothrium sp. and Parorchites zederi, Corynosoma shackletoni and Stegophorus adeliae. The tick Ixodes uriae occurred in five of the examined penguins, and the louse Austrogoniodes gressitti on six birds. From the colony grounds, we collected 1,184 I. uriae. We recorded antibiotic-resistant bacteria, such as E. coli, in ecosystems where gentoo penguins breed. Cloacal samples (300) were negative for Chlamydia, as well as for Salmonella, Campylobacter, E. coli, Newcastle and Influenza viruses. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this work is to contribute to the knowledge of gastrointestinal parasites of the Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) from 25 de Mayo/King George Island (South Shetlands, Antarctica). Gastrointestinal tracts of 37 fresh dead individuals (21 chicks, 10 juveniles, and 6 adults) were collected from December 2006 to February 2012 and examined for macroparasites. Four adult parasite species were found: one Cestoda species (Parorchites zederi), two Nematoda species (Stegophorus macronectes and Tetrameres wetzeli), and one Acanthocephalan (Corynosoma shackletoni). Two species of immature acanthocephalans, Corynosoma hamanni and Corynosoma bullosum, were found in a single host. This is the first record of Tetrameres wetzeli in Gentoo penguins. The low parasite richness observed could be related to the stenophagic and pelagic diet of this host species which feeds almost exclusively on krill. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: The authors hypothesized that the catastrophic annual molt of penguins (Sphenisciformes) would lead to reduced intraindividual variation of mercury concentrations in body feathers. While mean mercury concentrations varied significantly among 8 penguin species, intraindividual variability did not differ among species and was 3 times lower than values observed in other seabirds. The findings of the present study suggest that a single body feather collected at random per individual can be adequate to estimate mercury exposure at the population level in penguins. © 2013 SETAC.

ABSTRACT: In birds, courtship is generally short relative to the whole breeding cycle. Emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri), however, are an exception as their courtship period is much longer (ca. 6 weeks) than the courtship of other penguin species. This strategy may appear surprising, as it is especially costly to fast and endure drastic climatic conditions for long periods at the colony (1. 5 and up to 4 months for females and males, respectively). We examined here the reasons of this extended courtship period and found that emperor penguins returned earlier to the colony when primary oceanic production before breeding was high. This suggests that emperor penguins return to the colony as soon as primary oceanic production in summer allows them to replenish their body reserves. The extended period of time spent at the colony during courtship may therefore result from an evolutionary process that confers advantages to emperor penguins that arrive earlier at the colony by reducing predation risks and offering better chances of securing a partner. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: An inverse food-web model for the western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) pelagic food web was constrained with data from Palmer Long Term Ecological Research (PAL-LTER) project annual austral summer sampling cruises. Model solutions were generated for 2 regions with Adélie penguin Pygoscelis adeliae colonies presenting different population trends (a northern and a southern colony) for a 12 yr period (1995-2006). Counter to the standard paradigm, comparisons of carbon flow through bacteria, microzooplankton, and krill showed that the diatom-krill-top predator food chain is not the dominant pathway for organic carbon exchanges. The food web is more complex, including significant contributions by microzooplankton and the microbial loop. Using both inverse model results and network indices, it appears that in the northern WAP the food web is dominated by the microbial food web, with a temporal trend toward its increasing importance. The dominant pathway for the southern WAP food web varies from year to year, with no detectable temporal trend toward dominance of microzooplankton versus krill. In addition, sensitivity analyses indicated that the northern colony of Adélie penguins, whose population size has been declining over the past 35 yr, appears to have sufficient krill during summer to sustain its basic metabolic needs and rear chicks, suggesting the importance of other processes in regulating the Adélie population decline. © 2013 Inter-Research.

ABSTRACT: Birds due to its position in the trophic chain are good monitors of the marine environment in terms of mercury contamination. For the proper interpretation of results it is necessary to know both the processes of accumulation of this metal in their bodies and processes of elimination. Research involving the Penguin (Spheniscus demersus) living in a ZOO has identified the relationship between diet and the amount of mercury removed from the penguin body in guano, feathers, and in the case of females with eggs. The research was conducted in years 2009-2011. Total mercury was determined in elements responsible for detoxification and in the diet of penguins. Mercury concentration was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry with AMA-254 automatic mercury analyzer. The highest average mercury concentrations were determined in feathers: 1781.12 ngHg•g-1d.w., lower in eggs: 950.88 ngHg•g-1 dry weight (d.w.). and in a guano: 139.18 ngHg•g-1. In food, herrings caught in the southern Baltic, Hg concentrations were relatively low with averaged value 31.81 ngHg•g-1d.w. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2013.

ABSTRACT: Penguin foraging and breeding success depend on broad-scale environmental and local-scale hydrographic features of their habitat. We investigated the effect of local tidal currents on a population of Adélie penguins on Humble Is., Antarctica. We used satellite-tagged penguins, an autonomous underwater vehicle, and historical tidal records to model of penguin foraging locations over ten seasons. The bearing of tidal currents did not oscillate daily, but rather between diurnal and semidiurnal tidal regimes. Adélie penguins foraging locations changed in response to tidal regime switching, and not to daily tidal patterns. The hydrography and foraging patterns of Adélie penguins during these switching tidal regimes suggest that they are responding to changing prey availability, as they are concentrated and dispersed in nearby Palmer Deep by variable tidal forcing on weekly timescales, providing a link between local currents and the ecology of this predator. © 2013 Oliver et al.

ABSTRACT: In Antarctica, the marine ecosystem is dynamically interrelated with the terrestrial ecosystem. An example of the link between these two ecosystems is the biogeochemical cycle of phosphorus. Biovectors, such as penguins, transport phosphorus from sea to land, play a key role in this cycle. In this paper, we selected three colonies of penguins, the most important seabirds in Antarctica, and computed the annual quantity of phosphorus transferred from sea to land by these birds. Our results show that adult penguins from colonies at Ardley Island, the Vestfold Hills, and Ross Island could transfer phosphorus in the form of guano at up to 12 349, 167 036, and 97 841 kg/a, respectively, over their breeding period. These quantities are equivalent to an annual input of 3.96×109-1.63×1010 kg of seawater to the land of Antarctica. Finally, we discuss the impact of phosphorus on the ice-free areas of the Antarctica. © 2014 Chinese Society for Oceanology and Limnology, Science Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Tagging is essential for many types of ecological and behavioural studies, and it is generally assumed that it does not affect the fitness of the individuals being examined. However, the tagging of birds has been shown to have negative effects on some aspects of their lives. Here we investigate the influence of tagging on apparent survival. We examined the effects of flipper bands and injected transponders on the apparent survival of adult Little Penguins by comparing the survival probabilities of 2483 Little Penguins marked at Phillip Island, Australia, between 1995 and 2001 in one of three ways: with bands, with transponders or with both. The design of the study and our method of analysis allowed us to estimate tag loss and ensured that tag loss did not bias the survival estimates. Birds marked with flipper bands had lower survival probabilities than those marked with transponders (with apparent survival probabilities in the first year after tagging of 75% for banded birds and 80% for birds fitted with transponders, and in subsequent years of 87% for banded birds and 91% for birds fitted with transponders). We estimated both band and transponder loss probabilities for the first time, and found that transponder loss probabilities were substantially higher than band loss probabilities, particularly in the first year after marking when the tag loss probability was 5% for transponders and 0.7% for bands. Survival probabilities were lower in the first year after marking than in subsequent years for all birds. Studies of penguins that have used flipper bands to identify individuals may have underestimated annual adult survival probabilities, as banded penguins were likely to have lower than average survival probabilities than those of unbanded birds. The higher annual survival probabilities of individuals marked with transponders indicate that this should be the preferred marking technique for Little Penguins. However, future studies will, like ours, need to consider the higher rates of transponder loss when estimating survival, possibly by double-tagging some birds. © 2013 British Ornithologists' Union.

ABSTRACT: Aquatic birds are often used as a health indicator of the marine ecosystem. African penguins living in the zoo make good research material as they form a link between the marine and the terrestrial ecosystem in terms of xenobiotic circulation. Tests were performed on whole herring - the food of the penguins - as well as on bird muscle, liver, brain, eggs, feathers and guano in order to determine total mercury, aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, isodrin, endosulfan isomers, endosulfan sulfate, methoxychlor, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolites. In herring and penguin, the tests did not show the presence of β-endosulfan, endosulfan sulfate, aldrin and isodrin. It was shown that penguins absorb about 36.8 μg of organochlorine pesticides and 4.6 μg of mercury with their food on a daily basis. Xenobiotics accumulate mostly in the liver, from where they are transported to the muscles and the brain, where the highest bioaccumulation factor is reached by endrin and pp'-DDT. Conceivably, the older the penguin, the higher is the concentration level of pesticides in its liver and brain. Molting was found to be the most effective way of eliminating mercury, dieldrin and methoxychlor from the system. Insecticides, such as DDT and its metabolites, were removed most effectively by females through laying of eggs. The standard four eggs laid within a year may have contained up to 20 % of the total amount of pesticides which had been absorbed with food, but no more than 5 % of mercury. © 2013 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The presence of metals in the Antarctic environment is principally a natural phenomenon caused by geochemical characteristics of the region, although some anthropogenic activities can increase these natural levels. Antarctic penguins present several of the characteristics of useful sentinels of pollution in Antarctica such as they are long-lived species situated at the top of food web. The concentrations of Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Cd, and Pb were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry in samples of liver, kidney, muscle, bone, feather, and stomach contents of gentoo, chinstrap, and Adélie penguin (12 adults, five juveniles) from carcasses of naturally dead individuals collected opportunistically in the Antarctic Peninsula area. The obtained results showed that accumulation and magnification of several elements can be occurring, so that Cd and Se reached levels potentially toxic in some specimens. The presence of human activities seems to be increasing the presence of toxic metals such as Mn, Cr, Ni, or Pb in penguins. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Redescribed and reinterpreted here is a partial skeleton of the oldest Antarctic penguin, Crossvallia unienwillia from the late Paleocene of Marambio (Seymour) Island. A thorough morphological analysis of limb bones (humerus, femur and tibiotarsus) allowed us to report both an amended reconstruction of type specimens and a revised taxonomic diagnosis of this large-sized early penguin. Moreover, an additional skeletal element, a single thoracic vertebra, is described for the first time. C. unienwillia is characterized by a mixture of features typical of both geologically older and younger penguins, supplemented by characters that are obviously unique. The above-mentioned findings shed new light on the very beginning of penguin evolution.

ABSTRACT: Krill consumption by natural predators represents a critical link between surveys and models of standing krill biomass and the design of a sustainable krill fishery for the Scotia Sea. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is a significant component of diet for penguins breeding in this region and, consequently, uncertainties regarding penguin population abundances contribute to uncertainties in krill predation estimates. We use a comprehensive database of Antarctic penguin abundances to identify 14 breeding colonies that contribute most significantly to uncertainty regarding the total number of pygoscelid penguins breeding in this region. We find that a high quality survey of Zavodovski Island alone would decrease uncertainty in total population by 24.8%, whereas high quality surveys of all 14 high-influence locations would decrease uncertainty by almost 72%. Updated population estimates at these sites should be considered top priority for future fieldwork in the region. Our results are based on a robust quantitative method for assessing data priorities in estimating krill consumption that is easily extended to other groups of krill predators. © 2012 Antarctic Science Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The Adélie penguin is the most important animal currently used for ecosystem monitoring in the Southern Ocean. The diet of this species is generally studied by visual analysis of stomach contents; or ratios of isotopes of carbon and nitrogen incorporated into the penguin from its food. There are significant limitations to the information that can be gained from these methods. We evaluated population diet assessment by analysis of food DNA in scats as an alternative method for ecosystem monitoring with Adélie penguins as an indicator species. Scats were collected at four locations, three phases of the breeding cycle, and in four different years. A novel molecular diet assay and bioinformatics pipeline based on nuclear small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU rDNA) sequencing was used to identify prey DNA in 389 scats. Analysis of the twelve population sample sets identified spatial and temporal dietary change in Adélie penguin population diet. Prey diversity was found to be greater than previously thought. Krill, fish, copepods and amphipods were the most important food groups, in general agreement with other Adélie penguin dietary studies based on hard part or stable isotope analysis. However, our DNA analysis estimated that a substantial portion of the diet was gelatinous groups such as jellyfish and comb jellies. A range of other prey not previously identified in the diet of this species were also discovered. The diverse prey identified by this DNA-based scat analysis confirms that the generalist feeding of Adélie penguins makes them a useful indicator species for prey community composition in the coastal zone of the Southern Ocean. Scat collection is a simple and non-invasive field sampling method that allows DNA-based estimation of prey community differences at many temporal and spatial scales and provides significant advantages over alternative diet analysis approaches. © 2013 Jarman et al.

ABSTRACT: Determination of clade membership is a crucial requirement for many research questions addressing phylogeography, population structure, mating patterns, speciation, and hybridisation. The little blue penguin (Eudyptula minor) can be separated into two deeply divergent clades. However, assigning clade membership in little blue penguins requires molecular methods. Genetic sequencing can be used to identify clade membership but is expensive. Here, we present an economical alternative to the use of sequencing to determine little blue penguin clade membership. We extracted DNA from feathers using a method that produced reasonable quantities of DNA. We then amplified the D-loop section of the mitochondrial control region from total genomic DNA extracts, using the primers 'C L-tRNAglu' and 'D H-Dbox' followed by digestion with the restriction enzyme AluI. When visualised on a gel, distinctive banding patterns clearly indicated clade membership. We sequenced a subset of our samples and verified the accuracy of this method. The methods we present should facilitate little blue penguin research through a cost-effective approach to clade analysis as well as a successful technique to extract DNA from feathers when blood or tissue samples are not available. © New Zealand Ecological Society.

ABSTRACT: As iteroparous species, seabirds must balance present against future reproduction. We used stable-isotope (SIA) and stomach content analysis (SCA) to examine the effects of sex, breeding stage, pre-moulting period, ontogeny and chick age on the diet of northern rockhopper penguins (NRP; Eudyptes moseleyi) breeding at the Tristan da Cunha archipelago during 2010. Stomach contents were obtained from birds during the guard and crèche stages. δ15N and δ13C signatures of whole blood of adults were measured at Tristan Island (during the incubation, guard and crèche stages), and of adult feathers at Tristan and nearby (∼38 km) Nightingale Islands. δ15N and δ13C signatures of the whole blood of chicks were also measured during both stages. Adult pre-moult diets were significantly enriched in both elements at Nightingale compared to Tristan Islands. Adult female diet was dominated by zooplankton during the guard stage, and in both sexes by fish (predominantly Photichthyidae) in the crèche stage. No effects of chick size within the guard stage, or of sex within the crèche stage were observed on diet composition of adult birds. δ13C values of adult blood were higher in females relative to chicks, and in crèche relative to guard stage individuals. δ15N values of blood showed a significant breeding stage × chick age interaction. Sex affected blood δ15N and δ13C only in the guard and incubation stages. Stage and sex interacted significantly on δ13C and δ15N signatures of adult feathers. NRP were opportunistic foragers, hunting in different areas during breeding and non-breeding periods, with different premoult foraging patterns observed in adults from colonies separated by only 38 km. Adults seemed to favour future reproduction, through brood reduction and by feeding chicks lower trophic level prey than they consumed themselves, although provisioning shifted from zooplankton to fish later in the breeding season. © Inter-Research 2013 · www.int-res.com.

ABSTRACT: Anthropogenic changes in the marine environment and global climate change have led to population declines in several seabird species worldwide. Rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome and Eudyptes moseleyi) have experienced a dramatic population decline, potentially linked to increasing sea surface temperatures (SST). Among Southern Ocean diving seabirds, rockhopper penguins typically occupy a low trophic level, and might therefore be expected to mirror climate-driven bottom-up changes to the food web sensitively and on a short time scale. Using passive integrated transponders, survival rates of adults in a colony of southern rockhopper penguins (E. chrysocome) on the Falkland Islands were monitored over five consecutive years. Mean annual survival rates were in the range 84 to 96%. These values are high compared with other crested penguin species and reflect the generally good conditions during the study period, when low SST prevailed. However, survival rates were lower in 2010, corresponding to very cold conditions. Curve fits showed a best-fit quadratic relationship between average SST anomaly and survival rates for the present data, as well as for a data set including two additional years from a different study at Staten Island. Results of this study suggest that rockhopper penguins survive best at SSTs that are lower than the average of the last four decades. In accordance with previously observed rockhopper penguin population declines, the present data suggest that rockhopper penguins are highly sensitive to changes in SST and their effects on the food web, a worrying perspective in times of global climate change. It seems likely that these changes could, in the long term, also affect population trends of other seabird species with similar ecological preferences. The most promising conservation approach should aim at enhancing ecosystem resilience, mainly by reducing industrial fishing and oil exploitation. This would allow the currently over-exploited fish and squid stocks to recover, offering larger food resources to seabirds and other vertebrate species. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: We analysed the vocalisation behaviour of Rockhopper Penguin chicks Eudyptes chrysocome during hatching. Hatching vocalisation rates (in number per minute) were not consistently influenced by ambient air temperature. They did not differ between chicks hatching from first-laid eggs (which are smaller, hatch second, and usually suffer brood reduction) and chicks hatching from second-laid eggs (which usually develop into fledglings). Hatchlings did not show significantly different vocalisation rates in the presence of a sibling during hatching. Hatching vocalisation rates also did not increase between the penultimate day and the last day before hatching. These results suggest that Rockhopper Penguin chicks might gain little benefit (parental care) from increased vocal behaviour at the late incubation stage.

ABSTRACT: In response to zooplankton grazing, phytoplankton release dimethylsulphoniopropionate in the seawater, which is then catabolized to dimethyl sulphide (DMS) that is emitted to the air. This molecule therefore signals areas of high productivity in the oceans, and it can be used by predators for locating foraging areas. Detection of this compound has been described in several species of procelariiform seabirds and non-Antarctic fish-feeding penguins. However, there is no evidence of DMS detection by krill-feeding penguins. The mechanisms of krill detection by its predators are especially relevant in Antarctica, where trophic webs are mainly based on krill. We explored for the first time whether a krill-feeding penguin species, the chinstrap penguin Pygoscelis antarctica, is able to detect DMS. We examined whether chinstrap penguins could detect DMS by locating DMS or control recipients in pathways that penguins used when moving between the colony and the sea. We also analysed the attraction of nestling penguins to DMS in a T-shaped experimental enclosure. Our results showed that adult penguins are attracted to DMS on land. Nestling penguins also tended to be attracted to the scent of DMS. Further research is needed to examine whether chinstrap penguins use natural DMS concentrations as a foraging cue at sea. © Inter-Research 2013.

ABSTRACT: The concentration of human activities in the near-shore ecosystems from the northern Antarctic Peninsula area can cause an increasing bioavailability of pollutants for the vulnerable Antarctic biota. Penguin chicks can reflect this potential impact in the rookeries during the breeding season. They also can reflect biomagnification phenomena since they are on the top of the Antarctic food chain. The concentrations of Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Cd and Pb were measured by ICP-MS in samples of liver, kidney, muscle, bone, feather and stomach content of gentoo, chinstrap and Adélie penguin chicks (n=15 individuals) collected opportunistically in the Islands of King George and Deception (South Shetland Islands, Antarctica). The detected levels of some trace elements were not as low as it could be expected in the isolated Antarctic region. Penguin chicks can be useful indicators of trace elements abundance in the study areas. Capsule: Carcasses of Antarctic penguin chicks were used to evaluate the bioavailability of trace elements in the Islands of King George and Deception. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Parasites may adversely affect the breeding success and survival of penguins, potentially hampering the viability of their populations. We examined 161 pygoscelid penguins (3 Pygoscelis adeliae, 98 Pygoscelis antarcticus, and 60 Pygoscelis papua) at the South Shetlands Archipelago during the 2010-2011 summer; blood smears were examined for 64 penguins (2 P. adeliae, 18 P. antarcticus, and 44 P. papua), and a PCR test targeting Haemoproteus sp. and Plasmodium sp. was applied for 37 penguins (2 P. adeliae, 17 P. antarcticus, 19 P. papua). No blood parasites were observed, and all PCR tests were negative, leukocyte profiles were similar to those reported in other studies for wild pygoscelid penguins, and all penguins were in good body condition and had no external signs of disease. One specimen of chewing lice (Austrogoniodes sp.) was recorded in one P. antarcticus at King George Island. Ticks (Ixodes uriae) were not observed on the penguins, but were found on the ground near P. antarcticus nests at King George Island. The absence of avian blood parasites in Antarctic penguins is thought to result from the absence of competent invertebrate hosts in the climatic conditions. Predicted climate changes may redefine the geographic distribution of vector-borne pathogens, and therefore, the occurrence of blood parasites and their invertebrate hosts should be monitored regularly in Antarctic birds, particularly in the northernmost Antarctic Peninsula. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Captive penguins are prone to pododermatitis (bumblefoot) lesions due to sedentary habits, changes in normal activity patterns, prolonged time on hard and abrasive surfaces, and less time swimming in the water. Environmental enrichment allows the use of creative and ingenious techniques that aim to keep the captive animals occupied by increasing the range and the diversity of behavioral opportunities always respecting the ethological needs of the species. The main goal of this work was to use environmental enrichment techniques to reduce pododermatitis in a group of captive penguins. Five captive Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) that were showing bumblefoot lesions were followed during this project. To monitor the lesions, all animals were physically restraint 3 times a week over a period of 12 weeks. Environmental enrichment was introduced daily in the water with the goal of enhancing their time in the water for one extra hour daily. The results demonstrate that in a twelve weeks period, four animals showed significant reduction of the lesions in both feet and in two animals the lesions were completely healed. With these results we can conclude that aquatic environmental enrichment allowed this group of penguins to spend more time in the water, favoring the reduction of the bumblefoot lesions.

ABSTRACT: Despite the enormous amount of data available on the importance of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota in vertebrate (especially mammals), information on the GI microbiota of seabirds remains incomplete. As with many seabirds, penguins have a unique digestive physiology that enables them to store large reserves of adipose tissue, protein, and lipids. This study used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing to characterize the interspecific variations of the GI microbiota of four penguin species: the king, gentoo, macaroni, and little penguin. The qPCR results indicated that there were significant differences in the abundance of the major phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroides, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria. A total of 132,340, 18,336, 6324, and 4826 near full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences were amplified from fecal samples collected from king, gentoo, macaroni, and little penguins, respectively. A total of 13 phyla were identified with Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Fusobacteria dominating the composition; however, there were major differences in the relative abundance of the phyla. In addition, this study documented the presence of known human pathogens, such as Campylobacter, Helicobacter, Prevotella, Veillonella, Erysipelotrichaceae, Neisseria, and Mycoplasma. However, their role in disease in penguins remains unknown. To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide an in-depth investigation of the GI microbiota of penguins. © 2013 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Human activity and specifically tourism has been increasing in Antarctica over the last few years. Few studies have examined the indirect effects of human visits on Antarctic penguin rookeries. This work aims to study the differences between a highly visited (Hannah Point) and a rarely visited (Devil's Point, Byers Peninsula) gentoo penguin rookery on Livingston Island. Our results suggest that potential indirect effects of human impact are observed in gentoo penguins at Hannah Point, a colony heavily visited by tourists. Penguins at Hannah Point showed a higher presence of heavy metals such as Pb and Ni and a higher number of erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities than penguins at Devil's Point. Immunological parameters showed different results depending on whether we consider the cellular response - the number of lymphocytes being higher in penguins from Hannah Point - or the humoral response - the level of immunoglobulins being higher in penguins from Devil's Point. Measurements of corticosterone levels in feathers and heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratio in blood showed lower levels in the heavily visited rookery than in the rarely visited rookery. Finally, we did not detect Campylobacter jejuni, a bacteria potentially transmitted by humans in either of the populations and we did not find any difference in the prevalence of Campylobacter lari between the populations.

ABSTRACT: Emperor penguins Aptenodytes forsteri are able to survive the harsh Antarctic climate because of specialized anatomical, physiological and behavioural adaptations for minimizing heat loss. Heat transfer theory predicts that metabolic heat loss in this species will mostly depend on radiative and convective cooling. To examine this, thermal imaging of emperor penguins was undertaken at the breeding colony of Pointe Geologie in Terre Adelie (668400 S 1408 010 E), Antarctica in June 2008. During clear sky conditions, most outer surfaces of the body were colder than surrounding sub-zero air owing to radiative cooling. In these conditions, the feather surface will paradoxically gain heat by convection from surrounding air. However, owing to the low thermal conductivity of plumage any heat transfer to the skin surface will be negligible. Future thermal imaging studies are likely to yield further insights into the adaptations of this species to the Antarctic climate. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Knowledge of spatial distribution is fundamental to ecological studies and crucial for conservation and management of species and biodiversity, but detailed, large-scale spatial data are lacking for most taxa. Although the Adélie penguin is one of the most intensively studied Antarctic vertebrates, spatial data that could aid in ecological study and conservation management are incomplete. We undertook a large-scale survey of the current breeding distribution of Adélie penguins along 3800 km of the East Antarctic coastline. The survey increased the number of known breeding locations by 50% and revealed that the breeding distribution has expanded in some parts of the survey region over the past two to three decades. The expanding breeding distribution may reflect underlying population dynamics of sustained growth and resultant density dependent effect on dispersal and movement from established breeding sites to new sites. The comprehensive, large-scale distribution data from this study will form a baseline for assessing any future changes in Adélie penguin breeding distribution, provide data for developing spatial models for predicting future changes in breeding distribution under plausible scenarios of environmental change, and contribute to the development of metapopulation models by providing estimates of local colonization and extinction probabilities under specific conditions of metapopulation change. © Antarctic Science Ltd 2013.

ABSTRACT: Gentoo penguins Pygoscelis papua have sexual dimorphism, which females have smaller morphological measurements than males. P. papua also shows a geographic morphological variation, decreasing in size toward southern latitudes. Therefore, morphological measurements may vary in space and overlap in the distribution of traits between females and males, which could lead to sex misidentification. A total of 300 blood samples and eight measurements and weight were obtained for Gentoo penguins from three localities in the South Shetland Islands and the Antarctic Peninsula. The molecular sex was identified for all individuals using two primer pairs (P2/P8 and PL/PR). We obtained higher success amplification for P2/P8 compared to PL/PR. We used 172 adults to create a morphological discriminant function using the backward stepwise method. We established a discriminant function for sex identification of each locality due to significant morphological differences found between sexes and between the three studied localities for adult Gentoo penguins. Using these functions, the percentages of individuals correctly assigned was 93.87 % in Ardley Island, 88.09 % in Bernardo O’Higgins, and 83.95 % in Gabriel Gonzalez Videla. The most southern locality studied was the most morphologically divergent from the others and with low divergence between sexes. Moreover, we also established a general function for the Gentoo penguin, which can be used to identify the sex of penguins from a broad number of localities. Therefore, molecular and biometric are useful techniques for sexing Gentoo penguins. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.

ABSTRACT: Due to their restricted foraging range, flightless seabirds are ideal models to study the short-term variability in foraging success in response to environmentally driven food availability. Wind can be a driver of upwelling and food abundance in marine ecosystems such as the Southern Ocean, where wind regime changes due to global warming may have important ecological consequences. Southern rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome) have undergone a dramatic population decline in the past decades, potentially due to changing environmental conditions. We used a weighbridge system to record daily foraging mass gain (the difference in mean mass of adults leaving the colony in the morning and returning to the colony in the evening) of adult penguins during the chick rearing in two breeding seasons. We related the day-to-day variability in foraging mass gain to ocean wind conditions (wind direction and wind speed) and tested for a relationship between wind speed and sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA). Foraging mass gain was highly variable among days, but did not differ between breeding seasons, chick rearing stages (guard and crèche) and sexes. It was strongly correlated between males and females, indicating synchronous changes among days. There was a significant interaction of wind direction and wind speed on daily foraging mass gain. Foraging mass gain was highest under moderate to strong winds from westerly directions and under weak winds from easterly directions, while decreasing under stronger easterly winds and storm conditions. Ocean wind speed showed a negative correlation with daily SSTA, suggesting that winds particularly from westerly directions might enhance upwelling and consequently the prey availability in the penguins' foraging areas. Our data emphasize the importance of small-scale, wind-induced patterns in prey availability on foraging success, a widely neglected aspect in seabird foraging studies, which might become more important with increasing changes in climatic variability. © 2013 Dehnhard et al.

ABSTRACT: Animals in aggregations such as herds, schools, flocks, or colonies tend to synchronize their behaviour with each other for food acquisition and predator detection. Different species of captive penguins, when housed communally, intermingle more than in their natural habitat. Wild penguins typically divide themselves into separate colonies by species. We predicted that penguins would synchronize their behaviour more with conspecifics rather than interspecifically in a mixedspecies zoo exhibit. The subjects were 65 penguins of two different species, chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarctica) and gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) in the Central Park Zoo, New York, NY, USA. Using instantaneous scan sampling, 359 video scans were taken over 10 days. Scans were analysed for nine different categories of behaviour for both species. Intra-species synchrony scores were calculated using the Kappa coefficient of agreement, and inter-species synchrony was measured by computing cross-correlations. As predicted, overall synchrony was significantly greater within both species of penguins than for randomly aggregated data representing mixed groups. There was also significantly less synchrony between species than between randomly mixed data for six of the nine behaviour categories. The pattern of results indicates that the penguins had organized by behaviour into separate species-specific colonies within the enclosure. They maintained species separation through behavioural synchrony despite the restrictions imposed by captivity. © 2013 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.

ABSTRACT: Interspecific competition is an important structuring element in marine ecosystems, especially in the Southern Ocean which offers few prey choices to comparatively large predator populations. We present the first simultaneous observations of at-sea behaviour and attendance patterns of 3 synchronously breeding, central place, krill foragers at Bouvetøya-a small, isolated, sub-Antarctic island in the South Atlantic. Time depth recorders and satellite transmitters were deployed during the austral summer of 2007/2008 on 47 lactating Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella (AFS) rearing pups and on 20 macaroni Eudyptes chrysolophus (MAC) and 30 chinstrap Pygoscelis antarctica penguins (CHIN) rearing chicks. All 3 species showed a strong preference for the west side of the island, and their foraging ranges overlapped markedly. Solar elevation influenced the timing of departures from, and arrivals to, the island with markedly different patterns between the seals and the penguins. Diving patterns also showed significant differences among the 3 species, with the frequency of diving being higher at night for the AFS, while both penguin species dove more frequently during the day. But a common, vertical diel pattern occurred in all 3 species, with shallow diving occurring at night and deep diving during the day, consistent with the vertical migration of krill. MACs targeted 2 depth layers for feeding, including a deep prey layer at ~70 m, which was not exploited by AFSs and CHINs. The results suggest that there is potential for competitive overlap among these 3 krill predators at Bouvetøya, but that it is reduced via both spatial (horizontal and vertical) and temporal partitioning of foraging areas.

ABSTRACT: Corticosterone, the main stress hormone in birds, mediates resource allocation, allowing animals to adjust their physiology and behaviour to changes in the environment. Incubation is a time and energy-consuming phase of the avian reproductive cycle. It may be terminated prematurely, when the parents' energy stores are depleted or when environmental conditions are severe. In this study, the effects of experimentally elevated baseline corticosterone levels on the parental investment of incubating male Adélie penguins were investigated. Incubation duration and reproductive success of 60 penguins were recorded. The clutches of some birds were replaced by dummy eggs, which recorded egg temperatures and rotation rates, enabling a detailed investigation of incubation behaviour. Corticosterone levels of treated birds were 2.4-fold higher than those of controls 18. days post treatment. Exogenous corticosterone triggered nest desertion in 61% of the treated birds; consequently reducing reproductive success, indicating that corticosterone can reduce or disrupt parental investment. Regarding egg temperatures, hypothermic events became more frequent and more pronounced in treated birds, before these birds eventually abandoned their nest. The treatment also significantly decreased incubation temperatures by 1.3. °C and lengthened the incubation period by 2.1. days. However, the number of chicks at hatching was similar among successful nests, regardless of treatment. Weather conditions appeared to be particularly important in determining the extent to which corticosterone levels affected the behaviour of penguins, as treated penguins were more sensitive to severe weather conditions. This underlines the importance of considering the interactions of organisms with their environment in studies of animal behaviour and ecophysiology. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Africa is home today to only a single breeding species of penguin, Spheniscus demersus (black-footed penguin), which is endangered with extinction. Spheniscus demersus has been the only breeding species of penguin to share African coastlines with humans over the last 400000 years. Interestingly, African penguin diversity was substantially higher before the evolution of archaic humans. The fossil record indicates that a diverse assemblage of penguin species inhabited the southern African coasts for much of the Neogene. Previous excavations have identified four distinct species in Early Pliocene coastal marine deposits. Here we extend this pattern of high diversity and report the oldest record of penguins from Africa. Seventeen penguin specimens were identified from the Saldanha Steel locality, revealing the presence of at least four distinct species in South Africa during the Miocene. The largest of these species reached the size of the extant Aptenodytes patagonicus (king penguin), whereas the smallest was approximately the size of the smallest extant penguin Eudyptula minor (little blue penguin). Recovery of Miocene penguin remains is in accordance with earlier predictions of multiple pre-Pliocene colonizations of Africa and supports a higher level of ecological diversity amongst African penguins in the past. © 2013 The Linnean Society of London.

ABSTRACT: Plant communities around penguin rookeries were studied during the Antarctic summer. Antarctic hair grass Deschampsia antarctica was examined. The abundance of this grass around penguin rookeries demonstrated a characteristic distribution. Eight UV screens were installed on a transect leading away from the rookeries. Nitrate reductase activity was measured below and outside of the screens. The activity varied between the measurement sites and also changed with the distance from rookeries. Fifteen cycles of nitrate reductase activity were conducted during the experiment. The highest values of nitrate reductase in the leaves of plants protected from UV radiation, which occurred in well-fertilized sites close to the rookery, reached 743.1 (SD = 789.7) nmol of nitrite synthesized g-1 of dry mass h-1; the lowest occurred in the poorly fertilized sites 77.2 (SD = 41.2) nmol g-1 of dry mass h-1. Nitrate reductase activity in unprotected plants growing in ambient conditions reached up to 843.8 (SD = 894.5) in well-fertilized sites and 159.5 (SD = 257.6) nmol g-1 of dry mass h-1, respectively. The greatest abundance of D. antarctica occurred in the middle of the transect. The influence of ultraviolet radiation caused the induction of NR activity in poorly fertilized sites, but this effect was not visible in sites that were well fertilized. Total nitrogen concentrations in the plant tissues varied between 1.4 % in poor sites and 3.4 % in sites that were situated close to the rookeries. In addition, the concentrations of total nitrogen in the soil varied between the sites and ranged from 0.2 to 3.3 %. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

ABSTRACT: Penguins are a remarkable group of birds, with the 18 extant species living in diverse climatic zones from the tropics to Antarctica. The timing of the origin of these extant penguins remains controversial. Previous studies based on DNA sequences and fossil records have suggested widely differing times for the origin of the group. This has given rise to widely differing biogeographic narratives about their evolution. To resolve this problem, we sequenced five introns from 11 species representing all genera of living penguins. Using these data and other available DNA sequences, together with the ages of multiple penguin fossils to calibrate the molecular clock, we estimated the age of the most recent common ancestor of extant penguins to be 20.4 Myr (17.0-23.8 Myr). This time is half of the previous estimates based on molecular sequence data. Our results suggest that most of the major groups of extant penguins diverged 11-16 Ma. This overlaps with the sharp decline in Antarctic temperatures that began approximately 12 Ma, suggesting a possible relationship between climate change and penguin evolution. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: The 'krill surplus' hypothesis in Antarctica posits that the historic depletion of krill-eating whales and seals in the 18-20th centuries provided a surplus of krill in the Southern Ocean that benefited penguins. A previous study which examined stable isotopes in ancient and modern tissues of Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) provides support for this hypothesis. Specifically, a significant decrease in δ13C and δ15N values occurred in modern versus ancient tissues from an apparent dietary shift from fish to krill associated with the purported krill surplus. Here, we present new data on gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) tissues from active and abandoned colonies at three locations in the Antarctic Peninsula. We found an overall, but weak, decrease in modern versus fossil δ15N and δ13C values of gentoo penguin egg membrane with considerable variation across three breeding sites. Dietary mixing models suggest that shifts between fish and krill in gentoo penguins were likely not as strong as those previously observed in Adélie penguins. This weaker signal probably results from the greater reliance on fish in their diets, past and present, though we cannot rule out declines in primary productivity or other ecosystem shifts which also could account for declines in δ13C and δ15N values.

ABSTRACT: In the 2009-2010 austral summer, two breeding pairs of king penguins were recorded at Stinker Point, Elephant Island, Maritime Antarctic. This is the first record of king penguins breeding south of 60°S. The finding suggests a possible range extension of this species and increases the number of breeding bird species at Stinker Point, which was recently appointed as an Important Bird Area in Antarctica. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: As predicted by life history theory, once recruited into the breeding population and with increasing age, long-lived animals should be able to manage more efficiently the conflict between self-maintenance and reproduction. Consequently, breeding performances should improve with age before stabilizing at a certain level. Using temperature-depth recorders and isotopic analysis, we tested how age affects the foraging behaviour of king penguin Aptenodytes patagonicus during one trip in the chick-rearing phase. Depending on sex and age, king penguins expressed two different foraging strategies. Older birds gained more daily mass per unit body mass than younger ones. Older females conducted shorter trips, dived deeper and performed more prey pursuits. They also had higher blood levels of δ15N than younger individuals and males indicating sex- and age-specific dietary regimes. However, we found no differences in carbon isotopic signature, suggesting that individuals exploited the same foraging areas independently of sex and age. Our results suggest that king penguins are able to increase the quantity of energy extracted with increasing age and that such a strategy is sex-related. Our study is the first to reveal of an interaction between age and sex in determining foraging efficiency in king penguins. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Hormones regulate many aspects of an individual's phenotype, including various physiological and behavioral traits. Two hormones have been described as important players in the regulation of parental investment in birds: the glucocorticoid hormone corticosterone and prolactin, a pituitary hormone, widely involved in mediating parental behavior. In comparison with corticosterone, the role of prolactin on parental investment remains poorly documented, and most studies so far have been correlative. In this study, the effects of an experimental decrease of prolactin levels on the incubation behavior of a long-lived seabird species were assessed. Male Adélie penguins were treated with self-degradable bromocriptine pellets, inhibiting prolactin secretion. Filming and subsequent video analysis allowed the determination of a behavioral time budget for birds and their position on the nest, while dummy eggs recorded incubation parameters. Incubation duration and breeding success at hatching were also monitored. As expected, bromocriptine-treatment significantly decreased plasma prolactin levels, but did not affect corticosterone levels. The behavioral time budget of penguins was not affected by the treatment. However, treated birds spent significantly more time in an upright position on the nest. These birds also incubated their eggs at lower temperatures and turned their eggs more frequently than controls, resulting in a lengthened incubation period. Despite this, the treatment was insufficient to trigger nest desertion and eggs of treated birds still hatched, indicating that several endocrine signals are required for the induction of nest abandonment. We suggest that the decreased prolactin levels in treated birds offset their timeline of breeding, so that birds displayed behavior typical of early incubation. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Long term changes (46 years) in the abundance of pygoscelid penguins breeding populations and nests distribution in the Lions Rump (King George Island) colony were investigated in three time intervals, according to previously published two censuses and one original study conducted in 2010. At that time a detailed colony map based on the GIS system was made. Results of this study showed different trends for each investigated species. In the last three decades Adélie penguin breeding populations showed strong declining tendencies (69.61%). In contrast, the population of gentoo penguins represents the reverse trend, increasing 171.85% over the same period. Observed changes in both penguin population sizes are reflected in the different spatial and geographic distribution of their nests. The population changes observed at the Lions Rump colony are consistent with the relevant pygoscelid penguin tendencies in the western Antarctic Peninsula region. Breeding penguin population dynamics at Lions Rump area with a minimal disturbance by human activity may well illustrate a natural response of those birds to environmental changes in the Antarctic.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this project was to study the fate of chemically persistent organochlorine xenobiotics in the marine link of the food web, between penguins and herrings (Clupea harengus), which are the only food for Spheniscus demersus from the Gdańsk Zoo. Concentrations of hexachlorobenzene (HCBz), pentachlorobenzene (PCBz), trichlorobenzene (TCBz) and the γ-HCH isomer were determined in Baltic herrings, in muscles, fat and liver of penguins, unhatched eggs, contour feathers and guano. The highest concentrations of fungicides were observed for HCBz. Fungicides were not detected in the liver of penguins and herrings. The bioaccumulation factor (BAF) for fungicides reached the highest values in the penguin brain. The highest biomagnification factor (BMF) for PCBz was determined in the muscle tissue and for lindane - in liver. It was confirmed that detoxification of penguins occurred through deposition of fungicides and lindane in guano and through epithelial tissue and eggs. © 2013 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Wien.

ABSTRACT: Magellanic Penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) migrate thousands of kilometres from their breeding colonies every winter. Despite the significance of this seasonal movement, aspects of its ecology and implications for conservation biology remain enigmatic. We examined the sex of 528 Magellanic Penguins either beachcast (found dead ashore) or stranded (found alive ashore) in wintering grounds of southern Brazil from 2002 to 2009. We found evidence that: (a) among beachcast Penguins, females significantly outnumbered males; (b) for stranded Penguins that had not been oiled, the sex-ratio was significantly female-biased, whereas among oiled Penguins the sex-ratio was even; (c) among stranded Penguins, females had a lower rate of survival through rehabilitation than males; and (d) for both sexes, juvenile Penguins surviving rehabilitation had greater body mass upon admission than those that died. Our findings suggest an increased mortality of juvenile and adult females might occur during migration, and emphasise that sex may play a significant role in the movement ecology and conservation of this species. Conservation efforts might thus benefit from incorporating sex-based strategies to ensure that biased sex mortality does not have a negative effect on the species, and researchers are encouraged to consider sex as a key component in the ecological research and conservation efforts of this, and other, species of penguin. © 2013 Bird Life Australia.

ABSTRACT: Using a 40 yr demographic database of little penguins Eudyptula minor, we investigated anticipated impacts of climatic changes on the penguin population at Phillip Island, southeastern Australia, and the potential economic impact on the associated tourism industry over the next century. We project a small loss of penguin breeding habitat due to sea level rise, although breeding habitat is unlikely to be limiting over this period. However, some erosion in the vicinity of tourism infrastructure will undoubtedly occur which will have economic implications. We anti cipate little direct impact of decreased rainfall and humidity. However, fire risk may increase, and extreme climate events may reduce adult and chick survival slightly. Warmer oceans are likely to improve recruitment into the breeding population but the effect on adult survival is unclear. Overall, many aspects of little penguin biology are likely to be affected by climatic change but no net negative effect on population size is projected from existing analyses. Ocean acidification has the potential to be a highly significant negative influence, but present assessments are speculative. Some of the predicted negative impacts can be addressed in the shortterm, particularly those resulting from expected changes to the terrestrial environment. Others, particularly in the marine environment, appear to have limited options for mitigation locally. In the absence of evidence indicating population decline, economic impact may be confined to issues for tourism infrastructure due to increased sea-levels during storm events. © Inter-Research 2013.

ABSTRACT: To evaluate the avian influenza virus (AIV) circulation in Antarctic and sub-Antarctic penguins we carried out a serosurvey on six species from Livingston, Marion and Gough islands. Seropositivity against AIV was performed on serum samples using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and haemagglutination and neuraminidase inhibition assays. Some oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs were also assayed to detect influenza virus genomes by real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Overall, 12.1% (n = 140) penguins were seropositive to AIV. By species, we detected 5% (n = 19) and 11% (n = 18) seroprevalence in sub-Antarctic rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes spp.) from Gough and Marion islands, respectively, 42% (n = 33) seroprevalence in macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chysolophus Brandt), but no positives in the three other species, gentoo (Pygoscelis papua Forster; n = 25) and chinstrap penguins (P. antarctica Forster; n = 16), from Livingston Island and king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus Miller; n = 27) from Marion Island. While seropositivity reflected previous exposure to the AIV, the influenza genome was not detected. Our results indicate that AIV strains have circulated in penguin species in the sub-Antarctic region, but further studies are necessary to determine the precise role that such penguin species play in AIV epidemiology and if this circulation is species (or genus) specific.

ABSTRACT: This study is the first report on mortality of Spheniscus magellanicus, penguin of South America, caused by Plasmodium tejerai, which was identified using morphological and molecular analyses. Blood stages (trophozoites, meronts and gametocytes) were reported and illustrated. The necropsy revealed marked splenomegaly and pulmonary edema, as well as moderate hepatomegaly and hydropericardium. The histopathology revealed the presence of tissue meronts in the macrophages and endothelial cells of multiple organs. The molecular analyses showed 5.6% of genetic divergence in cytochrome b gene between P. tejerai and Plasmodium relictum. Morphology of blood and tissue stages of P. tejerai is similar to P. relictum; the distinction between these two species requires experience in the identification of avian Plasmodium species. Molecular studies associated with reliably identified morphological species are useful for barcoding and comparisons with previous studies of wildlife malaria infections as well as for posterior phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies. S. magellanicus is a new host record of P. tejerai, which is the virulent parasite and worth more attention in avian conservation and veterinary medicine projects in South America. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The western Antarctica Peninsula and Scotia Sea ecosystems appear to be driven by complex links between climatic variables, primary productivity, krill and Avian predators. There are several studies reporting statistical relationships between climate, krill and Penguin population size. The Adélie (Pygoscelis adeliae), Chinstrap (P. antarctica) and Gentoo (P. papua) penguins appear to be influenced by interannual variability in sea-ice extent and krill biomass. In this paper we developed simple conceptual models to decipher the role of climate and krill fluctuations on the population dynamics of these three Pygoscelis penguin species inhabiting the Antarctic Peninsula region. Our results suggest that the relevant processes underlying the population dynamics of these penguin species at King George Island (South Shetland Islands) are intra-specific competition and the combined effects of krill abundance and sea-ice cover. Our results using population theoretical models appear to support that climate change, specifically regional warming on the western Antarctic Peninsula, represents a major driver. At our study site, penguins showed species-specific responses to climate change. While Chinstrap penguins were only influenced by krill abundance, the contrasting population trends of Adélie and Gentoo penguins appear to be better explained by the "sea-ice hypothesis". We think that proper population dynamic modeling and theory are essential for deciphering and proposing the ecological mechanisms underlying dynamics of these penguin populations. © 2013 The Society of Population Ecology and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: Yellow-eyed penguins (YEPs) have suffered major population declines over the past 30 years, with no single cause established. Leucocytozoon was first identified in yellow-eyed penguins in 2005. During the 2008/09 breeding season, a high mortality was seen in both mainland yellow-eyed penguins as well as those on Enderby Island of the Auckland Islands archipelago. A high overall prevalence of Leucocytozoon spp. in association with a high incidence of chick mortality was observed during this period on Enderby Island. One chick had histological evidence of leucocytozoonosis with megaloschizonts in multiple organs throughout its body. In addition, a high prevalence (73·7%) of Leucocytozoon was observed by PCR in the blood of adult Enderby yellow-eyed penguins taken during the 2006/07 season. These findings were different from the low prevalence detected by PCR on the coast of the South Island (11%) during the 2008/2009 breeding session and earlier on Campbell Island (21%) during the 2006/2007 breeding session. The Leucocytozoon spp. sequences detected lead us to conclude that the Leucocytozoon parasite is common in yellow-eyed penguins and has a higher prevalence in penguins from Enderby Island than those from Campbell Island and the mainland of New Zealand. The Enderby Island yellow-eyed penguins are infected with a Leucocytozoon spp. that is genetically distinct from that found in other yellow-eyed penguin populations. The role of Leucocytozoon in the high levels of chick mortality in the yellow-eyed penguins remains unclear. Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2013.

ABSTRACT: How closely related marine organisms mitigate competition for resources while foraging at sea is not well understood, particularly the relative importance of interspecific and intraspecific mitigation strategies. Using location and time-depth data, we investigated species-specific and sex-specific foraging areas and diving behaviour of the closely related Humboldt (Spheniscus humboldti) and Magellanic (S. magellanicus) Penguins breeding in sympatry at Islotes Puñihuil in southern Chile during the chick-rearing period. The average duration of foraging trips was <20h and did not differ significantly between species or between sexes of each species. Magellanic Penguins made significantly deeper and longer dives than Humboldt Penguins. Males of both species made significantly longer dives than females. Total distance travelled per foraging trip was significantly greater for males than for females, and females made more direct trips (less sinuous) than males. Foraging effort was concentrated in waters up to 15km to the west and south-west of the colony. The overlap in density contours was lower between species than between sexes within a species. In general, dive characteristics and foraging areas differed more between Magellanic and Humboldt Penguins than between the sexes of each species. In contrast to the findings of studies of flying seabirds, the foraging behaviour of these penguins differs more between species than between sexes. © 2013 Bird Life Australia.

ABSTRACT: Colonial breeding is common in seabirds, and may provide individuals with benefits such as increased protection from predators by joint defence, improved information exchange and enhanced access to mates. However, the presence of large numbers of individuals in breeding colonies may also lead to interference, especially where conspecific behaviour disrupts the normal chick-rearing routine. Using standardised video recordings, we describe and quantify for the first time such disruptive behaviour by conspecifics in penguins. This disruptive behaviour appeared to be common in chick-feeding Southern rockhopper penguins Eudyptes chrysocome and its occurrence did not differ significantly among the colony areas where observations were made. Females were commonly (77 % of 111 observation sessions) disrupted by other adults when attempting to feed chicks alone during the crèche stage. They consequently reduced the time spent with their chicks. Disrupted chicks compensated by begging more intensely when their female parents were present, and they did not eat significantly less often than undisrupted chicks. In contrast, disruptive behaviour towards chick-feeding males or pairs was never observed. This study supplements knowledge about a disruptive behaviour that appears to be common but for which the function remains unclear in penguins, as the intruders did not appear to gain any visible benefits. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to identify effective techniques for the culture of the winged oyster (Pteria penguin) by comparing the growth and mortality of juveniles cultured on a self-designed wire collector and in traditional circle nets. The juveniles were hatchery reared, nearly 5 mo old, and were cultured in Li'an Lagoon, Hainan Island, China. The mean shell height (SH) and total weight (TW) of the juveniles was 26.06 ± 3.43 mm and 5.85.88 ± 2.258 g, respectively. They were held for 7 mo in suspended culture either on self-designed wire collectors or in circle nets. The collector was made of galvanized seizing wire, consisting of a top circle, a bottom circle, and 3 pillars between the 2 circles. Every collector was settled with approximately 150 spat and hung naturally in the sea. The oysters cultured in circle nets had three stocking densities: 10 juveniles (D10), 20 juveniles (D20), and 30 juveniles (D30) per net. Juveniles held on wire collectors and in D10 circle nets showed the greatest growth during the experiment, and had significantly greater shell height (SH), maximum diagonal length, hinge length, and TW than oysters in other densities. Oysters in D30 showed the lowest mean SH and maximum diagonal length, hinge length, and TW. Mortality ranged from 3.33% in D10to approximately 17% for oysters in D30 and on wire collectors. When other factors such as cost of equipment, labor, and ease of construction were considered along with growth and survival, the method of natural hanging on a wire collector is highly advisable in Li'an Lagoon because this method takes advantage of the strong byssi of winged oysters, substantially reduces cost, is easy to construct, and promotes increased growth. Although the loss of oysters was relatively high, it was balanced positively by growth rate and cost reduction, because the spat are hatchery produced and easily available.

ABSTRACT: Five species of digeneans parasitic in the Magellanic penguin Spheniscus magellanicus (Forster) from off the Brazilian coast of the western Atlantic are reported for the first time from this host and described. These are Mesostephanus odhneri (Travassos, 1924) Lutz, 1935, Posthodiplostomummacrocotyle Dubois, 1937, Stephanoprorauruguayensis Holcman-Spector & Olagüe, 1989, Ascocotyle (Phagicola) longa Ransom, 1920 and Ascocotyle (Phagicola) sp. One other digenean, Cardiocephaloides physalis (Lutz, 1926) Sudarikov, 1959, was also recorded. The taxonomy of the species and available data on their life-cycles are commented upon in relation to the possible origins of digenean infections of the Magellanic penguin. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

ABSTRACT: Traditional methods for sex identification are not applicable to sexually monomorphic species, leading to difficulties in the management of their breeding programs. To identify sex in sexually monomorphic birds, molecular methods have been established. Two established primer pairs (2550F/2718R and p8/p2) amplify the CHD1 gene region from both the Z and W chromosomes. Here, we evaluated the use of these primers for sex identification in four sexually monomorphic penguin species: king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus), rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome), gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua), and Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus). For all species except rockhopper penguins, primer pair 2550F/2718R resulted in two distinct CHD1Z and CHD1W PCR bands, allowing for sex identification. For rockhopper penguins, only primer pair p8/p2 yielded different CHD1Z and CHD1W bands, which were faint and similar in size making them difficult to distinguish. As a result, we designed a new primer pair (PL/PR) that efficiently determined the gender of individuals from all four penguin species. Sequencing of the PCR products confirmed that they were from the CHD1 gene region. Primer pair PL/PR can be evaluated for use in sexing other penguin species, which will be crucial for the management of new penguin breeding programs.

ABSTRACT: Recent studies suggest that parental resource allocation may be the most important factor explaining differences in reproductive output among parents. That said at least two different hypotheses of balance between parental foraging effort and resource allocation have been proposed. First, parents with high foraging effort have high reproductive success. Second, parents with higher allocation of resources to offspring have high reproductive success. We tested the second hypothesis using chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica) as a model. We evaluated nutritional condition of the parents using blood urea, uric acid, creatine kinase, and cholesterol levels. We evaluated reproductive success according to total mass of the brood and asymmetries inside the brood. We measured the degree of asymmetry using weight and culmen length. Generalized linear models were used to examine relationships between adult plasma urea levels with year, nest position, and degree of asymmetry in chicks. Our results demonstrate that lighter broods were more asymmetric and associated with lower values of adult plasma urea, uric acid, and creatine kinase. We interpret these findings as evidence that the birds allocate fewer resources to their chicks than adults with more symmetric broods are. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: We estimated levels of diversity at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II DRß1 gene in 50 breeding pairs of the Magellanic penguin and compared those to estimates from Humboldt and Galapagos penguins. We tested for positive selection and 2 conditions required for the evolution of MHC-based disassortative mating: 1) greater MHC diversity between breeding pairs compared to random mating, and 2) associations between MHC genotype and fitness. Cloning and sequencing of the DRß1 gene showed that Magellanic penguins had higher levels of genetic variation than Galapagos and Humboldt penguins. Sequence analysis revealed 45 alleles with 3.6% average proportion of nucleotide differences, nucleotide diversity of 0.030, and observed heterozygosity of 0.770. A gene phylogeny showed 9 allelic lineages with interspersed DRß1 sequences from Humboldt and Galapagos penguins, indicating ancestral polymorphisms. dN/dS ratios revealed evidence for positive selection. Analysis of breeding pairs showed no disassortative mating preferences. Significant MHC genotype/fitness associations in females suggest, however, that selection for pathogen resistance plays a more important role than mate choice in maintaining diversity at the MHC in the Magellanic penguin. The differential effect of MHC heterozygosity on fitness between the sexes is likely associated with the relative role of hatching and fledging rates as reliable indicators of overall fitness in males and females. © 2012 The American Genetic Association.

ABSTRACT: After an extended period of sporadic sightings of small numbers of king penguins at the Falkland Islands, they established themselves on Volunteer Point, situated at the north-east of the islands, by the late 1970s. By 1980, a small breeding population was present which yielded some 40 fledglings during that same year. Since 1991, the population has been monitored annually and the resulting fledgling counts analysed to assess population trends. The population demonstrated a significant increase over the past three decades, at about 10% per annum, with time explaining 75% of the variation in count data. The current population is estimated to be 720 breeding pairs. Despite several authors having alluded to the existence of a large colony of king penguins at the Falklands prior to human exploitation, we found no evidence in support of this. We furthermore found no evidence in the literature in support of exploitation for king penguin oil during the 19th century. Unlike at other breeding sites, increasing numbers of king penguins at the Falklands is consequently unlikely to be a recovery response following exploitation, but rather an indication of either increased immigration or of improved feeding conditions. © Copyright 2012 Antarctic Science Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Knowledge about parasites of Antarctic birds is fragmented and scarce. The aim of this work is to contribute to the knowledge of gastrointestinal parasites of the Chinstrap Penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica) from Deception Island (South Shetlands, Antarctica). Gastrointestinal tracts of 64 fresh dead individuals (61 chicks and three adults) were collected from December 2006 to February 2009 and examined for macroparasites. Three adult parasite species were found: two Cestoda species (Parorchites zederi and Tetrabothrius pauliani) and one Nematoda species (Stegophorus macronectes). Also, immature acanthocephalans (Corynosoma sp.) were found in one penguin. The low parasite richness observed could be related to the stenophagic and pelagic diet of the host species. False negatives were found in coprological studies. © Springer-Verlag 2012.

ABSTRACT: Pygoscelis penguins are experiencing general population declines in their northernmost range whereas there are reported increases in their southernmost range. These changes are coincident with decadal-scale trends in remote sensed observations of sea ice concentrations (SIC) and sea surface temperatures (SST) during the chick-rearing season (austral summer). Using SIC, SST, and bathymetry, we identified separate chick-rearing niche spaces for the three Pygoscelis penguin species and used a maximum entropy approach (MaxEnt) to spatially and temporally model suitable chick-rearing habitats in the Southern Ocean. For all Pygoscelis penguin species, the MaxEnt models predict significant changes in the locations of suitable chick-rearing habitats over the period of 1982-2010. In general, chick-rearing habitat suitability at specific colony locations agreed with the corresponding increases or decreases in documented population trends over the same time period. These changes were the most pronounced along the West Antarctic Peninsula where there has been a rapid warming event during at least the last 50 years. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Using 20 years of data (1986 to 2008), we examined relationships between oceanographic variables (Fremantle sea level (FSL) a proxy for the strength of the Leeuwin Current and sea surface temperature (SST)) and five measures of little penguin, Eudyptula minor, breeding performance near Perth, Western Australia: namely (1) the laying date, (2) the number of chicks produced per pair, (3) the proportion of eggs that hatched, (4) the overall breeding success, defined as the proportion of total eggs laid that resulted in successful fledglings and (5) chick mass at fledging. The next three years of data (2009 to 2011) were used to test the performance of our statistical predictive models. FSL provided more accurate predictions of timing of laying, whereas SST provided more accurate predictions of breeding success. A later end to laying was associated with a high FSL during the summer (December to February) before breeding. Higher SSTs in the pre-breeding period from April to May corresponded to reduced breeding success, with lower fledgling success, fewer chicks per pair and generally a lower mean mass of chicks at fledging. The models predict that future oceanographic warming is expected to reduce the breeding success of this colony of little penguins. © 2012 CSIRO.

ABSTRACT: Total mercury (Hg) concentration and several other geochemical parameters were determined for five sediment profiles from the Antarctic Ross Sea region. Our data exhibit significant positive correlations between Hg concentration and total organic carbon (TOC) content in all profiles, suggesting the predominant role of organic matter (OM) as a Hg carrier. The OM in the sediments originates primarily from penguin guano and algae. High Hg content in guano and a positive correlation between Hg and a guano bio-element (phosphorus, P) in the ornithogenic sediment profiles (MB6, BI and CC) indicate that Hg was strongly influenced by guano input. The bottom sediments of MB6 with seal hairs contain relatively high Hg. This increase is attributed to the input of seal excrement, suggesting that sedimentary Hg may be an effective trophic-level indicator from seals to penguins. The enrichment factor (EF) for Hg was calculated and the results indicated apparent Hg enrichment in the sediment profiles from the Ross Sea region caused by bio-vectors such as penguins and seals. Compared with typical sediments from other sites in Antarctica and the SQGs (sediment quality guidelines), the total amount of Hg in our study area is still not considered to be adversely high. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Avian eggs have become one of the most common means of evaluating mercury contamination in aquatic and marine environments and can serve as reliable indicators of dietary mercury exposure. We investigated patterns of mercury deposition into the major components of penguin eggs (shell, membrane, albumen, and yolk) using the Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) as a model species. Eggs were collected from both wild and captive populations of Gentoo penguins to compare the allocation of mercury into individual egg components of birds feeding at disparate trophic positions as inferred by stable isotope analysis. Mercury concentrations in captive penguins were an order of magnitude higher than in wild birds, presumably because the former were fed only fish at a higher trophic position relative to wild penguins that fed on a diet of 72-93% krill (Euphausia spp.). Similar to previous studies, we found the majority of total egg mercury sequestered in the albumen (92%) followed by the yolk (6.7%) with the lowest amounts in the shell (0.9%) and membrane (0.4%). Regardless of dietary exposure, mercury concentrations in yolk and membrane, and to a lesser degree shell, increased with increasing albumen mercury (used as a proxy for whole-egg mercury), indicating that any component, in the absence of others, may be suitable for monitoring changes in dietary mercury. Because accessibility of egg tissues in the wild varies, the establishment of consistent relationships among egg components will facilitate comparisons with any other study using eggs to assess dietary exposure to mercury. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.

ABSTRACT: We examined sexual dimorphism in bill size in adult Adélie Penguins Pygoscelis adeliae, adult Chinstrap Penguins P. antarctica and adult and juvenile Gentoo Penguins P. papua at King George Island, Antarctica, using a DNA-based molecular sexing technique. Bill length and depth were the most consistent dimorphic character examined, with measurements 5.4%-11.5% larger in males than in females, on average. Within breeding pairs sampled, male Chinstrap and Gentoo Penguins had consistently longer and deeper bills than their mates, although bill measurement overlapped between sexes at the population level. We used bill measurements to calculate species- and age-specific discriminant functions that correctly classified 83.2%-96.7% of the individuals in our study following cross-validation. The discriminant functions derived from this analysis provide a practical method of sex determination for all three Pygoscelis penguin species in the South Shetland Islands where they breed sympatrically. Posterior probability analysis can also be used to identify individuals that are likely to be incorrectly classified using discriminant function analysis, allowing DNA-based tests for gender to be reserved for targeted use. Furthermore, we report raw morphometric data to facilitate future analysis and discriminant function improvement.

ABSTRACT: A fractured femur of a giant fossil penguin from the Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi Biozone (Late Eocene), Isla Marambio (Seymour Island), Antarctica (La Meseta Formation) is described. Palaeoecological, palaeopathological and taphonomical implications derived from the analysis of the kinds of fractures identified are also discussed. The main fracture has irregular margins, indicating there was collagen in the bone at the time of the impact. In this fracture, a mineral deposit was also identified as a fracture hematoma. According to the antemortem classification of fractures, it was produced by an indirect mechanism, provocating a "butterfly wing" or "third fragment" fracture. The remaining fractures are assigned to times of biostratinomic and fossil diagenesis. © Copyright Antarctic Science Ltd 2012.

ABSTRACT: In the present study, persistent organic pollutants (POPs) were determined in 25 livers from Magellanic penguins, Spheniscus magellanicus, found on the state of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). The following concentrations of POPs (wet weight) were found: ∑ PCBs: 18.9-775.8ngg-1; ∑ DDTs: 2.3-275ngg-1; and ∑ HCHs: 1.0-11.8ngg-1. Among the PCBs, there was a predominance of hexachlorobiphenyls (138 and 153) and heptachlorobiphenyls (180 and 187). Among the organochlorines, DDT predominated. Through histopathologic exams a positive correlation was found between HCB and cardiovascular failure (p=0.012), as HCB values (wet weight) were 6.33-96.49ngg-1 for positive animals and 2.45-19.63ngg-1 for negative animals. Studies on POPs in Magellan penguins contribute to a better understanding of the distribution and trends of these pollutants in the western South Atlantic Ocean. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The recently observed recession of glaciers on King George Island is associated with decades of climate warming in the Antarctic Peninsula region. However, with only 60 years of glaciological observations in the study area ages of the oldest moraines are still uncertain. The goal of the study was to estimate ages of lichen colonization on the oldest moraines of the Ecology and White Eagle Glaciers on King George Island and on the Principal Cone of Penguin Island volcano. The first lichenometric studies on these islands from the late 1970s used rates that had about four to five times slower Rhizocarpon growth rates. We re-examined the sites and measured 996 thalli diameters to establish the surface ages. To estimate the age we used (1) long-term Rhizocarpon lichen group growth rates established by authors using data from a previous lichenometric study on King George Island (2) previous data of lichen growth rates from other sub-Antarctic islands. Our results suggest growth rates between 0.5 and 0.8mmyr -1. According to these rates the ages of the oldest moraine ridges are of the Little Ice Age and were colonized at the beginning of the twentieth century. The mid-twentieth century age of lichen colonization on the historically active Penguin Island volcano might support the date of the last eruption reported by whalers in the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century. © The authors 2012.

ABSTRACT: Deception Island (62°57′S, 60°38′W) is one of the most frequently visited locations in Antarctica, prompting speculation that tourism may have a negative impact on the island's breeding chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica). Discussions regarding appropriate management of Deception Island and its largest penguin colony at Baily Head have thus far operated in the absence of concrete information regarding the current size of the penguin population at Deception Island or long-term changes in abundance. In the first ever field census of individual penguin nests at Deception Island (December 2-14, 2011), we find 79,849 breeding pairs of chinstrap penguins, including 50,408 breeding pairs at Baily Head and 19,177 breeding pairs at Vapour Col. Our field census, combined with a simulation designed to capture uncertainty in an earlier population estimate by Shuford and Spear (Br Antarct Surv Bull 81:19-30, 1988), suggests a significant (>50 %) decline in the abundance of chinstraps breeding at Baily Head since 1986/1987. A comparative analysis of high-resolution satellite imagery for the 2002/2003 and the 2009/2010 seasons suggests a 39 % (95th percentile CI = 6-71 %) decline (from 85,473 ± 23,352 to 52,372 ± 14,309 breeding pairs) over that 7-year period and provides independent confirmation of population decline in the abundance of breeding chinstrap penguins at Baily Head. The decline in chinstrap penguins at Baily Head is consistent with declines in this species throughout the region, including sites that receive little or no tourism; as a consequence of regional environmental changes that currently represent the dominant influence on penguin dynamics, we cannot ascribe any direct link between chinstrap declines and tourism from this study. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: Due to its high spatial resolution, broad spatial coverage, and cost-effectiveness, commercial satellite imagery is rapidly becoming a key component of biological monitoring in the Antarctic. While considerable success in surveying emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) has been facilitated by their large size and the visual simplicity of their habitat, there has been considerably less progress in mapping colonies on the Antarctic Peninsula and associated sub-Antarctic islands where smaller penguin species breed on topographically complex terrain composed of mixed substrates. Here, we demonstrate that Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae), chinstrap penguin (P. antarcticus), gentoo penguin (P. papua), and macaroni penguin (Eudyptes chrysolophus) colonies can be detected by high-resolution (2-m multispectral, 40-50-cm panchromatic) satellite imagery and that under ideal conditions, such imagery is capable of distinguishing among groups of species where they breed contiguously. To demonstrate the potential for satellite imagery to estimate penguin population abundance, we use satellite imagery of Paulet Island (63°35′S, 55°47′W) to estimate a site-wide population of 115,673 (99,222-127,203) breeding pairs of Adélie penguins. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: The recent discovery of a Plasmodium parasite in the endangered Galapagos Penguin (Spheniscus mendiculus) poses a threat to the long-term persistence of this endangered species and, potentially, much of the endemic avifauna of the Galapagos Islands. However, little information is available on the transmission dynamics or pathogenicity of Plasmodium in the Galapagos. We added a simple model of infection to the population model of the Galapagos Penguin devised by Vargas et al. (2007). Two variables (the probability of an individual becoming infected each year, and the increase in annual mortality caused by infection) defne the dynamics of the disease component of the model; the stress from El Niño events could afect parasitized individuals in diferent ways, so three forms of stress-induced relapse are also explored. All models show a high impact due to mortality from infection, and there are large parts of parameter space that have a 0% probability of persistence for the next 100 years. To estimate the mortality that might be associated with Plasmodium infection, a comparison was made between census data from 1998-2009 and model predictions based on the same years. A range of plausible mortality values was determined from the best-ftting models, ranging from 0-5% to 0-10% depending on the type of relapse modeled. Even at these relatively low levels of impact, Plasmodium infection has the potential to drastically reduce the probability of persistence of the Galapagos Penguin population over the next 100 years. © 2013 by The American Ornithologists' Union.

ABSTRACT: The CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program aims at detecting possible impacts of the krill fishery on predator populations. Population parameters of Chinstrap and Adélie penguins are monitored at Point Martin, Laurie Island, South Orkneys Islands as part of the Program. Diet information is collected to aid in the interpretation of population data. In the present study, the diet of both species is compared in order to detect differences between them as well as to ascertain whether the krill consumed by both species might be pooled in single estimates of prey parameters. A nested ANOVA model was fitted to the dataset obtained in the seasons from 1997/1998 to 2005/2006. The overall variance was decomposed into variance components: within penguins (krill in stomachs), between penguins (means within each date), between dates (date means in each season), and between years (annual means). The within penguins component was similar in both species (18 % difference), while the between penguins was 64 % larger in Adelies. The within and between penguins variance components of both species showed consistent interannual changes. The annual means of both species differed significantly in three seasons, but not consistently. The sources of variance are tentatively attributed to biological characteristics: the within penguins component would reflect searching and feeding at the individual level; the between penguins might be associated with their foraging ranges, an assumption to be tested tracking individuals. Given their differences, the information from both species should be viewed as complementary and not be pooled. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: Study of physiological mechanisms can help us to understand how animals respond to changing environmental conditions. In particular, stress hormones (i.e. glucocorticoids, such as corticosterone) are described as mediating resource allocation, allowing animals to adjust their physiology and behaviour to predictable and unpredictable changes in the environment. In this study, we investigated the effects of an experimental increase in baseline corticosterone levels on the breeding effort and the reproductive output of chick-rearing male Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae). The number of chicks per nest, their body mass, and their size were monitored throughout the study. Direct observations allowed measurement of the time spent foraging at sea and caring for the young on the nest. At the end of the treatment, blood samples were collected for isotope analysis. Although all birds raised at least one chick, reproductive output was decreased by 42% in corticosterone-treated birds compared with control birds. The increase in corticosterone levels during the guard stage did not affect the mass of surviving chicks or the brood mass at fledging. Corticosterone-treated males spent on average 21% more time at the nest than control birds. However, the duration of foraging trips was similar between both groups. In addition, the similarity of isotopic signatures suggests that both groups foraged at similar locations and ingested the same prey species. The detailed on-land behaviour of birds should be examined in further studies to clarify the possible links between corticosterone levels, brooding time, and reproductive output. Understanding the relationships between glucocorticoids, fitness, and ultimately population dynamics is fundamental to enabling conservation physiology as a discipline to be successful in helping to manage species of conservation concern. © The Author 2013.

ABSTRACT: Lipid biomarkers in AD2 penguin droppings-amend soil core from the Ardley Island, Western Antarctic, were dated using 210Pb. Changes in the fatty acid ratios of nC18:2/nC18:0 from the penguin droppings reflect climate changes coincident with ENNO events during 1931-2006. The occurrence of the minimum values in the depth of 2-3 and 6-7 cm are consistent with the end of ENSO in 1958 and 1983, respectively, reflecting a lag of the biomarker records in AD2 penguin droppings-amend soil in climatic signatures. This study also reveals that the changes in the relative concentration of n-alkanes nC23, the ratios of nC23/nC17 and ΣnC21-/ΣnC22+, and carbon preferential index (CPI) values collectively indicate the variations of soil microorganism and lower plant, which are closely related to climate changes. The ratios of bacterial fatty acids iC15:0/aC15:0 reflect the increasing significance of microorganism activities during the two periods that occurred at the end years of ENSO. Decrease in CPIA value and increase in ΣnC21t-/ΣnC22+ indicate that low molecular weight fatty acids are derived from microorganism; and their insignificant correlation with Pr/Ph suggests microorganisms play an important role in the relatively simply ecosystem in the Antarctic and are closely linked to climatic conditions. In addition, the observed penguin community indicates the population of penguin can largely reflect the impacts of global climate changes on the ecosystem. © 2012 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Between 1979 and 2002, 5044 Little Penguins Eudyptula minor were banded (4796 adults, 248 chicks) at Rabbit Island, Wilsons Promontory, Victoria. Recoveries of dead banded birds and recaptures away from the island of banded adult and fledging birds made up to June 2009 are reviewed: mention is also made of results obtained from banding smaller numbers of birds (823) on Seal, Rag and Notch Islands in the nearby Seal Island Group between 1991 and 2001. For birds originally banded at Rabbit Island, most recoveries were made to the west of the banding site, although some birds were found dead in New South Wales and in northern Tasmania. Recoveries were made in and out of presumed breeding periods, particularly during winter/early spring and mid-summer for adults, usually within 400 kilometres of Rabbit Island and less than five years after banding. While causes of death were rarely reported (if known), there was a substantial increase in recoveries following a die-off of Pilchards Sardinops sagax in southern Australian waters in 1995. Recoveries of banded birds from Rabbit Island and the Seal Island Group fit within a pattern shown by banding at other colonies, namely that those from colonies to the west and south tend to move to the coasts of western Victoria and South Australia whereas those to the east may move north and south. Such results suggest that Little Penguins disperse away from breeding colonies to areas of presumed increased productivity and prey availability.

ABSTRACT: In 1956, an emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) colony had been reported during an aerial survey north of the north-western protrusion of the West Ice Shelf in East Antarctica. About 15,000 birds were estimated to be present. The region often has very heavy pack ice conditions hindering access by vessels. In the summers of 2009-2011, we surveyed the area from the air and sighted two emperor penguin colonies. One was situated on top of the ice shelf and comprised 342 adults and 1,156 chicks. The second colony was seen near the northern edge of the West Ice Shelf on the sea ice about 60 km farther south than in 1956. There were at least 1,498 adults and 3,436 chicks. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: The pharmacokinetics of a single dose of enrofloxacin administered orally, both pilled and in fish, and i.v. to African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) at 15 mg/kg were determined. Plasma concentrations of enrofloxacin and its metabolite ciprofloxacin were measured via high-pressure liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry. An i.v. administration of enrofloxacin resulted in an extrapolated mean plasma concentration of 7.86 μg/ml at time zero. Plasma volume of distribution for i.v. administration was 3.00 L/kg, with a mean elimination half-life of 13.67 hr and a mean total body clearance rate of 3.03 ml/min/kg. Oral administration of enrofloxacin achieved a mean maximum plasma concentration of 4.38 μg/ml at 4.8 hr after administration when pilled, whereas mean maximum plasma concentration was 4.77 μg/ml at 1.59 hr after administration when given in fish. Mean terminal elimination half-life was 13.79 hr pilled and 11.93 hr when given in fish. Low concentrations of ciprofloxacin were detected after both oral and i.v. enrofloxacin administration. Enrofloxacin administered to African penguins at 15 mg/kg p.o. q. 24 hr, whether in fish or pilled, is expected to achieve the surrogate markers of efficacy for bacteria with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.5 μg/ml or less; however, clinical studies are needed to determine efficacy. © 2012 American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Successful hatchery production of commercial bivalve species requires optimal recruitment of larvae to substrates. This study used two experiments to investigate the effects on recruitment of Pteria penguin pediveliger larvae of (1) treating the culture medium with alternate concentrations of three chemical compounds both in the presence/absence of a bio-film and (2) exposure to five substrate types both in the presence/absence of a chemical cue. Small 10mL aquaria were stocked with 1larvaemL -1 and given a 25×25mm piece of horizontally-oriented flat substrate. The proportion of larvae within each treatment that displayed various behaviours (swimming/sitting/crawling), had settled using byssal attachment or had undergone mortality was recorded at 24, 48 and 72h. After 48h, settlement of P. penguin was 65% greater in aquaria containing a substrate covered by a naturally formed bio-film than in control aquaria. The neuroactive compounds 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and the chemical compound potassium chloride (KCl) all acted to decrease larval swimming behaviour when compared to controls with untreated seawater. Exposure to KCl (20mM) also resulted in more larvae crawling over the substrate surface. After 72h, settlement of larvae in aquaria treated with serotonin (10 -3M) or KCl (20mM) was significantly greater than in control aquaria by 75% and 84%, respectively, while exposure to GABA had no effect. The positive effect of a bio-film on settlement did not change significantly according to chemical treatment of the culture medium, suggesting that the techniques can be used in conjunction. Settlement in response to 20mM KCl was enhanced by the presence of a red nylon mesh substrate with 5mm between filaments. Roughly three times more larvae settled onto this substrate during the first 24h when compared to the same material with a smaller mesh size, black fibreglass screen and smooth plastic substrates. Comparisons with settlement behaviour of other bivalves and the commercial implications of this research are discussed. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..

ABSTRACT: Crested penguins (genus Eudyptes) have a peculiar hatching pattern, with the first-laid egg (A-egg) hatching after the second-laid egg (B-egg) and chicks from A-eggs typically having a much lower survival probability. Maternal yolk androgens have been suggested to contribute to the competitive superiority of the B-chick in southern rockhopper penguins Eudyptes chrysocome, given their important role in mediating sibling competition in other species. We therefore increased the yolk androgen levels in freshly-laid eggs and examined the consequences for sibling competition - via effects on embryonic developmental times, chick growth and early survival. We placed one androgen-treated egg and one control egg into each foster nest, matching them for mass, laying date and laying order. The androgen treatment did not significantly affect embryonic developmental times or chick measurements at hatching. However, elevated yolk androgen levels benefitted chick growth in interaction with the number of siblings in a brood. Chicks from androgen-treated eggs had faster growth in the presence of a sibling than chicks from control eggs. Under these circumstances they also had a higher survival probability. Thus maternal androgens appear to reinforce the observed hatching pattern, facilitating brood reduction. This contrasts to most previous studies in other species where yolk androgens have been shown to compensate for the negative consequences of delayed hatching within the brood hierarchy. © 2012 Poisbleau et al.

ABSTRACT: Maintaining appropriate developmental temperatures during avian incubation is costly to the parents, so embryos may experience pronounced variations in temperature that can lead to embryo mortality and extended incubation periods, or that could affect the offspring phenotype in several bird species. The egg temperatures (N = 28 eggs) of free-living Magellanic Penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) were recorded in a breeding colony in Puerto Deseado, Santa Cruz, Argentina. Three nests had atypical incubation patterns. Two nests experienced high temperature drops (average = 11.7 °C, minimum = 6.5°C, duration = 9 h) and another nest had a broad daily temperature range (max-min), i.e. 13.9 ±0.9 °C for the first egg and 14.1 ±0.8 °C for the second egg (range = 8-22°C during egg laying and 1837°C during advanced incubation). Thermal anomalies during incubation did not affect the embryonic viability, hatchling mass or fledging success. The survival of embryos despite these atypical incubation patterns may be an adaptive mechanism during the harsh weather conditions normally experienced by eggs throughout incubation.

ABSTRACT: The passage from shore to marine life of juvenile penguins represents a major energetic challenge to fuel intense and prolonged demands for thermoregulation and locomotion. Some functional changes developed at this crucial step were investigated by comparing pre-fledging king penguins with sea-acclimatized (SA) juveniles (Aptenodytes patagonicus). Transcriptomic analysis of pectoralis muscle biopsies revealed that most genes encoding proteins involved in lipid transport or catabolism were up-regulated, while genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism were mostly downregulated in SA birds. Determination of muscle enzymatic activities showed no changes in enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway, but increased 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, an enzyme of the b-oxidation pathway. The respiratory rates of isolated muscle mitochondria were much higher with a substrate arising from lipid metabolism (palmitoyl-L-carnitine) in SA juveniles than in terrestrial controls, while no difference emerged with a substrate arising from carbohydrate metabolism (pyruvate). In vivo, perfusion of a lipid emulsion induced a fourfold larger thermogenic effect in SA than in control juveniles. The present integrative study shows that fuel selection towards lipid oxidation characterizes penguin acclimatization to marine life. Such acclimatization may involve thyroid hormones through their nuclear beta receptor and nuclear coactivators. © 2012 The Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Sea ice conditions in the Antarctic affect the life cycle of the emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri). We present a population projection for the emperor penguin population of Terre Adélie, Antarctica, by linking demographic models (stage-structured, seasonal, nonlinear, two-sex matrix population models) to sea ice forecasts from an ensemble of IPCC climate models. Based on maximum likelihood capture-mark-recapture analysis, we find that seasonal sea ice concentration anomalies (SIC a) affect adult survival and breeding success. Demographic models show that both deterministic and stochastic population growth rates are maximized at intermediate values of annual SIC a, because neither the complete absence of sea ice, nor heavy and persistent sea ice, would provide satisfactory conditions for the emperor penguin. We show that under some conditions the stochastic growth rate is positively affected by the variance in SIC a. We identify an ensemble of five general circulation climate models whose output closely matches the historical record of sea ice concentration in Terre Adélie. The output of this ensemble is used to produce stochastic forecasts of SIC a, which in turn drive the population model. Uncertainty is included by incorporating multiple climate models and by a parametric bootstrap procedure that includes parameter uncertainty due to both model selection and estimation error. The median of these simulations predicts a decline of the Terre Adélie emperor penguin population of 81% by the year 2100. We find a 43% chance of an even greater decline, of 90% or more. The uncertainty in population projections reflects large differences among climate models in their forecasts of future sea ice conditions. One such model predicts population increases over much of the century, but overall, the ensemble of models predicts that population declines are far more likely than population increases. We conclude that climate change is a significant risk for the emperor penguin. Our analytical approach, in which demographic models are linked to IPCC. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The occurrence of infections and the disease induced by Contracaecum plagiaticium and Contracaecum pelagicum in Magellanic penguins, Spheniscus magellanicus Foster. 1781 (Sphenisciformes: Spheniscidae) were reported on the coast of Rio de Janeiro. Parasites of the genus Contracaecum were present in all of the 11 studied animals. Co-infections by Csontracaecum pelagicum and C. plagiaticium were observed in three hosts (27.27%). Gross lesions included hyperemia of the esophagus and/or stomach in six animals (54.54%). One of these animals (9.09%), parasitized by C. plagiaticium, presented a hemorrhagic area in the gastric mucosa. Histopathological findings demonstrated esophagitis with helminthes segments inserted in the epithelium, showing discrete mixed inflammatory infiltrate of heterophils and mononuclear cells. These parasites may be associated with other diseases, implicating in death of the penguins.

ABSTRACT: Numerous studies link climate change with advancing breeding phenology in birds, but less frequently considered are the joint impacts on sympatrically breeding communities of birds. We used data on clutch initiation dates (CID) from 4 sites along the Western Antarctic Peninsula for 3 congeneric and sympatrically breeding penguin species (Adélie Pygoscelis adeliae, gentoo P. papua and chinstrap P. antarcticus) to understand what factors correlate with the phenology and synchrony of breeding and how these factors might change with the recent warming experienced in this region. We found that clutch initiation was most significantly correlated with October air temperatures such that all 3 species advanced clutch initiation to varying degrees in warmer years. Gentoo penguins were able to advance CID almost twice as much (3.2 d °C-1) as Adélie (1.7 d °C-1) and chinstrap penguins (1.8 d °C-1). Beyond the variation explained by mean October temperatures, there was an unexplained trend to earlier clutch initiation of 0.15 ± 0.05 d yr-1. Greater plasticity in gentoo breeding phenology compressed the mean interval between Adélie and gentoo breeding in warm years and this may increase competition for nesting space in mixed colonies. Our results suggest that differential responses in breeding phenology to changing temperatures represent an additional mechanism by which climate change may affect competitive interactions and, consequently, pygoscelid penguins on the Antarctic Peninsula. © Inter-Research 2012.

ABSTRACT: As important marine mesopredators and sensitive indicators of Antarctic ecosystem change, penguins have been a major focus of long-term biological research in the Antarctic. However, the vast majority of such studies have been constrained by logistics and relate mostly to the temporal dynamics of individual breeding populations from which regional trends have been inferred, often without regard for the complex spatial heterogeneity of population processes and the underlying environmental conditions. Integrating diverse census data from 70 breeding sites across 31 years in a robust, hierarchical analysis, we find that trends from intensely studied populations may poorly reflect regional dynamics and confuse interpretation of environmental drivers. Results from integrated analyses confirm that Pygoscelis adeliae (Adé lie Penguins) are decreasing at almost all locations on the Antarctic Peninsula. Results also resolve previously contradictory studies and unambiguously establish that P. antarctica (Chinstrap Penguins), thought to benefit from decreasing sea ice, are instead declining regionally. In contrast, another open-water species, P. papua (Gentoo Penguin), is increasing in abundance and expanding southward. These disparate population trends accord with recent mechanistic hypotheses of biological change in the Southern Ocean and highlight limitations of the influential but oversimplified "sea ice" hypothesis. Aggregating population data at the regional scale also allows us to quantify rates of regional population change in a way not previously possible. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.

ABSTRACT: Penguins have peculiar modifications in their skeletal anatomy as a consequence of their extremely specialized diving habit. Morphological specialization is particularly evident in the forelimb. However, the kinematics of the pectoral girdle appears to be key to the locomotion of penguins. Penguin scapulae have an unusual morphology among birds. Modern penguins have a very large (especially broad) scapula, whereas this bone is long but narrower in basal fossil species. The recent finding of an incomplete scapula with a singular acromion in the Upper Eocene Submeseta Allomember of the La Meseta Formation in the Antarctic Peninsula reveals a scapula proportionally narrower than those of modern penguins but similar to that of Waimanu and possibly other Eocene species. Osteological comparisons and muscular dissections of modern penguins show that the most striking feature is the curvature of the acromion, and the consequent enlargement of the fades articularis clavicularis. The configuration of the acromion and the corpus scapula reflects a lack of functional optimization in terms of the resistance to forces transverse to the body axis. The scapula's general morphology suggests it belonged to a medium to large-sized penguin species with no so specialized diving skills.

ABSTRACT: Oil pollution is a significant conservation concern. We examined data from six institutions along the coast of South America: Emergency Relief Team of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, Fundación Mundo Marino, Centro de Recuperação de Animais Marinhos, Natura Patagonia, Associação R3 Animal, and Mar del Plata Aquarium and data from resightings in Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Falkland/Malvinas Islands. From 2000 to 2010, 2183 oiled Magellanic penguins were rehabilitated as part of the routine activities of these institutions or during emergency responses to eight oil spills in which they were involved; all rehabilitated penguins were flipper banded and released. Since their release, 41 penguins were resighted until 31 December 2011. The results demonstrate that, when combined with other prevention strategies, the rehabilitation of Magellanic penguins is a strategy that contributes to the mitigation of adverse effects of oil spills and chronic pollution to the species. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Population trends of African penguins Spheniscus demersus in the Western Cape, South Africa, and their breeding success have been linked to the abundance of their main prey, sardine Sardinops sagax and anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, both fish species increased markedly in abundance, but after 2004, sardine biomass decreased to below average levels. In addition, adults of both stocks were principally located to the east of Cape Agulhas from 2001 to 2009 and were thus distant from seabird colonies on South Africa's West Coast. The number of African penguin pairs counted at Robben Island from 2001 to 2009 and the fledging period of chicks from successful nests increased and decreased in apparent response to the biomass of sardine prior to each breeding season, possibly linked through adult condition at the onset of breeding. Breeding success and chick-fledging rates increased during the study period and showed positive relationships with local food availability, indexed through the annual industrial catch of anchovy made within 56 km (30 nautical miles) of the colony. In addition, chick-fledging rates were depressed in 2-chick broods during years when anchovy contributed <75% by mass to the diet of breeding birds. Previously reported relationships between the overall abundance of forage fish in South Africa and penguin breeding success were not supported. Taken together, these results highlight the combined importance of ensuring adequate local food availability for seabirds during the reproductive cycle and safeguarding regional prey abundance during the non-breeding season. © Inter-Research 2013.

ABSTRACT: Seabirds depend on a variety of terrestrial habitats during the part of their life cycle that they spend on land. Understanding the temporal patterns of use of these habitats provides insights into their ecological requirements, and ultimately helps to direct efforts that ensure the birds' protection. We investigated Magellanic penguin Spheniscus magellanicus beach attendance at Punta Tombo, Argentina, during three breeding seasons to understand the use of beach habitat by juveniles and adults in the breeding season, during the day and in response to physical stressors. We found that beaches at the breeding colony are actively used during the breeding season. The number of penguins on the beach increased as the breeding season progressed for both juveniles and adults, but their patterns of beach use differed. Juveniles arrived later in the season and their numbers on the beach reflected their moulting cycle. In all three years, juveniles left the beach in late January, consistent with their pre-moult foraging trip. Adult penguins, on the other hand, attended the beach in larger numbers during hot days, suggesting that breeders used the beach to avoid high inland temperatures. More penguins, both juveniles and adults, were on the beach during the afternoons, which probably reflects their foraging pattern. However, juvenile counts were less variable between mornings and afternoons than adult counts, indicating a more even use of the beach by juveniles. Beaches provide an alternative habitat for several key functions throughout the life cycle of Magellanic penguins but the birds' temporal patterns of attendance probably depend on their age and breeding status and on the ambient temperature. Our study highlights the importance of the beaches surrounding Magellanic penguin colonies and provides guidance for the spatial layout of reserves where penguin colonies occur.

ABSTRACT: Population changes of top predators can provide key indications of environmental quality. In the Antarctic ecosystem, population dynamics of top predators like penguins may yield important information about how the environment is changing. From 1991-1992 to 2008-2009 censuses of the chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica), breeding population of Vapour Col in Deception Island (South Shetlands Islands) were carried out. Censuses were conducted on 19 sub-colonies, mainly in December around the time of peak hatching. Nest counts were taken from photographs that were recorded from a standard location. Some censuses were also made in mid-January in 1999, 2006, 2007 and 2008. Our results reveal that the population has declined by 36 % when comparing data from 1991 with those from 2008. The strongest decline occurred since 2000. No temporal trends were detected in reproductive success. Declines of Chinstrap penguin populations constitute a general pattern in the South Shetlands, and it has been suggested to be related to climate change through effects of reduction in sea-ice extent during winter and a consequent decline in the abundance of krill. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: In diving birds and mammals, bradycardia and peripheral vasoconstriction potentially isolate muscle from the circulation. During complete ischemia, ATP production is dependent on the size of the myoglobin oxygen (O2) store and the concentrations of phosphocreatine (PCr) and glycogen (Gly). Therefore, we measured PCr and Gly concentrations in the primary underwater locomotory muscle of emperor penguin and modeled the depletion of muscle O2 and those energy stores under conditions of complete ischemia and a previously determined muscle metabolic rate.We also analyzed stroke rate to assessmuscleworkload variation during dives and evaluate potential limitations on the model. Measured PCr and Gly concentrations, 20.8 and 54.6 mmol kg-1, respectively, were similar to published values for nondiving animals. The model demonstrated that PCr and Gly provide a large anaerobic energy store, even for dives longer than 20 min. Stroke rate varied throughout the dive profile, indicating muscle workload was not constant during dives as was assumed in the model. The stroke rate during the first 30 s of dives increased with increased dive depth. In extremely long dives, lower overall stroke rates were observed. Although O2 consumption and energy store depletion may vary during dives, the model demonstrated that PCr and Gly, even at concentrations typical of terrestrial birds and mammals, are a significant anaerobic energy store and can play an important role in the emperor penguin's ability to perform long dives. © 2012 by The University of Chicago.

ABSTRACT: A 22-year-old female African black-footed penguin (Spheniscus demersus), housed indoors with other African and rockhopper penguins, was presented acutely with lethargy, ataxia, and hind limb weakness after a molt. The penguin would assume a hunched position and, when resting, sat on its hocks or lay on its keel. Physical and neurologic examination revealed hind limb paraparesis, proprioceptive deficits, and tiptoe walking. Results of a complete blood cell count and biochemical analysis revealed mild heterophilic leukocytosis, anemia, mild hypoalbuminemia, hypokalemia, and hyperuricemia. Results of whole-body radiographs and coelioscopy were unremarkable. Two computed tomographies of the spine at a 3-month interval revealed a lesion at the mobile thoracic vertebra proximal to the synsacrum with associated spinal cord compression. The penguin was treated with itraconazole, doxycycline, and meloxicam, and it initially improved with return to near normal gait and behavior. However, 5 months after the onset of clinical signs, the penguin was euthanatized after a relapse with worsening of the neurologic signs. Postmortem and histopathologic examination revealed focal granulomatous discospondylitis at the penultimate mobile thoracic vertebra, with intralesional bacteria from which Staphylococcus aureus was cultured. © 2012 by the Association of Avian Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Bumblefoot (pododermatitis), often described as the most significant environmental disease of captive penguins, is commonly due to excessive pressure or trauma on the plantar surface of the avian foot, resulting in inflammation or necrosis and causing severe swelling, abrasions, or cracks in the skin. Although not formally evaluated in penguins, contributing factors for bumblefoot are thought to be similar to those initiating the condition in raptors and poultry. These factors include substrate, body weight, and lack of exercise. The primary purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate variables potentially contributing to the development and duration of plantar lesions in aquarium-maintained African penguins (Spheniscus demersus), including sex, weight, age, season, exhibit activity, and territory substrate. Results indicate that males develop significantly more plantar lesions than females. Penguins weighing between 3.51 and 4.0kg develop plantar lesions significantly more often than penguins weighing between 2.5 and 3.5kg, and because male African penguins ordinarily weigh significantly more than females, weight is likely a contributing factor in the development of lesions in males compared with females. Significantly more plantar lesions were observed in penguins standing for greater than 50% of their time on exhibit than swimming. Penguins occupying smooth concrete territories developed more plantar lesions compared with penguins occupying grate territories. Recommendations for minimizing bumblefoot in African penguins include training penguins for monthly foot examinations for early detection of plantar lesions predisposing for the disease, encouraging swimming activity, and replacing smooth surfaces on exhibit with surfaces providing variable degrees of pressure and texture on the feet. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Understanding the foraging behaviour of seabirds and its plasticity is vital to establish their role in marine food webs and their use as indicators of change in the availability of prey. The foraging behaviour of penguins is known to differ with locality, sex, stage of breeding and between years. We studied the diving behaviour of breeding Magellanic Penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus), using time-depth recorders, during incubation and brooding in the 200304 and 200405 breeding seasons at Isla Martillo, Tierra del Fuego, Argentina. Foraging trips during the incubation period were longer than those during the brooding period for both sexes in both years of the study. Sex-related differences in foraging behaviour were observed during the incubation stage. During the incubation stage females performed longer foraging trips than males, foraging effort was lower, and did not dive as deep as males in both years. Foraging success was lower for females than males during incubation only in 2003. Our results suggest that sexual differences, expressed as differences in the foraging parameters of males and females, only develop when Fuegian Sprat (Sprattus fuegensis), the main prey in this locality, is not abundant close to the colony. Females may be extending the volume of water they can exploit by extending the duration of trips (horizontal distance), whereas males do so by diving deeper (vertical distance). Our results show the fundamental differences in foraging strategies between the sexes in Magellanic Penguin are a consequence of environmental conditions not morphological differences between sexes. © 2012 BirdLife Australia.

ABSTRACT: Ocean temperature has been shown to be related to various demographic parameters in several seabird species, but ultimately its influence on breeding success and survival are paramount. The timing and success of breeding of little penguins Eudyptula minor in south-eastern Australia have been shown to correlate with local sea-surface temperatures (SST) and the east-west sea-temperature gradient across Bass Strait several months earlier. However, the causal links between ocean temperature and these demographic variables are not readily apparent due to their lagged nature. Using 41 yr of data on little penguins in south-eastern Australia, we carried out a mark-recapture analysis to examine if the changing SST and sea-temperature gradient (east-west difference between 2 locations in Bass Strait) are associated with survival probability in the first year of life. First-year survival is correlated with (1) an east-west sea-temperature gradient in Bass Strait in the winter after fledging, with an increased temperature gradient associated with decreased survival and (2) the mean SST in the autumn after fledging, with warmer seas associated with increased survival. SST alone does not provide the best model for explaining first-year survival. Projections suggest that SST in south-eastern Australia and sea-temperature gradient in Bass Strait will both increase due to global warming. The net effect of an increased sea-temperature gradient in winter (which has a negative influence) and increased SST in autumn (which has a positive influence) on first-year survival is uncertain, given the current lack of knowledge concerning the relationship between the sea-temperature gradient and SST in Bass Strait. © Inter-Research 2012.

ABSTRACT: Evolutionary developmental biology (or evodevo) is the scientific connectivity that allowed a more comprehensive and practical completeness in the contemporary conceptualisation of evolution. The links between genetics, developmental mechanics and evolution led to a better understanding of evolutionary mechanisms. An analysis of evolutionary concepts such as homology, homeoses, constraints, novelties, modularity, and selection is given through the recurring example of the variations identified in the modular repartition of the cervical vertebrae in extant and fossil penguins. The inclusion of this study about penguins in the evolutionary system also involves a reflection on the current state and the future of evo-devo. Three principles of assessment and method, applicable to many natural and conceptual scales, are introduced to define a "survival strategy" for evo-devo. The above-mentioned principles are intended to strengthen and continue the connectivity induced de facto. These current and future investigation challenges are discussed and connected to three main naturalist names related directly to the conceptualisation of evolution: Charles Darwin, Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, and Lamarck. © Springer-Verlag 2012.

ABSTRACT: Avian yolk fatty acids (FA) composition is influenced by two main factors: maternal diet and genetic factors that regulate FA metabolism. However, due to embryonic developmental requirements, yolk FA are thought to be physiologically constrained and less useful for dietary and trophic studies. We assessed the relative contributions of diet and physiological constraints in determining the yolk FA composition of a marine bird, the gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) by comparing FA signatures of yolks and prey between a captive, controlled- feeding experiment and a wild population. Captive and wild yolk FA signatures differed even though both groups' yolk lipids were composed primarily of three FA (16:0, 18:0 and 18:1n-9). Differences were due to FA occurring in relatively low abundance, but which mirrored differences in the FA composition of diets. However, yolk FA signatures were correlated across three penguin species suggesting that common developmental constraints can be relatively more important than species-specific differences in diet or egg-laying physiology. While yolk FA are constrained, several minor components of yolk FA are reflective of diets and the calibration coefficients resulting from this study have the potential to be incorporated into predictive models and allow for quantitative dietary and trophic studies using FA analysis of penguin egg yolks. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: We report the characterization of 30 new single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for an endangered species, the African Penguin (Spheniscus demersus), based on screening of a random genomic library. The polymorphisms of these SNP loci were assessed using a captive population comprising 34 individuals. The minor allele frequency ranged from 2. 17 to 42. 65 and the observed and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0. 1 to 0. 6897 and from 0. 0435 to 0. 4965, respectively. None of the loci deviated significantly from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. These SNP markers will provide a necessary addition to the genetic tools employed for understanding population structure and for developing a conservation management strategy for this endangered species. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

ABSTRACT: Increasing experience in long-lived species is fundamental to improving breeding success and ultimately individual fitness. Diving efficiency of marine animals is primarily determined by their physiological and mechanical characteristics. This efficiency may be apparent via examination of biomechanical performance (e.g. stroke frequency and amplitude, change in buoyancy or body angle, etc.), which itself may be modulated according to resource availability, particularly as a function of depth. We investigated how foraging and diving abilities vary with age in a long-lived seabird. During two breeding seasons, small accelerometers were deployed on young (5 year old) and older (8/9 year old) brooding king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) at the Crozet Archipelago, Indian Ocean. We used partial dynamic body acceleration (PDBA) to quantify body movement during dive and estimate diving cost. During the initial part of the descent, older birds exerted more effort for a given speed but younger penguins worked harder in relation to performance at greater depths. Younger birds also worked harder per unit speed for virtually the whole of the ascent. We interpret these differences using a model that takes into account the upthrust and drag to which the birds are subjected during the dive. From this, we suggest that older birds inhale more at the surface but that an increase in the drag coefficient is the factor leading to the increased effort to swim at a given speed by the younger birds at greater depths. We propose that this higher drag may be the result of young birds adopting less hydrodynamic postures or less direct trajectories when swimming or even having a plumage in poorer condition. © 2012.

ABSTRACT: We present a systematic and quantitative model of huddling penguins. In this mathematical model, each individual penguin in the huddle seeks only to reduce its own heat loss. Consequently, penguins on the boundary of the huddle that are most exposed to the wind move downwind to more sheltered locations along the boundary. In contrast, penguins in the interior of the huddle neither have the space to move nor experience a significant heat loss, and they therefore remain stationary. Through these individual movements, the entire huddle experiences a robust cumulative effect that we identify, describe, and quantify. This mathematical model requires a calculation of the wind flowing around the huddle and of the resulting temperature distribution. Both of these must be recomputed each time an individual penguin moves since the huddle shape changes. Using our simulation results, we find that the key parameters affecting the huddle dynamics are the number of penguins in the huddle, the wind strength, and the amount of uncertainty in the movement of the penguins. Moreover, we find that the lone assumption of individual penguins minimizing their own heat loss results in all penguins having approximately equal access to the warmth of the huddle. © 2012 Waters et al.

ABSTRACT: The spawning cycle of the winged pearl oyster, Pteria penguin, was studied at Orpheus Island, north-eastern Queensland to observe seasonal changes in gonad development, mean oocyte diameter and sex ratio over time. A total of 201 oysters were collected over 10 sampling periods, approximately every 5-6 weeks (mean=20 oysters/sample). Histological analysis of gonads showed that spawning activity occurred mainly through the austral mid-spring to late summer (November to March), when mean monthly water temperature ranged between 27.5°C and 29.4°C. There was a primary spawning peak at the beginning of the spawning season in December, followed by a secondary peak in March. Mean oocyte diameter (μm) was highest during the warmer months, ranging from 31.2±2.4 in November to 36.2±3.2 in March, and sex ratio analysis showed the percentage of females in the population also peaked between 30% and 50% during this period. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.

ABSTRACT: Many animals show sex differences in foraging behaviour, which can be related to sex-specific size dimorphism, avoidance of intersexual competition for depletable resources or different energetic requirements of males and females. In southern rockhopper penguins, Eudyptes chrysocome, both sexes differ in their roles during breeding, which leads to differences in their energetic requirements. We therefore examined sex differences in the foraging behaviour of southern rockhopper penguins during the incubation period, using GPS and time-depth data, stable isotope analysis and an automated weighbridge system. While males carried out mostly long trips lasting several days, females often used coastal foraging areas on day trips. Stable isotope data suggested differences in prey composition between the sexes, with consistently higher trophic levels in males as expected for their larger size and ability to catch larger prey items. We applied ecological niche models to compare the environmental conditions in the utilized incubation season habitat between the sexes, using MaxEnt modelling. MaxEnt models suggested that the niche spaces of males and females are largely overlapping, but males have slightly larger niche width. The most important environmental parameter was sea surface temperature. The different energetic requirements related to the birds' incubation and chick-provisioning pattern seem to be the driving force behind the observed spatial segregation. Males make use of highly productive areas to prepare for subsequent fasting periods whereas females forage in coastal waters for themselves as well as for the chicks during the subsequent guard stage. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: The fossil record of the Antarctic penguins is dated to the late Paleocene of Seymour (Marambio) Island, but the largest sphenisciforms, genera Anthropornis and Palaeeudyptes, originate from the Eocene La Meseta Formation. Here, the most complete large-scale reconstruction of a limb skeleton (a whole wing and a partial hind leg) of a Paleogene Antarctic penguin is reported. All bones are attributable to a single individual identified as Anthropornis sp. The comparative and functional analyses of the material indicate that this bird was most probably well-adapted to land and sea while having a number of intriguing features. The modern-grade carpometacarpal morphology is unique among known Eocene Antarctic species and all but one more northerly taxa.

ABSTRACT: Logger technology has revolutionised our knowledge of the behaviour and physiology of free-living animals but handling and logger attachments may have negative effects on the behaviour of the animals and their welfare. We studied southern rockhopper penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome) females during the guard stage in three consecutive breeding seasons (2008/09-2010/11) to evaluate the effects of handling and logger attachment on foraging trip duration, dive behaviour and physiological parameters. Smaller dive loggers (TDRs) were used in 2010/11 for comparison to larger GPS data loggers used in all three seasons and we included two categories of control birds: handled controls and PIT control birds that were previously marked with passive integrative transponders (PITs), but which had not been handled during this study. Increased foraging trip duration was only observed in GPS birds during 2010/11, the breeding season in which we also found GPS birds foraging further away from the colony and travelling longer distances. Compared to previous breeding seasons, 2010/11 may have been a period with less favourable environmental conditions, which would enhance the impact of logger attachments. A comparison between GPS and TDR birds showed a significant difference in dive depth frequencies with birds carrying larger GPS data loggers diving shallower. Mean and maximum dive depths were similar between GPS and TDR birds. We measured little impact of logger attachments on physiological parameters (corticosterone, protein, triglyceride levels and leucocyte counts). Overall, handling and short-term logger attachments (1-3 days) showed limited impact on the behaviour and physiology of the birds but care must be taken with the size of data loggers on diving seabirds. Increased drag may alter their diving behaviour substantially, thus constraining them in their ability to catch prey. Results obtained in this study indicate that data recorded may also not represent their normal dive behaviour. © 2012 Ludynia et al.

ABSTRACT: This report offers a macroscopic and histological description of ulcerative gastric lesions in Humboldt penguins associated with the presence of Contracaecum pelagicum. Parasites of this genus have been isolated from different species of marine mammals and birds, including penguins, demonstrating its capacity to generate ulcerative lesions in the gastrointestinal tracts of many hosts. A bibliographic review revealed no publications on gastric ulceration by nematodes in Humboldt penguins. Studies carried out in Chile concerning gastrointestinal parasitism by nematodes of the Contracaecum genus in S. humboldti only established the parasite's taxonomy. This is the first pathological description of a parasitic ulcerative manifestation in the stomach of S. humboldti in the world. The Humboldt penguin is a vulnerable species. Therefore, this study is relevant as it offers a better understanding of the diseases that affect S. humboldti and facilitates the development of strategies intended to recover the population.

ABSTRACT: The Royal Penguin Eudyptes schlegeli breeds only on Australia's Macquarie Island and its nearby islets, about 1 200 km southwest of New Zealand. Vagrant Royal Penguins have been reported elsewhere in Australia, New Zealand and Antarctica. Reports of Royal Penguins from other subantarctic islands, including Heard, Prince Edward and Marion Islands, South Georgia and the Falkland Islands are controversial, as these penguins could also be aberrant Macaroni Penguins E. chrysolophus, and species determination can be difficult because of high variation in facial colour in both species. We discuss here the recent sighting of an apparent immature Royal Penguin on New Island, Falkland Islands. A simultaneously visiting adult male Macaroni Penguin allowed a size comparison between the two individuals. This could be the first documented sighting of a vagrant Royal Penguin in the Neotropical region.

ABSTRACT: Aquatic migratory birds are a major vectors by which influenza viruses and paramyxoviruses are spread in nature. Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) are usually present on the southern shores of South America and can swim as far as the southern coast of Brazil in winter. In 2008, however, several Magellanic penguins were observed on the northeastern coast of Brazil. Paramyxoviruses were isolated from Magellanic penguins on the Espírito Santo state coast, approximately 4000. km from their breeding colonies, although influenza viruses were not detected. Among the paramyxoviruses, five Avulavirus isolates belonging to serotype APMV-2 and the serotype APMV-10, which was proposed by Miller et al. (2010), were identified. These results highlight the risks associated with the spread of paramyxoviruses between natural to non-natural habitats by birds exhibiting unusual migration patterns, and they document for the first time the presence of the APMV-2 and APMV-10 serotypes on penguins in Brazil. The local avifauna may become infected with these viruses through close contact between migratory and resident birds.

ABSTRACT: Body mass and body condition are often tightly linked to animal health and fitness in the wild and thus are key measures for ecophysiologists and behavioral ecologists. In some animals, such as large seabird species, obtaining indexes of structural size is relatively easy, whereas measuring body mass under specific field circumstances may be more of a challenge. Here, we suggest an alternative, easily measurable, and reliable surrogate of body mass in field studies, that is, body girth. Using 234 free-living king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) at various stages of molt and breeding, we measured body girth under the flippers, body mass, and bill and flipper length. We found that body girth was strongly and positively related to body mass in both molting (R2=0.91) and breeding (R2=0.73) birds, with the mean error around our predictions being 6.4%. Body girth appeared to be a reliable proxy measure of body mass because the relationship did not vary according to year and experimenter, bird sex, or stage within breeding groups. Body girth was, however, a weak proxy of body mass in birds at the end of molt, probably because most of those birds had reached a critical depletion of energy stores. Body condition indexes established from ordinary least squares regressions of either body girth or body mass on structural size were highly correlated (rs=0.91), suggesting that body girth was as good as s body mass in establishing body condition indexes in king penguins. Body girth may prove a useful proxy to body mass for estimating body condition in field investigations and could likely provide similar information in other penguins and large animals that may be complicated to weigh in the wild. © 2012 by The University of Chicago.

ABSTRACT: Growth of Pteria penguin pearl oysters was monitored for 20 mo, from April 2009 to November 2010, to investigate differences in growth performance at three dissimilar sites: Pioneer Bay, Cape Ferguson, and Horseshoe Bay in the Great Barrier Reef lagoon. Growth parameters generated with the von Bertalanffy growth function ranged from K = 0.090.32 and L∞ = 283.6822.5. Overall growth performance (′) ranged from 4.404.77. Time to reach commercial size (T100) was between 1.38 y and 1.54 y, and T120 was between 1.74 and 1.92 y. A more accurate estimate of the L∞ = 213.4-mm dorsoventral measurement (DVM) was obtained at Pioneer Bay by using a larger data set that incorporated a wider size range of oysters. Overall monthly increase in DVM of oysters held at Horseshoe Bay (5.3 ± 0.2 mm) was more than that at Pioneer Bay (4.7 ± 0.2 mm) and Cape Ferguson (4.9 ± 0.2 mm), and there were significant differences in the monthly DVM increase among the sites during growth measurement periods (P < 0.05). Monthly DVM growth was fastest (7.2 ± 0.2 mm) in small oysters (DVM, 5070 mm) in the spring and summer and was lowest (2.4 ± 0.4 mm) in larger oysters (DVM, 105110 mm) during the spring. Regression analysis showed anteroposterior measurement (APM), shell thickness (ST), and whole weight (WW) were significantly correlated with DVM for all groups (P < 0.001). In the commercial size class of 100120 mm DVM, mean WW of oysters at Cape Ferguson was significantly greater (P < 0.01), and the APM-to-DVM ratio was also significantly greater for oysters at Cape Ferguson and Horseshoe Bay (P < 0.01), whereas there were no significant differences among groups with regard to the ST-to-DVM ratio. At all 3 sites, the highest mortalities (measured as a percentage) were recorded for small oysters (DVM, 2550 mm) during the winter period. Suspended particulate inorganic matter (measured in grams) levels were significantly different among sites (P < 0.001). Comparison among growth rates obtained during this study demonstrate that there is significant variability in growth between sites in the Great Barrier Reef lagoon, and that P. penguin are able to tolerateand even thrive-under a wide range of turbidity levels.

ABSTRACT: In long-lived species such as seabirds, foraging success is considered to be related to breeding success, so quantification of foraging parameters during the breeding season should help understand population trends. Using GPS units, we studied the foraging effort of 55 breeding Magellanic penguins Spheniscus magellanicus from 5 colonies in coastal Patagonia, Argentina (42 to 54°S): Punta Norte, Bahía Bustamante, Puerto Deseado, Puerto San Julián and Isla Martillo, in an attempt to relate this to differences in breeding population trends. Measures of foraging effort-trip duration, total distance covered and maximun distance of the foraging trips from the breeding colony-decreased with increasing rate of population change. This information suggests that there are large differences in foraging effort and success among Patagonian penguin colonies, and penguins from Bahía Bustamante and Puerto Deseado, which are in the centre of the geographic range, require the highest foraging effort but are the least successful. It is plausible that lower population growth rates in these 2 colonies stem from the differences in food availability rather than any other process on land. © Inter-Research 2012.

ABSTRACT: Ornamental colouration is often due to carotenoid pigments and varies inter- and intra-specifically. This paper reports on variation in beak colour of the gentoo penguin, Pygoscelis papua, corresponding to different geographical locations along a latitudinal gradient in the Antarctic Peninsula (from King George Island (62 o15′S-58 o37′W) to Rongé Island (64 o40′S-62 o40′W). The gentoo penguin has a conspicuous red spot on both sides of the beak that indicates the presence of the carotenoid pigment, astaxanthin. Beak colouration was measured with a portable spectrophotometer for 20 individuals in three locations, along the Western coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. In the study area, marked variation can be found in terms of factors such us parasite load, human impact, variations in UV radiation and the abundance of krill; all possibly affecting carotenoid availability for signalling purposes. Colour traits were expected to be more intense, that is more vivid, saturated and pure, in places where there is diminished pressure from factors such as contamination, parasites or diseases, all of which may reduce the availability of carotenoids for other functions, such as antioxidant or immune stimulation involving physiological trade-offs. Likewise, colour traits might be predicted to be more intense where carotenoid sources, krill in the case of gentoo penguins, are more available. However, contrary to this initial expectation, our results indicate that northerly penguins' populations, which are in the most polluted and parasitized areas, have more saturated beaks. An alternative hypothesis suggests that environmental constraints relating to the variation in abundance of krill may explain the geographical variation in colour expression found among gentoo penguins. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: Knowledge of habitat use by top marine predators in response to environmental conditions is crucial in the current context of global changes occurring in the Southern Ocean. We examined the at-sea locations of male Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) breeding at Dumont d'Urville during their first, long incubation trip. Compared with the chick-rearing period, penguins performed longer trips, going to oceanic waters as far as 320 km from the colony. We observed 3 strategies: (1) five individuals covered large distances to the north, targeting open-ocean areas and following the currents of two persistent eddies; (2) five individuals foraged to the north-west, close to the Antarctic shelf slope at the limit of the pack ice; and (3) three individuals covered much shorter distances (northwards or eastwards). The foraging range also seemed to be limited by the body condition of the penguins before their departure to sea. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: Varying the timing of reproduction in response to local environmental conditions is a key factor influencing reproductive success. We used 19 yr (1991 to 2009) of data on breeding chronology and reproductive success of Adélie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae and gentoo penguins P. papua at King George Island, Antarctica to compare clutch initiation dates (CIDs), hatch rates, and crèche rates at population and individual levels. The CIDs of both species occurred earlier with warmer October temperatures, but gentoo penguins adjusted CIDs twice as much per °C of temperature as Adélie penguins. Gentoo penguins also exhibited lower variances in hatch and crèche rates than Adélie penguins, suggesting that greater ability to respond to ambient conditions can buffer reproductive success. Mixed-effects models revealed that individual- and yearspecific random effects on the overall population mean best accounted for observed variation in CIDs, with some individuals routinely breeding earlier than others. However, individual differences in the relative timing of breeding provided no advantage for long-term reproductive success. The results suggest that, among gentoo and Adélie penguins, plasticity in CIDs with respect to environmental conditions is primarily a population-level rather than an individual-level response. Energetic constraints of contrasting migratory and fasting behaviors likely contribute to the different abilities to respond to warming spring temperatures. Overall, larger responses of gentoo penguin CIDs to October temperature and lower variability in reproductive success, despite reduced reproductive success with delayed breeding, suggests that gentoo penguins are better equipped than Adélie penguins to adjust to rapid warming in the Antarctic Peninsula ecosystem. © Inter-Research 2012.

ABSTRACT: Loss of nesting habitat threatens many cavity nesting birds worldwide and has contributed to the decline of several species of burrow-nesting seabirds. Replacing lost habitat with artificial nesting structures is considered to be a useful conservation intervention. Here we report on an investigation into the effectiveness of such a strategy providing artificial nests for the endangered African Penguin (Spheniscus demersus) at a colony on Robben Island, South Africa. The re-colonisation of Robben Island by breeding African Penguins in the 1980s was partly attributed to the availability of shaded nesting habitat under introduced vegetation. However, the suitability of this habitat had not been tested empirically. In addition, artificial nests have been present at Robben Island since 2001, but whether they were a viable means of providing improved nesting habitat was not known. The reproductive output of African Penguins was monitored on Robben Island from 2001 to 2010. Breeding success varied between years but, overall, was within the range of figures previously reported for the species. Relative to pairs in nests under vegetation, birds occupying artificial nests and nests in abandoned buildings had increased nesting survival during chick-rearing, with 9 and 13% more chicks fledged per egg hatched over the study period. These artificial structures seem to offer the advantages of shelter from the weather and protection from predators, without the risks of collapse associated with natural burrows in non-guano substrates. This study supports findings from Namibia, and also supports the continued use of artificial nests as a conservation tool throughout the range of the species. © 2012 BirdLife Australia.

ABSTRACT: Parental provisioning strategies are central to life history theory, as one of the main components that adults can adjust to maximize their fitness. In altricial species, newly born young rely entirely on parents for food. Provisioning strategies are thus crucial for offspring survival and growth, but they may also have major consequences for parental lifetime reproductive success, especially in long-lived species. We investigated provisioning strategies in an offshore seabird, the king penguin, Aptenodytes patagonicus, through the number of times parents return to the colony to feed their chick, using a pluriannual database on more than 800 microtagged penguins. King penguin chick rearing can be divided into three periods: (1) from thermal emancipation to the onset of winter, (2) winter and (3) from the end of winter to fledging. Overall, we found that the number of feeding visits was larger for males, as well as for older and larger individuals. The timing of the winter low-provisioning period (15 May-1 September; shorter than previously described) did not vary according to sex, age or breeding timing. We found four different parental strategies during the winter period, from complete absence to regular foraging trips, which led to different breeding success rates. These four strategies were observed in the 6 study years, and in both sexes, although in different proportions. They were not explained by individuals' age, and individuals were not consistent across years, the decision to follow a strategy probably reflecting the trade-off between the bird's current condition and its environment. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: Worldwide marine protected areas (MPAs) have been designated to protect marine resources, including top predators such as seabirds. There is no conclusive information on whether protected areas can improve population trends of seabirds when these are further exploited as tourist attractions, an activity that has increased in past decades. Humboldt Penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) and Magellanic Penguins (S. magellanicus) breed sympatrically on Puñihuil Islets, two small coastal islands off the west coast of Chiloé Island (41° S) in southern Chile that are subject to exploitation for tourism. Our goal was to compare the population size of the mixed colony of Humboldt and Magellanic Penguins before and after protection from unregulated tourism and freely roaming goats in 1997. For this purpose, two censuses were conducted in 2004 and 2008, and the numbers compared with those obtained in 1997 by other authors. The proportion of occupied, unoccupied, and collapsed/flooded burrows changed between years; there were 68% and 34% fewer collapsed burrows in 2004 and 2008, respectively, than in 1997. For the total number of burrows of both species, we counted 48% and 63% more burrows in 2004 and 2008, respectively, than in 1997. We counted 13% more burrows of Humboldt Penguins in 2008 than in 1997, and for Magellanic Penguins, we estimated a 64% increase in burrows in 2008. Presumably, this was as a result of habitat improvement attributable to the exclusion of tourists and the removal of goats from the islets. Although tourist visits to the islets are prohibited, tourism activities around the colonies are prevalent and need to be taken into account to promote appropriate management. © 2013 by the author(s).

ABSTRACT: Rapid climate change recorded in the western Antarctic Peninsula confronts species with less predictable conditions in the marine and terrestrial environments. We analysed the breeding chronology and nesting site selection of gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) at King George Island (Isla 25 de Mayo), Antarctica, during four seasons in which differences in snow presence and persistence on the ground were observed. We recorded an overall delay as well as seasonal asynchrony at the beginning of reproduction for those years with higher snow deposition. A redistribution of breeding groups was also observed. Nevertheless, the population breeding success and chicks' weight at fledging remained relatively constant, despite the delay in breeding chronology, the increased duration of foraging trips during the guard stage and the decreased weight of stomach contents during the cre'che stage. We suggest that the plasticity of their trophic biology, along with the flexibility of their breeding phenology and relocation of breeding groups, may be complementary reasons why gentoo penguin populations in the region have remained stable in spite of the changing conditions currently registered. © 2013.M.A. Juáres et al.

ABSTRACT: We analysed summer diet and fledging mass of macaroni penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus breeding at Bird Island, South Georgia, during the crèche period (January and February) between 1989 and 2010. Crustaceans were the main prey accounting, for over 90% of the diet by mass. Antarctic krill Euphausia superba was the main prey, in 17 out of 22 years. Amphipods Themisto gaudichaudii were the main prey in 1994 and 2009, fish in 2004, and the euphausiids Thysanoessa spp. and Euphausia frigida in 2000. There was no clearly dominant prey group in 1999. Prey diversity and the frequency occurrence of T. gaudichaudii both increased with a decreasing proportion of E. superba in the diet. There was strong evidence that macaroni penguins have a sigmoidal functional response, indicating that this kind of response should be accounted for when devising ecosystem-based management reference points for seabirds. The energy and mass of all euphausiids combined (rather than E. superba in particular) in the diet were the most reliable predictors of chick fledging mass; the correlation between model-predicted and observed values was 0.84. The gross energy content of individual meals was often above average in years when the diets contained fewer euphausiids, but fledging mass was always below average in these years. Although macaroni penguins are able to feed on a variety of prey types, chick growth was always severely impacted by a shortage of euphausiids due to higher energy or time costs associated with feeding on alternative prey types. Given their reliance on euphausiids, macaroni penguins would be particularly vulnerable to potential climate-driven declines in krill stocks. © Inter-Research 2012.

ABSTRACT: The penguin wing oyster Pteria penguin whole body extract was obtained with different solvents. The whole body extracts were assayed for antibacterial activity using agar well diffusion technique against human pathogens. The extracts derived from acetone and chloroform exhibited broad antibacterial activity. Highest activity was exhibited against Klebsiella pneumoniae (6 mm) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (5.5 mm) by the crude extract of acetone and against Salmonella paratyphi B (5.5 mm) by the chloroform extract. The column-purified acetone fractions showed higher activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae (6 mm), Streptococcus pneumoniae (4.5 mm). The MIC of the 100% acetone fraction was found to be equally lower for the pathogens Klebsiella pneumoniae (250μg) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (250μg). Therefore 100% acetonated fraction of the extract of P. penguin can be concluded as potent antimicrobial compound against these human pathogens.

ABSTRACT: Life history theory predicts that parents will not raise unrelated offspring. For seabirds, an ability to recognize their own eggs and chicks can prevent a costly mistake. We tested whether Magellanic Penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) would discriminate against artificial eggs by presenting nine types of egg-objects and one type of artificial chick to penguins at their nests. Magellanic Penguins regardless of their sex or breeding status accepted all egg-objects. A generalized linear mixed model showed that mass and number of dimensions were the most important factors in predicting whether the object was accepted: flat egg-objects and light egg-objects were less likely to be incubated than round, normally weighted ones. We also tested whether Magellanic Penguins would retrieve egg-objects more frequently if the object was within 1 m of the nest cup. Penguins retrieved 75 % of objects that were 1 m from the nest cup, but only 25 % of objects that were 2 m from the nest cup. Lastly, we tested whether penguins would accept artificial chicks. We found that pairs with chicks less than 3 weeks of age (i. e., not out of the guard stage) were at least twice as likely to brood an artificial chick than pairs with chicks older than 3 weeks, pairs that had lost their chicks, or unmated males. © 2012 Dt.

ABSTRACT: Understanding direct influences of local prey availability on penguin breeding behavior is limited in part because it is extremely challenging to organize a study that collects detailed data for both simultaneously. Models can help us understand the pattern of interaction between penguins and their prey, bridging holes in the data and helping steer future empirical studies. The main goal of our work is to provide an estimate of the functional response for penguins with respect to local changes in Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) around breeding colonies in the Southern Ocean. We use data from field studies on penguins and krill to characterize a state-dependent life-history model where a breeding pair of penguins forage to provision a chick to fledging. Each parent makes decisions that maximize a measure of reproductive success based on quantified estimates for state dynamics, using a probabilistic distribution of how their partner is behaving (determined by successive runs of the model). We predict that the relationships describing total amount of krill eaten and chick survival versus krill available around a breeding colony approximate a Holling Type III functional response. We also found that quantifying the quality of the prey environment, rather than total quantity was a useful and relatively simple way to test changes in krill availability. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Investigating the responses of marine predators to oceanographic structures is of key importance for understanding their foraging behaviour and reproductive success. Using Global Positioning System (GPS) and Time-Depth-Temperature-Recorder (TDR) tags, we investigated how king penguins breeding at South Georgia explore their foraging area over the summer season in both the horizontal and vertical dimensions. We determined how horizontal habitat use may relate to different Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) frontal zones and associated thermal structuring of the water column. To study the penguins' use of the water column, we examined foraging niches defined by temperature, temperature gradient and depth, and explored the importance of these thermal properties for prey pursuit. King penguins foraged within the Polar Front (PF) and its southern edges during incubation, and the Antarctic Zone (AAZ) and Southern ACC Front (SACCF) during brooding. Foraging niches became more distinct with the advancing summer season, defined by strong thermal gradients at shallow depths in the AAZ, and weak gradients at greater depths in the SACCF. These niches indicate foraging in the sub-thermocline Winter Water (WW) in the AAZ, and in deep WW and Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) at the SACCF. The influence of different ACC frontal zones in the area to the north of South Georgia appears to provide for a horizontally and vertically segregated environment. The presence of optional foraging areas and niches close to the colony clearly play an important role in these king penguins' foraging success. © 2012 Inter-Research.

ABSTRACT: Industrial fishing can profoundly alter marine environments, and no-take zones are an important tool to achieve sustainable fishing and re-establish ecosystem integrity. However, the potential benefits for vagile species such as top predators are still questioned. The numbers of endangered African penguins Spheniscus demersus have halved since 2004. They depend on small pelagic fish, also targeted by a purse-seine industry in South Africa. We studied penguin foraging behaviour and breeding output at two colonies supporting 60% of the global population in relation to fishing activity by purse-seine vessels. In 2008, both sites were open to fishing, but in 2009 and 2010 waters within 20. km of the world's largest colony were closed to fishing, while waters around the neighbouring colony, 50. km away, remained open. Birds' foraging effort increased with the size of catches around their colonies and decreased with the implementation of a reserve. Total fishing catches in the bay remained constant, but shifted toward the boundaries of the reserve in 2010. While the no-take zone significantly reduced penguin foraging effort, intensified fishing pressure at the reserve boundaries (" fishing the line" ) in 2010 limited this benefit. The decrease over time of both adult body mass and chick growth rates from both colonies, suggested that the 20. km-closure is too small to reverse penguin population decreases. Therefore, stronger fishery management measures, such as larger no-take zones, buffer zones around reserves, or local reduction of fishing quotas, seem necessary to increase food availability for penguins around their colonies. The collapse of Africa's only breeding penguin species adds urgency to the wider implementation of such measures. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Feathers are useful to determine mercury (Hg) contamination. We evaluated the mercury concentration in feathers of Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) age 1.5. years to 25. years at Punta Tombo, Argentina before and during their molt. Mercury ranged between <1.4 and 367. ng/g. dry. weight, with three extreme high values (8996. ng/g, 3011. ng/g and 1340. ng/g) all in young adults. The median concentration was lowest for juveniles and significantly higher for adults but with high variation among older adults. Males and females had similar mercury loads. Compared with other penguin species, concentrations in Magellanic penguins were low. Mercury levels for Magellanic penguins in the Southwest Atlantic for older adults averaged 206 ± 98 ng/g, and serve as a baseline for biomonitoring and/or ecotoxicological studies. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The Earth's climate is undergoing rapid warming, unprecedented in recent times, which is driving shifts in the distribution and phenology of many plants and animals. Quantifying changes in breeding phenology is important for understanding how populations respond to these changes. While data on shifts in phenology are common for Northern Hemisphere species (especially birds), there is a dearth of evidence from the Southern Hemisphere, and even fewer data available from the marine environment. Surface air temperatures at Macquarie Island have increased by 0.62{ring operator}C during the 30-year study period (0.21°C decade-1) and royal penguins (Eudyptes schlegeli) commenced egg laying on average three days earlier in the 1990s than during the 1960s. This contrasts with other studies of Southern Ocean seabirds; five of nine species are now breeding on average 2.1 days later than during the 1950s. Despite the different direction of these trends, they can be explained by a single underlying mechanism: resource availability. There was a negative relationship between the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and median laying date of royal penguins, such that low-productivity (low SAM) years delayed laying date. This accords with the observations of other seabird species from the Antarctic, where later laying dates were associated with lower sea ice and lower spring productivity. The unifying factor underpinning phenological trends in eastern Antarctica is therefore resource availability; as food becomes scarcer, birds breed later. These changes are not uniform across the region, however, with resource increases in the subantarctic and decreases in eastern Antarctica. © 2012 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The moult is arguably the most critical period in the life of emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri). Birds from western Ross Sea colonies travel yearly to and from the pack ice of the eastern Ross Sea to moult. Despite the suspected large numbers of penguins involved, this migration had never been directly observed. Here, we provide the first description of a migratory front of penguins travelling east to west between their moulting habitat and to the breeding colonies. Early autumn ship-bound visual surveys showed density of birds increased significantly as we approached the eastern Ross Sea and was not related to ice type, per cent ice cover or primary productivity. This supports the hypothesis of a dense ‘‘source’’ of post-moult birds in the eastern Ross Sea migrating in nearsynchrony and gradually dispersing towards breeding colonies in the southwest and northwest Ross Sea. Emperor penguins travelled alone or in small groups of up to 8 individuals, concentrating around narrow leads or isolated water holes, and were occasionally seen far from open water, suggesting they move primarily by swimming, complemented by tobogganing. Their new coats indicated they had completed the moult. Aggregations of birds and guano stains suggested they were feeding while migrating. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.

ABSTRACT: Populations of the African penguin Spheniscus demersus have decreased dramatically over the past century, due in part to competition for food with commercial fisheries, and the species is now endangered as a result. Economic arguments are used to favour fisheries over the needs of penguins, but penguins have direct value to the South African economy thanks to penguin-based tourism at several breeding colonies. We estimated the value of African penguins at the most important tourist site for African penguins: Boulders on the Cape Peninsula, South Africa. As a mainland colony close to Cape Town, Boulders is accessible to large numbers of visitors; gate revenues in 2009/2010 alone were R14.5 million (US$2 million). A zonal travel-cost analysis revealed an average consumer surplus among Cape Town residents of some R20 per visit. Penguin-based tourism thus forms an integral part of the R25 billion Western Cape tourism sector. Given that the future survival of this valuable resource is dependent, among others, on the availability of sufficient prey, competition with South Africa's purse-seine fishing fleet should be limited through management strategies that lessen the potential effects of fishing on prey available at the local scale. © 2012 Copyright NISC (Pty) Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Corticosterone has received considerable attention as the principal hormonal mediator of allostasis or physiological stress in wild animals. More recently, it has also been implicated in the regulation of parental care in breeding birds, particularly with respect to individual variation in foraging behavior and provisioning effort. There is also evidence that prolactin can work either inversely or additively with corticosterone to achieve this. Here we test the hypothesis that endogenous corticosterone plays a key physiological role in the control of foraging behavior and parental care, using a combination of exogenous corticosterone treatment, time-depth telemetry, and physiological sampling of female macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus) during the brood-guard period of chick rearing, while simultaneously monitoring patterns of prolactin secretion. Plasma corticosterone levels were significantly higher in females given exogenous implants relative to those receiving sham implants. Increased corticosterone levels were associated with significantly higher levels of foraging and diving activity and greater mass gain in implanted females. Elevated plasma corticosterone was also associated with an apparent fitness benefit in the form of increased chick mass. Plasma prolactin levels did not correlate with corticosterone levels at any time, nor was prolactin correlated with any measure of foraging behavior or parental care. Our results provide support for the corticosterone-adaptation hypothesis, which predicts that higher corticosterone levels support increased foraging activity and parental effort. © 2012 by The University of Chicago.

ABSTRACT: Hormonally mediated maternal effects link maternal phenotype and environmental conditions to offspring phenotype. The production of lipidrich maternal yolk precursors may provide a mechanism by which lipophilic steroid hormones can be transported to developing yolks, thus predicting a positive correlation between yolk precursors in mothers and androgen levels in eggs. Using rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome), which produce a two-egg clutch characterized by extreme egg-size dimorphism, reversed hatching asynchrony and broodreduction, we examined correlations between circulating concentrations of the primary yolk-precursor vitellogenin (VTG) and levels of yolk androgens. Previous work in Eudyptes penguins has shown that egg-size dimorphism is the product of migratory constraints on yolk precursor production. We predicted that if yolk precursors are constrained, androgen transport to developing yolks would be similarly constrained. We reveal positive linear relationships between maternal VTG and androgens in small A-eggs but not larger B-eggs, which is consistent with a migratory constraint operating on the A-egg. Results suggest that intra-clutch variation in total yolk androgen levels depends on the production and uptake of yolk precursors. The brood reduction strategy common to Eudyptes might thus be best described as the result of a migratory constraint. © 2012 The Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Sexual differences in at-sea behaviour of seabirds often derive from size dimorphism and may lead to both resource partitioning and diverging threats between the sexes. Spheniscids are among the least dimorphic of the seabird families and are the most threatened. In many instances, diet differs between the sexes in penguins, but few studies have compared their foraging behaviour, partly because of the difficulty of identifying sexes in the field. We derived a discriminant function analysis that predicts the sex of African penguins Spheniscus demersus with >90% confidence, using only beak length and depth. We also deployed GPS-time-depth recorders on male and female penguins breeding on 2 of their largest colonies in South Africa over 2 consecutive breeding seasons and compared their at-sea behaviour. Foraging effort (time spent at sea, distance covered) showed greater variance with clutch mass and between years and colonies than between sexes. However, although maximum diving capabilities were similar, males dived deeper and longer on average than females. Females compensated by increasing their diving frequency, which resulted in similar volumes of water being explored, and foraged over larger foraging areas. There was also some spatial separation between sexes, although foraging range overlap differed markedly (35 to 83%) between years and islands, presumably reflecting prey availability and the need to minimise between-sex competition. The results suggest potential niche partitioning between the sexes in African penguins, but could also be a passive consequence of sexual dimorphism driven primarily by sexual selection. Female behaviour may make them more at risk from predation or oiling events, highlighting the possibility of sex-dependent vulnerability in this Endangered species. © Inter-Research 2013.

ABSTRACT: We report on the discovery, care, release, and post-release monitoring of the 2nd vagrant emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) recorded from New Zealand. An immature male emperor penguin came ashore at Peka Peka Beach (40° 50' S) 56 km north-east of Wellington on 20 Jun 2011. Its condition deteriorated over the following 4 days, and it was taken into care at Wellington Zoo on 24 Jun. Following 72 days of rehabilitation, the bird was released at sea at 51° 42' S, 78 km north of subantarctic Campbell I, on 4 Sep 2011. He was tracked, via satellite transmiter, moving south-east for 113 km until 9 Sep, after which no further signals were received. The arrival, care and release of this penguin atracted unprecedented levels of public and media interest for a vagrant bird to New Zealand. © The Ornithological Society of New Zealand, Inc.

ABSTRACT: A previously unpublished four-page pamphlet by Dr. George Murray Levick R.N. (1876-1956) on the 'Sexual habits of the Adélie penguin' was recently rediscovered at the Natural History Museum (NHM) at Tring. It was printed in 1915 but declined for publication with the official expedition reports. The account, based upon Levick's detailed field observations at Cape Adare (71°18′S, 170°09′E) during the course of the British Antarctic (Terra Nova) Expedition 1910, commented on frequency of sexual activity, autoerotic behaviour, and seemingly aberrant behaviour of young unpaired males and females including necrophilia, sexual coercion, sexual and physical abuse of chicks, non-procreative sex and homosexual behaviour. His observations were however accurate, valid and, with the benefit of hindsight, deserving of publication. Here we publish the pamphlet in its entirety, reinterpret selected observations and comment on its significance as a forgotten work by the pioneer of research on Adélie penguin Pygoscelis adeliae (Hombron and Jacquinot 1841) biology.

ABSTRACT: Archaeological deposits in continental Patagonia that allow an adequate discussion of the exploitation of seabirds, particularly the Spheniscidae, are scarce. In many cases, characteristics of bone assemblages seem to indicate the natural incorporation of penguin bones into archaeological contexts. This suggests it is not always possible to support the argument that the presence of penguin remains indicates, a priori, consumption by humans. The Bajada de los Pescadores (BP2) site, San Matías Gulf (Río Negro, Patagonia, Argentina), provides a case study that allows the origin of these deposits and their contents to be evaluated in terms of the exploitation of penguins and other marine resources by hunter-gatherers during the Late Holocene. This paper discusses the origin of the archaeological deposit, its context, and the agents involved in its formation. The analysis used criteria formulated previously in the framework of actualistic taphonomic observations, with the aim of assessing the integrity of this sample, and evaluating its contribution towards clarifying the role of penguins in the subsistence of people on the northern Patagonian coast. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

ABSTRACT: Sub-populations within species can exhibit differing population growth trajectories in relation to one another depending on various environmental factors. In threatened species, negative population growth in some sub-populations can ultimately cause the demise of the species; therefore, understanding causal factors of population change is critical to inform management aimed at reversing population declines. Feral house cats Felis catus are potential predators of Endangered yellow-eyed penguins Megadyptes antipodes and were considered the principal causal factor in the species' decline on Stewart Island/Rakiura, New Zealand. The number of yellow-eyed penguins breeding on Stewart Island is low relative to the number on close outlying islands, where cats are absent, and a census had recorded few juveniles on Stewart Island, suggesting poor reproductive success. Yellow-eyed penguin breeding attempts on the northern coast of Stewart Island and outlying islands were monitored for 5 yr, but predation by cats was not evident. Instead, disease, probably aggravated by starvation and poor dietary provisioning, was found to be a significant cause of chick mortality on Stewart Island. Reproductive success was consistently low there (0-33%), in contrast to outlying islands (27-76%). Little recruitment was recorded on Stewart Island, and the number of breeding pairs on the northern coast of Stewart Island declined by 27% between 1999 and 2008. Factors unique to the north coast of Stewart Island are believed to be adversely affecting nesting yellow-eyed penguins, as a similar decline was not recorded elsewhere on the island or on outlying islands. © Inter-Research 2012.

ABSTRACT: Managing fisheries in an ecologically sensitive manner demands that catches do not depress stocks within the foraging areas used by predators to levels that reduce their reproductive success or survival. Spatially-explicit bioenergetics models that estimate the amount of prey consumed by predators are required to inform such policy. These models require information on the number of predators in a population, their nutritional demands, their diet composition and their seasonal distribution in the marine environment. This paper reviews all published information on the diet and at-sea distribution of the six penguin species that breed in the CAMLR Convention Area, the methods used to collect these data and the uncertainties inherent in them. The review will be of utility to modellers as a source of parameters, and to penguin biologists by providing comparative information for their own findings and by highlighting significant gaps in existing knowledge and methods that could be used to fill these.

ABSTRACT: During the austral winter of 2008, thousands of penguins traveled to low latitudes along the South Atlantic coast of South America. The atmospheric and oceanic conditions from April to July 2008 may account for the penguins' unusual geographic distribution. During that period, South Atlantic coastal waters were cooler; the wind anomalies had northward and onshore components; the ocean's coastal region presented northward currents that favored the penguins to travel toward lower latitudes. This anomalous climate regime resulted from extreme meteorological frontal systems that occurred mainly during June 2008. Three consecutive extreme midlatitude cyclones produced strong wind shear that resulted in the northward oceanic flow along the South American eastern shoreline favoring the penguins to be spotted in northern tropical waters.

ABSTRACT: Parasites reduce host fitness and consequently impose strong selection pressures on their hosts. It has been hypothesized that parasites are scarcer and their overall effect on hosts is weaker at higher latitudes. Although Antarctic birds have relatively low numbers of parasites, their effect on host fitness has rarely been investigated. The effect of helminth parasitism on growth rate was experimentally studied in chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica) nestlings. In a total of 22 two-nestling broods, 1 nestling was treated with anthelminthics (for cestodes and nematodes) while its sibling was left as a control. Increased growth rate was predicted in de-wormed nestlings compared to their siblings. As expected, 15 days after treatment, the experimental nestlings had increased body mass more than their siblings. These results show a non-negligible negative effect of helminth parasites on nestling body condition that would presumably affect future survival and thus fitness, and it has been suggested there is a strong relationship between body mass and mortality in chinstrap penguins. © Copyright 2012 Cambridge University Press.

ABSTRACT: During the summer months, Adélie penguins represent the dominant biomass of terrestrial Antarctica. Literally millions of individuals nest in ice-free areas around the coast of the continent. Hence, these modern populations of Adélie penguins have often been championed as an ideal biological indicator of ecological and environmental changes that we currently face. In addition, Adélie penguins show an extraordinary record of sub-fossil remains, dating back to the late Pleistocene. At this time, temperatures were much lower than now. Hence, this species offers unique long-term information, at both the genomic and ecological levels, about how a species has responded to climate change over more than 40 000 years. © 2012 ISZS, Blackwell Publishing and IOZ/CAS.

ABSTRACT: Historically, king penguin populations on Macquarie Island have suffered greatly from human exploitation. Two large colonies on the island were drastically reduced to a single small colony as a result of harvesting for the blubber oil industry. However, recent conservation efforts have resulted in the king penguin population expanding in numbers and range to recolonize previous as well as new sites. Ancient DNA methods were used to estimate past genetic diversity and combined with studies of modern populations, we are now able to compare past levels of variation with extant populations on northern Macquarie Island. The ancient and modern populations are closely related and show a similar level of genetic diversity. These results suggest that the king penguin population has recovered past genetic diversity in just 80 years owing to conservation efforts, despite having seen the brink of extinction.

ABSTRACT: Bio-logging is a useful technique for obtaining information on foraging behaviour, physiology, and environ-mental conditions from animals in marine ecosystems. By integrating this information, researchers can investigate the ecology of general prey-predator system in terms of their optimal behaviour with the help of theoretical models. In the present study, I analyse the diving behaviour of two chinstrap penguins using an index of diving behaviour optimality as a case study. Because of small sample size in the study, I demonstrate possibility to prove the association between calcu-lated optimality index and breeding success in birds and how it basically would be possible if more individuals would be included in analyses. This index is the proportion of observed dive time to "standard" dive time. Standard dive time is de-fined as an "optimal" dive time that maximises the proportion of bottom time to the duration of a dive cycle for a given travel time. Using this index, I found a difference in the optimality of diving behaviour and prey conditions experienced between birds, which may cause differences in chick growth rate. Because many dives have already been recorded using bio-logging techniques, using this index to analyse diving behaviour could give new insights into the foraging ecology of top predators in marine ecosystems. © Yoshihisa Mori.

ABSTRACT: In colonial breeders, agonistic interactions between conspecifics are frequent and may have significant physiological implications. Physiological responses (e.g., increased heart rate) to such social stressors may be determined by the potential costs of agonistic interactions, such as personal injury or risk of breeding failure, and by the motivation of the individuals concerned. The latter may vary according to individuals' reproductive status or willingness to engage in agonistic interactions. In this study, we investigated heart rate responses to aggressive interactions in a breeding colony of king penguins Aptenodytes patagonicus. From heart rate (HR) and behavior recorded in 20 adults at various stages of the breeding season, we investigated how king penguins reacted to aggressive neighbors. A total of 589 agonistic interactions, 223 in which birds were actors and 366 in which birds remained bystanders (i.e., witnesses that were not involved in interactions), were characterized. We found that HR increased during agonistic interactions, both in actors and bystanders. The intensity (threat displays or physical attacks), duration, and rate of aggressive events (number of threats/blows per unit time) of an interaction significantly influenced the HR response in actors. For bystanders, however, only the duration of interactions seemed to matter. Our results also suggest a role for individual motivation, as initiators of agonistic interactions displayed higher HR increases than responders, and as increases were not constant throughout the reproductive season. We conclude that individual risk assessment and motivation modulate physiological responses to social stressors in group-living animals. © 2012 The Author.

ABSTRACT: Multicentric T-cell lymphomas were diagnosed in two birds from separate zoological collections: one in a 27-year-old female Humboldt penguin (Spheniscus humboldti) and the second in an adult pink-backed pelican (Pelecanus rufescens). The main clinical sign in the penguin was dysphagia caused by lymphoma formation in the esophagus. Besides the esophageal lymphoma, neoplastic lymphoid cells were observed in the adrenal glands, liver, kidneys, lung, proventriculus, and gizzard. The pelican was found dead without a clinical history. Neoplastic lymphoid cells were observed in the kidneys, liver, pancreas, spleen, ventriculus, and small intestine. Neoplastic cells of the penguin as well as of the pelican were immunoreactive to CD3 antigen, suggesting the lymphomas were of T-cell origin. In both cases, test results were negative for Marek's disease virus, avian leukosis virus, and reticuloendotheliosis virus. In the pelican, a skin melanoma was diagnosed on the left throat pouch in addition to the multicentric T-cell lymphoma. © 2012 Association of Avian Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: The 18 penguin species are exclusively and widely distributed in the Southern hemisphere, from the Equator to the Antarctic continent, and are thus submitted to various ecological constraints in their reproductive strategy. This results in a high variability in all aspects of the breeding biology of the different species. Although penguins appear primarily adapted for a marine existence, they remain dependent on land for breeding, rearing young, and moulting. Here we describe and compare the breeding cycle of all the penguin species, highlighting the characteristics of each species in terms of breeding range, population status, threats induced by environmental changes, duration of the different phases of the breeding cycle, mate fidelity, body mass, body height, egg mass and duration of egg formation. We also focus on the breeding cycle of the genus Aptenodytes, since it largely differs from the breeding cycle of most of the other penguin species. © 2013 Académie des sciences.

ABSTRACT: Penguin colonies represent some of the most concentrated sources of ammonia emissions to the atmosphere in the world. The ammonia emitted into the atmosphere can have a large influence on the nitrogen cycling of ecosystems near the colonies. However, despite the ecological importance of the emissions, no measurements of ammonia emissions from penguin colonies have been made. The objective of this work was to determine the ammonia emission rate of a penguin colony using inverse-dispersion modelling and gradient methods. We measured meteorological variables and mean atmospheric concentrations of ammonia at seven locations near a colony of Adélie penguins in Antarctica to provide input data for inverse-dispersion modelling. Three different atmospheric dispersion models (ADMS, LADD and a Lagrangian stochastic model) were used to provide a robust emission estimate. The Lagrangian stochastic model was applied both in 'forwards' and 'backwards' mode to compare the difference between the two approaches. In addition, the aerodynamic gradient method was applied using vertical profiles of mean ammonia concentrations measured near the centre of the colony. The emission estimates derived from the simulations of the three dispersion models and the aerodynamic gradient method agreed quite well, giving a mean emission of 1.1g ammonia per breeding pair per day (95% confidence interval: 0.4-2.5g ammonia per breeding pair per day). This emission rate represents a volatilisation of 1.9% of the estimated nitrogen excretion of the penguins, which agrees well with that estimated from a temperature-dependent bioenergetics model. We found that, in this study, the Lagrangian stochastic model seemed to give more reliable emission estimates in 'forwards' mode than in 'backwards' mode due to the assumptions made. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Seabird populations of the Southern Ocean have been responding to climate change for the last three decades and demographic models suggest that projected warming will cause dramatic population changes over the next century. Shift in species distribution is likely to be one of the major possible adaptations to changing environmental conditions. Habitat models based on a unique long-term tracking dataset of king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus) breeding on the Crozet Islands (southern Indian Ocean) revealed that despite a significant influence of primary productivity and mesoscale activity, sea surface temperature consistently drove penguins’ foraging distribution. According to climate models of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the projected warming of surface waters would lead to a gradual southward shift of the more profitable foraging zones, ranging from 25 km per decade for the B1 IPCC scenario to 40 km per decade for the A1B and A2 scenarios. As a consequence, distances travelled by incubating and brooding birds to reach optimal foraging zones associated with the polar front would double by 2100. Such a shift is far beyond the usual foraging range of king penguins breeding and would negatively affect the Crozet population on the long term, unless penguins develop alternative foraging strategies. © 2012 The Royal Society

ABSTRACT: Remote regions such as the Antarctic have become increasingly important for investigations into far-reaching anthropogenic impacts on the environment, most recently in regard to the global mercury cycle. Spatial patterns of mercury availability in four regions of the Antarctic Peninsula were investigated using three species of sympatrically breeding Pygoscelis penguins as biomonitors. Eggshells with intact membranes from Adélie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap penguins were collected at 24 breeding colonies in the South Orkney Islands, South Shetland Islands, eastern Antarctic Peninsula, and western Antarctic Peninsula during the 2006/2007 austral summer. In addition, we compared eggshell membrane mercury concentrations with eggshell stable isotope values (δ15N and δ13C) to determine if species-specific trophic or foraging habitat preferences influenced female mercury exposure prior to breeding. With few exceptions, mercury concentrations were found to be fairly homogeneous throughout the Antarctic Peninsula suggesting little spatial variation in the risk of exposure to dietary mercury in this food web. Mercury concentrations in Gentoo and Adélie penguins were similar while Chinstrap penguins tended to have higher eggshell membrane mercury concentrations than their congeners. However, inter and intra-specific differences in eggshell membrane mercury concentration were not related to eggshell δ15N or δ13C values, a likely result of all three species foraging at similar trophic positions. The lack of regional-scale differences in mercury availability in this marine ecosystem may be a reflection of generally uniform atmospheric deposition and upwelling of regionally homogeneous deep water rather than from geographically distinct point sources. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Background: A central question for ecologists is the extent to which anthropogenic disturbances (e.g. tourism) might impact wildlife and affect the systems under study. From a research perspective, identifying the effects of human disturbance caused by research-related activities is crucial in order to understand and account for potential biases and derive appropriate conclusions from the data. Results: Here, we document a case of biological adjustment to chronic human disturbance in a colonial seabird, the king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus), breeding on remote and protected islands of the Southern ocean. Using heart rate (HR) as a measure of the stress response, we show that, in a colony with areas exposed to the continuous presence of humans (including scientists) for over 50 years, penguins have adjusted to human disturbance and habituated to certain, but not all, types of stressors. When compared to birds breeding in relatively undisturbed areas, birds in areas of high chronic human disturbance were found to exhibit attenuated HR responses to acute anthropogenic stressors of low-intensity (i.e. sounds or human approaches) to which they had been subjected intensely over the years. However, such attenuation was not apparent for high-intensity stressors (i.e. captures for scientific research) which only a few individuals experience each year. Conclusions: Habituation to anthropogenic sounds/approaches could be an adaptation to deal with chronic innocuous stressors, and beneficial from a research perspective. Alternately, whether penguins have actually habituated to anthropogenic disturbances over time or whether human presence has driven the directional selection of human-tolerant phenotypes, remains an open question with profound ecological and conservation implications, and emphasizes the need for more knowledge on the effects of human disturbance on long-term studied populations. © 2012 Viblanc et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

ABSTRACT: During the cold austral winter, king penguin chicks are infrequently fed by their parents and thus experience severe nutritional deprivation under harsh environmental conditions. These energetic constraints lead to a range of energy sparing mechanisms balanced by the maintenance of efficient thermogenic processes. The present work investigated whether the high thermogenic capacities exhibited by winter-acclimatized king penguin chicks could be related to an increase in lipid substrate supply and oxidation in skeletal muscle, the main site of thermogenesis in birds. To test this hypothesis, we examined i) the effect of an experimental rise in plasma triglyceride on the whole metabolic rate in winter-acclimatized (WA) and de-acclimatized king penguin chicks kept at thermoneutrality (TN), and ii) investigated the fuel preference of muscle mitochondria. In vivo, a perfusion of a lipid emulsion induced a small 10% increase of metabolic rate in WA chicks but not in TN group. In vitro, the oxidation rate of muscle mitochondria respiring on lipid-derived substrate was +. 40% higher in WA chicks than in TN, while no differences were found between groups when mitochondria oxidized carbohydrate-derived substrate or succinate. Despite an enhanced fuel selection towards lipid oxidation in skeletal muscle, a rise of circulating lipids per se was not sufficient to fully unravel the thermogenic capacity of winter-acclimatized king penguin chicks. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Continuous growth, associated with a steady parental food supply, is a general pattern in offspring development. So that young chicks can acquire their locomotor independence, this period is usually marked by a fast maturation of muscles, during which different myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms are expressed. However, parental food provisioning may fluctuate seasonally, and offspring therefore face a challenge to ensure the necessary maturation of their tissues when energy is limited. To address this trade-off we investigated muscle maturation in both the pectoral and pelvic girdles of king penguin chicks. This species has an exceptionally long rearing period (1 year), which is prolonged when parental food provisioning is drastically reduced during the sub-Antarctic winter. Approximately 1 month post hatching, chicks acquire a functional pedestrian locomotion, which uses pelvic muscles, whereas swimming, which uses the pectoral muscles, only occurs 1 year later. We therefore tested the hypothesis that the MyHC content of the leg muscles reaches a mature state before those of the pectoral muscles. We found that leg muscle MyHC composition changed with the progressive acquisition of pedestrian locomotion, whereas pectoral muscle fibres reached their mature MyHC profile as early as hatching. Contrary to our predictions, the acquisition of the adult profile in pectoral muscles could be related to an early maturation of the contractile muscular proteins, presumably associated with early thermoregulatory capacities of chicks, necessary for survival in their cold environment. This differential maturation appears to reconcile both the locomotor and environmental constraints of king penguin chicks during growth. © 2011. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The Penguin Island volcano is located on the southern shelf of King George Island (South Shetland Islands, West Antarctica). Its activity is regarded as connected with the opening of the Bransfield Strait. Penguin Island is dominated by a 180 m high basaltic stratocone (Deacon Peak) with a 350 mwide crater containing a small basaltic plug inside and radial dykes, and it has asecond principal vent-the Petrel Crater maar - that was formed during a phreatomagmatic eruption about 100 years ago. A low-potassium, calc-alkaline sequence of basaltic lava flows with intercalations of beach deposits (Marr Point Formation) forms the basement of the stratocone. The Marr Point Formation lava flows have never been dated before. Combined whole rock 40Ar- 39Ar isotopic dating and magneto stratigraphy were applied for this purpose. We obtained an isotopic 40Ar- 39Ar plateau age of 2.7 ±0.2 Ma, and together with the palaeomagnetic data, middle Pliocene age (Piacenzian) is implied for the basaltic plateau of Penguin Island.

ABSTRACT: Predation by fur seals and sea lions has been identified, among others, as a potential cause of the declines in rockhopper penguin populations. Here, we report a multiple predation event of southern rockhopper penguins Eudyptes chrysocome by South American sub-adult male sea lions Otaria flavescens at Staten Island, Argentina. The sea lions attacked and preyed on penguins mostly using a wait and rush tactic at sea, but in some cases, penguins were also pursued on land. Although observations suggested that only a few sea lions are involved in predation, further research is necessary to elucidate the importance of this predation in the rate of population decline. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: Antarctica is often considered as one of the last pristine regions, but it could be affected by pollution at global and local scale. Concentrations of Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Cd and Pb were determinated by ICP-MS in feathers (n = 207 individuals) of gentoo, chinstrap and Adélie penguin collected in 8 locations throughout the Antarctic Peninsula (2006-2007). The highest levels of several elements were found in samples from King George Island (8.08, 20.29 and 1.76 μg g -1 dw for Cr, Cu and Pb, respectively) and Deception Island (203.13, 3.26 and 164.26 μg g -1 dw for Al, Mn and Fe, respectively), where probably human activities and large-scale transport of pollutants contribute to increase metal levels. Concentrations of Cr, Mn, Cu, Se or Pb, which are similar to others found in different regions of the world, show that some areas in Antarctica are not utterly pristine. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Penguins (Sphenisciformes) inhabit some of the most extreme environments on Earth. The 601 Myr fossil record of penguins spans an interval that witnessed dramatic shifts in Cenozoic ocean temperatures and currents, indicating a long interplay between penguin evolution and environmental change. Perhaps the most celebrated example is the successful Late Cenozoic invasion of glacial environments by crown clade penguins. A major adaptation that allows penguins to forage in cold water is the humeral arterial plexus, a vascular counter-current heat exchanger (CCHE) that limits heat loss through the flipper. Fossil evidence reveals that the humeral plexus arose at least 49 Ma during a 'Greenhouse Earth' interval. The evolution of the CCHE is therefore unrelated to global cooling or development of polar ice sheets, but probably represents an adaptation to foraging in subsurface waters at temperate latitudes. As global climate cooled, the CCHE was key to invasion of thermally more demanding environments associated with Antarctic ice sheets. © 2010 The Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Killer whales are the oceans' apex predators and their potential effects on ecosystems have been demonstrated. In the Southern Ocean, the role of killer whale predation in population declines of southern elephant seals remains largely speculative. We aimed to assess whether top-down control of pinniped and penguin populations at the Subantarctic Prince Edward Islands (PEIs) is generally plausible using a simple process of elimination. Based on published data, we predicted the energetic ingestion requirements of adult male and female killer whales as 1394 and 1028MJday-1, respectively. Expanding these requirements to the 37 killer whales photographically identified at the PEIs, the population requires 40600MJday-1. Based on the energy density and mass data available, we predicted the energy content of available pinniped and penguin prey and calculated the rates at which killer whales would consume these prey in various scenarios. Penguins and Subantarctic fur seals are relatively insensitive to killer whale predation owing to their large population sizes (10000-100000s). Conversely, the smaller populations (100-1000s) of Antarctic fur seals and southern elephant seals are sensitive to predation, particularly the latter, as they have a high energy content (c. 2000-9000MJ). Populations of these seals are currently increasing or stable and we conclude that presently killer whale predation is not driving population declines, although they clearly have the potential for the regulation of these smaller populations. Thus, if population sizes were reduced by bottom-up processes, if killer whale diet shifted or if prey availability changed, top-down predation by killer whales could become significant. By eliminating the possibility of some predation scenarios, we are better able to concentrate future efforts on plausible predation effects. © 2011 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The driving factors of survival, a key demographic process, have been particularly challenging to study, especially for winter migratory species such as the Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae). While winter environmental conditions clearly influence Antarctic seabird survival, it has been unclear to which environmental features they are most likely to respond. Here, we examine the influence of environmental fluctuations, broad climatic conditions and the success of the breeding season prior to winter on annual survival of an Adélie penguin population using mark-recapture models based on penguin tag and resight data over a 16-year period. This analysis required an extension to the basic Cormack-Jolly-Seber model by incorporating age structure in recapture and survival sub-models. By including model covariates, we show that survival of older penguins is primarily related to the amount and concentration of ice present in their winter foraging grounds. In contrast, fledgling and yearling survival depended on other factors in addition to the physical marine environment and outcomes of the previous breeding season, but we were unable to determine what these were. The relationship between sea-ice and survival differed with penguin age: extensive ice during the return journey to breeding colonies was detrimental to survival for the younger penguins, whereas either too little or too much ice (between 15 and 80% cover) in the winter foraging grounds was detrimental for adults. Our results demonstrate that predictions of Adélie penguin survival can be improved by taking into account penguin age, prior breeding conditions and environmental features. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: Semi-automated software has been written in Matlab to enable nesting Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae), on aerial photographs of the Ross Sea sector of Antarctica, to be counted. Previously, this task had been accomplished by manual marking of printed images; this is slow, and highly-dependent on the skill of the operator. The basis of the semiautomated counting procedure is to use linear discriminant analysis to separate the background (snow, water, rock, bare ground) from the guano-covered colony area, followed by morphological image processing operators to select the breeding penguins. Many interactive features are provided that allow an operator to delete penguins singly or in groups, selectively process a defined area, and record the running census counts. © 2011 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Three 1- to 3-mo-old black-footed penguins (Spheniscus demersus) died within 24 hr of showing central nervous signs such as ataxia. The birds were housed in a baby penguin crche. At necropsy, peritonitis, pneumonia, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and renomegaly were evident. Histologically, the liver, lung, brain, and small intestine contained numerous tachyzoites and a few cysts of Toxoplasma. Immunohistochemistry identified the protozoal parasites as Toxoplasma gondii. Ultrastructurally, this was confirmed by the presence of many tachyzoites of T. gondii in the liver and lungs. © 2011 American Association of Avian Pathologists.

ABSTRACT: Determining temporal and spatial variation in feeding rates is essential for understanding the relationship between habitat features and the foraging behavior of top predators. In this study we examined the utility of head movement as a proxy of prey encounter rates in medium-sized Antarctic penguins, under the presumption that the birds should move their heads actively when they encounter and peck prey. A field study of free-ranging chinstrap and gentoo penguins was conducted at King George Island, Antarctica. Head movement was recorded using small accelerometers attached to the head, with simultaneous monitoring for prey encounter or body angle. The main prey was Antarctic krill (>99% in wet mass) for both species. Penguin head movement coincided with a slow change in body angle during dives. Active head movements were extracted using a high-pass filter (5 Hz acceleration signals) and the remaining acceleration peaks (higher than a threshold acceleration of 1.0g) were counted. The timing of head movements coincided well with images of prey taken from the back-mounted cameras: head movement was recorded within ±2.5s of a prey image on 89.1±16.1% (N=7 trips) of images. The number of head movements varied largely among dive bouts, suggesting large temporal variations in prey encounter rates. Our results show that head movement is an effective proxy of prey encounter, and we suggest that the method will be widely applicable for a variety of predators. © 2011.

ABSTRACT: Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) are non-breeding winter visitors to the Brazilian coast. In 2008 and 2010, plastic items and other marine debris were found in the stomachs and intestines of 15% of 175 dead penguins collected in the Lagos Region of the state of Rio de Janeiro. One bird had its stomach perforated by a plastic straw, which may have caused its death. There are few records of penguins ingesting plastic litter, but previous studies have found similar levels of debris ingestion among Magellanic penguins stranded on the Brazilian coast (35.8% of 397 birds). The high incidence of marine debris in this species in Brazil may result at least in part from the predominance of juveniles reaching these waters, as juvenile penguins may have a broader diet than adults. It is unclear to what extent plastic ingestion affects the mortality rate in this species and whether the incidence in stranded birds reflects that in the entire population. The present study addresses the increasing impact of plastic debris on marine life. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Gentoo Penguins (Pygoscelis papua (J.R. Forster 1781)) are defined morphologically as a single species with a northern ansd southern subspecies. Differences in nuptial displays and particularly mating calls, however, suggest isolation among island archipelagos of different ocean basins. We thus asked whether genetic divergence of populations could be confirmed using molecular markers. A phylogenetic tree was constructed from a sample of 110 Gentoo Penguins and 58 haplotypes from the control region of the mitochondrial DNA. Reanalyses of historical data on morphology were conducted to construct additional phylogenetic trees for comparison. In agreement with differences in mating calls, the phylogenetic tree that was based on mitochondrial DNA showed a deep division between populations in the Indian and Atlantic oceans. The current systematic division into two subspecies based on morphology was not supported. The division between populations in the Indian and Atlantic oceans was great enough to justify taxonomic revision, with at least three distinct clades: two in the respective sub-Antarctic and Antarctic zones of the Atlantic Ocean, and a deeply divergent and unnamed third clade in the sub-Antarctic Indian Ocean. In contrast to more pelagic species like Rockhopper Penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome (J.R. Forster, 1781)), the restricted coastal foraging ranges of Gentoo Penguins and the distances among isolated oceanic archipelagos could explain the distribution of genetically differentiated populations.

ABSTRACT: An oxygen isotope record of Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) eggshells from Terra Nova Bay (Victoria Land, Antarctica) has been reconstructed in order to provide insights into the palaeoenviroment of this region during the last ~8000 years. The δ18O values measured in eggshell carbonate show a great variability over the course of the studied period, with maximum values consistently around +27.5‰. Adopting a metabolic enrichment relative to water source of ~+28.5‰, eggshell δ18O values can be interpreted in terms of marine water uptake by the penguins. The spread in δ18O of eggshell carbonate at any given time toward more negative values reflects the existence of a low δ18O water end member, most plausibly snow or snowmelt. Samples younger than 2000 years are characterized by a general lack of very negative δ18O values. As also attested by other proxies, this shift toward more positive isotopic values is likely to be related both to a decreasing contribution of snow or meltwater in the seawaters and consequently to an absence or paucity on the boundary of the nesting sites of snow or snowfall and freshwater that could be directly eaten or drunk by penguins. © The Author(s) 2011.

ABSTRACT: Species in which the sexes equally exhibit colourful ornaments are an issue for evolutionary theory. Among several hypotheses, sexual selection for mutual mate choice and social selection for signals of behavioural dominance are most commonly supported. We examined the previously documented sex-similar size of yellow-orange ear patches in the king penguin, Aptenodytes patagonicus. This species is monogamous and pairs just before reproduction. Raising a chick requires considerable effort by both parents, as they alternate care of their single offspring with foraging at sea. The size of the ear patches appears to signal aggressive territoriality in the breeding colony for both sexes. However, experiments suggest that females prefer large patch size during mate choice, and males do not prefer this trait. We tested whether the size of the coloured ear patch was influenced by sexual selection for couples that had recently paired. We used analyses of covariance to compare the size of the ear patch to a measure of body size and then tested for the difference between males and females. Males were 6.2% larger in ear patch width and 7.7% larger in ear patch area than females, and the distance between the ear patches over the head was 7.5% smaller in males, with all differences highly significant. Consequently, sexual selection appears to favour larger ear patches in males, possibly because of an excess of males that promotes female choice. Social selection also appears to favour the evolutionary maintenance of ear patches of males, and thus both types of selection may contribute to enlarged ear patches. © 2011 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

ABSTRACT: To jump out of water onto sea ice, emperor penguins must achieve sufficient underwater speed to overcome the influence of gravity when they leave the water. The relevant combination of density and kinematic viscosity of air is much lower than for water. Injection of air into boundary layers ('air lubrication') has been used by engineers to speed movement of vehicles (ships, torpedoes) through sea water. Analysis of published and unpublished underwater film leads us to present a hypothesis that free-ranging emperor penguins employ air lubrication in achieving high, probably maximal, underwater speeds (mean ± SD: 5.3 ± 1.01 m s-1), prior to jumps. Here we show evidence that penguins dive to 15 to 20 m with air in their plumage and that this compressed air is released as the birds subsequently ascend whilst maintaining depressed feathers. Fine bubbles emerge continuously from the entire plumage, forming a smooth layer over the body and generating bubbly wakes behind the penguins. In several hours of film of hundreds of penguins, none were seen to swim rapidly upwards without bubbly wakes. Penguins descend and swim horizontally at about 2 m s-1); from simple physical models and calculations presented, we hypothesize that a significant proportion of the enhanced ascent speed is due to air lubrication reducing frictional and form drag, that buoyancy forces alone cannot explain the observed speeds, and that cavitation plays no part in bubble formation. © Inter-Research 2011.

ABSTRACT: In many species of birds, periods of incubation of eggs within a clutch depend on the order in which the eggs were laid and determine whether the eggs hatch asynchronously or on the same day. Magellanic Penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) lay two eggs 4 days apart that hatch 2 days apart; first eggs take 41 days to hatch, and second eggs take 39 days. We tested whether temperatures of the two eggs differ and whether delayed onset of incubation caused this pattern. First eggs were cooler than second eggs during their first few days (P < 0.001). First eggs averaged 23.4 ± 0.3 °C in the first 24-48 hours after they were laid. Second eggs averaged 27.9 ± 0.3 °C, warm enough for development. Egg temperature did not stabilize (33.9 °C) until eggs were about 18 days old. We swapped first and second eggs of different nests to determine if parental behavior caused the differences in temperatures and incubation periods. First eggs treated as second eggs developed as fast as control second eggs, and second eggs treated as first eggs developed nearly as slowly (40 days) as control first eggs. First eggs that were stored in a cooler until second eggs were laid took 2 days longer to hatch than control first eggs. Parental incubation behavior explained why the incubation period of second eggs was shorter than that of first eggs and controlled asynchrony of hatching, which affects chick growth and survival. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2011.

ABSTRACT: Three skeletons collected from the late Oligocene Kokoamu Greensand of New Zealand are among the most complete Paleogene penguins known. These specimens, described here as Kairuku waitaki, gen. et sp. nov., and Kairuku grebneffi, sp. nov., reveal new details of key elements of the stem penguin skeleton associated with underwater flight, including the sternum, flipper, and pygostyle. Relative proportions of the trunk, flippers, and hind limbs can now be determined from a single individual for the first time, offering insight into the body plan of stem penguins and improved constraints on size estimates for giant taxa. Kairuku is characterized by an elongate, narrow sternum, a short and flared coracoid, an elongate narrow flipper, and a robust hind limb. The pygostyle of Kairuku lacks the derived triangular cross-section seen in extant penguins, suggesting that the rectrices attached in a more typical avian pattern and the tail may have lacked the propping function utilized by living penguins. New materials described here, along with re-study of previously described specimens, resolve several long-standing phylogenetic, biogeographic, and taxonomic issues stemming from the inadequate comparative material of several of the first-named fossil penguin species. An array of partial associated skeletons from the Eocene-Oligocene of New Zealand historically referred to Palaeeudyptes antarcticus or Palaeeudyptes sp. are recognized as at least five distinct species: Palaeeudyptes antarcticus, Palaeeudyptes marplesi, Kairuku waitaki, Kairuku grebneffi, and an unnamed Burnside Formation species. © 2012 by the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology.

ABSTRACT: A drop in body temperature allows significant energy savings in endotherms, but facultative heterothermy is usually restricted to small animals. Here we report that king penguin chicks (Aptenodytes patagonicus), which are able to fast for up to 5 months in winter, undergo marked seasonal heterothermy during this period of general food scarcity and slow-down of growth. They also experience short-term heterothermy below 20 °C in the lower abdomen during the intense (re)feeding period in spring, induced by cold meals and adverse weather. The heterothermic response involves reductions in peripheral temperature, reductions in thermal core volume and temporal abandonment of high core temperature. Among climate variables, air temperature and wind speed show the strongest effect on body temperature, but their effect size depends on physiological state. The observed heterothermy is remarkable for such a large bird (10 kg before fasting), which may account for its unrivalled fasting capacity among birds. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

ABSTRACT: Estimates of daily activity and consequent demand for food during winter are scarce for many polar seabirds, yet essential for assessing constraints on foraging effort, demand for food, and potential competition with local fisheries. We affixed archival temperature tags to gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) from two colonies in the South Shetland Islands to measure the frequency, timing, and duration of foraging trips and to estimate minimum food requirements during winter. Foraging trip frequencies ranged from 0.85 to 1.0 trips day-1 and were positively correlated with day length. Early winter foraging trips more closely matched day length than late winter foraging trips. The data suggest that individuals maximize foraging time during the early winter period, likely to recover body mass following the breeding season and molt. The more attenuated response of foraging trip durations to increasing day length in late winter may be related to differences in local resource availability or individual behaviors prior to the upcoming breeding season. Minimum food requirements also exhibited a seasonal cycle with a mid-winter minimum. On average, minimum food requirements were estimated at 0.70 ± 0.12 kg day-1. Extrapolated to the regional population of gentoo penguins, winter food requirements by gentoo penguins were equivalent to roughly 33% of annual krill catches by commercial fisheries in the South Shet fishery in the southern Scotia Sea warrants continued monitoring of gentoo penguins during winter. © 2011 US Government.

ABSTRACT: Magellanic Penguins Spheniscus magellanicus are sexually dimorphic while breeding, but in winter the difference is not always sufficiently evident for visual determination of gender. We examined published discriminant functions and produced additional discriminant functions using morphometric data from 408 beachcast Magellanic Penguins from the Centro de Recuperação de Animais Marinhos on the most southerly point of the Brazilian coast (31°15'38S to 33°45'03S), for which gender was determined by post mortem examination or polymerase chain reaction. The discriminant functions correctly determined the gender of 70-90% of these penguins. However, an important gender-associated bias was detected, as previously published discriminant functions developed for animals in breeding colonies were systematically misclassifying males as females. A method is proposed to adjust the functions and correct this gender bias. While other methods may be more accurate, gender determination from morphometric data still offers reasonably reliable results and is an accessible, rapid, inexpensive and non-invasive method for determining the gender of Magellanic Penguins.

ABSTRACT: In this study, we evaluated the use of seabird eggs of two common bird species from the Falkland Islands as bioindicators of contamination with organohalogenated contaminants (OHCs). We compared contamination levels and profiles of different OHCs between eggs of the rockhopper penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome) and the imperial shag (Phalacrocorax atriceps). In addition, laying order effects on OHC concentrations and profiles were also investigated in both species. For polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) as well as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), concentrations were significantly lower in eggs of rockhopper penguins (27.6 ± 0.70. ng/g lw, 56.5 ± 1.33. ng/g lw and 0.98 ± 0.04. ng/g lw, respectively) compared to the imperial shags (140 ± 5.54. ng/g lw, 316 ± 11.53. ng/g lw, 1.92 ± 0.15. ng/g lw, respectively). On the other hand, 2′MeO-BDE 68 and 6MeO-BDE 47, two brominated compounds of reported natural origin, were significantly higher in the penguin eggs (0.55 ± 0.05. ng/g lw and 7.01 ± 0.64. ng/g lw, respectively) compared to the shag eggs (0.17 ± 0.03. ng/g lw and 0.50 ± 0.06. ng/g lw, respectively). In addition, PCB, OCP and PBDE contamination profiles differed markedly between the two species. Various factors, such as diet, feeding behaviour, migratory behaviour and species-specific metabolism, may be responsible for the observed results. For both rockhopper penguins and imperial shags, PCB, OCP and PBDE concentrations and profiles did not significantly change in relation to the laying order. This suggests that, for both species, any egg of a clutch is useful as a biomonitoring tool for OHCs. Although our results showed that OHCs have also reached the Falkland Islands, concentrations were relatively low compared to other studies. However, future monitoring may be warranted to assess temporal trends of different OHCs. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Field-based animal researchers need to balance the potential adverse effects of their research activities against the benefits of research outcomes, but the data required to do this are often lacking. Assessing, and subsequently reporting the effects of researcher activities on wild animal populations can be difficult, so that studies to detect these effects sometimes lack rigour or fail to encompass sufficient time to ensure that the effects are tested under a range of environmental stresses. We monitored the effect of investigators working in colonies of two seabirds, the short-tailed shearwater (Puffinus tenuirostris) and the little penguin (Eudyptula minor). Disturbance of breeding birds while checking nests or the weighing of chicks to monitor growth are very common activities for demographic and ecological studies, but how these activities may influence the birds is rarely measured. We investigated differing levels of disturbance during both activities between 2002-03 and 2008-09 to assess their effect on egg laying, chick survival and growth rate and observed no effect for nest checking or handling of short-tailed shearwaters and indeterminate effects for handling in little penguins. Over a period of several years the study has observed a large-scale decline in the number of breeding shearwaters and includes years when control nests had above and below average breeding success. © 2012 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare The Old School.

ABSTRACT: The little blue penguin (Eudyptula minor) is in decline throughout much of its range in New Zealand and Australia, largely due to introduced predators, human disturbance and roadkill mortalities. The whiteflippered penguin is a unique morphological variant of the blue penguin, which is traditionally given subspecific status (Eudyptula minor albosignata), and is found only on Banks Peninsula and Motunau Island in Canterbury, New Zealand. We monitored a varying number of nest boxes from 1996 to 2009. Overall breeding success was 64% over 13 years of monitoring, with a hatching success rate of 75% and a fledging success rate of 85%. We used a set of generalised linear mixed models and model selection to examine the relative influence of various explanatory variables on hatching, fledging and overall breeding success. Breeding success in nest boxes significantly increased with shorter average pair bond length, longer guard period and later relative lay date. Guard period length was the best predictor of breeding success, followed by relative lay date and average pair bond length. Hatching success also increased with later relative lay date but fledging success was not influenced by any of the explanatory variables measured.© New Zealand Ecological Society.

ABSTRACT: We estimated the effect of selected habitat variables on burrow occupancy rate and breeding success of blue penguins in two regions of the West Coast of the South Island of New Zealand, South Westland (three colonies) and Buller (five colonies), in order to measure the impact of habitat changes on the West Coast blue penguin population. In both regions, habitat type did not appear to influence the breeding success of burrows and there was no significant difference in breeding success between colonial and isolated breeders in either region. Proximity to the hightide line and scrubline influenced the occupancy of nests in Buller but not in South Westland. Breeding success was apparently unrelated to the proximity of nests to the sea or to a road/track, suggesting that disturbance did not influence breeding success. These findings provide baseline data against which to measure the consequences of changes in breeding habitat and their impact on West Coast penguin populations, and guide the placement of artificial nest boxes. © 2011 The Royal Society of New Zealand.

ABSTRACT: Stomach content analysis (SCA) and more recently stable isotope analysis (SIA) integrated with isotopic mixing models have become common methods for dietary studies and provide insight into the foraging ecology of seabirds. However, both methods have drawbacks and biases that may result in difficulties in quantifying inter-annual and species-specific differences in diets. We used these two methods to simultaneously quantify the chick-rearing diet of Chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarctica) and Gentoo (P. papua) penguins and highlight methods of integrating SCA data to increase accuracy of diet composition estimates using SIA. SCA biomass estimates were highly variable and underestimated the importance of soft-bodied prey such as fish. Two-source, isotopic mixing model predictions were less variable and identified inter-annual and species-specific differences in the relative amounts of fish and krill in penguin diets not readily apparent using SCA. In contrast, multi-source isotopic mixing models had difficulty estimating the dietary contribution of fish species occupying similar trophic levels without refinement using SCA-derived otolith data. Overall, our ability to track inter-annual and species-specific differences in penguin diets using SIA was enhanced by integrating SCA data to isotopic mixing modes in three ways: 1) selecting appropriate prey sources, 2) weighting combinations of isotopically similar prey in two-source mixing models and 3) refining predicted contributions of isotopically similar prey in multi-source models.

ABSTRACT: In captive penguins, avian malaria due to Plasmodium parasites is a well-recognized disease problem as these protozoa may cause severe losses among valuable collections of zoo birds. In blood films from naturally infected birds, identification and differentiation of malaria parasites based on morphological criteria are difficult because parasitaemia is frequently light and blood stages, which are necessary for identification of parasites, are often absent. Post-mortem diagnosis by histological examination of tissue samples is sometimes inconclusive due to the difficulties in differentiating protozoal tissue stages from fragmented nuclei in necrotic tissue. The diagnosis of avian malaria would be facilitated by a technique with the ability to specifically identify developmental stages of Plasmodium in tissue samples. Thus, a chromogenic in-situ hybridization (ISH) procedure with a digoxigenin-labelled probe, targeting a fragment of the 18S rRNA, was developed for the detection of Plasmodium parasites in paraffin wax-embedded tissues. This method was validated in comparison with traditional techniques (histology, polymerase chain reaction), on various tissues from 48 captive penguins that died at the zoological garden Schönbrunn, Vienna, Austria. Meronts of Plasmodium gave clear signals and were easily identified using ISH. Potential cross-reactivity of the probe was ruled out by the negative outcome of the ISH against a number of protozoa and fungi. Thus, ISH proved to be a powerful, specific and sensitive tool for unambiguous detection of Plasmodium parasites in paraffin wax-embedded tissue samples.© 2011 Houghton Trust Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Avian pox is an enveloped doublestranded DNA virus that is mechanically transmitted via arthropod vectors or mucosal membrane contact with infectious particles or birds. Magellanic Penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) from two colonies (Punta Tombo and Cabo Dos Bahías) in Argentina showed sporadic, nonepidemic signs of avian pox during five and two of 29 breeding seasons (1982-2010), respectively. In Magellanic Penguins, avian pox expresses externally as wart-like lesions around the beak, flippers, cloaca, feet, and eyes. Fleas (Parapsyllus longicornis) are the most likely arthropod vectors at these colonies. Three chicks with cutaneous pox-like lesions were positive for Avipoxvirus and revealed phylogenetic proximity with an Avipoxvirus found in Black-browed Albatross (Thalassarche melanophrys) from the Falkland Islands in 1987. This proximity suggests a long-term circulation of seabird Avipoxviruses in the southwest Atlantic. Avian pox outbreaks in these colonies primarily affected chicks, often resulted in death, and were not associated with handling, rainfall, or temperature. © Wildlife Disease Association 2012.

ABSTRACT: This study describes the processes of embryogenesis, shell formation and larval development of the winged pearl oyster, Pteria penguin. Broodstock were induced to spawn using the standard method of thermal stimulation and fertilized eggs were incubated at a density of 50 ml -1 and a temperature of 27 ± 1°C. After an incubation period of 24 h, shelled larvae were stocked at 3 ml -1 and fed a mixed microalgae diet until reaching settlement age. Embryos and larvae were sampled periodically for examination by scanning electron microscope. The resulting high-resolution images were used to record the timing of developmental stages including the first cleavage (1 h postfertilization, hpf), morula (2.5 hpf), blastula (4.5 hpf), gastrula (5.5 > hpf), trochophore (7 > hpf), D-stage (2022 hpf), prodissoconch II (36 days posthatching, dph), umbone (1012 dph) and pediveliger (22 dph). Comparison with other oviparous oyster species revealed a similar sequence of key events, with differences occurring in the timing of developmental stages, shell structure and shell shape. This study is the first to describe early shell formation for a species belonging to the family Pteriidae. Shell development begins with formation a shell-field invagination (sfi) at the dorsoposterior end of the embryo (7 hpf), indicating the creation of a shell gland. The sfi stretches laterally to create a deep crevice (9 hpf) before eventually everting to form a flat central hinge linking the two expanding shell valves (12 hpf). © 2011 The Author.

ABSTRACT: At some point in a dive, breath-hold divers must decide to return to the surface to breathe. The issue of when to end a dive has been discussed intensively in terms of foraging ecology and behavioral physiology, using dive duration as a temporal parameter. Inevitably, however, a time lag exists between the decision of animals to start returning to the surface and the end of the dive, especially in deep dives. In the present study, we examined the decision time in emperor penguins under two different conditions: during foraging trips at sea and during dives at an artificial isolated dive hole. It was found that there was an upper limit for the decision-to-return time irrespective of dive depth in birds diving at sea. However, in a large proportion of dives at the isolated dive hole, the decision-to-return time exceeded the upper limit at sea. This difference between the decision times in dives at sea versus the isolated dive hole was accounted for by a difference in stroke rate. The stroke rates were much lower in dives at the isolated hole and were inversely correlated with the upper limit of decision times in individual birds. Unlike the decision time to start returning, the cumulative number of strokes at the decision time fell within a similar range in the two experiments. This finding suggests that the number of strokes, but not elapsed time, constrained the decision of emperor penguins to return to the surface. While the decision to return and to end a dive may be determined by a variety of ecological, behavioral and physiological factors, the upper limit to that decision time may be related to cumulative muscle workload. © 2012.

ABSTRACT: Feathers, eggs, and excreta of Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua ellsworthii), adults, from Livingston Island (South Shetlands), chosen as bioindicators, were used to test the quality of the Antarctic environment. Sex was not examined. The bioaccumulations of toxic trace elements (Cd, Pb, Al, and As), essential trace elements (Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn, Cr, V, Ni, and Sr), and major essential elements (Na, K, Mg, Ca, P, and S) were established. For the first time data about the element contents in Gentoo eggs is provided. Two hypotheses were tested: (1) there are differences in the metal levels among eggs and feathers; and (2) the element concentrations are highest in the excreta. The hypotheses were confirmed at 0.01-0.05 confidence levels. The concentrations of almost all trace elements were significantly higher in the feathers compared to those in the eggs. The following values of the concentrations ratio Fe/Zn were obtained: in the embryo, Fe/Zn = 1.5, and in the feathers, Fe/Zn = 0.5. The concentration of Pb in the embryo and excreta was below 0.4 μg/g, and Cd and As in eggs were below 0.05 and 0.3 μg/g, respectively. This indicates that there is no toxic risk for penguin offspring. Arsenic could be considered as a potential pollutant for Antarctic soil due to its relative high concentration in excreta, 5.13 μg/g. The present data (year 2007) were compared to the data for years 2002 and 2003. No trend of toxic element contamination was established. The concentrations of Pb, Cd, and As in representatives from the top of the food chain in the Antarctic (the present study) and Arctic (literature data) were compared. The data supports the hypothesis that there is an abnormality in cadmium levels in polar marine areas. Regarding Pb, the South Shetlands displayed 3-fold lower level compared to the Aleutians. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

ABSTRACT: Rats (Rattus spp.) are among the most successful alien predators brought to islands by humans and have had devastating impacts on numerous seabird populations, but studies demonstrating rates of consumption and ecological impacts on penguins are scarce and mostly based on anecdotal evidence. We investigated the effects of rat predation on Humboldt Penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) by simulating unattended clutches with domestic Chicken eggs. Experiments were independently set at two Humboldt Penguin colonies in north (Pájaros Island, 29°S) and central Chile (Algarrobo Island, 33°S). At both colonies, eggs were primarily predated by rats (Rattus rattus = 70. 8 % at Pájaros and Rattus norvegicus = 52. 6 % at Algarrobo), and secondarily by Kelp Gulls (Larus dominicanus = 9. 7 % at Pájaros and 15. 8 % at Algarrobo). Significantly more eggs were predated at night. At both colonies, rates of rat and gull predation were highest within the first 12 h. Our study constitutes the first quantification of rats as important alien predators at Humboldt Penguin colonies. We suggest that rat presence at Humboldt Penguin colonies coupled with events that can cause temporary nest abandonment, such as human perturbation and El Niño events, may impact on the species' breeding success. Eradication of rats is suggested to improve the nesting habitat of this and other threatened and endemic seabird species in the region. © 2012 Dt. Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.

ABSTRACT: Juvenile winged pearl oysters, Pteria penguin, were cultured for 6 mo in three commonly used culture units (panel nets, plastic mesh trays, and pyramidal pearl nets) at two dissimilar sites-Pioneer Bay (a coral reef environment in which P. penguin are naturally present) and Cape Ferguson (a coastal semiestuarine area with high levels of silt deposition)to determine the effects of site and culture method on growth, survival, and fouling. Mean growth increases were recorded for the dorsoventral measurement (DVM), anteroposterior measurement (APM), shell thickness, and whole weight. At Pioneer Bay, five replicates for each of the three culture unit types were suspended at 3 m and at 6 m, and mean initial DVM was 28.0 ± 0.6 mm (n = 190). At Cape Ferguson, there were five replicates for each culture unit at 3 m only, and mean initial DVM was 28.0 ± 0.6 mm (n = 86). Mean growth increase at the end of the experiment for oysters at Pioneer Bay and Cape Ferguson, respectively, were 26.6 ± 1.0 mm and 32.6 ± 2.4 mm DVM, 29.6 ± 1.2 mm and 34.0 ± 2.9 mm APM, 6.7 ± 0.3 mm and 9.7 ± 0.5 mm shell thickness, and 16.5 ± 0.7 g and 23.0 ± 2.1 g whole weight. For all growth parameters, mean increase was significantly higher under high-turbidity conditions at Cape Ferguson (P < 0.05). Culture unit also affected growth, with oysters held in mesh trays showing significantly more growth at both sites (P < 0.05). Mean survival of oysters at Cape Ferguson (96.5%) was significantly higher than at Pioneer Bay (79.4%). Depth had no significant effect on growth, survival, or fouling. The results indicate that site selection and culture unit are important parameters for optimizing growth and survival during nursery phase culture of P. penguin.

ABSTRACT: Adélie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae exhibit phenological variability across their geographic range due to fixed and variable forcing factors acting differentially on populations. Shifts in breeding phenology can be indicative of environmental change when cues for breeding ini - tiation are tightly linked with environmental conditions. Adélie penguins on opposite sides of Antarctica display contrasting trends in clutch initiation dates, with different explanations of underlying causes. To make comparisons possible with a third significant Adélie penguin population region, we examined temporal trends and driving factors of breeding phenology at Béchervaise Island in East Antarctica. We have extended existing knowledge by examining how phonological dates are related throughout a breeding season, as well as the reproductive consequences of phenological variation. In contrast to other sites, we saw no evidence at this site of shifts towards early or delayed arrival or clutch initiation. Arrival, clutch initiation dates and the length of the incubation period had different environmental forcing factors, which explained up to 36% of the temporal variability. Penguins had a reduced courtship and egg-lay period when their arrival was delayed, and this led to later clutch initiation, later parent departure for foraging trips and later chick hatch. The phenological variations recorded here were not detrimental to chick-rearing. In particular, a delay in the start of breeding activities did not result in poor reproductive success. This indicates the importance of other factors for chick survival. Inter-annual pheno logical variability at this location is compared with that at other locations to further develop the colony latitude-breeding phenology relationship for Adélie penguins. © 2011 Inter-Research.

ABSTRACT: Breeding animals face important time and energy constraints when caring for themselves and their offspring. For long-lived species, life-history theory predicts that parentsshould favor survival over current reproductive attempts, thus investing more into their own maintenance than the provisioning of their young. In seabirds, provisioning strategies may additionally be influenced by the distance between breeding sites and foraging areas, and offshore and inshore species should thus exhibit different strategies. Here, we examine the provisioning strategies of an inshore seabird using a long-term data set on more than 200 Little Penguins, Eudyptula minor. They alternated between two consecutive longand several short foraging trips all along chick rearing, a strategy almost never observed for inshore animals. Short trips allowed for regular provisioning of the chicks (high feeding frequency and larger meals), whereas long trips were performed when parent body mass was low and enabled them to rebuild their reserves, suggesting that adult body condition may be a key factor in initiating long trips. Inshore seabirds do use dual strategies of alternating short and long trips, but from our data, on a simpler and less flexible way than for offshore birds. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.

ABSTRACT: The physiological basis of the aerobic dive limit (ADL), the dive duration associated with the onset of post-dive blood lactate elevation, is hypothesized to be depletion of the muscle oxygen (O2) store. A dual wavelength near-infrared spectrophotometer was developed and used to measure myoglobin (Mb) O2 saturation levels in the locomotory muscle during dives of emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri). Two distinct patterns of muscle O 2 depletion were observed. Type A dives had a monotonic decline, and, in dives near the ADL, the muscle O2 store was almost completely depleted. This pattern of Mb desaturation was consistent with lack of muscle blood flow and supports the hypothesis that the onset of post-dive blood lactate accumulation is secondary to muscle O2 depletion during dives. The mean type A Mb desaturation rate allowed for calculation of a mean muscle O 2 consumption of 12.4 ml O2 kg-1muscle min -1, based on a Mb concentration of 6.4 g 100 g-1 muscle. Type B desaturation patterns demonstrated a more gradual decline, often reaching a mid-dive plateau in Mb desaturation. This mid-dive plateau suggests maintenance of some muscle perfusion during these dives. At the end of type B dives, Mb desaturation rate increased and, in dives beyond the ADL, Mb saturation often reached near 0%. Thus, although different physiological strategies may be used during emperor penguin diving, both Mb desaturation patterns support the hypothesis that the onset of post-dive lactate accumulation is secondary to muscle O2 store depletion. © 2011.

ABSTRACT: An outbreak of Chlamydophila psittaci occurred in an outdoor colony of 63 Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) at the San Francisco Zoo. Affected penguins presented with inappetence, lethargy, and light green urates. Hematologic and serum biochemical findings were consistent with chronic inflammation. Penguins did not respond to initial supportive and antimicrobial therapy, and 3 died. Necropsy results of the 3 birds revealed hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, and histologic lesions included necrotizing hepatitis, splenitis, and vasculitis. Chlamydophila psittaci infection was confirmed by results of Gimenez staining, immunohistochemistry, and tissue polymerase chain reaction assay. As additional birds continued to present with similar clinical signs, the entire colony of penguins was prophylactically treated with a 30-day minimum course of doxycycline, administered orally or intramuscularly or as a combination of both. Despite treatment, 9 additional penguins died during a 3-month period. Pathologic results from these birds revealed renal and visceral gout (n = 4), cardiac insufficiency (n = 2), sepsis from a suspected esophageal perforation (n = 2), and no gross lesions (n = 1). During the outbreak, 4 birds presented with seizures, 5 developed dermatitis, and nearly 90% of birds in the colony showed severe keratoconjunctivitis, believed to be related to drug therapy with doxycycline. We report the clinical and pathologic features of Chlamydophila psittaci infection in an outdoor colony of penguins and the associated challenges of treatment. © 2012 by the Association of Avian Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: This paper presents information on the levels of trace elements in sediments collected at Deception and Penguin Islands and tracks the sources of natural and anthropogenic inputs of metals into this sub-Antarctic region. The results suggest that natural processes, such as volcanic activity, hydrothermal processes and sediment transport, are more important than anthropogenic inputs in accounting for the metal concentrations measured in sediments at Deception Island. The higher levels of trace metals recorded in sediments at Penguin Island seem to reflect the composition of the source rocks of the island, which are dominated by the olivine-basalt group. Our findings show that human activities in the study areas may contribute to negligible levels of trace metals associated with anthropogenic inputs (e.g., Cr and Zn) in sediments, and these results can be used in the future as background levels related to low anthropogenic impacts. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Penguin bones from the Eocene La Meseta Formation (Seymour Island, Antarctic Peninsula) constitute the only extensive fossil record of Antarctic Sphenisciformes. Here, we synonymize some of the recognized genera (Anthropornis with Orthopteryx, Delphinornis with Ichtyopteryx) and species (Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi with Orthopteryx gigas, Delphinornis gracilis with Ichtyopteryx gracilis). Moreover, we suggest that Antarctic species of Anthropornis and Palaeeudyptes, so-called giant penguins, may in fact comprise only one species each instead of two, based on evidence of well-marked sexual dimorphism. We also present new estimates of body mass based on femora testifying to the impressive scope of interspecific body-size variation in Eocene Antarctic penguins.

ABSTRACT: It has long been held that Eudyptes penguins will only ever develop a maximum of two mature yolky follicles to match their invariant two-egg clutch, an idea inferred largely from egg removal studies. Combining our own data with those from a previous but rarely cited study and by applying these to a simple developmental model, we show that macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus) develop up to four large, yolky vitellogenic follicles, and they do so despite the fact that they will never lay more than two eggs or rear more than one chick, a tactic that seems maladaptive given their realized reproductive success. We discuss these results within the context of the usual pattern of reproductive investment in Eudyptes penguins and suggest a broader significance to modes of clutch size determination among all penguins (order Sphenisciformes). © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: A juvenile, male, yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes) with abnormal stance and decreased mobility was captured, held in captivity for approximately 6 weeks, and euthanized due to continued clinical signs. Radiographically, there was bilateral degenerative joint disease with coxofemoral periarticular osteophyte formation. Grossly, the bird had bilaterally distended, thickened coxofemoral joints with increased laxity, and small, roughened and angular femoral heads. Histologically, the left femoral articular cartilage and subchondral bone were absent, and the remaining femoral head consisted of trabecular bone overlain by fibrin and granulation tissue. There was no gross or histological evidence of infection. The historic, gross, radiographic, and histopathologic findings were most consistent with bilateral aseptic femoral head degeneration resulting in degenerative joint disease. Although the chronicity of the lesions masked the initiating cause, the probable underlying causes of aseptic bilateral femoral head degeneration in a young animal are osteonecrosis and osteochondrosis of the femoral head. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of bilateral coxofemoral degenerative joint disease in a penguin. © 2011 Houghton Trust Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Cranial and mandibular penguin remains from the Eocene of Antarctica were studied in order to determine their feeding habits and food item preferences. Their osteology and musculature were compared with those of modern taxa. Different morphotypes were recognized based on their skull, configuration of the articular region of the mandible and bill shape. The results point to a variety of trophic habits and food preferences consistent with the known taxonomic diversity for this unit. For the middle Eocene, large sized penguins were interpreted as fish and crustacean eaters, whereas for the late Eocene, taxonomic diversity and number of individuals in the colonies during the late Eocene seems to increase. This colony could be reconstructed as being composed of medium-sized generalist penguins, piscivorous large- and medium-sized species, and also large penguins with a diet based on crustaceans and squids. © 2012 E.

ABSTRACT: Increasing ecotourism activity in Argentine Patagonia has led to concerns about the effects of ecotourism on wildlife populations. Penguin breeding colonies are popular tourist destinations. While some species of penguins habituate to human visits, others exhibit negative effects due to disturbance. We studied the effects of tourism on Magellanic Penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) at San Lorenzo colony located on the Peninsula Valdes, Chubut, Argentina. We measured behavioural, physiological, and reproductive parameters in birds nesting in tourist-visited and non-visited areas. San Lorenzo has 11 years of visitation history and a low intensity of visitors (~10,000 annually). After 15 min of a simulated tourist visit, penguins in the tourist area showed fewer alternate head turns and lower plasma levels of the stress hormone corticosterone than penguins in a non-visited area. However, penguins showed similar baseline levels of corticosterone between areas as well as similar levels of integrated corticosterone expressed after an acute stressor. Penguin breeding success and chick growth were similar between areas. We compared these findings to results previously published from Punta Tombo, a colony with a longer history (+50 years) and high intensity of annual visitors (>120,000 people). Many (reproductive and behavioural parameters), but not all (physiological parameters), of our findings are similar. That a physiological difference exists may suggest that the previous history of human visitation plays an important role in the response of the birds. Thus, the continuous monitoring of tourist activity is important, as a history of visitation disturbance seems to have an effect on how birds respond to tourists. © 2011 Dt.

ABSTRACT: This paper explores various attempts to manage predation threats to an endangered population of little penguins (Eudyptula minor) living in Sydney's North Harbour. Some of these threats have come from species that are generally termed 'exotic' (such as the red fox, Vulpes vulpes), while other threats have potentially come from 'natives' (such as the New Zealand fur seal, Arctocephalus forsteri). This paper explores the problematic notion of 'invasiveness' as it applies to native and introduced predators, and the role that these rhetorical distinctions play in positioning various species as 'threats' to the continuity of this penguin colony. In particular, the paper is concerned with conservation legislation and practice in New South Wales, and the unique kind of 'ethical work' done by these processes of classifying living things. Finally, the paper asks, in the absence of a simplistic-but helpful-correlation between exotic and invasive species, how might we understand and justify the conservation of an isolated colony of little penguins What kinds of interventions (from humans and nonhumans) are warranted, and which are not What might it mean to genuinely inhabit these difficulties, making conservation decisions outside of any space of simple and absolute answers Copyright: © Sullivan 2011.

ABSTRACT: Whether androgen deposition in eggs is physiologically costly for female birds has remained a crucial but unsolved question, despite a broad use of this assumption in functional studies.We testedwhether females depositing high androgen concentrations experienced higher mass losses than females depositing low androgen concentrations. Analysing female body mass change during egg formation in rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome), we observed no energetic cost to androgen deposition.Nevertheless, lighter females laid eggs with higher yolk androgen concentrations. This relationship existed only for the second-laid egg (B-egg), but not for the first-laid egg (A-egg). Since the B-egg is usually the first to hatch and the only one to produce a fledging chick, we hypothesize that differential yolk androgen deposition may be an adaptive strategy for females to affect brood reduction. © 2011 The Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Initiated in 1997, the year-round study of formic and acetic acids was maintained until 2011 at the coastal Antarctic site of Dumont d'Urville. The records show that formic and acetic acids are rather abundant in summer with typical mixing ratios of 200 pptv and 700 pptv, respectively. With the aim to constrain their budget, investigations of their potential marine precursors like short-chain alkenes and acetaldehyde were initiated in 2011. Acetic acid levels in December 2010 were four times higher than those observed over summers back to 1997. These unusually high levels were accompanied by unusually high levels of ammonia, and by an enrichment of oxalate in aerosols. These observations suggest that the guano decomposition in the large penguin colonies present at the site was particularly strong under weather conditions encountered in spring 2010 (important snow storms followed by sunny days with mild temperatures). Although being dependent on environmental conditions, this process greatly impacts the local atmospheric budget of acetic acid, acetaldehyde, and acetone during the entire summer season. Present at levels as high as 500 pptv, acetaldehyde may represent the major precursor of acetic acid, alkene-ozone reactions remaining insignificant sources. Far less influenced by penguin emissions, the budget of formic acid remains not fully understood even if alkene-ozone reactions contribute significantly. © 2012 by the American Geophysical Union.

ABSTRACT: The emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) is highly dependent on sea ice conditions, and future climate change may affect its distribution and numbers. Most studies on the demography and population dynamics of emperor penguins in relation to sea ice characteristics were conducted at a single colony (Pointe Géologie). Several non-exclusive hypotheses have been proposed to explain the dramatic decline of this colony, including changes in sea ice conditions, predation, flipper banding and human disturbance. Here, we report and analyse updated long-term trends in numbers of breeding pairs made at two colonies (Pointe Géologie and Haswell Island) where counts are comparable. Similar changes were observed for both colonies and paralleled changes in sea ice extent. At Pointe Géologie and Haswell Island, populations declined similarly and later growth rates were also similar since the early 1990s for Haswell and early 1980s for Pointe Géologie. The magnitude of the decline was similar between both colonies when numbers of breeding pairs were assessed. This study suggests that a common large-scale environmental factor has probably negatively affected both colonies. © 2011, Antarctic Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The stomach flushing technique is a vital tool in bird dietary studies. The technique requires a tube to be inserted into the penguin's mouth and passed through the oesophagus to the stomach. General practice does not include cleaning of the tube between penguins. This report investigates if the stomach flushing tube can be a vehicle to transmit potential pathogens from a sick penguin to a healthy penguin, and if implementation of aseptic or disinfection practice is warranted in the stomach flushing technique. A total of 19 tubes from 19 penguins were examined for bacterial presence from May until August 2007. This paper presents new recommendations for stomach flushing procedures from a microbial perspective to ensure that birds subjected to this are not jeopardised by practices that may promote the transfer of potential pathogens from one penguin to another.

ABSTRACT: Insulation and vascular heat-retention mechanisms allow penguins to forage for a prolonged time in water that is much cooler than core body temperature. Wing-based heat retention involves a plexus of humeral arteries and veins, which redirect heat to the body core rather than to the wing periphery. The humeral arterial plexus is described here for Eudyptes and Megadyptes, the only extant penguin genera for which wing vascular anatomy had not previously been reported. The erect-crested (Eudyptes sclateri) and yellow-eyed (Megadyptes antipodes) penguins both have a plexus of three humeral arteries on the ventral surface of the humerus. The wing vascular system shows little variation between erect-crested and yellow-eyed penguins, and is generally conserved across the six extant genera of penguins, with the exception of the humeral arterial plexus. The number of humeral arteries within the plexus demonstrates substantial variation and correlates well with wing surface area. Little penguins (Eudyptula minor) have two humeral arteries and a wing surface area of ∼ 75 cm 2, whereas emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) have up to 15 humeral arteries and a wing surface area of ∼ 203 cm 2. Further, the number of humeral arteries has a stronger correlation with wing surface area than with sea water temperature. We propose that thermoregulation has placed the humeral arterial plexus under a strong selection pressure, driving penguins with larger wing surface areas to compensate for heat loss by developing additional humeral arteries. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The fossil record of Antarctic Sphenisciformes dates as early as the late Palaeo- cene Cross Valley Formation, Seymour Island, Antarctic Peninsula. However, the best known Antarctic locality for early penguin remains (mainly isolated bones) is the Eocene La Meseta Formation that outcrops in the northeast of Seymour Island. The analysis of an unstudied set of specimens collected there by members of the British Antarctic Survey in 1989 has resulted in identification of a distal humerus from the unit Telm3 (early Eocene) of the formation that is the oldest known bone attributable to a medium-sized (in the context of the entire Cainozoic era) penguin. This find suggests that the origin of these birds, in con- junction with an increase in taxonomic diversity of the Eocene Sphenisciformes, was re- lated to the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO) or, more probably, the early phase of subsequent cooling.

ABSTRACT: We studied foraging segregation between two different sized colonies of little penguins Eudyptula minor with overlapping foraging areas in pre-laying and incubation. We used stomach contents and stable isotope measurements of nitrogen (δ15N) and carbon (δ13C) in blood to examine differences in trophic position, prey-size and nutritional values between the two colonies. Diet of little penguins at St Kilda (small colony) relied heavily on anchovy while at Phillip Island (large colony), the diet was more diverse and anchovies were larger than those consumed by St Kilda penguins. Higher δ15N values at St Kilda, differences in δ13C values and the prey composition provided further evidence of diet segregation between colonies. Penguins from each colony took anchovies from different cohorts and probably different stocks, although these sites are only 70km apart. Differences in diet were not reflected in protein levels in the blood of penguins, suggesting that variation in prey between colonies was not related to differences in nutritional value of the diet. Anchovy is currently the only available prey to penguins throughout the year and its absence could have a negative impact on penguin food supply, particularly at St Kilda where the diet is dominated by this species. While it is difficult to establish whether diet segregation is caused by inter- or intra-colony competition or spatial differences in foraging areas, we have shown that colonies with broadly overlapping foraging ranges could have significant differences in trophic position, diet composition and prey size while maintaining a diet of similar nutritional value. © 2011 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: According to life-history theory, individuals optimize their decisions in order to maximize their fitness. This raises a conflict between parents, which need to cooperate to ensure the propagation of their genes but at the same time need to minimize the associated costs. Trading-off between benefits and costs of a reproduction is one of the major forces driving demographic trends and has shaped several different parental care strategies. Using little penguins (Eudyptula minor) as a model, we investigated whether individuals of a pair provide equal parental effort when raising offspring and whether their behavior was consistent over 8 years of contrasting resource availability. Using an automated identification system, we found that 72% of little penguin pairs exhibited unforced (i.e., that did not result from desertion of 1 parent) unequal partnership through the postguard stage. This proportion was lower in favorable years. Although being an equal pair appeared to be a better strategy, it was nonetheless the least often observed. Individuals that contributed less than their partner were not less experienced (measured by age), and gender did not explain differences between partners. Furthermore, birds that contributed little or that contributed a lot tended to be consistent in their level of contribution across years. We suggest that unequal effort during breeding may reflect differences in individual quality, and we encourage future studies on parental care to consider this consistent low and high contributor behavior when investigating differences in pair investment into its offspring. © 2011 The Author.

ABSTRACT: In response to various environmental factors in offshore South China Sea, a group of microstructures of the screw dislocation are assembled in multiphase screw dislocations on the surface of the nacreous layer of Pteria penguin from the coastal waters of Hainan Island, China. The results of the transmission and scanning electronic microscope testing show that organic matter periodically secreted by epithelial histology of mantle of Pteria penguin pre-forms the original screw dislocation growth template in the form of film, along with its function to select, identify, and adhere to the amorphous calcium carbonate particles as the fine organic venations diffused in the epitaxial screw growth area. With the inducement and screw modulation of the organic film and venations, the amorphous calcium carbonate particles gradually evolve into the pseudohexagonal self. aragonite microsheet with long-range order and screw dislocation structure by location-selecting tropism and screw dislocation growth. Numerous micron-scale aragonite microsheets join in the cluster's interactive movement and screw dislocation self-assembly of the organic film, stacking forward along the axis C spirally and forming the nacreous layer with screw dislocation structure. © 2011 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Detecting and predicting how populations respond to environmental variability are eminent challenges in conservation research and management. This is particularly true for wildlife populations at high latitudes, many of which demonstrate changes in population dynamics associated with global warming. The Falkland Islands (Southwest Atlantic) hold one of the largest Gentoo Penguin Pygoscelis papua populations in the world, representing c. 34% of the global population. The numbers of breeding Gentoo Penguins at the Falkland Islands have shown a high degree of inter-annual variability since monitoring commenced in 1990. However, proximate causes of annual variability in breeding numbers have not been explored. Here we examine 21years of Gentoo Penguin breeding surveys from the Falkland Islands and assess whether inter-annual variability in the number of breeding pairs were correlated with proxies of environmental variability. There was a positive correlation between the number of breeding pairs and a broad-scale climatic variation index, the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). In turn, the SOI was significantly correlated with spring sea surface temperature anomalies, indicating a more immediate atmospherically forced response to El Niño Southern Oscillation variability in the Southwest Atlantic than previously reported. However, we also describe a non-linear response to environmental variability that may highlight foraging plasticity and/or the complexity of regional ecosystem interactions that operate across a range of different scales. © 2011 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: A free-ranging New Zealand fur seal (Actocephalus forsteri), considered a sub-adult male based on size, was observed and photographed on 15 July 2010 in the Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand, attacking a blue penguin (Eudyplula minor), likely an adult. While fur seals of various species are known to feed on penguins, most published data originate from dietary analyses rather than direct observations. New Zealand fur seals are rarely encountered within the Hauraki Gulf and while marine birds are considered to form a minor part of their diet, this record acts as the first documented observation of an attack on a blue penguin within this region and only the second published record within New Zealand waters involving these two species. The carcass of the penguin was not consumed but instead manipulated before being subsequently abandoned. Injuries sustained by the penguin were consistent with those inflicted by terrestrial mammalian carnivores considered important predators of blue penguin. © 2011 The Royal Society of New Zealand.

ABSTRACT: This work was performed as part of a multi-year study to determine the cause of the low fertility in captive rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome) and attempt to increase the fertility through artificial insemination (AI). Semen collection and characterization was performed on 14 male rockhopper penguins. The samples were evaluated for volume, sperm concentration, and sperm quality (motility, forward motility, viability, and morphology). There was a large variation between individuals and between collections for each individual. Mean volume of ejaculate was 0.24ml. Mean concentration was 47.09 × 10 6sperm/ml. Mean number of sperm per collection was 6.57× 10 6. The mean motility was 49.4%. Mean forward motility was 1.7. Mean percentage of living sperm was 88.9%. Mean percentage of sperm with normal morphology was 69.4%. AI was performed on a total of 10 females using pooled semen samples. The birds were also allowed to naturally mate. Ten eggs were laid and three fertile eggs were produced, one of them hatched but died within 24hr. Paternity testing was performed using 12 microsatellite loci, but unfortunately due to insufficient variability, the paternity of the chick and two embryos could not be determined. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Although the movements of seabirds at sea during various stages of breeding in spring and summer have been the focus of many studies in recent years, there is still little known about the non-breeding period for most species. Satellite telemetry was used to determine the at-sea movements and foraging range of 47 Little Penguins (Eudyptula minor) from Phillip Island, south-eastern Australia, during the winter non-breeding period. Individuals conducting single-day trips (72% of individuals) typically foraged 814km from the colony, whereas individuals conducting longer trips (28%; 249 days) foraged either within Port Phillip Bay or in the coastal waters of western Bass Strait at maximum distances of 62147km from the colony. Although there was no difference between sexes in duration of foraging trips, the overall foraging range of males (841km2) was substantially smaller than that of females (1983km2) across all months, and showed an overlap of only 34%. Our results show that the foraging range of Little Penguins in the non-breeding period is greater than that observed during the summer breeding period, which suggest a reduction in local food abundance in winter and highlights the importance of foraging areas distant to the colony during a time of increased energetic costs and higher mortality. © Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union 2011.

ABSTRACT: The amount of energy that organisms can allocate to self-maintenance and/ or reproduction largely depends on their foraging strategies. Because of corticosterone (CORT) involvement in the control of energy metabolism, food intake and locomotor activity, recent studies have sought to demonstrate the role of this hormone in foraging decisions and performance. Moreover, considerable recent advances in animalattached loggers now allow the study of behaviour in free-living animals. In order to assess the effects of CORT administration on the foraging behaviour of free-living Adélie Penguins Pygoscelis adeliae, we studied a group with CORT implants and a control group without CORT implants, by attaching time-depth recorders to the two groups and monitoring them throughout up to seven consecutive foraging trips during the guard stage (in Adélie Land, Antarctica). We found that foraging trips duration was similar between both groups. Dive durations, time spent at the bottom phase of dives, and the number of undulations per dive of CORT-implanted birds were all significantly higher than those of controls. However, CORT-implanted birds performed fewer dives overall (ca. 4,400) than controls (ca. 6,250) and spent many (13 and 6 times for penguins #3 and #4, respectively) long periods (>3 h) without diving. The low foraging effort and long resting periods support the view that CORT-implanted birds probably gained less energy than did the control birds. CORT treatment appears then to result in redirecting bird behaviour from costly activity (i.e. reproduction) to a behaviour promoting the preservation of energy reserves. Future studies are therefore needed to assess body condition and reproductive success of CORT-manipulated birds in parallel with the recording of their diving performances. © The Ornithological Society of Japan 2011.

ABSTRACT: Feathers are used commonly for stable isotope analysis to assess the foraging ecology and migration patterns of birds. However, these studies often require knowledge of species-specific feather isotopic discrimination factors (the differences in isotopic ratios between a species' diet and feathers), which can be influenced by a species' physiological state during molt. In this study, we determined the isotopic discrimination factors (Δ13Cdiet-feather and Δ15Ndiet-feather) between adult gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) diet and feathers in a controlled study. In addition, we tested whether molt duration or the magnitude of voluntary dietary reduction during molt influenced isotopic discrimination, as previous studies have found that nutritional stress can exaggerate 15N enrichment and in some cases lead to 13C depletion in feathers. Contrary to this hypothesis, we found no effect of molt duration or dietary reduction on discrimination factors, suggesting that isotopic discrimination is not linearly related to these measures of fasting intensity in penguins. Furthermore, we found that the range of Δ15Ndiet-feather found in several species of penguins, which fast while they molt, was similar to discrimination factors in fish-eating birds, which do not fast during molt. It is likely that species-specific metabolic adaptations that limit nutritional stress while fasting and variation in their relative reliance on endogenous vs. dietary pools during feather growth may confound the use of Δ15Ndiet-feather as a general measure of nutritional stress when comparing among species. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: We report co-operative group foraging in the African Penguin Spheniscus demersus. Groups of approximately 25-165 African Penguins were observed circling schools of pelagic fish, sometimes forcing them to the surface. During this behaviour 66-75% of penguins were underwater at any given time. Smaller numbers of African Penguins also joined foraging groups of Cape Gannets Moms capensis and Cape Cormorants Phalacrocorax capensis, but did not appear to corral fish schools when outnumbered by these species. African Penguins are listed as Endangered due to ongoing rapid population decreases. If group foraging confers an advantage to African Penguins, their dwindling populations may suffer from an Allee effect as colonies become too small to support sufficient densities of birds for foraging groups to form.

ABSTRACT: Agonistic signals used during contests over important resources have been extensively studied; postconflict signals have received comparatively little attention. While 'triumph displays', performed by winners following fights, have been described for many species, no experiment has yet assessed one of the main hypotheses explaining their existence: advertising victory to social eavesdroppers. Our experiments evaluated the impact of triumph calls on the behaviour and stress responses of surrounding penguins. We found that territorial male little blue penguins, Eudyptula minor, having previously been exposed to playback of a vocal exchange between conspecifics followed by the sounds of a fight, had higher heart rates in response to the winner's call than that of the loser; females had high rates in response to both winners and losers. Males were also less likely to threaten winners than losers vocally during a simulated approach of their burrow, while females remained silent in both contexts. Our findings support the hypothesis that triumph calls facilitate an association of winners' distinctive vocalizations with stress generated by nearby overt aggression. By advertising their victories, males may establish a 'reputation' for winning fights within the social group, potentially reducing the likelihood of being challenged by eavesdroppers in future contests. © 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: Traditionally, the systematics of the Seymour Island fossil penguins has been based on Wiman's groups defined by the robustness and size of isolated postcranial bones. However, current evaluations of fossil penguins necessitate that new species be established when the specimens include at least a tarsometatarsus or in some cases a humerus. Accordingly, neither of the two species reviewed herein (Orthopteryx gigas and Ichtyopteryx gracilis) are represented by remains sufficiently complete to validate a new taxon. Orthopteryx gigas is based on an isolated synsacrum lacking diagnostic characters. Ichtyopteryx gracilis is based on a tarsometatarsus but with insufficient preservational quality to justify discrimination of the species. For these reasons both Orthopteryx gigas and Ichtyopteryx gracilis should be considered nomen dubia. © 2011 Association of Australasian Palaeontologists.

ABSTRACT: Africa hosts a single breeding species of penguin today, yet the fossil record indicates that a diverse array of now-extinct taxa once inhabited southern African coastlines. Here, we show that the African penguin fauna had a complex history involving multiple dispersals and extinctions. Phylogenetic analyses and biogeographic reconstructions incorporating new fossil material indicate that, contrary to previous hypotheses, the four Early Pliocene African penguin species do not represent an endemic radiation or direct ancestors of the living Spheniscus demersus (blackfooted penguin). A minimum of three dispersals to Africa, probably assisted by the eastward-flowing Antarctic Circumpolar and South Atlantic currents, occurred during the Late Cenozoic. As regional sea-level fall eliminated islands and reduced offshore breeding areas during the Pliocene, all but one penguin lineage ended in extinction, resulting in today's depleted fauna. © 2011 The Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: MLP 00-III-5-1 is a distal end of a right tibiotarsus belonging to a fossil penguin. It comes from the Cerro Águila Conglomerate (53°50'14.85"S, 67°47'29.78"W) near Rio Grande City, Tierra del Fuego, Argentina. These beds overly sediments referable to the Cabo Peña Formation, probably similar in age to that of the Middle Miocene Carmen Silva Formation. The fossil described here is the only fossil penguin from this unit and represents the southernmost record of a Neogene penguin in South America. © 2012 E.

ABSTRACT: The colours of living organisms are produced by the differential absorption of light by pigments (e.g. carotenoids, melanins) and/or by the physical interactions of light with biological nanostructures, referred to as structural colours. Only two fundamental morphologies of non-iridescent nanostructures are known in feathers, and recent work has proposed that they self-assemble by intracellular phase separation processes. Here, we report a new biophotonic nanostructure in the non-iridescent blue feather barbs of blue penguins (Eudyptula minor) composed of parallel b-keratin nanofibres organized into densely packed bundles. Synchrotron small angle X-ray scattering and two-dimensional Fourier analysis of electron micrographs of the barb nanostructure revealed short-range order in the organization of fibres at the appropriate size scale needed to produce the observed colour by coherent scattering. These two-dimensional quasi-ordered penguin nanostructures are convergent with similar arrays of parallel collagen fibres in avian and mammalian skin, but constitute a novel morphology for feathers. The identification of a new class of β-keratin nanostructures adds significantly to the known mechanisms of colour production in birds and suggests additional complexity in their self-assembly. © 2011 The Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Breeding individuals enter an emergency life-history stage when their body reserves reach a minimum threshold. Consequently, they redirect current activity toward survival, leading to egg abandonment in birds. Corticosterone (CORT) is known to promote this stage. How and to what extent CORT triggers egg abandonment when breeding is associated with prolonged fasting, however, requires further investigation.We manipulated free-living male Adélie penguins with CORT-pellets before their laying period. We then examined their behavioral response with respect to nest abandonment in parallel with their prolactin levels (regulating parental care), and the subsequent effects of treatment on breeding success in relieved birds.Exogenous CORT triggered nest abandonment in 60% of the treated penguins ~. 14. days after treatment and induced a concomitant decline in prolactin levels. Interestingly, prolactin levels in treated penguins that did not abandon their nest were higher at the point of implantation and also after being relieved by females, when compared with abandoning penguins. Among successful birds, the treatment did not affect the number of chicks, nor the brood mass.Our results show the involvement of CORT in the decision-making process regarding egg abandonment in Adélie penguins when incubation is associated with a natural long fast. However, we suggest that CORT alone is not sufficient to trigger nest abandonment but that 1) prolactin levels need to reach a low threshold value, and 2) a rise in proteolysis (i.e. utilization of protein as main energy substrate) seems also to be required. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Reproductive physiology in North American ursids is characterized by mating from spring to early summer, delayed implantation, and birth during hibernation. During spring 2008, a captive adult female brown bear was mated with two adult males. Pregnancy was determined by elevated progesterone concentrations during late fall before hibernation. Two male cubs were born on December 31, 2008, and a third female cub was born 17 days later on January 16. All were successfully raised and all were confirmed to have identical paternity. When normalized to age, cub growth rates did not differ. To our knowledge, this is the first documented case of markedly different birth dates in a single litter of brown bear cubs. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Penguins have undergone dramatic changes associated with the evolution of underwater flight and subsequent loss of aerial flight, which are manifest and well documented in the musculoskeletal system and integument. Significant modification of neurosensory systems and endocranial spaces may also be expected along this locomotor transition. However, no investigations of the brain and sensory organs of extinct stem lineage Sphenisciformes have been carried out, and few data exist even for extant species of Spheniscidae. In order to explore neuroanatomical evolution in penguins, we generated virtual endocasts for the early Miocene stem penguin Paraptenodytes antarcticus, three extant penguin species (Pygoscelis antarctica, Aptenodytes patagonicus, Spheniscus magellanicus), and two outgroup species (the common loon Gavia immer and the Laysan albatross Phoebastria immutabilis). These endocasts yield new anatomical data and phylogenetically informative characters from the brain, carotid arteries, pneumatic recesses, and semicircular canal system. Despite having undergone over 60 million years of evolution since the loss of flight, penguins retain many attributes traditionally linked to flight. Features associated with visual acuity and proprioception, such as the sagittal eminence and flocculus, show a similar degree of development to those of volant birds in the three extant penguins and Paraptenodytes antarcticus. These features, although clearly not flight-related in penguins, are consistent with the neurological demands associated with rapid manoeuvring in complex aquatic environments. Semicircular canal orientation in penguins is similar to volant birds. Interestingly, canal radius is grossly enlarged in the fossil taxon Pa. antarcticus compared to living penguins and outgroups. In contrast to all other living birds, the contralateral anterior tympanic recesses of extant penguins do not communicate. An interaural pathway connecting these recesses is retained in Pa. antarcticus, suggesting that stem penguins may still have employed this connection, potentially to enhance directional localization of sound. Paedomorphosis, already identified as a potential factor in crown clade penguin skeletal morphology, may also be implicated in the failure of an interaural pathway to form during ontogeny in extant penguins. © 2012 The Linnean Society of London.

ABSTRACT: In accord with the hypotheses driving the Southern Ocean Global Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics (SO GLOBEC) program, we tested the hypothesis that the winter foraging ecology of a major top predator in waters off the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), the Adélie penguin (. Pygoscelis adeliae), is constrained by oceanographic features related to the physiography of the region. This hypothesis grew from the supposition that breeding colonies in the WAP during summer are located adjacent to areas of complex bathymetry where circulation and upwelling processes appear to ensure predictable food resources. Therefore, we tested the additional hypothesis that these areas continue to contribute to the foraging strategy of this species throughout the non-breeding winter season. We used satellite telemetry data collected as part of the SO GLOBEC program during the austral winters of 2001 and 2002 to characterize individual penguin foraging locations in relation to bathymetry, sea ice variability within the pack ice, and wind velocity and divergence (as a proxy for potential areas with cracks and leads). We also explored differences between males and females in core foraging area overlap. Ocean depth was the most influential variable in the determination of foraging location, with most birds focusing their effort on shallow (<200. m) waters near land and on mixed-layer (200-500. m) waters near the edge of deep troughs. Within-ice variability and wind (as a proxy for potential areas with cracks and leads) were not found to be influential variables, which is likely because of the low resolution satellite imagery and model outputs that were available. Throughout the study period, all individuals maintained a core foraging area separated from other individuals with very little overlap. However, from a year with light sea ice to one with heavy ice cover (2001-2002), we observed an increase in the overlap of individual female foraging areas with those of other birds, likely due to restricted access to the water column, reduced prey abundance, or higher prey concentration. Male birds maintained separate core foraging areas with the same small amount of overlap, showing no difference in overlap between the years. While complex bathymetry was an important physical variable influencing the Adélie penguin's foraging, the analysis of sea ice data of a higher resolution than was available for this study may help elucidate the role of sea ice in affecting Adélie penguin winter foraging behavior within the pack ice. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Around 80% of the world population of Northern Rockhopper Penguin Eudyptes moseleyi is found at Tristan da Cunha and Gough Island in the South Atlantic Ocean, where populations appear to be declining. However, numbers of birds at Middle Island, a small satellite island of Nightingale Island at Tristan Cunha, have not been counted since 1973 when an estimated 100,000 pairs were recorded. Updated population counts were obtained for all four islands at Tristan da Cunha (Tristan, Inaccessible, Nightingale and Middle islands) in 2009 providing a census of the whole island group and the first repeat count of Middle Island. Estimated breeding numbers at these four islands were Tristan 6,700 pairs, Inaccessible 54,000 pairs, Nightingale 25,000 pairs and 83,000 pairs at Middle Island. These counts confirm that Tristan da Cunha is a vitally important site for this 'Endangered' species holding over 65% of the global population and that breeding number have been relatively stable over the last 30 years. © 2011 BirdLife International.

ABSTRACT: The only record of the Paleogene Antarctic Sphenisciformes comes from the Eocene La Meseta Formation (Seymour Island, Antarctic Peninsula). The analysis of tarsometatarsi attributed to the genus Anthropornis ("giant" penguins) from the Argentine, Polish and Swedish collections revealed an intriguing heterogeneity within these taxonomically important elements of the skeleton. The unique hypotarsal morphology challenges the current systematics of large-bodied penguins and sheds new light on their evolution.

ABSTRACT: The results of investigations on the coccidian parasites of three species of penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica, P. papua and P. adeliae), nesting at Livingston and King George Island (South Shetland Islands, the Antarctic) are presented. Three coccidian parasites: Eimeria pygosceli Golemansky, 2003, Eimeria sp. and Isospora sp. were identified in faecal samples from 360 examined birds. The total prevalence of coccidian parasites was high: about 35% in all of examined penguins. No host specificity was observed. It is attributed due to the close phylogenetic relations, common habitats and nesting territories, similar feeding and reproductive biology of the three penguin species. In more than 20 specimens of investigated penguins a high intensity of oocysts in their guano was observed (80-220 oocysts in one microscopic field at magnification of 150×) an indirect indication of the negative role of the coccidian infections on penguin populations.

ABSTRACT: Abstract Widely accepted ideas about trophic preferences of early penguins suggest that all Eocene sphenisciforms were piscivorous. However, recent findings from the La Meseta Formation (Eocene) of Antarctica, support the presence of at least two different morphotypes that may have evolved as a niche partitioning strategy, which is consistent with the high diversity recorded. The first of them corresponds to a medium-large sized penguin, resembling the Neogene species in configuration. Another morphotype is represented by extremely large penguins with very long and slender bills, clearly linked to fish catching habits. © 2011 Antarctic Science Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Seabirds and their response to climate perturbations are important bioindicators of changes in Antarctic ecosystems. During 30 years of observations of two chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarcticus) colonies, one on King George Island and the other on Penguin Island (South Shetland Islands, Antarctica), the size of the breeding populations decreased by 84 and 41 %, respectively. We applied analyses of amplified fragment length polymorphisms to study the genetic structure of the two populations and to evaluate the influence of the sudden population decrease. Our data indicate that there were only weak genetic differences between the populations, which were not strong enough to support the hypothesis of population differentiation. Weak genetic differences observed between the two populations seem not to be determined by selection processes. We hypothesize that the very low level of between-population genetic structure can be explained by some extent of genetic drift, which is largely compensated by gene flow. Moreover, the two populations seem to remain in a stationary state. Our results support the hypothesis of limited natal philopatry in chinstrap penguins. The observed decrease in population size is probably caused by emigration or a rise in juvenile mortality due to the increasing krill limitation of the marine food web. However, detailed research is required to address this issue. © 2012 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Since the introduction of the aerobic dive limit (ADL) 30 years ago, the concept that most dives of marine mammals and sea birds are aerobic in nature has dominated the interpretation of their diving behavior and foraging ecology. Although there have been many measurements of body oxygen stores, there have been few investigations of the actual depletion of those stores during dives. Yet, it is the pattern, rate and magnitude of depletion of O 2 stores that underlie the ADL. Therefore, in order to assess strategies of O 2 store management, we review (a) the magnitude of O 2 stores, (b) past studies of O 2 store depletion and (c) our recent investigations of O 2 store utilization during sleep apnea and dives of elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) and during dives of emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri). We conclude with the implications of these findings for (a) the physiological responses underlying O 2 store utilization, (b) the physiological basis of the ADL and (c) the value of extreme hypoxemic tolerance and the significance of the avoidance of re-perfusion injury in these animals. © 2011.

ABSTRACT: The dimensional biometric relationships including that of length-weight was studied in the black winged oyster Pteria penguin, which is a candidate species for mariculture. During the life span of the winged oysters, growth in length and weight was initially 40-100 mm dorso-ventral measurement (DVM), positively allometric and subsequently became isometric (100-160 mm DVM) and finally reverted back to allometry (160-220 mm DVM). This is attributed to the increase in visceral mass of animals corresponding to gonadal maturation during the size range 100 - 160 mm DVM. In larger sized P. penguin, increase in shell length is more predominant as evidenced by large proportion of non-nacreous layer at the outer edge of the shell. There was no parallel increase in visceral mass resulting in allometry. All dimensional relationships were positive in relation to DVM; however the relationship between DVM and hinge length did not show significant R2 values (p>0.05) in all the size groups. This was mainly because, the tips of the hinge and ear were found to be broken at both the ends. Therefore, notch length is proposed as a better predictor of DVM in large hinged pterid oysters. Unlike other pterid pearl oysters, the thickness - DVM ratio showed a decline with size, indicating that bead seeding programmes can be initiated at early stages.

ABSTRACT: Context Penguin Island supports the largest colony of little penguins in Western Australia. It is subjected to a suite of anthropogenic threats because of its proximity to an increasing urban population. For effective management of the colony, it is necessary to not only have knowledge of the size of the colony, but also the population trend of the colony. Aims To demonstrate a new cost-effective method of estimating the island-wide population of penguins on Penguin Island. Methods We estimated the island-wide population by combining mark-recapture sampling over 2 years on part of the island and beach counts of penguins arriving at night around the entire island. We estimated the abundance using closed population models, allowing for sex and time effects in capture probabilities. We had four capture occasions in 2008 only, and so considered heterogeneity of capture probabilities (Mh), using the Chao heterogeneity moment estimator. The proportion of all penguins counted that arrived at the four mark-recapture sites was then used to inflate the population estimate for the whole island. Key results In all, 62% of all penguins counted used the four mark-recapture sites. In 2007, there were an estimated 2369±198 penguins, and 1543±182 in 2008. When capture heterogeneity was allowed for in 2008, this estimate increased to 2069±1172. Conclusions Fewer eggs were laid and all measures of breeding performance were lower in 2008 than in 2007. Hence, the lower population estimate is most likely to represent fewer birds attempting to breed. However, further work on population estimates is required to determine whether capture heterogeneity occurs in both good and poor breeding years. Capture rates were affected by the presence of a full moon and high tides. Implications The estimate of the population can be used as part of the basis of a long-term monitoring program needed for effective management of the penguin colony. However, such studies must be coincident with the monitoring of a suite of reproductive and foraging parameters if short-term impacts of threats are to be recognised and well managed. © 2011 CSIRO.

ABSTRACT: Pteria penguin were collected at Orpheus Island, north-eastern Queensland to observe sexual development, sex ratio and changes in morphometric relationships during growth. P. penguin are protandrous hermaphrodites, with all sexually mature oysters below 88.8 mm dorso-ventral height (DVH) being males. Evidence of male primary gonad development was seen in oysters with a DVH of .33.9 mm. Sexual maturity of males was first seen in oysters at .56.0 mm DVH, but was common in oysters at .70.0 mm DVH. Mean female size was 150.1 (±3.6) mm DVH, and mean male size was 111.3 (±2.2) mm DVH. In oysters <170 mm DVH, males outnumbered females. The female to male sex ratio in the population tended towards 1:1 with increasing size. Female to male sex ratio of oysters between 170-180 mm DVH was 1:1, and females outnumbered males in oysters >180 mm DVH. Significant linear correlations were found between anterior-posterior length of the shell (APL) and DVH (r2 = 0.97, p <0.001) and between shell thickness (ST) and DVH (r2 = 0.95, p <0.001), and a curvilinear relationship was recorded between adductor muscle weight (AW) and DVH (r2 = 0.93, p <0.001). These findings have industry applications for collection of juvenile stock, spawning induction procedures and determining optimal shell size for pearl nucleus implanting. © 2011 Malacological Society of Australasia & Society for the Study of Molluscan Diversity.

ABSTRACT: Southern rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome) have experienced severe population declines across their distribution area, potentially in response to bottom-up effects following elevated sea surface temperatures, changes in the food web and prey availability. We conducted stable isotope analysis to compare trophic levels and distribution patterns in the non-breeding period over three consecutive years, and between males and females, using egg membranes, blood cells and feathers of parent birds. Tissues representing the non-breeding season had lower δ13C values than prey sampled around the Falklands and red blood cells from breeding rockhopper penguins. In contrast, δ15N values were higher in red blood cells from the end of winter compared to those from the breeding season and compared to feathers. This indicated that rockhopper penguins left the Falkland Island area in the non-breeding season and foraged either around Burdwood Bank further south, or over the Patagonian Shelf. In winter, only males took more prey of higher trophic level than females. Inter-annual differences in isotopic values partly correlated with sea surface temperatures. However, as prey isotope samples were collected only in 1 year, inter-annual differences in penguin isotopic values may result from different foraging sites, different prey choice or different isotopic baseline values. Our study highlights the potential for stable isotope analyses to detect seasonal and gender-specific differences in foraging areas and trophic levels, while stressing the need for more sampling of isotopic baseline data. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: For Emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri), huddling is the key to survival during the Antarctic winter. Penguins in a huddle are packed so tightly that individual movements become impossible, reminiscent of a jamming transition in compacted colloids. It is crucial, however, that the huddle structure is continuously reorganized to give each penguin a chance to spend sufficient time inside the huddle, compared with time spent on the periphery. Here we show that Emperor penguins move collectively in a highly coordinated manner to ensure mobility while at the same time keeping the huddle packed. Every 30-60 seconds, all penguins make small steps that travel as a wave through the entire huddle. Over time, these small movements lead to large-scale reorganization of the huddle. Our data show that the dynamics of penguin huddling is governed by intermittency and approach to kinetic arrest in striking analogy with inert non-equilibrium systems, including soft glasses and colloids. © 2011 Zitterbart et al.

ABSTRACT: Recent research has clearly shown that the fear of predation, i. e. aversion to taking risks, among mesopredators or grazers, and not merely flight from an apex predator to avoid predation, is an important aspect of ecosystem structuring. In only a few, though well-documented cases, however, has this been considered in the marine environment. Herein, we review studies that have quantified behavioral responses of Adélie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae and emperor penguins Aptenodytes forsteri to the direct presence of predators, and question why the penguins avoid entering or exiting the water at night. We also show, through literature review and new analyses of Adélie penguin diving data, that Antarctic penguins are capable of successful prey capture in the dark (defined here as <3.4 lux). Finally, we summarize extensive data on seasonal migration relative to darkness and prey availability. On the basis of our findings, we propose that penguins' avoidance of foraging at night is due to fear of predation, and not to an inability to operate effectively in darkness. We further propose that, at polar latitudes where darkness is more a seasonal than a year-round, daily feature, this "risk aversion" affects migratory movements in both species, consistent with the "trade-off" hypothesis seen in other marine vertebrates weighing foraging success against predation risk in their choice of foraging habitat. Such non-consumptive, behavioral aspects of species interactions have yet to be considered as important in Southern Ocean food webs, but may help to explain enigmatic movement patterns and choice of foraging grounds in these penguin species. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: Emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri), both at sea and at an experimental dive hole, often have minimal surface periods even after performance of dives far beyond their measured 5.6?min aerobic dive limit (ADL: dive duration associated with the onset of post-dive blood lactate accumulation). Accelerometer-based data loggers were attached to emperor penguins diving in these two different situations to further evaluate the capacity of these birds to perform such dives without any apparent prolonged recovery periods. Minimum surface intervals for dives as long as 10?min were less than 1?min at both sites. Stroke rates for dives at sea were significantly greater than those for dives at the isolated dive hole. Calculated diving air volumes at sea were variable, increased with maximum depth of dive to a depth of 250?m, and decreased for deeper dives. It is hypothesized that lower air volumes for the deepest dives are the result of exhalation of air underwater. Mean maximal air volumes for deep dives at sea were approximately 83% greater than those during shallow (<50?m) dives. We conclude that (a) dives beyond the 5.6?min ADL do not always require prolongation of surface intervals in emperor penguins, (b) stroke rate at sea is greater than at the isolated dive hole and, therefore, a reduction in muscle stroke rate does not extend the duration of aerobic metabolism during dives at sea, and (c) a larger diving air volume facilitates performance of deep dives by increasing the total body O 2 store to 68?mlO 2?kg-1. Although increased O 2 storage and cardiovascular adjustments presumably optimize aerobic metabolism during dives, enhanced anaerobic capacity and hypoxemic tolerance are also essential for longer dives. This was exemplified by a 27.6?min dive, after which the bird required 6?min before it stood up from a prone position, another 20?min before it began to walk, and 8.4?h before it dived again. © 2011 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

ABSTRACT: One of the reasons for animals not to grow as fast as they potentially could is that fast growth has been shown to be associated with reduced lifespan. However, we are still lacking a clear description of the reality of growth-dependent modulation of ageing mechanisms in wild animals. Using the particular growth trajectory of small king penguin chicks naturally exhibiting higher-than-normal growth rate to compensate for the winter break, we tested whether oxidative stress and telomere shortening are related to growth trajectories. Plasma antioxidant defences, oxidative damage levels and telomere length were measured at the beginning and at the end of the post-winter growth period in three groups of chicks (small chicks, which either passed away or survived the growth period, and large chicks). Small chicks that died early during the growth period had the highest level of oxidative damage and the shortest telomere lengths prior to death. Here, we show that small chicks that grew faster did it at the detriment of body maintenance mechanisms as shown by (i) higher oxidative damage and (ii) accelerated telomere loss. Our study provides the first evidence for a mechanistic link between growth and ageing rates under natural conditions. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Historically, little contact with humans makes the Snares Penguin, Eudyptes robustus, an ideal species to study the natural response of penguins to human proximity. We measured behavioural and heart rate (HR) responses of Snares Penguins to a range of stimuli commonly occurring at their breeding sites and to experimental human disturbance. While behavioural responses gave an indication of disturbance effects, measuring HR provided a more objective and reliable tool to evaluate a stimulus. Natural stimuli usually caused little HR increase and were followed by rapid recovery. An experimental human approach provoked a significantly greater HR increase than most natural stimuli and more time was needed to recover from this disturbance event. Simultaneous and previous research projects on the Snares Penguin provided an opportunity to test the effects that contemporary experience with humans had on the Snares Penguin stress response. Penguins undisturbed in this study but exposed to intrusive research and filming activities the previous season showed significantly stronger responses to human approach than did naive birds. Hence, individual experiences with humans may have lasting effects on stimulus-specific disturbance responses. © Dt. Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V. 2011.

ABSTRACT: Breeding Spheniscus penguins are central place foragers that feed primarily on schooling pelagic fish. They are visual hunters, but it is unclear how they locate prey patches on a coarse scale. Many petrels and storm petrels (Procellariiformes), the penguins' closest relatives, use olfactory cues to locate prey concentrations at sea, but this has not been demonstrated for penguins. Procellariiforms are attracted to a variety of olfactory cues, including dimethyl sulphide (DMS), an organosulphur compound released when phytoplankton is grazed, as well as fish odorants such as cod liver oil. A recent study found that African penguins Spheniscus demersus react to DMS on land. We confirm this result and show that African penguins are also attracted by DMS at sea. DMS-scented oil slicks attracted 2-3 times more penguins than control slicks, whereas penguins showed no response to slicks containing cod liver oil. The number of penguins attracted to DMS increased for at least 30min, suggesting penguins could travel up to 2 km to reach scent cues. Repeats of land-based trials confirmed previous results showing DMS sensitivity of penguins on land. Our results also support the hypothesis that African penguins use DMS as an olfactory cue to locate prey patches at sea from a distance, which is particularly important given their slow commuting speed relative to that of flying seabirds. © 2011.

ABSTRACT: Despite the large biomass of macaroni penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus in the Southern Ocean, their feeding ecology is poorly known at some important breeding localities. We investigated the diving behaviour and diet of female macaroni penguins feeding small chicks on Marion Island (46°52′S, 37°5′E), South Africa, one of the species' most northerly breeding sites, supporting 4% of their global population. We then compared our results with similar studies from other localities. In December 2008, we collected information on 12 foraging trips from 6 individuals using time-depth recorders, as well as diet from 42 individuals. Median trip duration was 22. 8 h (5. 6-80. 8 h). Penguins performed 42. 8 ± 15. 9 dives per hour at sea, with dive depths averaging 24. 6 ± 8. 6 m and lasting 40. 8 ± 12. 1 s, although 74. 3% of dives were <10 m. Euphasids dominated their diet (86% by mass), mainly Thysanoessa vicina. A second peak in dive depths at 55-80 m might reflect the 12% of fish in their diet. The substantial proportion of shallow night dives (30% of total dives) suggests some foraging occurs at night. Differences in diving patterns of individual macaroni penguins in this study confirmed the behavioural flexibility of these birds reported from other breeding localities. However, most other studies assumed that dives <3-5 m were commuting dives whereas our study suggests that at least some prey are caught during shallow dives. We highlight how different analytical methods can change the outcome of studies. Despite macaroni penguins' apparent flexibility in foraging behaviour during the breeding season, their numbers are decreasing globally. Further investigations of their foraging behaviour are needed to assess potential competition with other predators and krill fisheries. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: An individual-based bioenergetics model that simulates the growth of an Adélie penguin Pygoscelis adeliae chick from hatching to fledging was used to assess marine and terrestrial factors that affect chick growth and fledging mass off the western Antarctic Peninsula. Simulations considered the effects on Adélie penguin fledging mass of (1) modification of chick diet through the addition of Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarcticum to an all-Antarctic krill Euphausia superba diet, (2) reduction of provisioning rate which may occur as a result of an environmental stress such as reduced prey availability, and (3) increased thermoregulatory costs due to wetting of chicks which may result from increased precipitation or snow-melt in colonies. Addition of 17% Antarctic silverfish of Age-Class 3 yr (AC3) to a penguin chick diet composed of Antarctic krill increased chick fledging mass by 5%. Environmental stress that results in >4% reduction in provisioning rate or wetting of just 10% of the chick's surface area decreased fledging mass enough to reduce the chick's probability of successful recruitment. The negative effects of reduced provisioning and wetting on chick growth can be compensated for by inclusion of Antarctic silverfish of AC3 and older in the chick diet. Results provide insight into climate-driven processes that influence chick growth and highlight a need for field research designed to investigate factors that determine the availability of AC3 and older Antarctic silverfish to foraging Adélie penguins and the influence of snowfall on chick wetting, thermoregulation and adult provisioning rate. © 2011 Inter-Research.

ABSTRACT: The African penguin, Spheniscus demersus, the only penguin species that breeds in Africa, is endangered, and several diseases including avian malaria, babesiosis, and aspergillosis are common in some populations. From 2002 to 2010, spirochetes morphologically consistent with Borrelia were observed on thin blood smears from 115 of 8,343 (1.4%) African penguins admitted to rehabilitation centers in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces of South Africa. Prevalence rates were significantly higher among chicks and juveniles compared with adults and for birds sampled during the summer months of October to February compared with winter months. The majority of infected birds were ultimately released, despite lack of antibiotic treatment; however, at least one bird is believed to have died of borreliosis based on characteristic gross and microscopic lesions. Analysis of partial flaB gene sequences indicated this was a relapsing fever Borrelia most similar to a Borrelia sp. detected in soft ticks from a seabird colony in Japan. This represents the fourth report of a relapsing fever Borrelia sp. in an avian species and highlights the need for additional studies of potentially pathogenic organisms infecting the African penguin in South Africa. © Springer-Verlag 2011.

ABSTRACT: Population monitoring of seabirds plays an important role in conservation since it provides the information required to evaluate conservation programmes of endangered species, to guide harvest management and to monitor indicators of marine ecosystem health. Annual nest counts are often used for the long-term monitoring of breeding seabird populations. While such counts provide a direct and cost-effective survey method, single nest counts will almost always yield an underestimate of the true number of nests and provide no means of expressing uncertainty. In this study, we used double counts and the Lincoln-Petersen estimator to assess the reliability of nest counts for the Yellow-Eyed Penguin (Megadyptes antipodes) in the South Island of New Zealand. We estimated the detection rate of single nest counts at 88%, and we calculated that double counts are sufficiently precise to detect changes in the size of the breeding population as small as 3. 3% between years. We failed to detect observer bias or any effects of search effort or habitat on the detection rate, the only significant factor being the steepness of the terrain. Given the high detection rate and the susceptibility of Yellow-Eyed Penguins to human disturbance, we conclude that the established protocol for single nest counts is adequate for the regular monitoring of the population. We suggest that double counts could be conducted once every 5 years to obtain precise estimates for the purpose of long-term population monitoring. We also highlight the importance of repeating similar studies for a variety of species and habitats. © 2011 Dt. Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.

ABSTRACT: Very little attention has been paid to quantifying ammonia (NH3) emissions from Antarctic marine animal excreta. In this paper, penguin guano and ornithogenic soils from four penguin colonies and seal colony soils were collected in coastal Antarctica, and laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate potential NH3 emissions and effects of environmental factors on NH3 fluxes. Ammonia fluxes were extremely low from the frozen samples. Significantly enhanced NH3 emissions were observed following thawing. The mean fluxes were 7.66 ± 4.33 mg NH3 kg-1 h-1 from emperor penguin guano, 1.31 ± 0.64 mg NH3 kg-1 h-1 from Adélie penguin guano and 0.33 0.39 mg NH3 kg-1 h-1 from seal colony soils during the thawing period. Ammonia emissions from penguin guano were higher than those from ornithogenic soils during freezing-thawing cycles (FTCs). The temperature, pH, total nitrogen (TN) and drying-wetting conversion had an important effect on NH3 fluxes. For the first time, we provide a quantitative relationship between NH3 flux and temperature, TN and pH. Our results show that marine animal excreta and ornithogenic soils are significant NH3 emission sources. In coastal Antarctica, FTC-induced NH3 emissions might account for a large proportion of annual flux from marine animal colonies due to high freezing-thawing frequency.

ABSTRACT: In 1902, the first breeding colony of emperor penguins was discovered. Over the following decades, the number of known emperor penguin colonies increased steadily and new ones are still being discovered. However, rigorous census work has been carried out at only a few colonies and accurate information on trends in breeding populations is limited to a small number of locations. Thus, the total number of breeding pairs is still unknown as is the size of the global population (breeders, non-breeders, juveniles). The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the species' status as 'least concern' and states that although the population trend for emperor penguins has not been quantified, the global population appears to be stable. This review summarises the currently available information on the populations of emperor penguins at known colonies in terms of survey methods, count units used and survey frequency. It examines what is known about the state of various colonies and demonstrates that currently available data are inadequate for a trend assessment of the global population. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: A complex interaction of biotic and abiotic factors influences animal foraging activity. It is often difficult to understand which factors may affect animals' foraging and how it is affected. For instance, whereas the effect of sexual dimorphism on foraging activity has been reported in several species, little is known of the complex interactions between variables acting at a finer scale, e.g. the variability of body mass within a sex. Evaluating the importance of these finer scale factors is also essential to the understanding of foraging behaviour. We propose here a simple approach by applying principal component analysis (PCA) in a novel way to examine relationships between biotic and abiotic factors affecting foraging behaviour of top predators. We studied female little penguins (Eudyptula minor) of known age, carrying miniature accelerometers during the guard stage of breeding. Surprisingly, the body mass of the females did not influence any of the foraging parameters, but females foraging later in the breeding season dived shallower and more often, showing a strong correlation with laying date. Similarly, the diving effort of females was greater with increasing chick age within the same breeding stage. These results indicate that for female little penguin, the relationship between changes in prey availability and hunting effort can change at a fine scale, within a breeding stage. Therefore, any analysis of little penguin foraging behaviour during breeding should consider the timing in relation to the breeding season. We encourage researchers to develop the use of this PCA approach as it could help clarify the complexity of the underlying mechanisms determining foraging activity and we propose that it should be used as a first step of foraging behaviour analysis, before examining a particular relationship. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: We investigated the effectiveness of rehabilitation for injured or sick resident breeders as a tool to increase population size of endangered yellow-eyed penguins (Megadyptes antipodes). Recent modelling of conservation measures showed that population growth for this species is achievable only through intensive management, including rehabilitation, with a predicted increase of 9% after 15 years. We tested this by monitoring resident breeders treated since 1997 at the rehabilitation facility of an eco-tourism venture, Penguin Place, near Dunedin, southern New Zealand. Males outnumber females in the wild breeding population; thus, annual nest numbers are derived from the number of females. Of 28 rehabilitations of resident female breeders, 24 (83%) were released, 16 (67%) of which bred again. Our results indicate that rehabilitation increased the average annual survival for adult females by 7%, an increase not statistically significant. Subsequent breeding generated 10% increases in cumulative totals for nests and for chicks fledged. We conclude that rehabilitation of this species can enhance population size, but is applicable only at locations already managed to mitigate anthropogenic threats to this species. © 2010 International Wildlife Rehabilitation Council.

ABSTRACT: We report here the first published observations of killer whales (Orcinus orca) feeding on penguins in Antarctica. The sightings took place in the Gerlache Strait off the western Antarctic Peninsula during February 2010. Two species of pygoscelid penguins were taken-gentoo (Pygoscelis papua, at least four individuals) and chinstrap (P. antarctica, 2). From remains left at the surface, it was clear that the killer whales fed mainly on the breast muscles, although some penguins may have been swallowed whole. The killer whales were ecotype B, which are purported seal specialists, but we also saw ecotype A, prey specialists on Antarctic minke whales Balaenoptera bonaerensis, chase, but not catch penguins. Because of their small relative size, if penguins are regularly targeted by killer whales in Antarctica, the impact on their populations could be significant. © 2010 US Government.

ABSTRACT: Kaiika maxwelli is a new species of archaic fossil penguin from the Kauru Formation (Waipawan-Mangaorapan,Early Eocene) of the southern Canterbury Basin,Waihao River,South Canterbury,New Zealand. Kaiika maxwelli is represented by a wellpreserved large and robust humerus,in which the broad m. scapulotricipitalis tendon sulcus,sigmoidal shaft and vestigial supracondylar process are similar to those of the basal penguin Waimanu,but differs from Waimanu and other penguins by having a deeply incised ventral tubercle and a smoothly curved profile of the deltoid crest and head. Humeral length suggests a body length of 1.3 m comparable to that of an emperor penguin,indicating that large penguins lived at a time of global warmth. This is the first significant fossil penguin named from pre-Bortonian (Middle Eocene) strata of the southern Canterbury Basin. Kaiika maxwelli is only the seventh species of fossil penguin reportedly older than Middle Eocene. © 2011 The Royal Society of New Zealand.

ABSTRACT: Abdominally implanted data-loggers have been used to study the behaviour and physiology of birds, with no detectable negative effects. This technique has great potential for smaller and streamlined species, since these animals tend to be more prone to the negative effects that may be associated with externally attached devices. We conducted the first assessment of the impacts of abdominally implanted heart-rate data-loggers on a smaller species, the Little Penguin (Eudyptula minor), which weighs ∼1.1kg. The number and duration of trips to sea were recorded in male penguins implanted with a device (n≤10) and compared with a control group not implanted with a device (n≤10). Trips were recorded for the entire duration of the Penguins' winter non-breeding period, which for this species is the time of year when their energy budgets are most delicately balanced. The heart-rate data-loggers appeared to have no effect on percentage of time spent at sea, and the number and duration of overnight trips of 25 days or 626 days. Implanted Penguins undertook fewer trips of 1-day duration but the duration of these trips of 1 day was not affected. Individual Penguins showed highly variable foraging behaviour and the difference in the number of trips of 1 day may be attributed to individual specialisation in foraging behaviour. © 2010 Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union.

ABSTRACT: Animals modulate breeding effort by balancing investment in self-maintenance against investment in their young, potentially impacting reproductive success when faced with difficult conditions. This life history trade-off model has been evaluated for flying birds, especially those that forage over large pelagic regions of relatively sparse prey availability. We evaluated its applicability to penguins which, lacking flight, depend on reliably available prey relatively close to colonies. We used transponders and an automated weighing system to monitor 40 to 75 breeding Adélie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae per season for 10 seasons, while environmental conditions varied dramatically, measuring foraging trip duration, parental mass change, and total food load delivered to chicks. Parents that lost the most mass during breeding provided more food to chicks while maintaining their own condition. In contrast, in years when adult mass was lower to begin with, parents recovered their own condition and delivered less food to chicks. Food loads were also related to environmental variables, with parents making longer trips and delivering less food when access to prey was more difficult, but delivering more food to 2-chick broods than to 1-chick broods. Penguins did not alternate between short (chick provisioning) and long (self-maintenance) trips, as has been observed in farranging seabirds. Nevertheless, our results indicate they regulated their condition depending on environmental and physiological factors, with impacts on the amount of food delivered to young and pre-fledging mass. Parental choice of multiple foraging habitats and depletion of prey in the nearest habitat due to intraspecific competition have important implications in explaining contrasting patterns observed among studies investigating the life history trade-off model in birds. © Inter-Research 2010.

ABSTRACT: Several traces of biological interaction were found on penguin bones from the basal levels (Aquitanian) of the Miocene Gaiman Formation in the lower Chubut valley of the Provincia del Chubut, Argentina. The fossil-bearing beds were deposited in littoral to sublittoral environments within sediments of mostly pyroclastic origin. We interpret many traces to have been produced by predators and/or scavengers while the penguins were still in a breeding area. Many bones show cracking marks due to aerial exposure. The material is disarticulated as is usual in recent breeding areas. Potential predators were coeval terrestrial mammals, most probably marsupial carnivores. After a marine transgression, these bones were buried or exposed on the sea bottom where they could be colonized by algae, sponges, cnidarians, and other benthic organisms. We identified sponge borings in several bones. Other traces are interpreted to have been produced by echinoderms feeding on sponges or algae. No evidence of other invertebrate predators such as muricid or naticid gastropods, or decapods was found. Finally, other traces appear to have been generated by shark and possibly teleostean vertebrates feeding on epibionts. One coracoid is interpreted to have been marked by a shark that is common in the Gaiman Formation, the carcharhiniform Galeocerdo aduncus. From an ethological (Seilacherian) classification, traces on bones from the Gaiman Formation include Domichnia (sponge perforations), Praedichnia (terrestrial marsupials, sharks, teleosteans) and Pasichnia (echinoderms). Remarkably, remains of marine organisms with skeletons made of calcium carbonate are very poorly preserved in the Gaiman Formation. Only large oysters, sparse shell fragments, skeletal moulds, and bioturbation is evident. The fossil assemblage is mainly composed of phosphatic (e.g. teeth, bones, crustacean parts) and siliceous (sponge spicules, diatoms) remains. © 2010 Association of Australasian Palaeontologists.

ABSTRACT: Courtship feeding has not been reported for chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica). However, we observed a male chinstrap penguin fed to his mate during the guard stage of chick. After being fed, the female regurgitated the food to her chick. Our observation suggests that the chicks' behaviour of begging for food may be retained in adults, but it is usually restrained. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: To maximize fitness, females should invest optimally in the siblings within a litter or brood and adapt this investment to environmental conditions. Chick mass and yolk androgens have been shown to influence the outcome of sibling competition. In birds, asynchronous hatching plays a major role in this process and often leads to brood reduction. We studied maternal deposition of yolk androgens in eggs of southern rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome). Contrary to other avian models, laying and hatching sequences do not coincide in this species, which exhibits reversed hatching asynchrony. This provides a unique model to test whether the first egg to hatch (B-egg), which is the most likely to survive, differs in composition from the second egg to hatch (A-egg). We found that B-eggs had higher egg masses, yolk masses, yolk androgen concentrations and total yolk androgen amounts than A-eggs. This was observed consistently for the three androgens analyzed (testosterone, androstenedione and 5α-dihydrotestosterone). Laying date affected androgen deposition into A- and B-eggs differently. Interestingly, late clutches had proportionally higher androgen levels in the B-egg compared to the A-egg than early clutches. We discuss these results in relation to the chronology of egg formation and the potential effect of the observed differences on embryo development and brood reduction. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: To understand how the social and physical environment influences behaviour, reproduction and survival, studies of underlying hormonal processes are crucial; in particular, interactions between stress and reproductive responses may have critical influences on breeding schedules. Several authors have examined the timing of breeding in relation to environmental stimuli, while others have independently described endocrine profiles. However, few studies have simultaneously measured endocrine profiles, breeding behaviour, and offspring survival across seasons. We measured sex and stress hormone concentrations (oestrogens, testosterone, and corticosterone), timing of breeding, and chick survival, in Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) at two colonies in two different years. Clutch initiation at Cape Bird South (CBS; year 1, ∼14,000 pairs) occurred later than at Cape Crozier East (CCE; year 2, ∼25,000 pairs); however, breeding was more synchronous at CBS. This pattern was probably generated by the persistence of extensive sea ice at CBS (year 1). Higher corticosterone metabolite and lower sex hormone concentrations at CBS correlated with later breeding and lower chick survival compared to at CCE - again, a likely consequence of sea ice conditions. Within colonies, sub-colony size (S, 50-100; M, 200-300; L, 500-600; XL, >1000 pairs) did not influence the onset or synchrony of breeding, chick survival, or hormone concentrations. We showed that the endocrine profiles of breeding Adelie penguins can differ markedly between years and/or colonies, and that combining measures of endocrinology, behaviour, and offspring survival can reveal the mechanisms and consequences that different environmental conditions can have on breeding ecology. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: More than 50 yr ago, field studies recorded the same-sex pairs (and trios) of penguins displaying to each other during the mating season, using behavior patterns typical of heterosexual mating displays. Such observations led to a hypothesis that due to a lack of sex recognition pairing occurs at random with respect to sex, an idea countered by the argument that sex recognition is highly accurate. No quantification of same-sex mating displays has tested the frequency of such displays in penguins or tested the hypothesis of random display partners with respect to sex. During their mating season, we studied displaying and paired king penguins, Apenodytes patagonicus, at Kerguelen Island and sexed them using a DNA marker, to quantify any occurrence of this behavior. Indeed, same-sex courtship displays were common (28.3% of 53 displaying pairs), the great majority of which were between males. Some homosexually displaying males eventually paired with females, but such males were significantly slower in heterosexual pairing than males that did not display homosexually. In two extraordinary cases, same-sex pairs learned each other's calls, an essential step in the pairing process. The frequency of such pairs was much lower than among displaying couples, significantly so for males. Finally, the frequency of homosexually displaying pairs was significantly lower than expected from random assortment of displaying birds, for both males and females. We examined possible explanations for same-sex display and its biological significance. A population sex-ratio bias in favor of males and high concentration of male sex hormones may help to explain non-reproductive homosexually displaying pairs. © 2010 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

ABSTRACT: Eocene Antarctic penguins are known solely from the La Meseta Formation (Seymour Island, James Ross Basin). They are most numerous and taxonomically diverse (at least ten species present) within strata formed at the end of this epoch, which is concomitant with a significant cooling trend and biotic turnover prior to the onset of glaciation. Moreover, all newly appeared taxa were small-bodied, and most probably evolved in situ. Interestingly, some chemical proxies suggest enhanced nutrient upwelling events that coincided with obvious changes in the record of La Meseta penguins. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Orientation based on visual cues can be extremely difficult in crowded bird colonies due to the presence of many individuals. We studied king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) that live in dense colonies and are constantly faced with such problems. Our aims were to describe adult penguin homing paths on land and to test whether visual cues are important for their orientation in the colony. We also tested the hypothesis that older penguins should be better able to cope with limited visual cues due to their greater experience. We collected and examined GPS paths of homing penguins. In addition, we analyzed 8 months of penguin arrivals to and departures from the colony using data from an automatic identification system. We found that birds rearing chicks did not minimize their traveling time on land and did not proceed to their young (located in crèches) along straight paths. Moreover, breeding birds' arrivals and departures were affected by the time of day and luminosity levels. Our data suggest that king penguins prefer to move in and out of the colony when visual cues are available. Still, they are capable of navigating even in complete darkness, and this ability seems to develop over the years, with older breeding birds more likely to move through the colony at nighttime luminosity levels. This study is the first step in unveiling the mysteries of king penguin orientation on land. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: Three cases of fatal septicaemia due to Plesiomonas shigelloides and one due to Edwardsiella tarda were diagnosed in newborn penguins from the Basle Zoo, Switzerland from 2003-2007. The affected penguins were of two different species (king penguin, Aptenodytes patagonicus, and African penguin, Spheniscus demersus) and between 2 and 10 days old at the time of death. The causative agents, E. tarda and P. shigelloides are ubiquitous bacteria which are reported to be present in the normal intestinal flora of wild and captive aquatic animals, including penguins. Their occurrence and infectious potential is discussed. © 2011 by Verlag Hans Huber, Hogrefe AG, Bern.

ABSTRACT: The realized niches of closely related species must differ if these species are to co-exist stably. The Gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) and Chinstrap Penguins (P. antarctica) breed concurrently in the Scotia Sea and Antarctic Peninsula regions. To identify species- and site-specific foraging niches, we compared the two species' foraging niches, including diet and foraging locations, at two sites in the South Shetland Islands with contrasting marine habitats. Both species fed primarily on Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), though fish was also a component of the Gentoo Penguin's diet. Gentoo Penguins foraged closer to shore than did Chinstrap Penguins. Gentoo Penguins foraged during the day, while Chinstrap Penguins foraged throughout the diel cycle, sometimes traveling farther from shore on overnight foraging trips. In most cases, these species-specific foraging patterns were consistent with trends seen elsewhere in the region. However, within each species, site-specific differences in foraging niches were still evident. Overall, we observed that Gentoo Penguins traveled within consistent and limited distances from their colonies, but their diets varied by site in both meal mass and content. Chinstrap Penguins, in contrast, had a uniform diet of krill at both sites but varied the distance from shore and times at which they foraged. © 2010 The Cooper Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Reflectance spectroscopy has several advantages compared to traditional chemical methods in paleolimnology. It requires little cost, involves minimal or no sample preparation and is rapid. There has, however, been limited use of reflectance spectroscopy in polar paleolimnological studies. This paper explores the application of reflectance spectroscopy to reconstruct historical changes in penguin population size in the maritime Antarctic. Two ornithogenic sediment cores on Ardley Island, Antarctica were analyzed. Penguin droppings and weathered soils were analyzed as reference materials. Principal component analysis and linear mixing modeling were performed on the spectral data to estimate the proportion of penguin guano in the sediments and these values were used to infer historical penguin population numbers. Historical penguin population size versus time, reconstructed from reflectance spectra, and population numbers inferred from previous geochemical analysis of bio-elements, were quite similar. Our results illustrate the feasibility of rapidly inferring historical changes in penguin population size using reflectance spectroscopy on Antarctic ornithogenic sediments. Our findings suggest that this technique has potential for reconstructing past population numbers of other seabirds and mammals using lake sediments influenced by animal excrement. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

ABSTRACT: While the foraging ecology of the Adélie penguin Pygoscelis adeliae and gentoo penguin P papua has been well studied, little is known on the distribution and diet of these species outside the breeding season In the present study we used stable carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (d15N) isotope analyses of eggshells to examine the pre-breeding diets and foraging habitats of female Adélie and gentoo penguins from 23 breeding colonies along the eastern and western Antarctic Peninsula (AP), South Shetland Islands, and South Orkney Islands, in 2006 Adélie penguin eggshells from the eastern AP, South Shetland Islands, and South Orkney Islands shared similar isotopic signatures and were significantly lower in both δ13C and δ15N values than eggshells from birds breeding along the western AP This result suggests that Adélie penguin populations that are geographically separated during the breeding season by the Adélie 'gap,' a 400 km region in the western AP devoid of breeding Adélie penguins, also inhabit geographically distinct habitats during the late winter prior to the breeding season To a lesser degree, gentoo penguin eggshell isotope values also varied across breeding colonies, which likely reflects local scale variation in their near-shore foraging grounds Furthermore, unlike the breeding period when krill (primarily Euphausia superba) dominates penguin diets in these regions, our findings suggest that fish and/or other high trophic-level prey species comprise a significant portion (468 to 629%) of female Adélie and gentoo penguin diets prior to breeding © Inter-Research 2011.

ABSTRACT: Despite having an exceptionally high fluorine (F) concentration in their bones (up to 9000 μg/g in the present study), radiographs of mature Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) do not show any symptoms of skeletal fluorosis. In this research, a series of chemical fractionation and speciation analyses for F gave a tentative explanation for this seemingly abnormal fact. The results showed that the inorganic fraction of F in penguin bones represented only about one-third of the total F with the rest bound organically, mostly in the form of fluorinated chitin or its derivatives. A laboratory experiment with rats on a high F intake indicated that chitin might prevent skeletal fluorosis by effectively combining with F and inhibiting abnormal mineralization, thereby decreasing the expected increase in bone mineral density. © 2010 The International Society for Fluoride Research Inc.

ABSTRACT: Spat recruitment of the winged pearl oyster Pteria penguin, in relation to season, substrate type, and depth was investigated at Orpheus Island in north Queensland for 27 mo, from February 2008 to April 2010. Two substrate types (70% shade cloth and open-weave polypropylene mesh bags) were deployed at 2 depths (4 m and 6 m) and checked every 6 wk for 3 spawning seasons to determine any differences in quantity of spatfall between these factors. No significant difference was found in spat recruitment between substrate types (P = 0.158) or depth (P = 0.349), although there was a significant seasonal effect on spat recruitment (P < 0.001), with a peak in the quantity of spatfall in late summer, from February to March, and no spat collected in the winter to spring (July to October). Maximum settlement of spat was 10.2 spat per mesh bag collector in February 2008. Recruitment was significantly reduced (P < 0.001) during the 2010 spawning season as a result of disturbance from severe storms generated by tropical cyclone Olga in late January.

ABSTRACT: The immune system is essential for health and survival of vertebrates, yet still little is known about the ontogeny of the immune system in wild birds. The southern rockhopper penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome) is a semi-altricial seabird with a long developmental period and reversed hatching asynchrony, favouring the survival of B-chicks. We compared leucocyte counts and baseline corticosterone levels of southern rockhopper penguin chicks under different preconditions such as sex and origin from an A- or B-egg from 4 to 51 days of age. We conducted an experiment to compare leucocyte profiles and baseline corticosterone levels in A- and B-chicks in single-egg clutches as well as in B-chicks from normal two egg-clutches (one A- and one B-egg). None of these treatments influenced leucocyte counts or corticosterone levels, indicating a similar investment in the immune system. Our main finding was an increase of leucocytes/10,000 erythrocytes with age, which was mainly caused by an increase in lymphocyte numbers. This suggests differential investment into acquired immunity at this stage of development. As the granulocyte/lymphocyte (G/L) ratio did not change with age or body condition, G/L ratios seem not to reflect stress caused by poor provisioning of penguin chicks. This was also reinforced by the decrease of plasma corticosterone levels with age. Body condition was negatively correlated with monocyte numbers, suggesting a poorer health status of penguin chicks in poorer body condition. Yet, there was no link between body condition and other leucocyte parameters, indicating that chicks in a good body condition did not additionally invest into their immune system. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: Individual marking is essential to study the life-history traits of animals and to track them in all kinds of ecological, behavioural or physiological studies. Unlike other birds, penguins cannot be banded on their legs due to their leg joint anatomy and a band is instead fixed around a flipper. However, there is now detailed evidence that flipper-banding has a detrimental impact on individuals. It can severely injure flipper tissues, and the drag effect of their flipper bands results in a higher energy expenditure when birds are moving through the water. It also results in lower efficiency in foraging, since they require longer foraging trips, as well as in lower survival and lower breeding success. Moreover, due to the uncertainty of the rate of band loss, flipper bands induce a scientific bias. These problems, which obviously have serious ethical implications, can be avoided with alternative methods such as radiofrequency identification techniques. © 2011 Académie des sciences.

ABSTRACT: Twenty-seven Magellanic penguins, Spheniscus magellanicus (Sphenisciformes), were collected from September 1996 to November 2000 from Península Valdés (42°04′42°53′S; 63°38′-64°30′W), on the Patagonian coast, Argentina and the gastrointestinal tract was examined for helminths. All birds were parasitized by at least 1 of the 5 following parasite species: Tetrabothrius lutzi (Cestoda); Cardiocephaloides physalis (Lutz, 1926) (Digenea), Contracaecum pelagicum (Johnston and Mawson, 1942), Cosmocephalus obvelatus (Creplin, 1825) (Nematoda), and Corynosoma sp. (Acanthocephala). The total mean intensity was 686. The helminth community composition of S. magellanicus is reported for first time in Argentina increasing the host range of many of the species registered. © 2010 The Helminthological Society of Washington.

ABSTRACT: Some morphological traits of Antarctic animals could be considered in the context of a trend to more direct relation between environmental conditions and possible adaptive mechanisms of animal's organism. Penguins are excellent object for biomonitoring. Here a preliminarily report is presented regarding a new trait, a spot-like coloration ("yellow spot"?) of the bill, observed on the upper mandible of Gentoo penguin (subspecies Pygoscelis papua ellsworthii). The spot varied in size and colour. It was recorded among chicks over two months old and adult birds (normal and molting). The trait had no significant relationship to the animal' s sex. Among all inspected females 31% and among all inspected males 27% exhibited beak spot. Three breeding colonies were investigated at three different geographical locations at the Antarctic Peninsula - Livingston Island, South Shetlands (62°38' S), Wiencke Island (64°52' S), and Petermann Island (65°10' S). Yellow spot was found with different frequencies at these three locations: 20%, 36%, and 30%, respectively. All spotted penguins from the three colonies were 32% whencompared to all non-spotted. The possible reasons for the spot-like coloration are discussed. The trait could be a phenotypic characteristic. It could play some role in the mate choice. A possible connection to carotenoid pigments content does not be eliminated in the context of Gentoo diet. A probable cause for the beak spot appearance seems to be the increasing of ozone depletion above Antarctica. The ultraviolet radiation enhances free radical production. Other studies reported an increase of the flux of transsulfuration pathway as a defense reaction, resulting in elevated level of cysteine. When cysteine concentration is raised, an attaching of cysteine to melanin synthesis pathway occurs and this results in formation of reddish pigments. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Dive duration generally decreases with dive depth in air-breathing vertebrates. In most penguin species, this occurs due to increasing transit (descent and ascent) durations. However, in U-shaped dives, this is also because the duration of the bottom phase of the dive increases with increasing depth. We considered the time-based efficiency with which birds can use different diving depths by using depth recorders on 9 foraging emperor penguins Aptenodytes forsteri, studied during the early and late chick-rearing period in Adélie Land, Antarctica. Dive and post-dive duration positively correlated with diving depth, but particularly long recovery durations were apparent for dives longer than 456 s. This inflection point (i.e. 456 s) corresponded to a theorized maximum rate of gain of prey per dive cycle. By using the number of undulations in the bottom phase of the dive as a proxy for prey capture success, we conclude that the most lucrative dive depths for the birds studied were between 50 and 225 m. Since these depths were also those most often visited, we think that foraging emperor penguins focus on depths where profitability is highest. © Inter-Research 2010.

ABSTRACT: Magellanic penguins migrate from Patagonia reaching northern Argentina, Uruguay, and southern Brazil on their winter migration, in parallel with the seasonal pulse of anchovy spawning. In 2008, Magellanic penguins went further north than usual. Many died and a few swam nearly to the Equator. Twelve groups surveyed 5000. km of coastline encountering 3371 penguins along the coast. Most penguins arrived in northern Brazil (68.4%) without petroleum (2933, 87%). Almost all penguins without petroleum were juveniles (2915, 99%) and 55% were alive when found. Penguins were dehydrated, anemic, hypothermic, and emaciated. Of the penguins with petroleum, 13% arrived in the southern half of Brazil, showing that petroleum pollution remains a problem along the SW Atlantic coast. The mortality occurred in the winter of 2008 when sea surface temperature were unusually cold perhaps reducing the prey for penguins. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) modern and fossil eggshells and guano samples collected from ornithogenic soils in Terra Nova Bay (Victoria Land, Ross Sea) were processed for carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios with the aim of detecting past penguin dietary changes. A detailed and greatly expanded Adélie penguin dietary record dated back to 7,200 years BP has been reconstructed for the investigated area. Our data indicate a significant dietary shift between fish and krill, with a gradual decrease from past to present time in the proportion of fish compared to krill in Adélie penguin diet. From 7,200 to 2,000 years BP, δ13C and δ15N values indicate fish as the most eaten prey. The dietary contribution of lower-trophic prey in penguin diet started becoming evident not earlier than 2,000 years BP, when the δ13C values reveal a change in the penguin feeding behavior. Modern eggshell and guano samples reveal a major dietary contribution of krill but not a krill-dominated diet, since δ13C values remain much too high if krill prevail in the diet. According to the Holocene environmental background attested for Victoria Land, Adélie penguin dietary shifts between fish and krill seem to reflect penguin paleoecological responses to different paleoenvironmental settings with different conditions of sea-ice extension and persistence. Furthermore, Adélie penguin diet appears to be particularly affected by environmental changes in a very specific period within the breeding season, namely the egg-laying period when penguin dietary and feeding habit shifts are clearly documented by the δ13C of eggshell carbonate. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: The diving behaviour of chick-rearing Adélie penguins of Edmonson Point, Ross Sea, was analysed over two summer seasons (1994-1995 and 1995-1996). In 1994-1995, the study area was characterized by fast-ice persistency throughout season and by higher pack ice concentration than the following year, when fast-ice retreated earlier. Both females' and males' behaviour were examined, and we then compared diving characteristic between years and between guard and crèche stages of chick rearing. We found that changes in fast-ice extent influenced the transit times between colony and foraging grounds and that females conducted longer foraging trips, dived for longer periods and made more dives than males. The diving parameters were affected neither by the sex nor by the year, but differed between the breeding stages. Parents guarding chicks had longer dive and bottom phase durations than in crèche (dive duration: guard = 48 s, crèche = 42 s; bottom duration: guard = 34 s, crèche = 26 s), whilst they had shorter recovery times (e. g. post dive duration) (guard = 29 s, crèche = 32 s). Possible causes for the observed differences in diving behaviours are discussed. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: We describe a long-range migration of a pre-moulting adult chinstrap penguin from Bouvetya, a small relatively recently established colony, to the South Sandwich Islands, where large, established colonies of this species reside. The trip lasted around three weeks, covered ∼3600 km, and the time of arrival was consistent with the annual moult. The bird did not travel along the shortest path or along a constant bearing, but instead followed what appeared to be a series of two or three rhumb lines of constant bearing. Small southward and northward deviations from the general path were consistent with local water currents. Travel speeds were high during daylight but decreased at night, suggesting that resting or opportunistic feeding occurred preferentially at night. While long-range winter migrations of chinstraps to feeding areas in the vicinity of distant colonies have been previously described, this is the first observation of such a trip during the period between breeding and moulting, and the first record of an individual actually arriving at one of these distant colonies. This has implications for understanding population structure and management of this important Southern Ocean predator. © 2009 Antarctic Science Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Historic museum specimens are increasingly used to answer a wide variety of questions in scientific research. Nevertheless, the scientific value of these specimens depends on the authenticity of the data associated with them. Here we use individual-based genetic analyses to demonstrate erroneous locality information for archive specimens from the late nineteenth century. Specifically, using 10 microsatellite markers, we analysed 350 contemporary and 43 historic yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes) specimens from New Zealand's South Island and sub-Antarctic regions. Factorial correspondence analysis and an assignment test strongly suggest that eight of the historic specimens purportedly of sub-Antarctic origin were in fact collected from the South Island. Interestingly, all eight specimens were obtained by the same collector, and all are currently held in the same museum collection. Further inspection of the specimen labels and evaluation of sub-Antarctic voyages did not reveal whether the erroneous data are caused by incorrect labelling or whether deliberate falsification was at play. This study highlights a promising extension to the well-known applications of assignment tests in molecular ecology, which can complement methods that are currently being applied for error detection in specimen data. Our results also serve as a warning to all who use archive specimens to invest time in the verification of collection information. © 2009 The Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Populations of Northern Rockhopper Penguins (Eudyptes moseleyi) are declining, and their breeding success is low compared with that of other species of Eudyptes. We tracked loss of broods and investigated how the response to threats by breeding birds and the density of nests in a colony influence breeding success of Northern Rockhopper Penguins on Gough Island. Brood loss was greatest (33-61%) during incubation and the early chick stage. Most (71%) hatchlings survived to form crèches, and 73% of chicks present during early crèche formation moulted into juvenile plumage. Breeding success was significantly positively correlated with the response to threats by breeding birds and the number of other breeding birds within a 1.5-m radius, a relationship that may be increasingly important in a declining penguin population. © 2010 Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union.

ABSTRACT: Yellow-eyed penguins on Stewart Island were identified with a Leucocytozoon spp. of a novel lineage in association with a high regional incidence of chick mortality (n=32, 100% mortality) during the November 2006 to January 2007 breeding season. Fourteen chicks from Stewart Island were examined post-mortem and histologically for Leucocytozoon infection. In addition, a survey of blood to detect Leucocytozoon spp. infections using PCR was performed on 107 yellow-eyed penguins from 4 distinct nesting areas on the South Island (Oamaru, Otago Peninsula, and Catlins) (n=95), and Stewart Island (n=12). The results of the study revealed that 2 of the 14 (14%) chicks necropsied showed severe, disseminated megaloschizont formation in the liver, spleen, lung, kidney and other tissues characteristic of leucocytozoonosis. Eighty-three percent (83%) of blood samples collected from Stewart Island penguins contained Leucocytozoon DNA, whereas samples from the 3 other nesting areas were negative for the blood parasite. Leucocytozoon spp. DNA sequences isolated from blood and tissues of adults (n=10) and chicks (n=7) were similar and grouped with other published Leucocytozoon spp. sequences but in a distinct cluster together with closely related isolates from a Western march harrier (Circus aerginosus) and common loon (Gavia immer). These findings suggest that yellow-eyed penguins on Stewart Island are infected with a regionally isolated, host-specific Leucocytozoon spp. which may contribute to the high chick mortality observed during this period.

ABSTRACT: Factors that control variability in energy density of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) populations, and the consequences of this variability for growth and fledging mass of Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) chicks, were investigated using an individual-based energetics model. Lipid content as a function of sex/maturity stage and season was used to calculate the energy density of krill ingested by chicks. Simulations tested the influence of variability in krill size-class distribution, sex-ratio, length-at-maturity, and the timing of spawning on krill population energy density and penguin chick fledging mass. Of the parameters included in simulations, variability in the timing of krill spawning had the greatest influence on predicted Adélie penguin fledging mass, with fledging mass decreasing from 3.30 to 2.92 kg when peak spawning was shifted from early December to early March. Adélie penguin chicks that fledge from colonies along the western Antarctic Peninsula (wAP) and survive to recruit into the breeding population are 0.117 kg heavier than those that do not survive to breed. Thus, it appears that small differences in fledging mass potentially have significant implications for Adélie penguin chick survivorship. Therefore, the timing of krill spawning may have important consequences for Adélie penguins, and other top-predator species, that may time critical activities to coincide with a period of dependable prey availability with maximum energy density. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The main characteristics of the PENGUIN-M instrument are given. The instrument has been operating aboard the CORONAS-PHOTON spacecraft (SC) launched into orbit on January 30, 2009. The instrument includes the PENGUIN-MD detector unit (PMD) and the PENGUIN-ME electronic unit (PMD). The purpose of the experiment is to measure the degree of linear polarization of X-ray radiation from solar flares in the energy range of 20-150 keV and to obtain energy spectra of X-ray radiation from solar flares in the energy range of 2-500 keV. The paper describes the instrument, calibration procedure, and in-flight adjustment, and contains the first results of measurements. © 2011 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Long-distance migration enables many organisms to take advantage of lucrative breeding and feeding opportunities during summer at high latitudes and then to move to lower, more temperate latitudes for the remainder of the year. The latitudinal range of the Adélie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) spans ∼22°. Penguins from northern colonies may not migrate, but due to the high latitude of Ross Island colonies, these penguins almost certainly undertake the longest migrations for the species. Previous work has suggested that Adélies require both pack ice and some ambient light at all times of year. Over a three-year period, which included winters of both extensive and reduced sea ice, we investigated characteristics of migratory routes and wintering locations of Adélie Penguins from two colonies of very different size on Ross Island, Ross Sea, the southernmost colonies for any penguin. We acquired data from 3-16 geolocation sensor tags (GLS) affixed to penguins each year at both Cape Royds and Cape Crozier in 2003-2005. Migrations averaged 12 760 km, with the longest being 17600 km, and were in part facilitated by pack ice movement. Trip distances varied annually, but not by colony. Penguins rarely traveled north of the main sea-ice pack, and used areas with high sea-ice concentration, ranging from 75% to 85%, about 500 km inward from the ice edge. They also used locations where there was some twilight (2-7 h with sun <6° below the horizon). We report the present Adélie Penguin migration pattern and conjecture on how it probably has changed over the past ∼12 000 years, as the West Antarctic Ice Sheet withdrew southward across the Ross Sea, a situation that no other Adélie Penguin population has had to confront. As sea ice extent in the Ross Sea sector decreases in the near future, as predicted by climate models, we can expect further changes in the migration patterns of the Ross Sea penguins. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.

ABSTRACT: ARGOS satellite telemetry and Global Location Sensors (geolocators) were used to identify the moult locations and the winter foraging dispersal of Adélie penguins after they left their breeding colonies on Signy Island in the South Orkney Islands. Animals were tracked during the period December 2004 to October 2005. All birds displayed a similar pattern of migratory behaviour, remaining away from colonies for approximately 9 months, at distances of up to 2,235 km. Moult locations were within the pack ice. Mean daily travel speeds to the moult locations were significantly faster when moving through open water than through pack ice. Moult occurred during February/March within a narrow latitudinal range (65-71°S), at a mean distance of 126 km from the ice edge; the mean duration of individual moult was c. 18.6 days. After moult, penguins spent the subsequent winter months moving north or north-eastward within the expanding winter pack ice, at a mean distance of 216 km from the ice edge, and in areas with ice cover >80%. The penguins returned to the vicinity of their colony between September 26 and October 22, 2005. This dependence of Adélie penguins on sea ice habitat suggests that any further reductions in sea ice extent in the Weddell Sea region would potentially have important impacts on the population processes of this pagophilic species. © 2010 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Placing external monitoring devices onto seabirds can have deleterious effects on welfare and performance, and even the most benign marking and identification methods return sparse population data at a huge time and effort cost. Consequently, there is growing interest in methods that minimise disturbance but still allow robust population monitoring. We have developed a computer vision system that automatically creates a unique biometric identifier for individual adult African penguins Spheniscus demersus using natural markings in the chest plumage and matches this against a population database. We tested this non-invasive system in the field at Robben Island, South Africa. False individual identifications of detected penguins occurred in less than 1 in 10 000 comparisons (n = 73 600, genuine acceptance rate = 96.7%) to known individuals. The monitoring capacity in the field was estimated to be above 13% of the birds that passed a camera (n = 1453). A significant increase in this lower bound was recorded under favourable conditions. We conclude that the system is suitable for population monitoring of this species: the demonstrated sensitivity is comparable to computer-aided animal biometric monitoring systems in the literature. A full deployment of the system would identify more penguins than is possible with a complete exploitation of the current levels of flipper banding at Robben Island. Our study illustrates the potential of fully-automated, non-invasive, complete population monitoring of wild animals. © Inter-Res.earch 2010.

ABSTRACT: Marine predators are thought to utilise oceanic features adjusting their foraging strategy in a scale-dependent manner. Thus, they are thought to dynamically alter their foraging behaviour in response to environmental conditions encountered. In this study, we examined the foraging behaviour of King Penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) breeding at South Georgia in relation to predictable and stable oceanographic features. We studied penguins during their long post-laying foraging trips during December 2005 and January 2006. For this investigation, we undertook a simultaneous analysis of ARGOS satellite-tracking data and Mk 7 WildLife Computers Time Depth Recorder (TDR) dive data. To investigate correlations between foraging behaviour and oceanographic conditions, we used SST data from January 2006 from MODIS satellite AQUA. To determine changes in search effort, first passage time (FPT) was calculated; for analysis of dive behaviour, we used several dive parameters that are thought to be reliable indicators of changes in foraging behaviour. King Penguins appeared to target predictable mesoscale features in the Polar Front Zone (PFZ), either a warm-core eddy in the PFZ or regions of strong temperature gradients at oceanic fronts. Two different trip types could be distinguished: direct trips with a straight path to one foraging area at the edge of an eddy or at a thermal front, and circular trips where birds foraged along strong thermal gradients at the northern limit of the PFZ. It is likely that both trip types were a direct consequence of prey encounter rates and distributions, both of which are likely to be associated with these oceanographic features. Circular trips often included passages across the centre of an eddy where birds made deep foraging dives, but remained only a short time in the eddy, possibly because prey were too deep. All birds showed Area Restricted Search (ARS) at scales of <10 km. The two trip types had different ARS patterns, with clear ARS hotspots for direct trips and several ARS hotspots over the whole duration of the trip for circular trips. Dive behaviour had clear relationships with the changing water temperature and the time of day, presumably in response to different prey distribution. Especially for direct trips, dive behaviour showed significant differences within and outside of ARS hotspots. Thus, King Penguins appear to target predictable mesoscale features in the PFZ. They use ARS in different patterns to exploit the environment and adjust their foraging strategy and diving behaviour depending upon conditions they encountered. Diving behaviour showed correlations to ARS patterns, especially for direct trips, which may represent a favourable foraging strategy. The presence of predictable oceanic features allows King Penguins to focus their foraging effort, presumably allowing them to increase their foraging success and decrease their diving effort. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement is a common procedure during eye examinations in birds. Differences in the IOP between avian species have been reported, which suggests the need to establish species-specific reference ranges. To determine IOP values of captive black-footed penguins (Spheniscus demersus), we obtained IOP readings with the use of a rebound tonometer by using two established calibration settings (dog and horse). No difference was seen in the IOP between the left and right eye when the horse setting was used; however, a difference was present when using the dog setting. No significant difference between the IOP of male and female penguins was seen in both eyes when the dog or horse setting was used. Rebound tonometry appears to be a safe and repeatable method to obtain IOP values in black-footed penguins. © 2010 by the Association of Avian Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Summary: 1. Species potentially competing for the same resource are considered to be able to co-exist if they occupy different niches. In an apparent example of this, Adélie, Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins all feed predominantly on krill Euphausea superba at certain sites of sympatry in Antarctica and are proposed to exploit different niche hyper-volumes via differential area and depth utilization. 2. Patterns of foraging for 49 of these penguins breeding in sympatry were assessed using dead-reckoning loggers to examine foraging niche overlap. 3. Area use overlaps were 0·29 for Adélie ∩ Chinstrap, 0·44 for Adélie ∩ Gentoo, and 0·40 for Chinstrap ∩ Adélie and depth use overlaps were 0·69 for Adélie ∩ Chinstrap, 0·48 for Adélie ∩ Gentoo, and 0·52 for Chinstrap ∩ Gentoo Penguins. 4. Foraging efficiency was greatest for Adélie Penguins diving near surface waters (0-15 m) while Chinstraps were most efficient at medium depths (15-60 m) and Gentoo Penguins most efficient at deeper depths (> 60 m). There appear to be physiological reasons for this. Penguins primarily exploited those depths where they were most efficient. 5. The overlap for foraging periods was 0·47 for Adélie ∩ Chinstrap, 0·26 for Adélie ∩ Gentoo, and 0·40 for Chinstrap ∩ Gentoo Penguins. Chinstraps foraged primarily at night, Gentoos during the morning and Adélies in the afternoon. Temporal differences in foraging may result in the three species exploiting krill at those depths where it is best adapted to pursue it, this being mediated by the diel vertical migration of krill. 6. Integration of all measured parameters together gives minimal overlap between species with total overlaps of 0·09 for Adélie ∩ Chinstrap, 0·05 for Adélie ∩ Gentoo, and 0·08 for Chinstrap ∩ Gentoo Penguins so it appears that these penguins conform to conventional theory in avoiding competition in areas of sympatry. However, a model incorporating prey movement between hyper-volumes indicates that penguins may still compete, even in the virtual absence of hyper-volume overlap. 7. This study shows that Pygoscelid penguin do indeed exploit different hypervolumes in areas of sympatry but that such exploitation of different niches by sympatric species feeding on a common resource does not necessarily result in reduced competition if the mobility of prey is high. © 2009 The Author.

ABSTRACT: We present the first detailed description of Perudyptes devriesi, a basal penguin from the middle Eocene (∼42 Ma) Paracas Formation of Peru, and a new analysis of all published extinct penguin species as well as controversial fragmentary specimens. The Perudyptes devriesi holotype includes key regions of the skull and significant postcranial material, thus helping to fill a major phylogenetic and stratigraphic (∼20 million year) gap between the earliest fossil penguins (Waimanu manneringi and Waimanu tuatahi, ∼5861.6 Ma) and the next oldest partial skeletons. Perudyptes devriesi is diagnosable by five autapomorphies: (1) an anteroventrally directed postorbital process, (2) marked anterior expansion of the parasphenoid rostrum, (3) posterior trochlear ridge of the humerus projecting distal to the middle trochlear ridge and conformed as a large, broadly curved surface, (4) convex articular surface for the antitrochanter of the femur, and (5) extremely weak anterior projection of the lateral condyle of the tibiotarsus. The skull of Perudyptes is characterized by deep temporal fossae and an elongate, narrow beak that differs from other reported stem penguins in its short mandibular symphysis. The wing skeleton of Perudyptes preserves a combination of plesiomorphic features also observed in the basal penguin Waimanu and derived features shared with more crownward penguins. Features of the wing optimized as primitive for Sphenisciformes include retention of a discrete dorsal supracondylar tubercle on the humerus and presence of a modestly projected pisiform process on the carpometacarpus. Derived features present in Perudyptes and all more crownward penguins, but absent in Waimanu, include a more flattened humerus, development of a trochlea for the tendon of m. scapulotriceps at the distal end of the humerus, and bowing of the anterior face of the carpometacarpus. A combined molecular and morphological dataset for Spheniciformes was expanded by adding 25 osteological and soft tissue characters as well as 11 taxa. In agreement with previous results, Perudyptes devriesi is identified as one of the most basal members of Sphenisciformes. This analysis also confirms the placement of the middle/late Miocene (∼1113 Ma) fossil Spheniscus muizoni as a member of the Spheniscus clade and places the late Miocene (∼10 Ma) Madrynornis mirandus as sister taxon to extant Eudyptes. These two species, known from relatively complete partial skeletons, are the oldest crown clade penguin fossils and represent well-corroborated temporal calibration points for the Spheniscus-Eudyptula divergence and Megadyptes-Eudyptes divergence, respectively. Our results reaffirm that the Miocene penguin taxon Palaeospheniscus, recently proposed to represent a member of the crown radiation, belongs outside of the crown clade Spheniscidae. The phylogenetic positions of small Eocene Antarctic penguin taxa (Delphinornis, Marambiornis, and Mesetaornis) recently proposed as possible direct ancestors to crown Spheniscidae were further evaluated using alternate coding strategies for incorporating scorings from isolated elements that preserve critical morphologies and are thought to represent these taxa, although they cannot yet be reliably assigned to individual species. Under all scoring regimes, Delphinornis, Marambiornis, and Mesetaornis were recovered as distantly related to Spheniscidae. Using synapomorphies identified in the primary analysis, we evaluated the phylogenetic position of fragmentary specimens, including the holotypes of valid but poorly known species, specimens currently unassignable to the species level, and morphologically distinct specimens that have not yet been named. All pre-Miocene specimens can be excluded from Spheniscidae based on presence of plesiomorphies lost in all crown penguins, consistent with a recent radiation for the penguin crown clade. This study provides additional support for a scenario of penguin evolution characterized by an origin of flightlessness near the K-T boundary, dispersal throughout the Southern Hemisphere during the early Paleogene, and a late Cenozoic origin for the crown clade Spheniscidae. Stratigraphic distribution and phylogenetic relationships of fossil penguins are consistent with distinct radiations during the Eocene, Oligocene, and Miocene. While the Eocene and Oligocene penguin faunas are similar in many respects, the Miocene fauna is characterized by smaller average size and novel cranial morphologies, suggesting that an ecological shift in diet occurred close to the origin of crown Spheniscidae. © American Museum of Natural History 2010.

ABSTRACT: All crested penguins present a unique reversed hatching asynchrony: the larger second-laid egg (B-egg) hatches before the smaller first-laid egg (A-egg). Although both eggs often hatch, the A-chick generally dies of starvation within days after hatching. However, within rockhopper penguins, the population at the Falkland Islands is unique in that some birds manage to raise both chicks. Although it has been suggested that the egg size dimorphism between A- and B-eggs may explain how long both eggs and chicks survive, this hypothesis has never been explicitly tested. We expect that both eggs are retained longer in the less dimorphic clutches than in the more dimorphic ones. In this paper, we have compiled egg measurements for three rockhopper penguin species (Eudyptes chrysocome, E. filholi and E. moseleyi) in order to compare the intra-clutch egg size dimorphism among these species. Furthermore, we have collected new data to compare egg size dimorphism between two populations of E. chrysocome (Falkland Islands versus Staten Island). A-egg volumes are more variable between species and populations than B-egg volumes. E. chrysocome and especially the population from the Falkland Islands produces the largest A-eggs and the least dimorphic eggs. Nevertheless, as differences in A-egg volumes between species and between the populations of Falkland Islands and Staten Island are stronger and more significant than differences in egg dimorphism, we suggest that A-egg volume, more than egg dimorphism, could be one of the factors influencing the prevalence of twins. A large A-egg and/or reduced egg dimorphism is probably necessary to enable rockhopper penguins to raise two chicks, but other reasons may also be involved which enable them to keep both eggs and chicks. © 2009 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: We report excavations of an abandoned penguin colony on Byers Peninsula, Livingston Island, Antarctica, in austral summer 2008/2009. Nine abandoned pebble mounds were located on Devils Point, near an active Gentoo Penguin (Pygoscelis papua) colony of about 3,000 nests, at an elevation of 40-45 m above sea level. Three of the nine mounds were excavated to recover organic remains for radiocarbon and ancient DNA analyses; two additional mounds were probed to obtain tissue samples for additional dating. All radiocarbon dates were corrected for the marine-carbon reservoir effect using a ΔR of 700 ± 50 years. Calibrated 2-sigma ranges in calendar years before present (B. P.) on 23 samples of egg membrane and bone provided an overall range of 40-1,150 B. P., with most of the dates falling between 225 and 465 B. P. Ancient DNA analysis confirmed that the tissues recovered from these excavations represent Gentoo Penguin. One radiocarbon date from the active Gentoo Penguin colony indicated an age of 285-480 B. P. for the initiation of this current occupation and corresponding in age with most of the abandoned mounds. Although geologic evidence indicates that Byers Peninsula has been ice free for at least 3,000 years, these results indicate that penguin occupation lagged behind deglaciation by over 2,000 years. Small numbers of Chinstrap Penguins (P. antarctica) also occupy the same breeding colonies as Gentoo Penguins at Byers Peninsula, but their absence in the ancient sediments suggests that they have only recently colonized this area. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: The incidental capture in fisheries is probably the main conservation problem affecting seabirds. While the capture of albatrosses and petrels on longline hooks is well-known worldwide, the bycatch of diving seabirds in gillnets is an overlooked conservation problem. During a winter coastal fishing trip, the capture of Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) was recorded in driftnet and bottom setnet fisheries for the first time in southern Brazil. The highest captures rates were found in driftnets, from 146.5 to 545.5penguins/km2 of net and a total of 56 dead penguins were recorded. In the bottom gillnet, a total of 12 birds were killed and the capture rates varied from 41.7 to 125.0penguins/km2 of net. Although preliminary, the results presented in this paper were consistent between sets. If we consider the magnitude of driftnet and setnet fishing fleets, and that most dead penguins were adults, the impact upon Magellanic penguin populations is probably significant. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: A temperature-defined regime shift occurred in the 1970s in the southern Indian Ocean, with simultaneous severe decreases in many predator populations. We tested a possible biological link between the regime shift and predator declines by measuring historic and contemporary feather isotopic signatures of seven penguin species with contrasted foraging strategies and inhabiting a large latitudinal range. We first showed that contemporary penguin isotopic variations and chlorophyll a concentration were positively correlated, suggesting the usefulness of predator δ13C values to track temporal changes in the ecosystem carrying capacity and its associated coupling to consumers. Having controlled for the Suess effect and for increase CO2 in seawater, δ13C values of Antarctic penguins and of king penguins did not change over time, while δ13C of other subantarctic and subtropical species were lower in the 1970s. The data therefore suggest a decrease in ecosystem carrying capacity of the southern Indian Ocean during the temperature regime-shift in subtropical and subantarctic waters but not in the vicinity of the Polar Front and in southward high-Antarctic waters. The resulting lower secondary productivity could be the main driving force explaining the decline of subtropical and subantarctic (but not Antarctic) penguins that occurred in the 1970s. Feather δ13N values did not show a consistent temporal trend among species, suggesting no major change in penguins' diet. This study highlights the usefulness of developing long-term tissue sampling and data bases on isotopic signature of key marine organisms to track potential changes in their isotopic niches and in the carrying capacity of the environment. © 2011 Jaeger, Cherel.

ABSTRACT: We inferred late Holocene Adélie penguin occupation history and population dynamics on Zolotov Island, Vestfold Hills, Antarctica, using geochemical data from a dated ornithogenic sediment core (ZOL4). Radiocarbon dates on fossil penguin bones in the core indicate that Adélie penguins occupied the island as early as 1,800 years before present (yr BP), following the retreat of the Sørsdal glacier. This occupation began ~1,200 years later than that observed at Ardley Island and King George Island, in the South Shetland Islands. Phosphorus was identified as the most indicative bio-element for penguin guano in core ZOL4, and was used to infer past penguin population dynamics. Around 1,800 years ago, the Adélie penguin populations at both Zolotov Island and Ardley Island increased rapidly and reached their highest levels ~1,000 yr BP. For the past ~900 years, the penguin populations at Zolotov Island have shown a general rising trend, with fluctuations, while those at Ardley Island have shown a moderate decreasing trend. The Adélie penguin populations at both Ardley Island and Zolotov Island showed a clear decline ~300 years ago, which we interpret as a response to the Little Ice Age, or a neoglacial cooling event. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

ABSTRACT: On 20 and 22 January 2007, we observed macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus) on Avian Island, Antarctica, approximately 1° south of the Antarctic Circle along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) near Adelaide Island, a new high-latitude observational record for the species within this region of the continent. Additionally, we report several extra-limital sightings of macaroni penguins over the last decade at relatively lower latitudes along the WAP near Anvers Island, including observations of breeding attempts. Although vagrancy cannot be ruled out as a possible causal factor in our observations, we hypothesize that a climate-induced shift in the species' bio-geographic range may be in progress. In this context, our observations are similar to the well-documented range shifts and eventual establishment of breeding populations by other sub-Antarctic penguin species along the WAP, over the last three decades, in response to regional climate warming. We highlight that the few observations reported here do not provide conclusive evidence for any putative causal mechanism explaining the presence of macaroni penguins at locations outside their natural geographic range. However, our observations are important for developing a better understanding of the natural history of the species along the WAP. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: This work describes a parametric bootstrap model for standardising animal count data to a common reference point of breeding chronology for species with a complex temporal function of sampling availability. ICESCAPE (Integrating Count Effort by Seasonally Correcting Animal Population Estimates) is a suite of routines that implements a general abundance estimator accounting for availability bias, detection bias and sampling fractions less than unity. Within this resampling framework, all reported measures of uncertainty associated with originally published counts are propagated through to the final adjusted estimates. Adjustment for availability bias is achieved by applying an adjustment factor based on independently measured time series of availability throughout a breeding season. Such time series are typically collected at only a limited number of sites, so surrogate availability information for a site is used when none exists. Importantly, a common standardisation procedure allows site-specific estimates to be aggregated to achieve region-scale population estimates. By way of illustration, the method is applied to several examples of published studies of Adélie penguin abundance at breeding sites in Antarctica. These examples focus on adjusting counts of adults to an effective number of breeding pairs, although the software has been developed to accommodate adjustment and aggregation of other count objects typical for penguin species, such as occupied nest or chick counts. While tailored for Adélie penguins, the method and implementation is sufficiently general to be easily adapted for other colonial land-breeding species showing seasonal variation in availability to sampling methodology.

ABSTRACT: Penguins (Aves: Spheniscidae) are pelagic, flightless seabirds, restricted to the southern hemisphere (Antarctic and sub-Antarctic areas, New Zealand, Australia, and nearby islands, as well as parts of South America and South Africa). They spend much of their life at sea, but return to islands and coasts to breed. Penguins are terrestrial as juveniles and aquatic as adults. To improve hydrodynamics, penguins tuck in their necks while swimming. They thus attain an "ichthyosaur" or "cetacean" body shape: characterised by telescoped cervicals. This mechanism is also used on land, associated with the posture of these birds. Our study of neck structure and cervical vertebrae morphology (morphological description, biometry and contour analysis) of the King Penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus), Gentoo Penguin (Pygoscelis papua), Macaroni Penguin (Eudyptes chrysolophus) and Humboldt Penguin (Sphensicus humboldti) shows a highly specialised fitting in adults, which develops during ontogenesis. The growth of penguins proceeds by stages and there are key stages with regard to the design of the neck. Despite a common main structure, some characteristics vary between species. Distribution of cervical vertebrae can be defined by six modules. There are differences in modularity between species and also within species between different ontogenetical phases. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: Southern Rockhopper Penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome) have a strongly synchronised breeding cycle with a fixed pattern of nest attendance for males and females. We studied leucocyte profiles and the development of granulocyte/lymphocyte (G/L) ratios as an indicator of stress. Variation in G/L ratios were related to sex and breeding stage, but not individual body condition. G/L ratios were similar for males and females during the first part of the incubation period ("shared incubation", when males and females both attend the nest), but in the second part of the incubation ("single incubation", only one adult attends the nest), females had significantly higher G/L ratios and a lower body condition than males. The lowest G/L ratios were recorded during the crèche of the chicks at the end of the breeding season. Our results show that G/L ratios in breeding Southern Rockhopper Penguins on the population-scale reflect the temporally and sexually different timing of fasting and refeeding related to the breeding cycle. However, this measurement was not sensitive enough to reveal an effect of body condition on G/L ratios on an individual scale. © 2011 Dt. Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.

ABSTRACT: The number of African penguins Spheniscus demersus breeding in South Africa collapsed from about 56 000 pairs in 2001 to some 21 000 pairs in 2009, a loss of 35 000 pairs (>60%) in eight years. This reduced the global population to 26 000 pairs, when including Namibian breeders, and led to classification of the species as Endangered. In South Africa, penguins breed in two regions, the Western Cape and Algoa Bay (Eastern Cape), their breeding localities in these regions being separated by c. 600 km. Their main food is anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus and sardine Sardinops sagax, which are also the target of purse-seine fisheries. In Algoa Bay, numbers of African penguins halved from 21 000 pairs in 2001 to 10 000 pairs in 2003. In the Western Cape, numbers decreased from a mean of 35 000 pairs in 2001-2005 to 11 000 pairs in 2009. At Dassen Island, the annual survival rate of adult penguins decreased from 0.70 in 2002/2003 to 0.46 in 2006/2007; at Robben Island it decreased from 0.77 to 0.55 in the same period. In both the Western and Eastern Cape provinces, long-term trends in numbers of penguins breeding were significantly related to the combined biomass of anchovy and sardine off South Africa. However, recent decreases in the Western Cape were greater than expected given a continuing high abundance of anchovy. In this province, there was a south-east displacement of prey around 2000, which led to a mismatch in the distributions of prey and the western breeding localities of penguins. © NISC (Pty) Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Data on population size and breeding success of Gentoo Penguins Pygoscelis papua at the Falkland Islands have been collected since 1990 as part of the Falkland Islands Seabird Monitoring Programme FISMP. During the austral summer of 2005/2006, the third five-yearly survey of all Gentoo Penguins breeding in the Falklands Archipelago was undertaken. Results are presented and compared to previous population estimates. The number of breeding pairs in 2005/2006 was estimated at 65,857, a decline of 42% since 2000, which was attributed largely to paralytic shellfish poisoning resulting from a harmful algal bloom event in 2002. Based on a selected number of colonies that were monitored annually, the population increased by over 95% since 2005, and numbered a record high of some 128,500 breeding pairs in 2008. On average, annual breeding success was 1.01 ranging between 0.51 and 1.44 chicks per breeding pair. Although no particular trend was evident, breeding success was above average between 2004 and 2008 which is likely to contribute towards future population growth.

ABSTRACT: A feather-loss disorder, first observed in captive African Penguin (Spheniscus demersus) chicks in a South African rehabilitation center in 2006, was found one year later in wild Magellanic Penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) chicks in four colonies in Argentina. Two years later, it was found in African Penguin chicks in the wild. The featherless African Penguin chicks in the rehabilitation center (N = 176) lost their down and emerging juvenile feathers, remaining featherless for several weeks until they died (N = 31) or grew juvenile (N = 3) or adult plumage (N = 145) before being released. The featherless African Penguin chicks took 16 days longer to reach the rehabilitation center's standards for release than feathered chicks (t 176 = -8.8, P < 0.00001). Likewise, the featherless wild Magellanic Penguin chicks (N = 13) lost their second coat of down, remaining featherless for several weeks; but those that survived to fledging all grew normal juvenile plumage (N = 4). Featherless Magellanic Penguin chicks grew more slowly and were smaller at fledgling age than most feathered chicks. The disorder in Africa and Argentina is new, rare, and more common in a rehabilitation center in Africa than in the wild. The cause of the feather loss is unknown, but the disorder results in slower growth, smaller fledglings, and appears to increase mortality in Magellanic Penguin chicks in the wild.

ABSTRACT: No-take zones may protect populations of targeted marine species and restore the integrity of marine ecosystems, but it is unclear whether they benefit top predators that rely on mobile pelagic fishes. In South Africa, foraging effort of breeding African penguins decreased by 30 per cent within three months of closing a 20 km zone to the competing purse-seine fisheries around their largest colony. After the fishing ban, most of the penguins from this island had shifted their feeding effort inside the closed area. Birds breeding at another colony situated 50 km away, whose fishing grounds remained open to fishing, increased their foraging effort during the same period. This demonstrates the immediate benefit of a relatively small no-take zone for a marine top predator relying on pelagic prey. Selecting such small protected areas may be an important first conservation step, minimizing stakeholder conflicts and easing compliance, while ensuring benefit for the ecosystems within these habitats. © 2010 The Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: New methods are presented for the collection and development of data to adjust counts of Adélie penguins made at any time in the breeding season to an estimate of the breeding population. The development of 'availability adjustment factors' involves the collection of time-series counts of population objects, such as adults, nests or chicks, throughout the breeding season and standardisation of the time series to a reference point one week after the peak in egg laying, consistent with Standard Method A3 of the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program (CEMP). Remotely operating cameras were used to obtain time-series counts of adults and nests, while time-series counts of chicks were obtained manually. Standardised time series were modelled using a generalised additive model framework to allow interpolation across days when no counts were available and to provide a formal estimate of uncertainty around the average function. The method is illustrated using data collected at the Béchervaise Island CEMP site in 2007/08. Estimates of the breeding population obtained by adjusting a one-off count using availability adjustment factors will not account for penguins that left the breeding site prior to the reference point because their breeding attempt failed, breeding-age penguins that failed to return to the breeding site in that breeding season, nor pre-breeding penguins. The abundance of these components of the population can only be estimated through alternative methods such as mark-recapture of individually tagged birds. Given the paucity of adjustment data in the literature, further collection of availability adjustment data across space and time is recommended.

ABSTRACT: Penguin colony is one of the Earth's simplest ecosystems. As the seabird with the largest population in Antarctica, penguin is a unique indicator of Antarctic environment and climate changes. In this study, we collected an ornithogenic sediment core from Gardner Island in Vestfold Hills, East Antarctica, reconstructed an 8,500 years variation history of penguin population and vegetation abundance on this island, and examined the evolution of the penguin colony. We used the levels of two molecular markers cholesterol and cholestanol as the proxy indicators of penguin population size. Other molecular markers, including C24:0 alkenoic acid, C18n-alkanol and phytol were used as the proxy indicators of aquatic moss, algae, and general vegetation, respectively. It is shown that the growth of algae was mainly affected by the nutritional supply from penguin droppings, so their abundance was positively linked with penguin population. The growth of aquatic moss, however, was controlled more by the degree of water body transparency than by nutrient availability. Because the pollution of water body increased as penguin population grew, aquatic moss abundance showed a seesaw-like relationship with penguin population. These results suggested that penguins played a dominant role in this simple ecosystem in the Antarctic environment. The reconstructed relationship between penguin population and vegetation abundance may offer new insights to understand ancient Antarctic environment and ecology. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: The alternation of short/coastal and long/pelagic foraging trips has been proposed as a strategy for seabirds to reconcile self-feeding and parental care. Both types of foraging trips may result in different foraging efforts and diet qualities, and consequently are likely to modify the oxidative status of seabirds. We examined the relationship between the oxidative status of Adélie penguins and (i) the duration of their foraging trips and (ii) their plasma δ13C values reflecting their spatial distribution. The oxidative status did not correlate with the foraging trip duration but with the δ13C values: high values being associated with high levels of oxidative damage. This relationship is likely to be related to the prey properties of penguins as both parameters are largely determined by the diet. Two non-exclusive hypotheses can be proposed to explain this relationship: (i) penguins foraging in coastal areas feed on a diet enriched in 13C and depleted in antioxidant compounds; (ii) birds with low antioxidant capacity are constrained to forage in coastal areas. Our study is the first to show that the adoption of different foraging strategies is associated with different levels of oxidative stress. However, further studies are needed to investigate the underlying mechanisms of this intriguing relationship. © 2009 The Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: It has been predicted that geometrically similar animals would swim at the same speed with stroke frequency scaling with mass-1/3. In the present study, morphological and behavioural data obtained from free-ranging penguins (seven species) were compared. Morphological measurements support the geometrical similarity. However, cruising speeds of 1.8-2.3m s-1 were significantly related to mass0.08 and stroke frequencies were proportional to mass-0.29. These scaling relationships do not agree with the previous predictions for geometrically similar animals. We propose a theoretical model, considering metabolic cost, work against mechanical forces (drag and buoyancy), pitch angle and dive depth. This new model predicts that: (i) the optimal swim speed, which minimizes the energy cost of transport, is proportional to (basal metabolic rate/drag)1/3 independent of buoyancy, pitch angle and dive depth; (ii) the optimal speed is related to mass0.05; and (iii) stroke frequency is proportional to mass -0.28. The observed scaling relationships of penguins support these predictions, which suggest that breath-hold divers swam optimally to minimize the cost of transport, including mechanical and metabolic energy during dive. © 2009 The Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: While studies of mate choice based on male color pattern are ubiquitous, studies of mate choice based on ornamental color traits in sexually monomorphic species are less common. We conducted manipulative field experiments on two color ornaments of king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus), the size of auricular patches of orange feathers and degree of UV reflectance from beak spots, to determine how the degree of ornamentation influenced pairing rate. In a reduction of auricular patch size, females paired significantly more quickly than males in both control and experimental samples. When this bias was taken into account statistically, pairing of individuals with reduced auricular patches was significantly delayed. We also reduced, but did not eliminate, UV reflectance from beak spots by applying a UV filter; no sex difference in pairing rate was evident in this experiment. Treated birds paired significantly more slowly than untreated control individuals, taking more than a week longer to pair on average than their unmanipulated counterparts, a result that was significant for males and approached significance for females. Our results may indicate mutual mate choice via UV reflectance of the beak spot. Given that this is a species where breeding is extremely slow and considerable investment by both males and females is required for successful reproduction, our results support the hypothesis that in such species, sexual selection might act on the same ornament in both sexes. © 2010 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

ABSTRACT: During a survey of seals in September and October 2009 at Gough Island, South Atlantic Ocean, we recorded goose barnacles (Lepas australis) attached to the pelage of two of the 12 elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) inspected and one of the seven vagrant Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) which were found amongst the resident Subantarctic fur seals (A. tropicalis). We also recorded a goose barnacle attached to a Northern rockhopper penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome moseleyi).

ABSTRACT: Off the coast of South Africa, the 2 most important prey items for African penguins Spheniscus demersus are sardine Sardinops sagax and anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus, species heavily exploited by commercial fisheries. At Dassen Island, the proportion of burrows occupied for breeding by African penguins from 1995 to 2008 was affected positively by the interaction between the overall biomass of sardine and anchovy. However, sardine had a positive effect while anchovy had a negative one. This unexpected negative relationship may result from a reduced local availability of anchovy linked to the fishing effort that continued to be focussed in the vicinity of Dassen Island, while the growing anchovy stock experienced an eastward shift away from Dassen Island in recent years, creating a spatial mismatch between penguin and available anchovy. A decrease of the Southern Oscillation Index tended to advance the onset of penguins' breeding, as did an increase in sea surface temperature (SST) at the sardine and anchovy spawning grounds. An increase in SST at the nursery and spawning areas tended to decrease the penguin per capita growth rate. Earlier breeding resulted in decreased chick production, possibly because it created a temporal mismatch between chick rearing and winter availability of young-of-the-year anchovy and sardine along South Africa's west coast. The local abundance of prey is more important for breeding African penguins than overall fish abundance. Consequently, management of the purse-seine fishery should be adjusted spatially in order to ensure adequate local food supplies for breeding African penguins. © Inter-Research 2010.

ABSTRACT: Petermann Island (65°10′S, 64°10′W), one of the Antarctic Peninsula's most frequently visited locations, is at the epicenter of a rapid shift in which an Adélie penguin dominated fauna is becoming gentoo penguin dominated. Over the course of five seasons, the breeding productivity of Adélie and gentoo penguins breeding at Petermann Island were monitored to identify drivers of this rapid community change. The impact of tourist visitation on breeding success was also investigated. Consistent with larger trends in this region, the Adélie penguin population decreased by 29% and the gentoo penguin population increased by 27% between the 2003/2004 and 2007/2008 seasons. Reproductive success among Adélie penguins ranged from 1.09 to 1.32 crèched chicks/nest, which was higher than or comparable to other sites and is an unlikely explanation for the precipitous decline of Adélie penguins at Petermann Island. Whereas gentoo penguin reproductive success was lowest in colonies frequently visited by tourists, Adélie penguin colonies frequently visited by tourists had higher reproductive success than those visited only occasionally. These results are placed in the context of other studies on reproductive success and the impact of tourist visitation on breeding colonies of Adélie and gentoo penguins. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: Pteria penguin is an important commercial bivalve species that is used in the production of half pearls known as mabè. Expansion of this industry in places with low natural spatfall is reliant on hatchery production of juvenile oysters, which begins with the incubation of fertilized eggs. This study addresses the issue of mortality during egg incubation by examining the effects of egg stocking density and the application of antibiotics. A factorial experimental design was implemented combining 3 egg densities (10, 50, and 100/mL) and 3 antibiotic treatments (control, no antibiotic; 5 mg/mL streptomycin-sulfate; 5 mg/mL tetracycline-erythromycin 2.5:2.5 mg/mL). Antibiotics were added to the culture medium as a single dose and fertilized eggs were incubated for an industry standard period of 24 h. Despite a 23% increase in mean survival during incubation, aquaria treated with tetracycline-erythromycin (1:1) yielded an average of only 9% more veliger larvae than control aquaria as a result of interference with development during the transition of trochophore to shelled larvae (D-stage). Application of the antibiotic streptomycin-sulfate improved mean survival by 16% compared with control aquaria, without significantly compromising development. A high egg density of 100/mL did not significantly reduce survival, but resulted in a 5% reduction in normal development to D-stage. The results of this study show that if tank space is limited during egg incubation, utilizing a high stocking density of 100 eggs/mL will provide the greatest number of D-stage larvae. However, if the supply of eggs is limited, we recommend stocking P. penguin eggs at a density ≤50/mL and minimizing mortality by treating the culture medium with the antibiotic streptomycin-sulfate.

ABSTRACT: King penguins Aptenodytes patagonicus are known to change their diving behaviour in response to changes in both prey location and their breeding status through the early stages of the breeding cycle (austral summer and autumn). However, little information exists on whether and how these changes affect the energy expenditure of such behaviour. By deploying heart rate and hydro-static pressure data loggers, we investigated detailed changes in the dive time budgeting of king penguins during foraging dives across the breeding season, in the same individuals, and the associated changes in estimated oxygen consumption during those dives. Maximum dive depth, duration, bottom duration, feeding events (indicated by wiggles) per dive and post-dive duration increased through the study period. While a foraging dive later in the breeding season was energetically more costly than a dive earlier in the season, the overall rate of energy expenditure did not change, nor did energy cost per unit prey capture. These findings indicate an ability of king penguins to adjust their foraging dive behaviours through the summer and autumn without affecting the energetic costs of diving to capture prey. Such plasticity may be necessary to compensate for changes both in prey location and abundance, and in the energy requirements of the chick over time. Copyright © 2010 Inter-Research.

ABSTRACT: Communities of helminths are known to be related to feeding behaviors of hosts. While climate change and overfishing can impact food availability for Antarctic piscivorous predators, knowledge about infectious and parasitic diseases among Antarctic species is scarce or fragmentary. We studied the helminth community of King penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) from the Crozet Archipelago, the main breeding area of the species. Based on a sample of 41 individuals found freshly dead from predation or starvation, the gastrointestinal helminth community in King penguins was composed of 1 species of cestode (Tetrabothrius wrighti) and 2 species of nematodes (Tetrameres wetzeli and Contracaecumheardi). Cestodes formed the core of the helminth community (97.5% of worms collected) with a prevalence of infestation of 100% and a mean intensity of 178.6 worms per host. Sources of infestation and pathologies caused by these worms are also discussed. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: How top avian predators are distributed at sea during the inter-breeding period remains poorly known Here we focused on the pelagic seabird that is the single greatest avian consumer of marine resources the macaroni penguin Our aims were (1) to investigate where these penguins are distributed whilst at sea during winter, and (2) to determine how their distribution and trophic ecology varies in 1 colony between successive years and between 2 colonies from neighbouring localities at the same time We surveyed a total of 30 penguins from Crozet and Kerguelen Islands (southern Indian Ocean) Penguins from Kerguelen were tracked in 2006 and 2007, and those from Crozet in 2007 Habitat use was investigated using miniaturised light-based geolocators, and trophic ecology by the use of stable isotope analyses Results showed large-scale patterns of distribution over deep oceanic waters of the Polar Frontal Zone characterised by a temperature of 30 to 35°C during July Birds from Kerguelen had a consistent inter-annual winter distribution at the population level Birds tracked from Crozet were distributed in distinct areas, separate from the birds from Kerguelen Trophic ecology (blood δ15N value) was very similar between years and colonies, and indicated that these penguins preyed upon low trophic level prey, most probably swarming crustaceans, at the end of winter We conclude that inter-annual fidelity in winter habitat provides evidence of highly favourable and predictable foraging areas, while the distinct inter-colony distributions suggest very heterogeneous distribution of profitable feeding areas for this species in the southern Indian Ocean © Inter-Research 2011.

ABSTRACT: The nature of how behaviour at one time step influences the next is of great interest to behavioural ecologists, but rarely used for comparisons between animals. Time depth recorders (TDR) and other archival tags have been widely used to infer patterns of diving and foraging. However, while we can extract variables that describe individual dives, how runs of dives may indicate behaviours and how one dive influences the next are not fully understood. Treating TDR data as time series, we examined patterns of autocorrelation to investigate structure in the timing of behaviour. We fitted an oscillating best-fit curve to the autocorrelation and used the parameters of this curve to investigate differences in foraging strategy of 129 macaroni penguins, Eudyptes chrysolophus, of both sexes. We found interannual differences in autocorrelation parameters as well as differences between reproductive stages. In contrast to other studies of macaroni penguin diving based on depth analysis, we found no differences between the sexes. We mimicked changes in the various parameters by simulation of dive profiles, and used these to infer biological meaning from the parameters. As this technique makes very few assumptions about how to identify a dive or cluster of dives, we suggest that it is a useful first characterization of diving or cyclical behaviour in a wide range of animals. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: For land-breeding marine organisms such as seabirds, knowledge about their habitat use has mainly been gained through studies of breeding individuals that are constrained to return frequently to their breeding grounds. In this study we set out to measure whether: a) habitat selection in the non-breeding period predicts habitat selection in the breeding period, and b) whether breeding individuals concentrated their activity on the closest suitable habitats. Macaroni Eudyptes chrysolophus and gentoo Pygoscelis papua penguins, two marine predators with contrasting foraging strategies, were tracked from the Iles Kerguelen and their habitat selection investigated through Mahalanobis distances factorial analysis. This study presents the first data about gentoo penguins juvenile dispersal. For both species, results showed 6.9 times larger maximum ranges and up to 12.2 times greater distances travelled during the non-breeding period. Habitat suitability maps suggested both species made similar environmental selections whatever the period. Macaroni penguins targeted pelagic areas beyond the shelf break while gentoo penguins always remained over the shelf. We consider the ecological significance of larger scale movements made outside the breeding period and suggest that this non-breeding period is of particular interest when attempting to understand an animal's habitat selection. © 2011 Antarctic Science Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Crested penguins (genus Eudyptes) present a unique reversed egg-size dimorphism and hatching asynchrony, with the larger second-laid egg (B-egg) hatching before the smaller first-laid egg (A-egg). Both a higher water vapour conductance and parental favouritism during incubation could explain the shorter incubation period for the B-egg than for the A-egg. Because the incubation period is increased by the presence of a sibling for A-eggs, but not for B-eggs, and because both egg categories have the same incubation period when they are incubated alone, it has been suggested that the difference in incubation period was largely driven by the parental favouritism for B-eggs during incubation. We tested whether A- and B-eggs show a difference in laying density, density at the beginning of incubation and in density decrease during incubation according to the presence of a sibling. Although density at the start of incubation was significantly higher for B-eggs than for A-eggs, the decrease in density during incubation had the same slope for both egg categories. Moreover, the presence of a sibling did not influence densities. We additionally provide two equations that allow the back-dating of laying dates for a clutch of SouthernRockhopper Penguin (Eudyptes c. chrysocome) and we discuss the precision of the method (3.04 ± 2.29 days for A-eggs and 2.73 ± 2.10 days for B-eggs) for penguins which are increasingly being used as marine environmental sentinels. © 2010 Dt.

ABSTRACT: Despite their strong dependence on the pelagic environment, seabirds and other top predators in polar marine ecosystems are generally studied during their reproductive phases in terrestrial environments. As a result, a significant portion of their life history is understudied which in turn has led to limited understanding. Recent advances in autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) technologies have allowed satellite-tagged Adélie penguins to guide AUV surveys of the marine environment at the Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site on the western Antarctic Peninsula. Near real-time data sent via Iridium satellites from the AUVs to a centralized control center thousands of miles away allowed scientists to adapt AUV sampling strategies to meet the changing conditions of the subsurface. Such AUV data revealed the water masses and fine-scale features associated with Adélie penguin foraging trips. During this study, the maximum concentration of chlorophyll was between 30 and 50m deep. Encompassing this peak in the chlorophyll concentration, within the water-column, was a mixture of nutrient-laden Upper Circumpolar Deep (UCDW) and western Antarctic Peninsula winter water (WW). Together, data from the AUV survey and penguin dives reveal that 54 of foraging by Adélie penguins occurs immediately below the chlorophyll maximum. These data demonstrate how bringing together emerging technologies, such as AUVs, with established methods such as the radio-tagging of penguins can provide powerful tools for monitoring and hypothesis testing of previously inaccessible ecological processes. Ocean and atmosphere temperatures are expected to continue increasing along the western Antarctic Peninsula, which will undoubtedly affect regional marine ecosystems. New and emerging technologies such as unmanned underwater vehicles and individually mounted satellite tracking devices will provide the tools critical to documenting and understanding the widespread ecological change expected in polar regions. © The Author 2010.

ABSTRACT: The purpose of this study was to examine the validity of albumin determinations in penguin plasma by the bromcresol green (BCG) method and the gold standard of protein electrophoresis (EPH). Plasma from 96 clinically normal and abnormal penguins (Spheniscus species) was analyzed. The 2 methods did not yield equivalent results. The BCG method underestimated the albumin level in samples from normal patients (indicated by a normal albumin-globulin ratio) and overestimated the albumin level in samples from clinically abnormal penguins (indicated by a decreased albumin-globulin ratio). After EPH of plasma samples from clinically abnormal penguins samples was performed to separate albumin and globulin fractions, the globulins exhibited marked binding to the BCG dye. There were no significant differences between the variable reaction of paired serum and plasma samples when using the BCG method. These results demonstrated marked differences in the determination of albumin levels when using the BCG method and protein EPH. They further demonstrated that the BCG method can provide erroneous results, which have the potential to significantly impact clinical diagnosis and treatment. This study confirmed findings from previous studies in other avian species that the BCG method yields unreliable results in avian species. It is our conclusion that the BCG method, commonly found on automated analyzers in commercial laboratories and on point-of-care analyzers, should not be used to determine albumin concentration in avian samples. © 2011 Association of Avian Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Where life-history stages overlap, there is the potential for physiological conflicts that might be important in mediating carryover effects. However, our knowledge of the specific physiological mechanisms underlying carryover effects remains rudimentary, and specific examples remain rare. Here we show that female macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus) initiate vitellogenesis and yolk formation while at sea during return migrations to breeding colonies; yolk formation takes approximately 16 days, but females lay only 7-14 days after their return. Once on land, Eudyptes penguins show a unique reproductive pattern of extreme egg size dimorphism in which the smaller, first-laid A-egg is 55%-75% of the size of the larger B-egg. We show that the degree of egg size dimorphism is inversely correlated with time between arrival and laying; that is, females that begin reproductive development well in advance of their return produce more dimorphic eggs. Furthermore, late-arriving females that produce the most dimorphic eggs have lower plasma levels of the yolk precursor vitellogenin on arrival; that is, they show lower reproductive "readiness." These data support the hypothesis that extreme egg size dimorphism in Eudyptes penguins is due to a physiological constraint imposed by a migratory carryover effect and argue against small A-eggs having a specific, adaptive function. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.

ABSTRACT: The diet of African penguins Spheniscus demersus in Namibia consisted mainly of sardine Sardinops sagax in the 1950s. Since the collapse of pelagic fish stocks in the 1970s, birds fed mainly on bearded (pelagic) goby Sufflogobius bibarbatus, a low-energy prey species. We present diet data for African penguins breeding at Mercury Island, the largest colony for this species in Namibia, between 1996 and 2009. Bearded goby was the main prey item throughout the study period, both in terms of frequency of occurrence (67.8%; SD 31.2) and in terms of mass (59.2%; SD 31.5). Diet composition varied throughout the year as well as between years; birds occasionally fed on a variety of fish species other than bearded goby. In Namibia, poor prey abundance is considered as a major factor contributing to the decline of penguin numbers after the collapse of the sardine stocks. However, bearded goby appears to be relatively abundant along Namibia's southern coast and low prey quality rather than low abundance appears to be a key factor influencing population dynamics of African penguins and other marine top predators in southern Namibia. © NISC (Pty) Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Various mitigation measures have been implemented to reduce incidental seabird mortality in longline and trawl fisheries but little attention has been given to artisanal fishing. In the 2008/09 breeding season, during a study of foraging of Humboldt, Spheniscus humboldti, and Magellanic Penguins, S. magellanicus, breeding on Puñihuil islets, southern Chile, a Magellanic Penguin equipped with a time-depth recorder became entangled and subsequently drowned in a gill net set for Corvina Drum (Cilus gilberti). The device was returned by fishermen and the data appear to be the first documented case of such a drowning in a marine, air-breathing vertebrate. According to the data, while diving to a depth of more than 50 m, the bird became entangled and drowned, remaining below 60 m for nearly 21 hours until the net was hauled. Although only a single incident is reported, there are indications that incidental mortality of penguins, other seabirds and marine mammals is more common in artisanal fisheries than previously anticipated.

ABSTRACT: We investigated intra-seasonal variation in foraging behavior of chick-rearing Adélie penguins, Pygoscelis adeliae, during two consecutive summers at Cape Hallett, northwestern Ross Sea. Although foraging behavior of this species has been extensively studied throughout the broad continental shelf region of the Ross Sea, this is the first study to report foraging behaviors and habitat affiliations among birds occupying continental slope waters. Continental slope habitat supports the greatest abundances of this species throughout its range, but we lack information about how intra-specific competition for prey might affect foraging and at-sea distribution and how these attributes compare with previous Ross Sea studies. Foraging trips increased in both distance and duration as breeding advanced from guard to crèche stage, but foraging dive depth, dive rates, and vertical dive distances travelled per hour decreased. Consistent with previous studies within slope habitats elsewhere in Antarctic waters, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) dominated chick meal composition, but fish increased four-fold from guard to crèche stages. Foraging-, focal-, and core areas all doubled during the crèche stage as individuals shifted distribution in a southeasterly direction away from the coast while simultaneously becoming more widely dispersed (i. e., less spatial overlap among individuals). Intra-specific competition for prey among Adélie penguins appears to influence foraging behavior of this species, even in food webs dominated by Antarctic krill. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: The at-sea distribution of fledgling emperor penguins Aptenodytes forsteri is largely unknown. Seven and 10 fledglings, respectively, were satellite tracked on their maiden voyage from the colonies at Taylor Glacier in 1996 and from Auster in 2007. In both years, the young birds dispersed widely, well beyond the pack ice zone once they had left and reached open water. They spent a substantial part of their time north of 60° S, i.e. outside the Antarctic Treaty area. The northernmost latitudes reached were 54° 14' S in 1996 and 56° 15' S in 2007. Their longitudinal distribution ranged from 7 to 93° E. The fledglings did not congregate in particular feeding areas nor did they appear to be associated with oceanographic fronts or the sea ice in their first 2 to 3 mo at sea. Towards the beginning of winter, they changed course and headed south back towards the ice but not to their natal colonies. Copyright © Inter-Research 2010.

ABSTRACT: The objective of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of orally administered terbinafine hydrochloride based on 3, 7, and 15 mg/kg single- as well as multiple-dosage trials in order to calculate dosing requirements for potential treatment of aspergillosis in African penguins (Spheniscus demersus). Ten adult African penguins were used in each of these trials, with a 2-wk washout period between trials. Mean plasma concentrations of terbinafine peaked in approximately 4 hrs at 0.11 ± 0.017 g/ml (mean ± SD) following administration of 3 mg/kg terbinafine, while 7 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg dosages resulted in peak plasma concentrations of 0.37 ± 0.105 and 0.33 ± 0.054 g/ml, respectively. The volume of distribution increased with increasing dosages, being 37 ± 28.5, 40 ± 28.1, and 52 ± 18.6 mg/L for 3, 7, and 15 mg/kg doses, respectively. The mean half-life was biphasic with initial terminal half-life (t) values of 9.9 ± 4.5, 17.2 ± 4.9 and 16.9 ± 5.4 hrs, for 3, 7, and 15 mg/kg doses, respectively. A rapid first elimination phase was followed by a slower second phase, and final elimination was estimated to be 136 ± 9.7 and 131 ± 9.9 hrs, for 7 and 15 mg/kg doses, respectively. Linearity was demonstrated for area under the curve but not for peak plasma concentrations for the three dosages used. Calculations based on pharmacokinetic parameter values indicate that a 15 mg/kg terbinafine q24h dosage regimen would result in steady-state trough plasma concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration (0.81.6 g/ml), and this dosage is recommended as a potential treatment option for aspergillosis in penguins. However, additional research is required to determine both treatment efficacy and safety. © 2010 American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Seabird burrows provide a soil environment for processing discards such as feathers and guano, hence constituting a primary interface between the sea and the land. This study involved collection and culturing of soil invertebrates from three blue penguin (Eudyptula minor) burrows, and examined their 13C/12C and 15N/14N isotopic composition in relation to potential burrow resources (terrestrial plant litter, burrow soil, guano, blue penguin feathers). Two taxa (cerylonid beetles and small tineid moth larvae) had a depleted 13C/ C indicative of a level of dependence on C from terrestrial soil. Tineid moth larvae (Monopis crocicapitella and (or) M. ethelella) substantially increased their 13C/12C enrichment during development, implying increasing dependence on marine C. Remaining taxa, both decomposers and predators, had 13C/12C intermediate between guano and feathers. Larval and emergent fleas had the most enriched 13C/12C, indicative of a greater dependence on feather C and the likelihood of co-processing with guano. Pseudoscorpions and histerid beetles had overlapping isotopic enrichments implying competition for prey, but were spatially separated in burrow soil. With their highly enriched 15N/ N and marine 13C/12C, larvae and protonymphs of the histiostomatid mite Myianoetus antipodus stood alone. Blue penguin burrows therefore support a diverse invertebrate fauna that incorporates terrestrial soil as well as varying proportions of the various blue penguin discards. © 2010 The Royal Society of New Zealand.

ABSTRACT: Increased oxygen storage is essential to the diving capacities of marine mammals and seabirds. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this adaptation are unknown. Myoglobin (Mb) and Mb mRNA concentrations were analyzed in emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) adults and chicks with spectrophotometric and RNase protection assays to evaluate production of their large Mb-bound O2 stores. Mean pectoral Mb concentration and Mb mRNA content increased throughout the pre-fledging period and were 15-fold and 3-fold greater, respectively, in adults than in 3.5 month old chicks. Mean Mb concentration in 5.9month old juveniles was 2.7±0.4g 100g-1 muscle (44% that of wild adults), and in adults that had been captive all their lives it was 3.7+0.1 g 100g-1 muscle. The Mb and Mb mRNA data are consistent with regulation of Mb production at the level of transcription as in other animals. Significant Mb and Mb mRNA production occurred in chicks and young juveniles even without any diving activity. The further increase in adult Mb concentrations appears to require the exercise/hypoxia of diving because Mb concentration in captive, non-diving adults only reached 60% of that of wild adults. The much greater relative increase in Mb concentration than in Mb mRNA content between young chicks and adults suggests that there is not a simple 1:1 relationship between Mb mRNA content and Mb concentration. Nutritional limitation in young chicks and post-transcriptional regulation of Mb concentration may also be involved. © 2010. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Measures of breeding success are traditionally derived using the proportion of total nests that successfully reach strategic stages across a breeding season, such as pair formation, egg laying or fledging chicks. The use of logistic regression has recently become a popular tool in avian literature for identifying influential factors that predict nest and/or individual breeding success. In this study, we use logistic regression models to assess the importance of a range of factors affecting male Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) breeding success during the 2002-2003 austral summer, when the presence of icebergs and extensive sea-ice meant overall breeding success of Adélie penguins was low (16/51 focal males had chicks reach fledging point). Logistic regression models for the early breeding season showed that good/average nest quality and central/middle nest location within the sub-colony were the best predictors of successful pair formation. Later, during incubation, the most successful males were those that not only returned earlier but were also heavier upon arrival and built nests of at least average quality. During the final stage when chicks had begun to fledge, the combined parameters of heavier male weight, early arrival time and good nest quality were the best predictors of breeding success. The logistic regression approach used here showed that the predictive ability of these parameters varied as the season progressed. However, most importantly, our logistic models fit the data well across all breeding stages. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: Inter-annual variability in the diet of Chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica) at Laurie Island (South Orkney Islands) and 25 de Mayo/King George and Nelson Islands (South Shetland) was examined based on stomach contents of adults during the 2002/2003-2006/2007 and 2002/2003-2004/2005 breeding seasons, respectively. Krill (Euphausia superba) dominated the diet as frequency of occurrence (in 100% of samples), number (>99%), and percentage contribution in weight (>94.8%). Other prey items were minor and varied between years. The weight of stomach contents was significantly different. The percentage in weight of whole krill was used to compare the feeding conditions across seasons. It differed significantly at the three sites studied. Distribution of krill size varied among years and localities, showing different krill availability for penguins. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: In 1948, a small colony of emperor penguins Aptenodytes forsteri was discovered breeding on Emperor Island (67° 51′ 52″ S, 68° 42′ 20″ W), in the Dion Islands, close to the West Antarctic Peninsula (Stonehouse 1952). When discovered, the colony comprised approximately 150 breeding pairs; these numbers were maintained until 1970, after which time the colony showed a continuous decline. By 1999 there were fewer than 20 pairs, and in 2009 high-resolution aerial photography revealed no remaining trace of the colony. Here we relate the decline and loss of the Emperor Island colony to a well-documented rise in local mean annual air temperature and coincident decline in seasonal sea ice duration. The loss of this colony provides empirical support for recent studies (Barbraud & Weimerskirch 2001; Jenouvrier et al 2005, 2009; Ainley et al 2010; Barber-Meyer et al 2005) that have highlighted the vulnerability of emperor penguins to changes in sea ice duration and distribution. These studies suggest that continued climate change is likely to impact upon future breeding success and colony viability for this species. Furthermore, a recent circumpolar study by Fretwell & Trathan (2009) highlighted those Antarctic coastal regions where colonies appear most vulnerable to such changes. Here we examine which other colonies might be at risk, discussing various ecological factors, some previously unexplored, that may also contribute to future declines. The implications of this are important for future modelling work and for understanding which colonies actually are most vulnerable. © 2011 Trathan et al.

ABSTRACT: The aerobic dive limit (ADL), dive duration associated with the onset of post-dive blood lactate elevation, has been widely used in the interpretation of diving physiology and diving behavior. However, its physiological basis is incompletely understood, and in most studies, ADLs are simply calculated with an O2 store/O2 consumption formula. To better understand the ADL, research has been conducted on emperor penguins diving at an isolated dive hole. This work has revealed that O2 stores are greater than previously estimated, and that the rate of depletion of those O2 stores appears to be regulated primarily through a diving bradycardia and the efficiency of swimming. Blood and respiratory O2 stores are not depleted at the 5.6 min ADL determined by post-dive blood lactate measurements. It is hypothesized that muscle, isolated from the circulation during a dive, is the primary source of lactate accumulation. To predict this 5.6 min ADL for these shallow dives at the isolated dive hole with the classic O2 store/O2 consumption formula, an O2 consumption rate of 2× the predicted metabolic rate of a penguin at rest is required. In contrast, if the formula is used to calculate an ADL that is defined as the time for all consumable O2 stores to be depleted, then a 23.1 min dive, in which final venous partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) was 6 mm Hg (0.8 kPa), represents such a maximum limit and demonstrates that an O2 consumption rate of about 0.5× the predicted rate of an emperor penguin at rest is required in the formula. © Inter-Research 2010.

ABSTRACT: According to life-history theory, long-lived birds should favor their survival over the current reproductive attempt, when breeding becomes too costly. In seabirds, incubation is often associated with spontaneous long-term fasting. Below a threshold in body reserves, hormonal and metabolic shift characteristics of a switch from lipid to protein utilization (phase III, PIII) occur. These metabolic changes are paralleled by nest abandonment and stimulation of refeeding behavior. Parental behavior is then under control of two hormones with opposite effects: corticosterone (CORT) and prolactin which stimulate foraging and incubation behavior, respectively. The aim of this study was to determine the respective role of these two hormones in nest abandonment by Adélie penguins. To this end, plasma hormone levels were measured before egg-laying and at departure from the colony (i.e. when birds were relieved by their partner or abandoned their nest), and related to nutritional state and incubation success. We found that males abandoning their nest in PIII presented high CORT levels and low prolactin levels. Interestingly, males which presented high plasma levels of prolactin in PIII did not abandon. We show that although CORT is the first hormone to be affected by prolonged energy constraints, the combined effects of high CORT and low prolactin levels are necessary for parents to favor self-maintenance and abandon the nest. We provide insights into time-course changes of the endocrine profile as PIII proceeds and report that reaching proteolytic late fasting is not sufficient to induce nest abandonment in a long-lived bird. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Aspergillus fumigatus is a known opportunistic pathogen of penguins. Most reports of penguin aspergillosis have focused on clinical, histopathological and microbiological findings. The molecular characterization of A. fumigatus isolates involved in invasive infections in penguins has yet to be addressed. The aim of this work was to study the possible coexistence of different A. fumigatus genotypes in five clinical cases of invasive aspergillosis in captive penguins. Differences in other relevant characteristics of the isolates, including mating type and invasiveness, were also considered. Alkaline protease and elastase production by the A. fumigatus isolates was evaluated by plate assays. Random amplified polymorphic DNA, and microsatellite analysis techniques were used for molecular typing, and mating type (MAT1-1 or MAT1-2) was determined by multiplex PCR. Although all isolates showed protease activity, differences in elastase activity were observed. The typing techniques indicated different genotypes in all the penguins, although one genotype was predominant in some cases. Fungal strains of different mating type were found in two different penguins, confirming infection polyclonality. In conclusion, captive penguins are susceptible to infection by multiple strains of A. fumigatus that differ not only in their genotype, but also in mating type and invasiveness. This finding has important consequences for the diagnosis and treatment of avian aspergillosis. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Here we report the isolation of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) from cloacal swabs obtained from penguins in the South Atlantic Antarctic region (62°08S, 58°25W). Samples of 100 penguins from King George Island were tested by real-time PCR, of which 2 (2%) were positive for NDV. The positive samples were isolated in embryonated chicken eggs and their matrix and fusion proteins genes were partially sequenced. This was complemented by the serological study performed on the blood of the same specimens, which resulted in a 33.3% rate of positivity. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Itraconazole is used to treat and prevent aspergillosis in captive penguin colonies. Although commercial formulations of itraconazole are available, compounding is sometimes performed to decrease cost or to provide a different concentration of the drug. Using a two-way crossover design, the pharmacokinetics of both a commercially available oral itraconazole solution and a compounded oral itraconazole solution were compared in six black-footed penguins (Spheniscus demersus). Each itraconazole formulation was administered orally in frozenthawed capelin at 7 mg/kg. Plasma itraconazole concentrations at time 0 (pretreatment), 20 and 40 min postdrug administration, and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hr postdrug administration were determined using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Drug concentrations were analyzed using standard pharmacokinetic methods. Plasma clearance of the commercial itraconazole solution was more rapid than the clearance published for other species, possibly warranting more frequent dosing in black-footed penguins. Absorption of itraconazole, as determined by peak concentration and area under the curve, was significantly higher for the commercial formulation when compared to the compounded formulation, likely as a result of the presence of cyclodextrin, a carrier compound shown to improve oral absorption, in the commercial formulation. Extrapolating dosing regimens for compounded itraconazole formulations from regimens determined for commercial formulations warrants caution as a result of the significant differences in pharmacokinetics.

ABSTRACT: DNA barcoding of faeces or stomach contents is an emerging approach for dietary analysis. We pyrosequenced mtDNA 16S markers amplified from faeces of captive little penguins (Eudyptula minor) to examine if recovered sequences reflect the proportions of species consumed. We also analysed wild little penguin faeces collected from 100 nests in southeast Australia. In the captive study, pilchards were the primary fish fed to the penguins and DNA sequences from pilchard were the most common sequences recovered. Sequences of three other fish fed in constant mass proportions (45:35:20) were all detected, but proportions of sequences (60:6:34) were considerably different than mass proportions in the diet. Correction factors based on relative mtDNA density in the fish did not improve diet estimates. Consistency between replicate samples suggests that the observed bias resulted from differences in prey digestibility. Detection of DNA from fish consumed before the penguins were brought into captivity indicates that a DNA signal in faeces can persist for at least 4 days after ingestion. In the wild-collected faeces, 24 distinct fish and 1 squid were identified; anchovy, barracouta and pilchard accounted for over 80% of these sequences. Our results highlight that DNA sequences recovered in dietary barcoding studies can provide semi-quantitative information on diet composition, but these data should be given wide confidence intervals. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

ABSTRACT: The cervical system of extant penguins (Aves: Sphenisciformes) is organised into morphological modules, each with its biomechanical function. Indeed, for these marine pelagic birds to acquire hydrodynamic morphology, the folding of the neck is essential. Despite a common general structure, the cervical vertebrae exhibit morphological differences depending on their positioning. These characteristics are identified as apparent cases of complete natural homeotic transformations-therefore, the composition of some modules varies. Two types of complete cervical homeoses are identified between species, but the second type can also occur within some species when the post hatching development is considered. The fossil material analysed here makes it apparent that the two modular configurations characterising the anterior part of the neck-a consequence of the first homeosis-existed 36 My and 25 My ago, for one, and circa 10 My ago, for the other. These comparisons also reveal a clear differentiation in vertebral features between the fossil species of the Oligocene-Miocene ages and the more recent and extant penguins. Ultimately, these observations make the proposal of a hypothesis in relation to the ontogenetic influence of Hox genes, and their regulators, based on the changes observed in the cervical segment of Sphenisciformes. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

ABSTRACT: Depth-dependent buoyancy resulting from the compression of body-associated air is a major force modulating energy expenditure in diving seabirds, yet quantification of its effects in free-living animals is problematic. Between November 2006 and December 2008, we used multiple chan-nel loggers (daily diaries [DDs]); recording triaxial acceleration, depth and speed, during foraging of 34 Magellanic penguins Spheniscus magellanicus from 3 colonies in Argentina to derive a new proxy for energy expenditure, overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA). Assuming ODBA to be linearly related to power, energy expenditure was highest during dive descent, nearer the surface and in those dives terminating at greater depths due to steeper descent angles. Swim speed during descent was invariant of maximum dive depth. Calculated energy expenditure during the bottom phase of the dive was invariant of depth, but energy expenditure of birds returning to the surface was lowest at any given depth for birds that had engaged in deeper dives due to the effects of buoyancy. Four birds, equipped with beak angle-measuring sensors as part of the DDs, captured 89% of their prey (nor-mally pelagic school fish) during fast passive ascents using buoyancy to aid in capture. Details from one of these birds showed that this passive ascent occurred at a mean velocity of 1.94 m s-1 for a mean of 2.02 s; ascent angles during such rushes were steeper when the bird was deeper, which was pre-sumed to reflect a response to the diminished buoyant force at greater pressures. Passive ascents during prey capture appear to be an important mechanism for Magellanic penguins to capture fast-moving prey with minimal energy expenditure. © Inter-Research 2010.

ABSTRACT: The link between poor reproductive success and diet was investigated in yellow-eyed penguins Megadyptes antipodes, by assessing diet at two localities separated by about 30km: the north coast of Stewart Island where breeding success is low (0.38-0.67 chicks per pair in recent years), and Codfish Island where breeding success is higher (0.96-1.51 chicks per pair), and relating this to published data from South Island localities, where average breeding success was 1.1 chicks per pair. Diet composition, meal sizes and energetic content of meals and prey were determined from stomach contents, and stable isotope analyses of chick down, fledgling feathers and adult blood provided information on diet throughout the fledging period. The high proportion of stomachs that were empty or lacked diagnostic remains reduced sample size considerably, and variability between samples reduced the power to detect significant differences in meal size, proportions of empty stomachs and prey diversity of meals. Energetic content of Stewart Island meals was less than Codfish Island meals, and there was a non-significant trend for smaller meal sizes and reduced prey diversity among Stewart Island samples. Both localities had lower prey diversity and smaller meals than South Island penguins. Blue cod Parapercis colias accounted for 99% of prey biomass in Stewart Island and 70% in Codfish Island stomach samples, where 27% of prey biomass was opalfish Hemerocoetes monopterygius. Isotopic mixing models carried out on larger sample sizes indicated that opalfish comprised a large proportion of the diet at both locations, with adults selectively provisioning chicks with opalfish while feeding mainly on blue cod themselves. We suggest the large blue cod consumed by Codfish Island and Stewart Island penguins, larger than those consumed by South Island penguins, is difficult to transfer to chicks by regurgitation. Oyster dredging around Stewart Island may have reduced the availability and abundance of alternative prey to Stewart Island penguins. © 2010 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The use of data-loggers has permitted to explore the biology of free-ranging animals. However, this method has also been reported to reduce reproductive success while the reasons of this deleterious effect remain poorly documented. In this study, we aimed to identify critical periods of the breeding cycle of Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) when the reproductive success may decrease because of instrumentation. For this purpose, we monitored 40 pairs, where one parent was instrumented before egg laying and 30 pairs without devices (controls). These pairs were followed at least during the incubation period but the majority was monitored during the entire breeding season. Reproductive success was affected in pairs where males were instrumented. This was not due to extra chick mortality during chick rearing but to a significantly lower hatching success. Moreover, the use of artificial eggs recording incubation temperatures and egg rotation indicated that in instrumented incubating males, eggs spent as much time at optimal incubation temperatures as control eggs but were rotated at a higher frequency. In Adélie penguins, males initiate incubation and it has been established that the early stage of incubation is one of the most critical periods for embryonic development. The low hatching rate observed in instrumented males was associated with a higher egg rotation rate, perhaps as a stress response to the presence of the instrument. Even though the causal effects remain unclear, instrumentation severely affected hatching success. For these reasons, we recommend equipping birds after the early incubation. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: In a clinical setting, it is important to differentiate abnormal values that may be a normal change resulting from feeding and those that may be disease related. Such postprandial changes have been identified in mammalian and avian species. In the current study, pre- and postvalues for several routine biochemical analytes from penguins (Spheniscus demersus) were examined. Significant increases were found in uric acid, triglycerides, and bile acids (P < 0.001). Uric acid levels increased more than threefold. These data indicate that postprandial changes should be considered when interpreting abnormal biochemistry values in penguins. © 2010 American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: This article summarises the history of the discovery of emperor penguin Aptenodytes forsteri colonies. Emperor penguins were probably first seen on James Cook's second voyage (1773-1775) but were not recorded as a separate species until 1844. The first breeding colony of these birds was found in 1902 and a further 32 were sighted over the next century. The total number of colonies is still unknown but today satellite technology is aiding the process of discovery. © Cambridge University Press 2009.

ABSTRACT: In 2008, the emperor penguin Aptenodytes forsteri colony at Amanda Bay, East Antarctica, was designated an Antarctic Specially Protected Area by the 31st Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting in Kyiv, Ukraine. It is only the third emperor penguin colony in the Australian Antarctic Territory to receive this status. The colony has been known to exist since 1956 and numerous visits have been made to it, especially by personnel from Australia's Davis station. On a number of occasions, attempts were made to estimate the number of birds in the colony in order to obtain an insight into the size of the breeding population. Here we report on the history of visitation to the colony since the 1950s and examine the quality of information collected with regard to the usefulness of this information in terms of population analyses. We also report the results of the first visit to the Amanda Bay colony made in winter with the specific purpose of estimating the number of birds present and of highlighting the need for long term monitoring programmes to assess the viability of emperor penguins in future. © 2009 Cambridge University Press.

ABSTRACT: Gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) have conspicuous red beak spots, the function of which is currently unknown. We hypothesized that beak spots might be sexual ornaments and investigated sexual dichromatism, assortative mating and the possible relationship between beak spot colouration and body condition. Beak colouration was measured with a portable spectroradiometer in 19 breeding pairs of gentoo penguin. Body mass and body mass relative to structural body size were used as estimates of body condition. We found that beak spots were sexually dichromatic, as they were more UV in males and more violet in females, but males and females did not mate assortatively in relation to beak spot colouration. Body condition was strongly related to red colouration in males, with individuals in good condition having redder beaks and individuals in poor condition more orange beaks. The beaks of males in good condition were also brighter. Body condition was not significantly related to beak spot colouration in females, so females might show red beak spots because of genetic correlation with the male trait. These results suggest that the red colour of the beak spot has the potential to be a secondary sexual character in males. Interpretation of the sexual dichromatism in the UV colour will require further knowledge of the capability of gentoo penguins to discriminate small differences in UV wavelengths. In any case, experimental manipulation of beak colouration will be needed to ascertain the role of this trait. © Springer-Verlag 2009.

ABSTRACT: Diet, and in particular, food quality and quantity can influence the reproductive performance of marine predators. Also, the diet of specialist predators is often monitored in programmes that model and manage ecosystems. We examined the diet of Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae), an important consumer of Southern Ocean living resources, at Béchervaise Island, east Antarctica, during the chick-rearing periods for 11 years between 1991-1992 and 2002-2003. We also investigated the relationship between diet and annual reproductive performance. Substantial inter- and intra-annual variation in both meal mass and composition was evident: adults generally returned with larger food loads during the crèche compared with the guard stages, and diet composition was dominated by two prey types, krill and fish, which combined contributed to >90% of the diet by mass in 7 out of 11 years. Females generally brought back meals dominated by krill; males generally consumed fish-dominated meals. However, both sexes returned with a high proportion of krill when annual mean meal mass was also high, suggesting that more food was available in high krill years. There was also evidence that years of high reproductive performance were positively correlated with years of both high meal and krill mass. We believe that our results indicate that there is significant long-term inter- and intra-annual variability in the amount of food available to Adélie penguins and that this was reflected in their diet and measures of reproductive performance. Coupled with the observation that penguins did not switch prey, this indicates that Adélie penguins from Béchervaise Island are dependent predators of krill. This contrasts with populations in other locations but supports the notion that Adélie penguins are an informative species to monitor the management of Southern Ocean marine living resources in this region. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) have emerged as a new class of global environmental pollutants. In this study, the presence of perfluorochemicals (PFCs) in penguin eggs and Antarctic fur seals was reported for the first time. Tissue samples from Antarctic fur seal pups and penguin eggs were collected during the 2003/04 breeding season. Ten PFC contaminants were determined in seal and penguin samples. The PFC concentrations in seal liver were in the decreasing order, PFOS > PFNA > PFHpA > PFUnDA while in Adélie penguin eggs were PFHpA > PFUnDA > PFDA > PFDoDA, and in Gentoo penguin eggs were PFUnDA > PFOS > PFDoDA > PFHpA. The PFC concentrations differed significantly between seals and penguins (p < 0.005) and a species-specific difference was found between the two species of penguins (p < 0.005). In our study we found a mean concentration of PFOS in seal muscle and liver samples of 1.3 ng/g and 9.4 ng/g wet wt, respectively, and a mean concentration in Gentoo and Adélie penguin eggs of 0.3 ng/g and 0.38 ng/g wet wt, respectively. PFCs detected in penguin eggs and seal pups suggested oviparous and viviparous transfer of PFOS to eggs and off-springs. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: This is the first report of a Plasmodium blood parasite found in the Galapagos Archipelago. Phylogenetic analyses place this parasite, recovered from endangered Galapagos penguins (Spheniscus mendiculus), within the genus Plasmodium, and suggest a close relationship to some of the most dangerous lineages of Plasmodium that have been known to cause severe mortality and morbidity in captive penguin populations. Infectious disease is an increasingly important cause of global species extinctions, and extinctions due to avian pox and avian malaria (Plasmodium relictum) have been well documented in Hawaiian avifauna. Plasmodium blood parasites had not been detected in Galapagos birds until now, despite previous microscopic and molecular screening of many of the species, including the Galapagos penguin. While penguin populations now appear healthy, it is unclear whether this parasite will have an obvious impact on their survival and reproduction, particularly during El Niño events, which cause stress due to reduced food availability. It is possible that this parasite arrived with or shortly after the recent arrival of an introduced mosquito, Culex quinquefasciatus, known elsewhere as a competent vector of Plasmodium blood parasites. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The Major Histocompatibility Complex (Mhc) class II DRB locus of vertebrates is highly polymorphic and some alleles may be shared between closely related species as a result of balancing selection in association with resistance to parasites. In this study, we developed a new set of PCR primers to amplify, clone, and sequence overlapping portions of the Mhc class II DRB-like gene from the 5'UTR end to intron 3, including exons 1, 2, and 3 and introns 1 and 2 in four species (20 Humboldt, six African, five Magellanic, and three Galapagos penguins) of penguin from the genus Spheniscus (Sphe). Analysis of gene sequence variation by the neighbor-joining method of 21 Sphe sequences and 20 previously published sequences from four other penguin species revealed overlapping clades within the Sphe species, but species-specific clades for the other penguin species. The overlap of the DRB-like gene sequence variants between the four Sphe species suggests that, despite their allopatric distribution, the Sphe species are closely related and that some shared DRB1 alleles may have undergone a trans-species inheritance because of balancing selection and/or recent rapid speciation. The new primers and PCR assays that we have developed for the identification of the DRB1 DNA and protein sequence variations appear to be useful for the characterization of the molecular evolution of the gene in closely related Penguin species and might be helpful for the assessment of the genetic health and the management of the conservation and captivity of these endangered species. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: Research on animal ornaments used in mate choice has largely focused on males, particularly for bird species with sexually dimorphic coloured patches of feathers and integument. Relatively less information is available for coloured ornaments of sexually monomorphic species and the use of these ornaments during mate choice. The king penguin, Aptenodytes patagonicus, is a monogamous marine bird in which both sexes show very similar coloured ornaments (UV and yellow-orange colours on the beak, yellow-orange auricular feathers, and yellow to rusty-brown breast feathers). These ornaments have previously been implicated in mate choice. We used manipulative experiments to test the role of coloured feather patches in the choice of partners that occurs during pair formation. Experimental reduction of auricular patch size delayed pairing, and alteration of auricular and breast patch colour from yellow to white caused an even stronger delay (white treatments gave adults the appearance of immature birds). Surprisingly, we found that time to pairing did not differ between treatments for females, but males showed significant delays in pairing in general and especially when treated. Thus, females seemed to be more selective in mate choice than males, a phenomenon that might be explained by a male-biased sex ratio in the colony. Nevertheless, our results indicate that choice of mate may be much stronger in one of the sexes in what appears to be a sexually monomorphic species, for which we expected sexual selection to favour mutually strong male and female mate choice. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: The breeding and moult phenology of African penguins Spheniscus demersus at Dassen Island form part of a variable annual cycle. Between 1994 and 2006, African penguins bred throughout the year. Most of this period was characterised by favourable feeding conditions. There were definite peaks in breeding activity, but these varied between years and between colonies on the island, with no obvious seasonal pattern. Synchronisation of breeding activities was greater in colonies with higher nest densities, suggesting that breeding phenology was influenced more by social interaction between individuals than by a wider-scale seasonal effect. Moult phenology of African penguins at Dassen Island was more synchronous and seasonal than breeding activities. Most penguins moulted between September and January. A large proportion (30%) of moult records was of birds moulting in nest sites rather than at landing beaches along the shore. The incidence of nest moulting was greatest from August to October, when sea conditions were generally rougher. The interval between successive moults ranged from 221 days to 546 days, with a mean of 349 days. The much greater degree of synchronisation in moult compared with breeding patterns suggests that moult, and not breeding, may represent the key driver of the annual cycle. © NISC (Pty) Ltd.

ABSTRACT: This study investigates the movements of Magellanic Penguins Spheniscus magellanicus breeding on Isla Martillo during the early chick-rearing period. Foraging paths were reconstructed using GPS loggers that registered the penguins′ geographic position, water temperature and depth at regular intervals. The relationship between penguins′ movements and search strategies, tide and tidal currents were assessed. Mean trip duration was on average 14.7 ± 6.9 h (33% overnight), and the maximum distance reached was 24 ± 10 km. All penguins studied foraged to the east of the colony. We identified three phases based on the sinuosity and speed of the trajectory: transit, central and return. Foraging effort was higher during the central phase, followed by the transit phase, and lower in the return phase. Foraging success, measured as the percentage of time at the bottom during each phase, was also highest during the central phase. In all birds studied, the central phase of the foraging trip took place during ebb tide, and birds travelled to the foraging areas with flow tide running in the same direction of displacement. Our study suggests that penguins take advantage of tidal currents to facilitate their movements to and from the main foraging area, thereby reducing the energy expended. Moreover, we suggest that piscivorous diving birds may enhance their catch rate during ebb tide when fish are more concentrated near the channel bed. © 2010 Dt. Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this work was to study foraging trip duration and body size of male and female Magellanic Penguins during the breeding season and to determine the association of these parameters with both reproductive success and clutch quality in a colony located in the Beagle Channel, Tierra del Fuego. Trip duration differed significantly between sexes and between breeding stages. Females performed longer trips than males during incubation. We suggest that this could be due to differences in body reserves and foraging capabilities related with their body condition. In both sexes, foraging trips during incubation were longer than in the other stages, while the shortest trips were observed during early chick rearing. Trips were shorter when chicks were smaller and required greater parental care. A high value of reproductive success (1.51 chicks per nest) was recorded in comparison to that observed in colonies from the Malvinas Islands and Punta Tombo. These results could be related to differences in food availability in nearby waters. Body size of parents was not associated with reproductive success. Notwithstanding, larger females produced larger chicks at early moult and clutches of higher quality. The correlation between female body size and chick size at early moult suggests an important contribution of females on chick's development.

ABSTRACT: Toxoplasma gondii is one of the most common protozoan parasites of humans and warm-blooded animals. Members of the family Felidae are the only definitive hosts of this parasite and, thus, important in the epidemiology of the disease. Previous studies on Pacific islands have found T. gondii infections in a number of avian species where domestic cats (Felis catus) have been introduced. Little is known about T. gondii in the Galapagos Islands, although introduced domestic cats in the archipelago are known to be T. gondii antibody-positive. In this study, we quantified prevalence of antibody to T. gondii in two threatened avian marine species, Galapagos Penguins (Spheniscus mendiculus) and Flightless Cormorants (Phalacrocorax harrisi), and tested the hypothesis that this parasite is more prevalent on Isabela Island (with cats) than on Fernandina Island (without cats). Overall, antibody prevalence was 2.3% in both Galapagos Penguins and Flightless Cormorants from samples collected during 2003-2005, and in 2008. In Galapagos Penguins (n=298), a significantly higher antibody prevalence was found in penguins on Fernandina Island (free of cats) than on Isabela Island (with cats; Fisher's exact test; P=0.02). In Flightless Cormorants (n=258), there was a higher antibody prevalence in cormorants living on Isabela than on Fernandina, although this difference was not statistically significant (Fisher's; P=0.19). This study is the first to show exposure to T. gondii in endemic avian species in the Galapagos Islands, providing evidence for disease-related risks associated with the feral cat population in the archipelago. We provide possible explanations for these findings and recommendations for future studies towards a better understanding of the epidemiology of T. gondii in the Galapagos Islands. © Wildlife Disease Association 2010.

ABSTRACT: The Humboldt (Spheniscus humboldti) and Magellanic (S. magellanicus) Penguins overlap over 1100 km along the coast of the southeastern Pacific Ocean, and much has been hypothesized about hybridization between them. We visited Puñihuil and Metalqui islands, southern Chile (41-42° S), where both species form mixed colonies; these are also the Humboldt Penguin's southernmost colonies. We observed one mixed pair attending chicks and two adults of intermediate color pattern, one of which tended a chick at a nest. Additionally, on the basis of analysis of 30 blood samples of Humboldt Penguins from the Puñihuil colony, we report the first documented Humboldt × Magellanic Penguin hybrid. Judged from the pattern of restriction fragments, this bird had a Magellanic dam and a Humboldt sire. We sequenced mitochondrial and nuclear copies independently to confirm these results. We suggest that hybridization at Metalqui and Puñihuil is encouraged by the low abundance of the Humboldt Penguin rather than by failed mate recognition. © The Cooper Ornithological Society, 2009.

ABSTRACT: The population dynamics of Antarctic seabirds are influenced by variations in winter sea ice extent and persistence; however, the type of relationship differs according to the region and the demographic parameter considered. We used annual presence/absence data obtained from 1,138 individually marked birds to study the influence of environmental and individual characteristics on the survival of Adélie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae at Edmonson Point (Ross Sea, Antarctica) between 1994 and 2005. About 25% of 600 birds marked as chicks were reobserved at the natal colony. The capture and survival rates of Adélie penguins at this colony increased with the age of individuals, and five age classes were identified for both parameters. Mean adult survival was 0.85 (SE = 0.01), and no effect of sex on survival was evident. Breeding propensity, as measured by adult capture rates, was close to one, indicating a constant breeding effort through time. Temporal variations in survival were best explained by a quadratic relationship with winter sea ice extent anomalies in the Ross Sea, suggesting that for this region optimal conditions are intermediate between too much and too little winter sea ice. This is likely the result of a balance between suitable wintering habitat and food availability. Survival rates were not correlated with the Southern Oscillation Index. Low adult survival after a season characterized by severe environmental conditions at breeding but favorable conditions during winter suggested an additional mortality mediated by the reproductive effort. Adélie penguins are sensitive indicators of environmental changes in the Antarctic, and the results from this study provide insights into regional responses of this species to variability in winter sea ice habitat. © Springer-Verlag 2009.

ABSTRACT: Potential Adélie penguin Pygoscelis adeliae breeding habitat in the Australian Antarctic Territory (AAT: 45°E-136°E, 142°E-160°E) was mapped using a geographic information system (GIS), and the literature reviewed for evidence of the mapped habitat being searched for presence or absence of breeding Adélie penguins. It is concluded that incomplete search effort is a possible source of substantial negative bias of Adélie penguin breeding abundance derived from published count data in some regions of the AAT. The extent of search effort in other regions of Antarctica could be determined using the same approach applied here, because GIS data required for mapping potential habitat are available for the entire continent. We would expect that regions with more scientific and tourist activity, such as the Antarctic Peninsula, are likely to have greater search effort than the AAT. © 2009 Cambridge University Press.

ABSTRACT: Emperor penguins Aptenodytes forsteri are endemic to Antarctica. Their breeding colonies are located in the coastal areas of the continent. The precise number of breeding locations is uncertain. This paper examines what is known about the colonies in the Australian Antarctic Territory and examines which colonies are without doubt breeding locations and which ones require further examination in order to determine their existence and status. Several colonies have not been seen since they were first reported. This begs the question of whether the reported sightings were indeed of breeding colonies. Given the extent of uncertainty with regard to the number of colonies, it is suggested that the listing of the species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature be changed from 'of least concern' to 'data deficient'. © 2009 Cambridge University Press.

ABSTRACT: The purpose of this study was to determine normal ocular surface bacterial flora, tear production, and intraocular pressure in a captive flock of Humboldt penguins, Spheniscus humboldti. Twenty-eight healthy penguins were studied and equally divided between fresh- and saltwater habitats. The population consisted of 15 female and 13 male penguins, ranging from 3-20 years of age. Following complete ophthalmic exam, 4 penguins with cataracts were removed from the study. Eight penguins from each habitat were randomly selected for ocular surface aerobic bacterial culture. Corynebacterium spp. and Staphylococcus spp. were the most common isolates. Twenty-five organisms consisting of 17 species, and 15 organisms consisting of 9 species, were identified in fresh- and saltwater groups, respectively. Tear production and intraocular pressures were evaluated on 24 penguins with normal ocular exams. The range and mean (±standard deviation) tear production, measured with the Schirmer tear test, was 1-12 mm/min and 6.45 mm/min ± 2.9, respectively. The mean tear production for penguins housed in the freshwater habitat was greater (8.5 mm/min) than those in saltwater (4.8 mm/min). The range and mean (±standard deviation) intraocular pressure, measured by applanation tonometry using a Tono-Pen XL® tonometer, was 10-27 mmHg and 20.36 mmHg ± 4.1, respectively. This data should be utilized as a reliable resource for those involved in avian and zoo medicine. Copyright 2009 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Aim: To map and assess the breeding distribution of emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) using remote sensing. Location: Pan-Antarctic. Methods: Using Landsat ETM satellite images downloaded from the Landsat Image Mosaic of Antarctica (LIMA), we detect faecal staining of ice by emperor penguins associated with their colony locations. Emperor penguins breed on sea ice, and their colonies exist in situ between May and December each year. Faecal staining at these colony locations shows on Landsat imagery as brown patches, the only staining of this colour on sea ice. This staining can therefore be used as an analogue for colony locations. The whole continental coastline has been analysed, and each possible signal has been identified visually and checked by spectral analysis. In areas where LIMA data are unsuitable, freely available Landsat imagery has been supplemented. Results: We have identified colony locations of emperor penguins at a total of 38 sites. Of these, 10 are new locations, and six previously known colony locations have been repositioned (by over 10 km) due to poor geographical information in old records. Six colony locations, all from old or unconfirmed records, were not found or have disappeared. Main conclusions: We present a new pan-Antarctic species distribution of emperor penguins mapped from space. In one synoptic survey we locate extant emperor penguin colonies, a species previously poorly mapped due to its unique breeding habits, and provide a vital geographical resource for future studies of an iconic species believed to be vulnerable to future climate change. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Chinstrap, Pygoscelis antarctica, and gentoo, P. papua, penguins are sympatric species that inhabit the Antarctic Peninsula. To evaluate differences in the foraging habitat of these two species, we recorded their foraging locations and diving behavior using recently developed GPS-depth data loggers. The study was conducted on King George Island, Antarctica during the chick-guarding period of both species, from December 2006 to January 2007. The area used for foraging, estimated as the 95% kernel density of dive (>5 m) locations, overlapped partially between the two species (26.4 and 68.5% of the area overlapped for chinstrap and gentoo penguins, respectively). However, the core foraging area, estimated as the 50% kernel density, was mostly separate (12.8 and 25.0% of the area overlapped for chinstrap and gentoo penguins, respectively). Chinstrap penguins tended to use off-shelf (water depth > 200 m) regions (77% of the locations for dives >5 m), whereas gentoo penguins mainly used on-shelf (water depth < 200 m) areas (71% of dive locations). The data on foraging locations, diving behavior, and bathymetry indicated that gentoo penguins often performed benthic dives (28% of dives >5 m), whereas chinstrap penguins almost always used the epipelagic/mid-water layer (96% of dives >5 m). Diving parameters such as diving bottom duration or diving efficiency differed between the species, reflecting differences in the use of foraging habitat. The diving parameters also suggested that the on-shelf benthic layer was profitable foraging habitat for gentoo penguins. Conversely, the relationship between trip duration, date, and stomach content mass suggested that the chinstrap penguins went further from the colony to forage as the season progressed, possibly reflecting a reduction in prey availability near the colony. Our results suggest that chinstrap and gentoo penguins segregated their foraging habitat in the Antarctic coastal marine environment, possibly due to inter- and intra-specific competition for common prey resources. © Springer-Verlag 2009.

ABSTRACT: Major population crashes due to natural or human-induced environmental changes may be followed by recoveries. There is a growing interest in the factors governing recovery, in hopes that they might guide population conservation and management, as well as population recovery following a re-introduction program. The emperor penguin Aptenodytes forsteri population in Terre Adélie, Antarctica, declined by 50% during a regime shift in the mid-1970s, when abrupt changes in climate and ocean environment regimes affected the entire Southern Ocean ecosystem. Since then the population has remained stable and has not recovered. To determine the factors limiting recovery, we examined the consequences of changes in survival and breeding success after the regime shift. Adult survival recovered to its pre-regime shift level, but the mean breeding success declined and the variance in breeding success increased after the regime shift. Using stochastic matrix population models, we found that if the distribution of breeding success observed prior to the regime shift had been retained, the emperor penguin population would have recovered, with a median time to recovery of 36 years. The observed distribution of breeding success after the regime shift makes recovery very unlikely. This indicates that the pattern of breeding success is sufficient to have prevented emperor penguin population recovery. The population trajectory predicted on the basis of breeding success agrees with the observed trajectory. This suggests that the net effect of any facors other than breeding success must be small. We found that the probability of recovery and the time to recovery depend on both the mean and variance of breeding success. Increased variance in breeding success increases the probability of recovery when mean success is low, but has the opposite effect when the mean is high. This study shows the important role of breeding success in determining population recovery for a long-lived species and demonstrates that demographic mechanisms causing population crash can be different from those preventing population recovery.

ABSTRACT: This study reports avian malaria caused by Plasmodium relictum in Magellanic Penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) from São Paulo Zoo. The disease was highly infective among the birds and was clinically characterized by its acute course and high mortality. The penguins of São Paulo Zoo were housed for at least 2 years without malaria; however, they had always been maintained in an enclosure protected from mosquito exposure during the night period. When they presented pododermatitis, they were freed at night for a short period. São Paulo Zoo is located in one of the last forest remnants of the city, an area of original Atlantic forest. In the winter, the space destined for Zoo birds is shared with migratory species. Hence the possibility exists that the disease was transmitted to the penguins by mosquitoes that had previously bitten infected wild birds. Avian malaria parasites are transmitted mainly by mosquitoes of the genera Aedes and Culex, common vectors in the Atlantic forest. In this study, one Culex (Cux.) sp. was found, infected with P. relictum. There are diverse problems in housing distinct species of animals in captivity, principally when occupying the same enclosure, since it facilitates the transmission of diseases with indirect cycles, as is the case of Plasmodium spp. ., because certain species that cause discrete infections in some bird species can become a serious danger for others, especially penguins, which do not possess natural resistance. Thus, serious implications exist for periodically testing and administrating malaria therapy in captive penguins potentially exposed to mosquitoes during the night period, as well as other captive birds from São Paulo Zoo. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: A novel, obligately anaerobic, psychrotolerant bacterium, designated strain PPP2T, was isolated from guano of the Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) in Chilean Patagonia. Cells were Gram-stain-positive, spore-forming, straight rods (0.7-0.8×3.0-5.0 mm) that were motile by means of peritrichous flagella. Growth was observed at pH 6.7-9.7 (optimum pH 8.3) and 2-37 °C (optimum 29 °C). Growth was observed between 0 and 4% (w/v) NaCl with optimum growth at 0.5% (w/v). Strain PPP2T was a catalase-negative chemo-organoheterotroph that was capable of fermentative metabolism. Peptone, bacto-tryptone, Casamino acids, oxalate, starch, chitin and yeast extract were utilized as substrates. The major metabolic products were acetate, butyrate and ethanol. Strain PPP2T was resistant to ampicillin, but sensitive to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, rifampicin, kanamycin, vancomycin and gentamicin. The DNA G+C content of strain PPP2T was 39.5 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that strain PPP2T was related most closely to Clostridium sticklandii SR (∼90% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). On the basis of phylogenetic analysis and phenotypic characteristics, strain PPP2T is considered to represent a novel species of a new genus, for which the name Proteocatella sphenisci gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Proteocatella sphenisci is PPP2T (=ATCC BAA-755T =JCM 12175T =CIP 108034T). © 2009 IUMS.

ABSTRACT: Prolonged abnormal vomiting causes metabolic alkalosis.Many seabirds are known to feed their chicks by regurgitation. We hypothesized that metabolic alkalosis occurs in seabirds even under natural conditions during the breeding season. Adélie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae feed their chicks by regurgitating food for 50-60 d until the chicks fledge. In this study, the concentrations of Cl-, HCO3 -, Na+, K+, pH, and PCO2 in the 2 blood of breeding Adélie penguins were measured throughout the chick-rearing season. The pH of penguin venous blood shifted from 7.54 in the guarding period to 7.47 in the crèche period. Decreasing Cl- and increasing HCO3 - blood concentrations in parents were associated with increasing mass of their brood in the guarding period, the early phase of the rearing season, indicating that regurgitating to feed chicks causes loss of gastric acid and results in relative metabolic alkalosis. The inverse trend was observed during the crèche period, the latter phase of the rearing season, when parents spent more time at sea and have fewer opportunities for gastric acid loss. This was assumed to be the recovery phase. These results indicate that regurgitation might cause metabolic alkalosis in breeding Adélie penguins. To our knowledge, this is the first report to indicate that seabirds exhibit metabolic alkalosis due to regurgitation to feed chicks under natural conditions. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.

ABSTRACT: Bio-logging studies suffer from the lack of real controls. However, it is still possible to compare indirect parameters between control and equipped animals to assess the level of global disturbance due to instrumentation. In addition, it is also possible to compare the behaviour of free-ranging animals between individuals equipped with different techniques or instruments to determine the less deleterious approach. We instrumented Adélie Penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) with internal or external time-depth recorders and monitored them in parallel with a control group during the first foraging trip following instrumentation. Foraging trip duration was significantly longer in the internally-equipped group. This difference was due to a larger number of dives, reflecting a lower foraging ability or a higher food demand, and longer periods of recovery at the surface. These longer recovery periods were likely to be due to a reduced efficiency to ventilate at the surface, probably because the implanted devices pressurised adjacent organs such as air sacs. Moreover, descent and ascent rates were slightly lower in externally-equipped penguins, presumably because external instrumentation increased the bird drag. Looking at our results, implantation appears more disadvantageous-at least for short-term deployment-than external equipment in Adélie Penguins, while this method has been described to induce no negative effects in long-term studies. This underlines the need to control for potential effects due to methodological aspects in any study using data loggers in free-ranging animals, to minimise disturbance and collect reliable data. © Dt.

ABSTRACT: In coastal Antarctica, freezing and thawing influence many physical, chemical and biological processes for ice-free tundra ecosystems, including the production of greenhouse gases (GHGs). In this study, penguin guanos and ornithogenic soil cores were collected from four penguin colonies and one seal colony in coastal Antarctica, and experimentally subjected to three freezing-thawing cycles (FTCs) under ambient air and under N2. We investigated the effects of FTCs on the emissions of three GHGs including nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). The GHG emission rates were extremely low in frozen penguin guanos or ornithogenic soils. However, there was a fast increase in the emission rates of three GHGs following thawing. During FTCs, cumulative N2O emissions from ornithogenic soils were greatly higher than those from penguin guanos under ambient air or under N2. The highest N2O cumulative emission of 138.24 μg N2O-N kg-1 was observed from seal colony soils. Cumulative CO2 and CH4 emissions from penguin guanos were one to three orders of magnitude higher than those from ornithogenic soils. The highest cumulative CO2 (433.0 mgCO2-C kg-1) and CH4 (2.9 mgCH4-C kg-1) emissions occurred in emperor penguin guanos. Penguin guano was a stronger emitter for CH4 and CO2 while ornithogenic soil was a stronger emitter for N2O during FTCs. CO2 and CH4 fluxes had a correlation with total organic carbon (TOC) and soil/guano moisture (Mc) in penguin guanos and ornithogenic soils. The specific CO2-C production rate (CO2-C/TOC) indicated that the bioavailability of TOC was markedly larger in penguin guanos than in ornithogenic soils during FTCs. This study showed that FTC-released organic C and N from sea animal excreta may play a significant role in FTC-related GHG emissions, which may account for a large proportion of annual fluxes from tundra ecosystems in coastal Antarctica. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: A 7-day-old gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) was found dead and postmortem examination revealed impaction of the ventriculus with feathers. A review of mortality in gentoo penguin chicks from 1997 to 2007 at that institution revealed another case of feather impaction of the ventriculus in a 4-week-old chick, a sibling of the previous chick. A third case of gastrointestinal impaction occurred in a 24-day-old king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus) with omphallitis and enteritis. In this chick, a fibrin mat produced a complete obstruction of the intestine at the level of Mecke's diverticulum. © 2009 by the Association of Avian Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: We assess the response of pack ice penguins, Emperor (Aptenodytes forsteri) and Adélie (Pygoscelis adeliae), to habitat variability and, then, by modeling habitat alterations, the qualitative changes to their populations, size and distribution, as Earth's average tropospheric temperature reaches 2°C above preindustrial levels (ca. 1860), the benchmark set by the European Union in efforts to reduce greenhouse gases. First, we assessed models used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) on penguin performance duplicating existing conditions in the Southern Ocean. We chose four models appropriate for gauging changes to penguin habitat: GFDL-CM2.1, GFDL-CM2.0, MIROC3.2(hi-res), and MRI-CGCM2.3.2a. Second, we analyzed the composited model ENSEMBLE to estimate the point of 2°C warming (2025-2052) and the projected changes to sea ice coverage (extent, persistence, and concentration), sea ice thickness, wind speeds, precipitation, and air temperatures. Third, we considered studies of ancient colonies and sediment cores and some recent modeling, which indicate the (space/time) large/centennialscale penguin response to habitat limits of all ice or no ice. Then we considered results of statistical modeling at the temporal interannual-decadal scale in regard to penguin response over a continuum of rather complex, meso- to large-scale habitat conditions, some of which have opposing and others interacting effects. The ENSEMBLE meso/decadal-scale output projects a marked narrowing of penguins' Zoogeographic range at the 2°C point. Colonies north of 70° S are projected to decrease or disappear: ∼50% of Emperor colonies (40% of breeding population) and ∼75% of Adélie colonies (70% of breeding population), but limited growth might occur south of 73° S. Net change would result largely from positive responses to increase in polynya persistence at high latitudes, overcome by decreases in pack ice cover at lower latitudes and, particularly for Emperors, ice thickness. Adélie Penguins might colonize new breeding habitat where concentrated pack ice diverges and/or disintegrating ice shelves expose coastline. Limiting increase will be decreased persistence of pack ice north of the Antarctic Circle, as this species requires daylight in its wintering areas. Adélies would be affected negatively by increasing snowfall, predicted to increase in certain areas owing to intrusions of warm, moist marine air due to changes in the Polar Jet Stream. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.

ABSTRACT: We carried out a study to investigate the presence of some protozoan parasites (Cryptosporidium sp., Giardia sp., Toxoplasma gondii) on three species of Antarctic penguins: Adélie (Pygoscelis adeliae), gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) and chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarctica) from different locations along the Antarctic Peninsula and the South Shetland Islands. Swabs and faeces samples were analysed by PCR assay for Cryptosporidium sp. and Giardia sp. while Toxoplasma was studied using serological methods from blood samples. We did not detect the presence of these organisms in the species studied. However, based on the upper values of the confidence intervals of the observed prevalence, their presence cannot be completely excluded. Copyright © 2010 Antarctic Science Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Penguins (Aves: Sphenisciformes) holdmuch interest for many people, including (but not limited to) scientists. According to results of molecular studies, penguin history began in the Cretaceous, but the oldest bones assigned to these birds are Paleocene in age. The first fossil representative of Sphenisciformes formally described was Palae-eudyptes antarcticus, and this event took place 150 years ago. Since that time, several dozens of species have been erected, though not all of them have stood a test of time. The 21st century entered new dynamics into the paleontology of penguins, and (importantly) it concerned both the new material, and new theories. This paper summarizes what we currently know about extinct penguins and indirectly suggests the most promising areas for further research.

ABSTRACT: We report the characterization of 25 microsatellite loci isolated from the macaroni penguin (Eudyptes chrysolophus). Thirteen loci were arranged into four multiplex sets for future genetic studies of macaroni penguin populations. All 25 loci were tested separately in each of four other penguin species [Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae), chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica), gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) and king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus)]. Between eight and 12 loci were polymorphic per species. These loci are expected to be useful for studies of population genetic structure in a range of penguin species. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Colourful plumages observed in many birds provide ideal systems for investigating the control and function of animal signals, because we can identify the molecular currency (e.g. pigments, tissue structures) and thus the challenges associated with the production of the trait. To date, most attention has been paid to the signalling costs and benefits of the common pigmentary (e.g. carotenoid- and melanin-based) plumage colours. However, in penguins, the colour of feathers of crests or patches of head plumage is based on an unusual fluorescent pigment, presently thought to be in the class of pterin pigments, which are typically found as colourants in other animals like butterflies and amphibians. These yellow-orange colours may be used in sexual or social communication, but to date little is known about the signalling potential of such ornaments. We collected yellow crest-feathers from adult male and female Snares Penguins (Eudyptes robustus) in two years (2002 and 2003) and examined differences in colour and pigment content as a function of year, sex, body size and body condition. Unlike the typical pattern of birds, crests of female Snares Penguins contained higher concentrations of pigments than those of males. In both years, yellower feathers in females contained more yellow pigment. Birds of both sexes grew yellower and more pigment-rich feathers in 2002 a year in which birds were in better condition than in 2003. Males with yellower crests also tended to be larger, heavier and in better condition, regardless of year. These results highlight the potential for yellow crests in Snares Penguins to serve as a condition-dependent indicator to conspecifics. Further work is needed to determine whether or not this plumage trait is a signal of social status or attractiveness, as colourful plumage patches appear to be in other penguin species. © 2009 Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union.

ABSTRACT: In birds, the chick's physical state at nest departure is critical for survival, especially for seabirds that shift from a terrestrial to a marine life. The timing of this life history transition should therefore be finely tuned by proximate factors reflecting the relative influence of parents and chicks. Using king penguins, Aptenodytes patagonicus, as a model, we investigated how food provisioning and chick developmental status and/or body condition interact with chick fledging behaviour to optimize the physical state at colony departure. During the month preceding colony departure, movements, developmental status and body condition were compared between naturally and experimentally fed chicks. Parents stopped feeding their moulting, obese chick on average 16 days before colony departure and no offspring anorexia was observed. All chicks left their feeding site at the time of moult end, indicating that complete feather development is a prerequisite for departing. The time between moult end and colony departure reduced both intra- and intergroup variation in body condition at departure, suggesting that this condition was optimized in terms of a trade-off between fat stores and buoyancy. After moult end, chicks increased their locomotor activity and energy expenditure, which contributes to the regulation of body condition. Our results indicate that the cessation of parental feeding does not trigger colony departure. Rather, the timing of departure depends on the chick's physical state, regardless of its recent feeding history. Thus, in king penguins, the parental decision to desert the chick seems to reflect a compromise between the offspring's body condition and its developmental status. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: As emperor penguins have no breeding territories, a key issue for both members of a pair is not to be separated until the egg is laid and transferred to the male. Both birds remain silent after mating and thereby reduce the risk of having the pair bond broken by unpaired birds. However, silence prevents finding each other if the pair is separated. Huddles - the key to saving energy in the cold and the long breeding fast - continuously form and break up, but not all birds are involved simultaneously. We studied the behaviour of four pairs before laying. Temperature and light intensity measurements allowed us to precisely detect the occurrence of huddling episodes and to determine the surrounding temperature. The four pairs huddled simultaneously for only 6 per cent of the time when weather conditions were harshest. Despite this asynchrony, the huddling behaviour and the resulting benefits were similar between pairs. By contrast, the huddling behaviour of mates was synchronized for 84 per cent of events. By coordinating their huddling behaviour during courtship despite the apparent confusion within a huddle and its ever-changing structure, both individuals save energy while securing their partnership. © 2009 The Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: 1. Modulating the adrenocortical response to stress and the corresponding mobilization of energy substrates allows animals to cope with energy-demanding challenges imposed by ecological constraints. Whether such a modulation occurs during the fledging process of the king penguin chick (Aptenodytes patagonicus) was examined. In this seabird species, fledging is associated with moult completion, prolonged fasting and transition from terrestrial to marine life. 2. Specifically, it was tested whether the adrenocortical and metabolic responses to a capture-handling stress i. depended on the developmental/moulting status of pre-fledging birds, ii. were affected by their nutritional status, and iii. were inter-related. 3. The adrenocortical response was 2-3 times lower at moult end and fledging than at the onset of moult, 1 month earlier. No direct evidence for a link between the adrenocortical response and moult-related changes in circulating thyroid hormones was obtained. 4. At the onset of moult, chicks were in a nutritional status corresponding to phase I of fasting whereas those at moult end and fledging were in phase II of fasting. Thus, the adrenocortical response depended on nutritional status, being blunted during phase II when body proteins were spared and fat stores preferentially mobilized. 5. The metabolic response to acute stress was characterized by an increase in plasma glucose, NEFA and uric acid and by a decrease in plasma β-hydroxybutyrate. Differences in this response between phase I and phase II fasting chicks suggest that the mix of energy substrates used to fuel energy demand during acute stress is the same as that routinely fuelling daily energy expenditure. We obtained no evidence for an interaction between corticosterone and metabolic responses. 6. Overall, the results suggest that, in pre-fledging king penguin chicks, the nutritional rather than the developmental/moulting status modulates the adrenocortical and metabolic responses to an acute stress. The possible adaptive function of the blunting of these responses by the time of fledging is discussed. © 2009 British Ecological Society.

ABSTRACT: Gentoo penguins Pygoscelis papua show considerable plasticity in their diet, diving, and foraging behaviors among colonies; we expected that they might exhibit similar variability over time, at a single site, since flexible foraging habits would provide a buffer against changes in prey availability. We examined interannual changes in the foraging strategies and diet of gentoo penguins in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, over 5 years with variable prey abundance. Antarctic krill Euphausia superba was the primary diet item, and fish the secondary, though the importance of these items varied among years. Diving behavior also varied over time: different dive depth distributions were observed among years. Nonetheless, chick-rearing success remained relatively constant, indicating that gentoo penguins were able to maintain chick provisioning by altering their foraging strategy among years. Variable abundance of krill in the region did not have observable impacts on the diet, foraging behaviors or chick-rearing success of gentoo penguins. We suggest that foraging plasticity may be one reason that gentoo penguin populations have remained stable in the region, while their congeners (P. antarctica and P. adeliae) with less flexible foraging strategies have declined. © Springer-Verlag 2009.

ABSTRACT: We investigated nutrient composition and the potential for greenhouse gas production in Antarctic penguin guano, ornithogenic soils and seal colony soils through a laboratory incubation experiment. Total organic carbon contents ranged from 0.2-14.7% and total nitrogen contents ranged from 0.05-3.60% across all the samples. Penguin guano and the soils had the δ13C org values of -28.4‰ to -22.8‰ and highly enriched δ15N values (8.2835.51‰), indicating a rapid N cycling in local ecosystems. The mean CO2 and CH4 emission rates from penguin guano were significantly higher than those from the soils under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. The CO2-C/TOC rate indicated that the bioavailability of TOC was markedly higher in penguin guano than in the soils. These soils showed higher N2O emission rates under anaerobic conditions, indicating that denitrification may be the major process in N 2O emission. The CO2 and CH4 emissions have a significant correlation with TOC in both penguin guano and the soils. Our results show that marine animal excreta are an important factor determining storage and composition of nutrients in coastal Antarctica, and that they may considerably affect current and future net fluxes of greenhouse gases in this region. © Antarctic Science Ltd 2009.

ABSTRACT: Flipper banding has long been the primary method to identify individual penguins, despite studies indicating that it may be detrimental to breeding success and survival. Our objectives were to measure the effects that flipper bands may have on diving performance of little penguins to determine whether the bands may be detrimental. We studied short-and long-term direct effects of flipper banding on diving behavior of free-ranging little penguins (Eudyptula minor) by comparing diving behavior before and after banding and by comparing diving performance of unbanded birds to those that had carried flipper bands for several years, respectively. Recently banded birds displayed increases in multiple variables following banding. Long-term banded penguins did not exhibit differences to their unbanded counterparts in most variables examined. Our findings are useful to those considering or reviewing the use of bands in penguin study and management. © 2009 The Wildlife Society.

ABSTRACT: The biological, serological, and genomic characterization of a paramyxovirus recently isolated from rock-hopper penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome) suggested that this virus represented a new avian paramyxovirus (APMV) group, APMV10. This penguin virus resembled other APMVs by electron microscopy; however, its viral hemagglutination (HA) activity was not inhibited by antisera against any of the nine defined APMV serotypes. In addition, antiserum generated against this penguin virus did not inhibit the HA of representative viruses of the other APMV serotypes. Sequence data produced using random priming methods revealed a genomic structure typical of APMV. Phylogenetic evaluation of coding regions revealed that amino acid sequences of all six proteins were most closely related to APMV2 and APMV8. The calculation of evolutionary distances among proteins and distances at the nucleotide level confirmed that APMV2, APMV8, and the penguin virus all were sufficiently divergent from each other to be considered different serotypes. We propose that this isolate, named APMV10/penguin/Falkland Islands/324/2007, be the prototype virus for APMV10. Because of the known problems associated with serology, such as antiserum cross-reactivity and one-way immunogenicity, in addition to the reliance on the immune response to a single protein, the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase, as the sole base for viral classification, we suggest the need for new classification guidelines that incorporate genome sequence comparisons.

ABSTRACT: In Polar Regions, the extent and dynamics of sea-ice are changing. This affects the ocean productivity which consecutively impacts plankton communities and polar top predators like penguins. Yet, the underlying behavioural and physiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we monitored the ecophysiological responses of Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) pairs during two seasons of contrasting timing of sea-ice retreat. Beside classical breeding parameters like foraging trip duration, body mass and reproductive success, we also investigated food-related stress (via plasma corticosterone concentration), nutritional state (via metabolite levels) and the use of penguins' habitat (via blood isotopic values). Body mass and reproductive success remained unchanged but foraging trips were shorter when sea-ice retreated earlier. Constant plasma corticosterone concentrations indicated that none of the feeding conditions resulted in a food-related stress. However metabolite levels were lower when sea-ice retreated early, suggesting that the foraging performance and the quality/quantity of food differed. Indeed isotopic ratios indicated that coastal prey like fish contributed more to the penguins' diet when sea-ice retreated prematurely. The early sea-ice retreat was related to higher chlorophyll concentrations, known to favour krill recruitment. Paradoxically, this was not associated to a higher krill contribution in the penguins' diet. We propose that a shift in the phytoplankton quality (rather than quantity), affecting krill recruitment, forced penguins to switch to more available prey like coastal fish. In some Antarctic regions, sea-ice is retreating earlier and earlier. In the present study, even though the timing of sea-ice retreat and the consecutive ocean productivity differed drastically between the 2 years, Adélie penguins were not severely affected because they were able to adjust their at-sea behaviour and thus maintained their body condition and reproductive success unchanged. This suggests that the timing of sea-ice retreat does not represent an important threat to populations of Adélie penguins at least as long as alternative resources are still available and other environmental parameters like winter sea-ice extent are not dramatically altered. © 2009 British Ecological Society.

ABSTRACT: Fresh egg mass (FEM) is an important measure as it relates to many allometric relationships. Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) eggs, as other bird eggs, begin to lose weight as soon as they are laid but their linear dimensions remain constant. The FEM of an Adélie penguin's egg can be estimated within 1% from the relationship FEM = 0.564 × LW2, where L is the length and W is the width. The constant 0.564 was calculated by weighing the eggs after replacing the air cell with water. The calculated mean egg mass agrees well with that obtained by weighing eggs after replacement of the air cell with water (r2 = 0.996). This method of estimating FEM based on linear measurements is easily applicable in the field. © Springer-Verlag 2009.

ABSTRACT: Populations of the recently split Northern Rockhopper Penguin Eudyptes moseleyi are restricted to Tristan da Cunha and Gough Island in the South Atlantic, and Amsterdam and St Paul in the Indian Ocean. The majority of the population is in the Atlantic (> 80%), but population trends at Tristan da Cunha and Gough are uncertain. Early records indicate "millions" of penguins used to occur at Tristan da Cunha and Gough Island. The most recent estimates indicate declines in excess of 90% for both Gough and the main island of Tristan that have occurred over at least 45 and 130 years, respectively. Numbers breeding at Inaccessible and Nightingale islands (TDC) also may have declined since the 1970s, albeit modestly, whereas numbers on Tristan appear stable over the last few decades. Current population estimates are 32,000-65,000 pairs at Gough, 18-27,000 at Inaccessible, 19,500 at Nightingale, and 3,200-4,500 at Tristan. Numbers and trends at Middle Island (TDC) are unknown. Middle Island supported an estimated 100,000 pairs in 1973, and recent observations suggest this colony is being impacted by competition for space with recently recolonising Subantarctic Fur Seals Arctocephalus tropicalis. Past human exploitation and the impact of introduced predators may be responsible for the historical decline in numbers at Tristan, but these factors cannot explain the sharp decrease (since the 1950s) at Gough Island. Overall, declines at Gough, Tristan, Nightingale and Inaccessible islands indicate a three-generation decline of > 50%. Taken in combination with recent decreases in Indian Ocean populations, the Northern Rockhopper Penguins is now categorised as globally 'Endangered'. Determining the causal factors responsible for these recent declines is an urgent priority. © 2009 BirdLife International.

ABSTRACT: In colonial species, it is often assumed that locations in the center of the colony are of highest quality and provide highest breeding success. We tested this prediction, known as the "central-periphery model," in a King Penguin colony in the subantarctic Crozet Archipelago. Breeding activity and survival of 150 penguins, fitted with transponder tags, were monitored over an entire breeding season. Among these 150 birds, 50 bred on the slope at the upper periphery of the colony, where the rates of predation and parasitism by ticks were high. Fifty birds bred in the center of the colony, where rates of predation and tick parasitism were low, and 50 bred at the lower end of the colony, where the rate of tick parasitism was low but predation and flooding were important risks. We predicted that the center of the colony should provide the safest breeding place and consequently be characterized by the highest breeding success and be used by the highest-quality individuals. Yet we found that penguins breeding in the center of the colony had the same breeding success as those at both peripheral locations. In addition, penguins breeding on the upper slope had a higher survival rate than penguins breeding at the center or bottom of the slope and were likely of higher quality. Our study does not support the central-periphery model and emphasizes the complexity behind the relationships among breeding site, breeding success, and individual quality. © 2009 by The Cooper Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: The inference of demographic parameters from genetic data has become an integral part of conservation studies. A group of Bayesian methods developed originally in population genetics, known as approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), has been shown to be particularly useful for the estimation of such parameters. These methods do not need to evaluate likelihood functions analytically and can therefore be used even while assuming complex models. In this paper we describe the ABC approach and identify specific parts of its algorithm that are being the subject of intensive studies in order to further expand its usability. Furthermore, we discuss applications of this Bayesian algorithm in conservation studies, providing insights on the potentialities of these tools. Finally, we present a case study in which we use a simple Isolation-Migration model to estimate a number of demographic parameters of two populations of yellow-eyed penguins (Megadyptes antipodes) in New Zealand. The resulting estimates confirm our current understanding of M. antipodes dynamic, demographic history and provide new insights into the expansion this species has undergone during the last centuries. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

ABSTRACT: Three Blue Penguins (Eudyptula minor) were rescued between July 2006 and January 2007 off the east coast of Auckland, New Zealand. They were taken to a rehabilitation center, where they subsequently died in May 2007 and were submitted for necropsy. There was unilateral enlargement of the salt glands with disseminated small, pale, and firm foci in all birds. Histologic examination of the affected glands demonstrated the presence of multifocal granulomas and areas of severe squamous metaplasia of the collecting ducts. The remaining gland had areas of hyperplasia, dysplasia, and necrosis with a severe granulomatous inflammatory reaction. Intralesional gram-negative bacteria were detected, but, unfortunately, bacterial culture was unrewarding. No further cases were observed in penguins in the subsequent year, and the primary cause of the salt gland adenitis remains uncertain. © Wildlife Disease Association 2010.

ABSTRACT: Recording the activity of animals as they migrate or forage has proven hugely advantageous to understanding how animals use their environment. Where animals cannot be directly observed, the problem remains of how to identify distinct behaviours that represent an animal's decision-making process. An excellent example of this problem is that of foraging penguins, which travel to sea to find prey to provision their young. Without direct sampling of the prey field, we cannot calibrate patterns of movement with prey capture, and therefore we cannot determine how different activities link to decision-making. To overcome this, we use a hidden markov model (HMM), which is a machine-learning technique that seeks to identify the underlying states of a system from observable outputs. We apply HMM to determine classes of behaviour from repetitive dives. We take dive data from 103 breeding macaroni penguins at Bird Island, South Georgia, for which we have measures of weight gain over a trip. We identify two classes of behaviour; those of short-shallow and long-deep dives. Using these two behaviours, we calculate the transition probabilities between these states and analyse these data to determine what predicts variation in the transition probabilities. We found that the stage of reproduction during a season, the sex and year of an individual influenced the probability of transition between long-deep and short-shallow sequential dives. We also found differences in the hourly transition rates between the four reproductive stages (incubation, broodguard, crèche and premoult) over a daily cycle. We conclude that this application of HMMs for behavioural switching is potentially useful for other species and other types of recorded behaviour. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: This book looks at the penguins - an enduringly popular and fascinating group of birds. Penguins are associated in the public consciousness with the icecap of the south pole, and we are all familiar with images of male Emperor Penguins clustered together through the long night of the Antarctic winter as they incubate the single egg on their feet. However, several species occur in warmer regions further north, in southern Africa, South America, Australia, New Zealand and even the Galapagos. All are flightless but are beautifully adapted swimmers and divers, and many are able to travel at high speeds on dry land by means of spectacular leaps and belly-slides. Most species breed in close-knit colonies and exhibit a complex system of social behaviour. This book looks at all aspects of penguin evolution, biology, ecology and sociobiology, as well as conservation issues affecting the group. It is illustrated with line drawings and black and white photographs, and has a full-colour photographic section. © 2003 text by Lloyd S Davis and Martin Renner.

ABSTRACT: During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when blubber oil fuelled house lamps, the king penguin population at Macquarie Island was reduced from two very large (perhaps hundreds of thousands of birds) colonies to about 3000 birds. One colony, located on the isthmus when the island was discovered in 1810, was extinct by 1894 and it took about 100 years for king penguins to re-establish a viable breeding population there. Here we document this recovery. The first eggs laid at Gadget Gully on the isthmus were recorded in late February 1995 but in subsequent years egg laying took place earlier between November and February (this temporal discontinuity is a consequence of king penguin breeding behaviour). The first chick was hatched in April 1995 but the first fledging was not raised until the following breeding season in October 1996. The colony increased on average 66% per annum in the five years between 1995 and 2000. King penguins appear resilient to catastrophic population reductions, and as the island's population increases, it is likely that other previously abandoned breeding sites will be reoccupied. © Antarctic Science Ltd 2009.

ABSTRACT: In 1992 and 1993, unknown diseases killed 250-300 King Penguins Aptenodytes patagonicus and an estimated 5-10 thousand Macaroni Penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus at sub-Antarctic Marion Island. At the same island, an outbreak of avian cholera Pasteurella multocida during November 2004 killed approximately 2000 Macaroni Penguins at Kildalkey Bay. Other breeding colonies of Macaroni Penguins and other species of seabirds at the island were not affected at the time. Procedures for reporting and dealing with such outbreaks are now being developed. © Marine Ornithology 2009.

ABSTRACT: A 1-year-old female yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes) was diagnosed with chronic discospondylitis on the basis of clinical signs and results of hematologic tests, radiography, and computed tomography. Despite significant destruction of the affected vertebral bodies and gross malformation of the spine, neurologic function was unaffected. Treatment with antibiotics, antifungals, and swimming physiotherapy was attempted, but the bird died after 40 days of hospitalization. Histopathologic lesions observed at necropsy were severe chronic discospondylitis, chronic granulomatous tracheitis, proventricular ulceration, and adrenal hemorrhage. The suspected inciting cause of the discospondylitis was a reported population-wide oral stomatitis that affects yellow-eyed penguin chicks. © 2010 Association of Avian Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: The penguin colony at Puñihuil Islands, southern Chile, is the only known place where hundreds of Magellanic (Spheniscus magellanicus) and Humboldt (Spheniscus humboldti) penguins nest together. Current jurisdictional limitations leave the waters around the colony unprotected, and penguins are vulnerable to accidental drowning in gillnets. Ecotourism is an important industry for the small community nearby, but residents are frustrated that there is no mechanism to protect penguins and ecotourism. Designation of a Marine Reserve, with a participatory management plan crossing institutional boundaries, could offer protection to both wildlife and human livelihoods, and serve as a model for protecting natural capital. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: We determined the δ15N and δ13C values of individual amino acids (AAs) isolated from chick blood of 4 penguin species that forage in different oceanic regions (from the subtropics of the Indian Ocean to Antarctica) to test if: (1) the δ15N values of phenylalanine (δ15Nphe) revealed different foraging areas among the species; (2) the difference between glutamic acid and phenylalanine δ15N values (δδ15N glu-phe) accurately predicted trophic levels; and (3) the δ13C value of AAs could resolve species foraging locations, similar to bulk δ13C values. The δ13C values of all AAs decreased with latitude, were positively correlated with bulk δ13C data, and, therefore, tracked the isotopic baseline. However, we were not able to discern additional ecological information from these δ13C values. In contrast, the δ15N values of AAs distinguished the isotopic value of the nitrogen at the base of the food web from the trophic level of the consumer, providing new insight for the study of the trophic ecology of seabirds. The difference in the bulk δ15N values of northern and southern rockhopper penguins Eudyptes chrysocome ssp. was due to both a difference in their foraging location (different δ15Nphe) and their trophic levels (different Δδ15Nglu-phe). The δ15Nphe values of king Aptenodytes patagonicus and Adélie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae were higher than those of rockhoppers, which could reflect a foraging on mesopelagic prey for king penguins and, in the highly productive Antarctic shelf waters, for Adelie penguins. The Δδ15Nglu-phe accurately reflected the relative trophic level of penguins, but further work is required to determine the trophic enrichment factors for compound-specific isotope analysis.

ABSTRACT: Correlations between female investment in egg production and age, breeding experience and laying date have been reported in several seabird species. In general, clutch and egg sizes increase with female age and breeding experience but decrease with laying date. Positive correlations of clutch and egg size with age and breeding experience can be caused by an increase in reproductive investment with maturation or they may be an artefact of lower survival rates for individuals with poor-quality phenotypes. Negative correlations of clutch and egg size with laying date might signal an adaptive reduction in egg production or be due in part to variation among individuals. We examined the interactions of female age, breeding experience, laying date and clutch and egg size in Adélie Penguins Pygoscelis adeliae. Breeding experience strongly affected clutch size with 87.3% of all one-egg clutches laid by first-time breeders. In addition, increasing age had a positive influence on egg size and was associated with earlier laying dates. However, there was little evidence to suggest that either clutch or egg sizes are influenced by laying date. Laying dates and clutch and egg sizes did not affect a female's probability of returning to breed in the following year, indicating that increased investment is a product of maturation and not of the loss of poor-quality breeders from the population. Our results suggest that as female Adélie Penguins gain foraging and breeding experience they are able to initiate breeding earlier, to lay complete clutches of two eggs and to lay larger eggs. © 2009 British Ornithologists' Union.

ABSTRACT: Little Penguins Eudyptula minor have been viewed by tourists at a penguin landing site (Jetty Bay) on Montague Island since 1991. Numbers of penguins coming ashore at Jetty Bay during November in the evening decreased significantly between 1994 and 1998 from approximately 250 to 66 per night, compared with no reduction in numbers coming ashore at a control site 600 m south (-270 to 284 per night). After watching penguins coming ashore at Jetty Bay, tourists walked to their boat along a roadway that was also used by penguins. The decrease in penguin numbers landing at Jetty Bay may be partly attributable to disturbance from tourists, because numbers at the control site and numbers of breeding pairs on the island showed little change. High and dense Kikuyu Grass Pennisetum clandestinum near Jetty Bay may also have caused penguin numbers to decrease during this period. In March 2001 a viewing platform and walkway were constructed at Jetty Bay, which enabled visitors to depart from the viewing platform to the tour boat without disturbing penguins. In November 2002, 37 penguins came ashore per night at Jetty Bay compared with 194 at the control site. There was a non-significant increase in numbers of penguins coming ashore at Jetty Bay between 2002 and 2006. The lack of recovery in numbers of penguins coming ashore at Jetty Bay after 2001 may be caused by the lag time for recovery as nesting penguins slowly return to the Jetty Bay area following cessation of disturbance from tourists and/or by the high, dense Kikuyu Grass in the Jetty Bay area. Work is underway to remove kikuyu in this area and replace it with native vegetation. Monitoring numbers of Little Penguins coming ashore in November at both sites should continue in order to determine responses to management actions.

ABSTRACT: Plasma corticosterone concentrations increase when birds experience a stressor, and in this study we quantified variation in corticosterone responses for the first time in a species of free-living bird. Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) nesting at Cape Bird on Ross Island in Antarctica were sampled on three occasions. Penguins with relatively low or high corticosterone responses on the first occasion had consistently low or high responses, as previously found for great tits and chickens. A model for birds is proposed in which birds with low corticosterone responses and proactive personalities are likely to be more successful (have greater fitness) in constant or predictable conditions, whilst birds with reactive personalities and high corticosterone responses will be more successful in changing or unpredictable conditions. There is thus no linear relationship between the size of a corticosterone response and fitness. Whilst the absolute magnitude of corticosterone responses varies markedly across species of birds, coefficients of variation are similar. Individual corticosterone responses are generally repeatable, with significant statistical repeatabilities for 30 min corticosterone concentrations and integrated corticosterone concentrations in the Adelie penguin, great tit and chicken. Coefficients of variation in corticosterone responses between birds and power analyses were used to provide a rule of thumb for determining differences between groups of birds in mean corticosterone concentrations to enable statistical analyses to have acceptable levels of statistical power for given sample sizes. It is suggested that power analyses and this rule of thumb be adopted in future investigations of corticosterone responses in birds. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Aspergillus spp. fungal infections are the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in captive penguins. Itraconazole has been the drug of choice for both therapeutic and prophylactic treatment; however, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters can be highly variable in different species, and it has not been evaluated in penguins. In this study, four preliminary steady state trials were performed to compare two oral formulations of itraconazole (commercial capsules compared with generic bulk compounded powder) at two different dosages (6 or 12 mg/kg once a day) administered in fish to small groups of captive Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti). Building on this data, a final steady state trial was performed with the use of a 7 mg/kg oral dosage twice a day of commercial capsules given in fish to a group of 15 penguins. With sparse sampling, blood was drawn for testing from small subsets of each treatment group at 4-7 time points in the 24-hr period after the final dose of itraconazole on day 14. Steady state plasma concentrations of itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole, the major metabolite, were determined by reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Treatment with the generic bulk compounded product resulted in plasma levels of itraconazole that were undetectable for 26 out of 30 blood samples, compared with seven out of 20 blood samples for the commercial product at the same dosage. On the basis of study results, an estimated oral dosage of either 8.5 mg/kg twice a day or 20 mg/kg once a day of the commercial itraconazole capsules given in fish would produce adequate steady-state therapeutic blood levels in Humboldt penguins.

ABSTRACT: In biparental species, the response of parents when their mates are disadvantaged is highly variable. Moreover, experimental studies on parental effort have mainly focused on short-lived birds whose breeding constraints largely differ from those of long-lived species such as seabirds. We investigated the short- and long-term consequences of handicapping one parent within Adélie penguin, Pygoscelis adeliae, pairs. We also examined whether handicapped mates and offspring could convey cues informing the other parent of the need to increase breeding effort and whether this parent adjusted its behaviour accordingly. While handicapped penguins foraged for longer and lost more mass than controls, partners, fasting for longer at the nest, did not change their behaviour or lose more mass suggesting that they compensated at least for themselves. Information exchange was increased between mates after the return of handicapped females from foraging. However, partner males did not respond to this. Handicapped-pair chicks, which were smaller than control chicks, did not increase their solicitation rate for food. In the subsequent breeding season, compared to controls, 40% of previously handicapped females laid fewer eggs, the resight rate of previously handicapped males was lower and pair instability was higher. No additional cues seemed to be detected by Adélie penguins when their mates were handicapped and, for handicapped-pair offspring, the cost associated wih a higher solicitation rate was probably too high for these small chicks to support. Consequently, we found no compensatory behaviour from partners in this long-lived species: handicapped individuals and offspring both supported the whole additional cost in both the short term and the long term. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: In altricial and semi-altricial species, asynchronous hatching gives the first chicks to hatch an initial advantage over other siblings and often leads to the elimination of the smallest chicks. Both baseline corticosterone and acute stress-induced corticosterone levels have been shown to be higher in food deprived chicks than in chicks fed ad libitum. However, first-hatched chicks have also been shown to exhibit higher corticosterone levels than last-hatched chicks, suggesting an influence of the initial differences between eggs on corticosterone levels. We subjected single-chicks of southern rockhopper penguins Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome to a standardised capture-stress protocol. In this species having very dimorphic two-egg clutches, we examined whether corticosterone levels were different between the two chick categories and tested for the effect of body condition controlled by the chick category. Neither body sizes, nor corticosterone levels differed between A- and B-chicks at 18. days. In contrast to baseline corticosterone levels, acute stress-induced levels of corticosterone were negatively correlated to body condition: chicks with a good body condition had lower acute stress-induced levels of corticosterone than chicks with a poor condition, whatever the chick category. Our results do not support the idea that initial differences in egg characteristics could drive the difference in corticosterone levels between siblings. On the contrary, they show that the A-egg of rockhopper penguins has, when reared alone, the same intrinsic potential to develop into a fledged chick as the B-egg. Later differences in body condition appear to lead to variation in the acute stress-induced levels of corticosterone. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The identification of demographically independent populations and the recognition of management units have been greatly facilitated by the continuing advances in genetic tools. Managements units now play a key role in short-term conservation management programmes of declining species, but their importance in expanding populations receives comparatively little attention. The endangered yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes) expanded its range from the subantarctic to New Zealand's South Island a few hundred years ago and this new population now represents almost half of the species' total census size. This dramatic expansion attests to M. antipodes' high dispersal abilities and suggests the species is likely to constitute a single demographic population. Here we test this hypothesis of panmixia by investigating genetic differentiation and levels of gene flow among penguin breeding areas using 12 autosomal microsatellite loci along with mitochondrial control region sequence analyses for 350 individuals. Contrary to our hypothesis, however, the analyses reveal two genetically and geographically distinct assemblages: South Island vs. subantarctic populations. Using assignment tests, we recognize just two first-generation migrants between these populations (corresponding to a migration rate of < 2%), indicating that ongoing levels of long-distance migration are low. Furthermore, the South Island population has low genetic variability compared to the subantarctic population. These results suggest that the South Island population was founded by only a small number of individuals, and that subsequent levels of gene flow have remained low. The demographic independence of the two populations warrants their designation as distinct management units and conservation efforts should be adjusted accordingly to protect both populations. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The Snares Penguin (Eudyptes robustus) breeds only on the Snares Islands, New Zealand, and is vagrant throughout the New Zealand region and southeast Australia. The only previous record outside this area was one in the Falkland Islands in 1988. We report the unusual occurrence of two Snares Penguins in the same colony in the Falkland Islands in 2008, and discuss identification issues. Vagrant penguins demonstrate the incredible dispersal ability of these flightless birds. © 2010 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Heart rate (fH) measurement offers the possibility to monitor energy expenditure (EE) in wild animals if the EE/fH relationship for the species, physiological stages and activities of interest is known. This relationship has been extensively studied using oxygen consumption rate (V̇o2) measurement in captive, repeatedly handled king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus). Unfortunately, the potential effects of stress on the observed relationships resulting from handling and confinement were not considered. This study is the first involving undisturbed animals, and determines the EE/fH relationship in naturally fasting and freely incubating or captivity-acclimatized male and female king penguins. EE determination was based on (1) the measurement of body mass loss during periods of phase II fasting, and (2) the calculation of its energy equivalent from changes in body composition, i.e. 23.9 kJg-1. fH levels in freely incubating and captivity-acclimatized birds were found to be 50-70% lower than those previously reported for resting king penguins during V̇o2 measurements. Significant EE/fH relationships were found in freely incubating and captive males and females (R 2=0.59 to 0.84), with no difference observed between genders. The best overall relationship was obtained by including fasting duration (t, days) in the model: EE=818+43.7XfH+36.3t- 1.4tXfH (R 2=0.91). This equation yielded EE estimates approximately 26% higher than the previously reported 'best' predictive equation in king penguins, and even more so when fH was low. This result suggests that stress induces a disproportionate increase of fH vs O2 consumption, and that the use of EE/fH relationships obtained in stressed birds could lead to underestimated EE values.

ABSTRACT: Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella and macaroni penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus are the two main land-based krill Euphausia superba consumers in the northern Scotia Sea. Using a combination of concurrent at-sea (predator observations, net hauls and multi-frequency acoustics), and land-based (animal tracking and diet analysis) techniques, we examined variability in the foraging ecology of these sympatric top predators during the austral summer and autumn of 2004. Krill availability derived from acoustic surveys was low during summer, increasing in autumn. During the breeding season, krill occurred in 80% of fur seal diet samples, with fish remains in 37% of samples. Penguin diets contained the highest proportion of fish in over 20 years of routine monitoring (46% by mass; particularly the myctophid Electrona antarctica), with krill (33%) and amphipods (Themisto gaudichaudii; 21%) also occurring. When constrained by the need to return and feed their offspring both predator species foraged to the northwest of South Georgia, consistent with an area of high macrozooplankton biomass, but fur seals were apparently more successful at exploiting krill. When unconstrained by chick-rearing (during March) penguins foraged close to the Shag Rocks shelf-break, probably exploiting the high daytime biomass of fish in this area. Penguins and seals are able to respond differently to periods of reduced krill abundance (in terms of variability in diet and foraging behaviour), without detriment to the breeding success of either species. This highlights the importance of myctophid fish as an alternative trophic pathway for land-based predators in the Scotia Sea ecosystem. © Springer-Verlag 2009.

ABSTRACT: In sexually dimorphic species, the sex of the offspring may induce different constraints for parents. At the same time, within pairs, males and females may have conflicting optimal reproductive strategies. As a result, they may adjust their level of parental investment differently according to the sex of the young. In this study, we examined whether Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) chicks were sexually dimorphic and whether parents adjusted their parental investment accordingly. Male chicks were on average approximately 10% heavier than female chicks but not larger. Despite the presumed additional cost associated with male chick growth, no fitness cost differences were observed between parents rearing 1 chick whatever its sex: Adult body mass changes and resight rates during the subsequent breeding season were similar. However, the sex of offspring affected the duration of foraging trips during the early guard stage: At this stage, female adults rearing a female chick performed longer foraging trips than female adults rearing a male chick and males rearing either a male or a female chick. We propose that, because female adults present a lower survival rate after a breeding attempt, they are more prone to modify their level of parental investment than male adults. Moreover, the modulation of the foraging behavior by female adults according to the sex of the chick is likely to reduce intraspecific competition at a time when resource availability at sea is not optimal and when food requirement for female chicks may be lower than for male chicks.

ABSTRACT: The Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) breeds in large, noisy Antarctic colonies and has evolved a communication system of complex intra- and inter-sexual visual and vocal behaviours. The Ecstatic Display Call (EDC) given by males whilst at the breeding colony is composed of introductory beats, short repeated syllables and a climactic long syllable. Here, we show that spectral qualities of the short syllables of the EDC can predict body condition and breeding success and suggest that in addition to its role in territory defence, the EDC may function as an honest signal of male quality for female mate choice. In the short repeated syllables frequency modulation, mean frequency, and pitch were all significantly lower in birds of better condition, with frequency modulation changing concomitantly with changing condition during the breeding season. Furthermore, during the period of mate attraction, a male's frequency modulation predicted both his latency to pair and likelihood of successfully breeding. Due to the long incubation fasts in this species we propose that female Adélie penguins may reliably use frequency modulation of the EDC as a potentially honest signal of early season male condition and the likelihood of a successful breeding outcome. © 2009 Brill.

ABSTRACT: This paper traces the Soviet responses to initiatives of international scientific institutions for collaborative research in the Antarctic dating from the International Geophysical Year (IGY) through to the formation of the Special Committee for Antarctic Research (SCAR) and the extension of the IGY for a year during the International Geophysical Cooperation. It demonstrates the consistently positive attitudes of the USSR to these initiatives and the steps that were taken at the national level to enable it to continue international collaboration. Other countries with interests in the Antarctic conjectured whether the Soviets had a long term strategy for continuing their presence in the South Polar region. The evidence suggests that from the day the Soviets set foot on the Antarctic continent, they had no intention of leaving. © Cambridge University Press 2009.

ABSTRACT: Mycobacterium intracellulare (MIT) was diagnosed postmortem by culture and supporting histopathology in seven birds from a flock of little blue penguins (Eudyptula minor) at the Henry Doorly Zoo (HDZ). These birds represented 20% of the deaths in the population over a 4 yr period. Clinical signs in affected birds included severe respiratory distress characterized by open-mouth breathing with chronic debilitation. On exam, plaques were noted in the larynx, trachea, and soft tissue of the caudal oropharynx. Index cases were identified on necropsy in two birds on loan to another institution in 2003. Following a case confirmed antemortem at the HDZ, a three-drug protocol of rifampin (15 mg/kg p.o. s.i.d.), ethambutol (15 mg/kg p.o. s.i.d.), and clarithromycin (10 mg/kg p.o. s.i.d.) was started on this bird in 2004 and extended to the entire flock in 2005. Gastric wash, fecal samples, and throat plaques were obtained antemortem on five birds within the flock, selected because of the presence of oral plaques, and tested by culture followed by a polymerase chain reaction assay. MIT was detected in gastric washes from four birds and in throat plaques from all five. Three more birds died during treatment. After the seventh bird died, antimicrobial susceptibility testing performed in July 2007 indicated that the MIT was now resistant to most antibiotics tested, including rifampin and ethambutol. The treatment regimen was changed to minocycline (10 mg/kg p.o. b.i.d.) and clarithromycin (10 mg/kg p.o. s.i.d.). Oral plaques were not seen on monthly rechecks of the flock through November 2008. The proposed mechanism of transmission is exposure to wild birds but the source has not been determined. These cases of avian mycobacteriosis caused by MIT are the first known cases reported in little blue penguins. © 2009 American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Penguins are adapted to live in extreme environments, but they can be highly sensitive to climate change, which disrupts penguin life history strategies when it alters the weather, oceanography and critical habitats. For example, in the southwest Atlantic, the distributional range of the ice-obligate emperor and Adélie penguins has shifted poleward and contracted, while the ice-intolerant gentoo and chinstrap penguins have expanded their range southward. In the Southern Ocean, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation and the Southern Annular Mode are the main modes of climate variability that drive changes in the marine ecosystem, ultimately affecting penguins. The interaction between these modes is complex and changes over time, so that penguin responses to climate change are expected to vary accordingly, complicating our understanding of their future population processes. Penguins have long life spans, which slow microevolution, and which is unlikely to increase their tolerance to rapid warming. Therefore, in order that penguins may continue to exploit their transformed ecological niche and maintain their current distributional ranges, they must possess adequate phenotypic plasticity. However, past species-specific adaptations also constrain potential changes in phenology, and are unlikely to be adaptive for altered climatic conditions. Thus, the paleoecological record suggests that penguins are more likely to respond by dispersal rather than adaptation. Ecosystem changes are potentially most important at the borders of current geographic distributions, where penguins operate at the limits of their tolerance; species with low adaptability, particularly the ice-obligates, may therefore be more affected by their need to disperse in response to climate and may struggle to colonize new habitats. While future sea-ice contraction around Antarctica is likely to continue affecting the ice-obligate penguins, understanding the responses of the ice-intolerant penguins also depends on changes in climate mode periodicities and interactions, which to date remain difficult to reproduce in general circulation models. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: We measured daily energy expenditure (DEE) continuously for a whole year in a free ranging bird, the macaroni penguin Eudyptes chrysolophus. We combined these measurements with concurrently recorded foraging behaviour, and literature information on body mass and dietary factors to estimate prey consumption rates and foraging success. DEE was at a maximum during late chick-rearing but was equally high during all other active phases of the breeding season. DEE was approximately 4×resting metabolic rate, which accords with established theory and suggests a common 'energetic ceiling' throughout the summer period. However, whether this represents a maximum in physiological capacity, or a rate which optimises fitness is still unclear. Rates of prey consumption and foraging success followed different patterns from daily energy expenditure. Daily prey consumption was high as the penguins prepared for long fasts associated with moulting and incubation but relatively low during chick-rearing, when foraging areas were restricted and foraging success lower. It appears that the energy intake of macaroni penguins is subject to extrinisic or environmental constraints rather than to intrinsic physiological limits. © 2009 J. Avian Biol.

ABSTRACT: Following recent phylogenetic work, Rockhopper Penguins were suggested to consist of two or three species. For the Southern Rockhopper Penguin Eudyptes c. chrysocome, sexual dimorphism has not been studied in detail, and only a few previous studies on penguins have investigated sexual dimorphism in immatures and chicks. Using data in the literature, we examined whether the sexual dimorphism of adults varies among the three taxa of Rockhopper Penguins and then we investigated the most reliable measurements to sex adult Rockhopper Penguins. We observed that bill length is the most useful measurement to separate males from females. To allow for sex discrimination In the field, we also examined a large dataset of Southern Rockhopper Penguins from New Island, Falkland Islands, including adults sexed via observation of behaviour, and immatures and chicks sexed genetically. We found that male adults and immatures were larger than females in bill length and bill depth and, to a lesser degree, in flipper lengths. We thus derived discriminant functions from bill length and bill depth and correctly sexed 96.2% of adults and 91.8% of immatures. In newly hatched chicks, males had a longer bill than females, but sexing was only successful for 63.5% of hatchlings. Just before the crèche age (18 and 19 days) and after the pre-fledging moult (55 days and older), all morphological measurements of chicks were significantly different between sexes, and sex determination was successful for 68.2% and 84.3% of chicks in these age groups, respectively. Consistently among age groups, bill length was the most dimorphic character in this population.

ABSTRACT: Foraging strategies play a key role in breeding effort. Little is known, however, about their connection with hormonal and nutritional states, especially when breeding constraints vary. Here, we experimentally increased foraging costs and thus breeding constraints by handicapping Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) with dummy devices representing 3-4% of the penguins' crosssectional area. We examined food-related stress (via plasma corticosterone concentration) and nutritional state (via metabolite levels). Concurrently, we investigated the use of ecological niches via the isotopic signature of red blood cells indicating the trophic position (δ15N) and the spatial distribution (δ13C) of penguins. Handicapped birds performed ∼70% longer foraging trips and lost ∼60% more body mass than controls and their partners. However, corticosterone levels and the nutritional state were unchanged. The isotopic signature revealed that males and females differed in their foraging behaviour: upper trophic levels contributed more in the males' diet, who foraged in more pelagic areas. Handicapped and partner birds adopted the same strategy at sea: a shift towards higher δ13C values suggested that they foraged in more coastal areas than controls. This change in foraging decisions may optimize feeding time by decreasing travelling time. This may partly compensate for the presumed lower foraging efficiency of handicapped birds and for the energetic debt of their partners who had to fast ∼70% longer on the nest. We propose that this flexible use of ecological niches may allow birds facing increased breeding constraints to avoid chronic stress and to minimize the impact on their body condition.

ABSTRACT: Central-place foraging seabirds alter the availability of their prey around colonies, forming a "halo" of reduced prey access that ultimately constrains population size. This has been indicated indirectly by an inverse correlation between colony size and reproductive success, numbers of conspecifics at other colonies within foraging range, foraging effort (i.e. trip duration), diet quality and colony growth rate. Although ultimately mediated by density dependence relative to food through intraspecific exploitative or interference competition, the proximate mechanism involved has yet to be elucidated. Herein, we show that Adélie penguin Pygoscelis adeliae colony size positively correlates to foraging trip duration and metabolic rate, that the metabolic rate while foraging may be approaching an energetic ceiling for birds at the largest colonies, and that total energy expended increases with trip duration although uncompensated by increased mass gain. We propose that a competition-induced reduction in prey availability results in higher energy expenditure for birds foraging in the halo around large colonies, and that to escape the halo a bird must increase its foraging distance. Ultimately, the total energetic cost of a trip determines the maximum successful trip distance, as on longer trips food acquired is used more for self maintenance than for chick provisioning. When the net cost of foraging trips becomes too high, with chicks receiving insufficient food, chick survival suffers and subsequent colony growth is limited. Though the existence of energetic studies of the same species at multiple colonies is rare, because foraging metabolic rate increases with colony size in at least two other seabird species, we suggest that an energetic constraint to colony size may generally apply to other seabirds. © 2009 Journal of Avian Biology.

ABSTRACT: There is an increasing awareness that the long-term viability of endemic island populations is negatively affected by genetic factors associated with population bottlenecks and/or persistence at small population size. Here we use contemporary samples and historic museum specimens (collected 1888-1938) to estimate the effective population size (Ne) for the endangered yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes) in South Island, New Zealand, and evaluate the genetic concern for this iconic species. The South Island population of M. antipodes-constituting almost half of the species' census size-is thought to be descended from a small number of founders that reached New Zealand just a few hundred years ago. Despite intensive conservation measures, this population has shown dramatic fluctuations in size over recent decades. We compare estimates of the harmonic mean Ne for this population, obtained using one moment and three likelihood based-temporal methods, including one method that simultaneously estimates migration rate. Evaluation of the Ne estimates reveals a harmonic mean Ne in the low hundreds. Additionally, the inferred low immigration rates (m = 0. 003) agree well with contemporary migration rate estimates between the South Island and subantarctic populations of M. antipodes. The low Ne of South Island M. antipodes is likely affected by strong fluctuations in population size, and high variance in reproductive success. These results show that genetic concerns for this population are valid and that the long-term viability of this species may be compromised by reduced adaptive potential. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

ABSTRACT: Concerns have been expressed over the impact of flipper banding on the survival and reproductive performance of penguins. This study compared the breeding success of banded and unbanded African Penguins Spheniscus demersus at Boulders Beach, South Africa, in 2006. It was based on 100 nests; 50 had at least one banded adult and 50 had no banded adults. Besides flipper banding, other variables considered were extent of vegetation cover, proximity to tourist path, burrow depth, and either sand or clay substratum. There were no significant differences in breeding success between the different nest types or between banded and unbanded penguins, suggesting that once an individual reaches the level of fitness required to breed, banding does not affect the outcome of breeding by African Penguins. © NISC Pty Ltd.

ABSTRACT: We measured breeding performance of little penguins Eudyptula minor at Phillip Island, Victoria, Australia, during a 21-year period. All birds considered in this paper (n=307) were of known age (2-22 y) and sex, and most were of known, or closely-estimated, pair-bond status (1-8 mates per bird; pair-bond durations 1-13 y). Breeding dates and breeding performance varied markedly from year to year; measures of annual performance were not associated with early breeding. Measures of individual breeding performance (clutch-size, hatching success, chick masses and productivity) were related to early laying, parental age, and duration of pair-bond. Dependence of breeding performance on parental age was curvilinear, levelling off at about 8 y of age. Productivity declined significantly among birds older than 8 y; this decline was not due to events in the last year of breeding ("terminal illness"). Breeding performance increased with duration of pair-bond at least through y 5. Early breeding was significantly related to age and duration of pair-bond. Most of these relationships were stronger among males than among females, and many of them were not significant when females were considered alone. After controlling for other factors, breeding performance varied significantly among birds, but autocorrelations were low and limited to intervals of one year. Parental quality (defined for birds studied in six or more years as the individual bird term in a GLM for productivity controlling for other factors) was not correlated with lifespan or other demographic parameters, but high-quality birds were less prone to change mates and burrows than low-quality birds. We know of no previous study in which simultaneous effects of laying date, age and pair-bond duration on breeding performance were measured, while controlling for year, individual quality and terminal illness. © 2009 Journal of Avian Biology.

ABSTRACT: Ornithogenic soils (N = 97) dated up to 7000 Before Present (BP) were sampled in 16 relict and modern breeding colonies of Adélie penguin along the Victoria Land coast (Ross Sea, Antarctica). Taxonomic identification of fish otoliths (N = 677) recovered in these soils allowed to identify the Antarctic silverfish as the most eaten prey (90.1%) throughout the investigated period. A morphometric analysis of the otoliths revealed that the Adélie penguin primarily selected prey averaging 67.23 ± 23 mm of standard length. Temporal distribution of Pleuragramma antarcticum showed a peak between 2,000 and 4,000 years BP, a period corresponding to the maximum spread of Adélie penguin in the Victoria Land. Possible explanations of the variations of the abundance of the fish prey in the diet are discussed in the context of the paleoclimatic events and as possible consequences of dietary shifts due to the temporal variation of prey availability in the Ross Sea ecosystem. © Springer-Verlag 2009.

ABSTRACT: Physiological measurements of both stress and sex hormones are often used to estimate the consequences of natural or human-induced change in ecological studies of various animals. Different methods of hormone measurement exist, potentially explaining variation in results across studies; methods should be cross-validated to ensure that they correlate. We directly compared faecal and plasma hormone measurements for the first time in a wild free-living species, the Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae). Blood and faecal samples were simultaneously collected from individual penguins for comparison and assayed for testosterone and corticosterone (or their metabolites). Sex differences and variability within each measure, and correlation of values across measures were compared. For both hormones, plasma samples showed greater variation than faecal samples. Males had higher mean corticosterone concentrations than females, but the difference was only statistically significant in faecal samples. Plasma testosterone, but not faecal testosterone, was significantly higher in males than females. Correlation between sample types was poor overall, and weaker in females than in males, perhaps because measures from plasma represent hormones that are both free and bound to globulins, whereas measures from faeces represent only the free portion. Faecal samples also represent a cumulative measure of hormones over time, as opposed to a plasma 'snapshot' concentration. Our data indicate that faecal sampling appears more suitable for assessing baseline hormone concentrations, whilst plasma sampling may best define immediate responses to environmental events. Consequently, future studies should ensure that they select the most appropriate matrix and method of hormone measurement to answer their research questions. © Springer-Verlag 2009.

ABSTRACT: Four species of penguin breed regularly at South Africa's Prince Edward Islands: king penguin Aptenodytes patagonicus, gentoo penguin Pygoscelis papua, macaroni penguin Eudyptes chrysolophus and southern rockhopper penguin E. chrysocome. In December 2008, it was estimated that some 65 000 pairs of king penguins were incubating eggs at Marion Island, the larger of the two islands in the group, and 2 000 pairs at Prince Edward Island. At Marion Island from 1987 to 2008, there was no long-term trend in numbers of king penguin chicks that survived to the end of the winter period, but there was considerable fluctuation in chick production in the 1990s. It was roughly estimated that on average 88% of king penguin chicks survived the winter period (from April to September/October). Numbers of gentoo penguins at Marion Island decreased from more than 1 300 pairs in the mid-1990s to fewer than 800 pairs in 2003, and then increased to almost 1 100 pairs in 2008 as breeding success improved. Between 1994/1995 and 2008/2009, numbers of macaroni and southern rockhopper penguins at Marion Island decreased by about 30% and 70% respectively. In 2008/2009, some 290 000 pairs of macaroni penguins bred at this island, mostly in two large colonies where there was a progressive decrease in the density of nests. At both these colonies, decreases in numbers breeding followed outbreaks of disease. Inadequate breeding success has influenced the decreases of macaroni and rockhopper penguins. In 2008/2009, some 42 000 pairs of southern rockhopper penguins bred at Marion Island and 12 000 pairs of macaroni penguins and 38 000 pairs of southern rockhopper penguins at Prince Edward Island. © NISC (Pty) Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The partial articulated skeleton MLP 77-V-10-1 comes from the upper levels of La Meseta Formation (Seymour Island, Antarctica) at the southwestern slope of the plateau. These remains were found in the Submeseta Allomember, within the Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi Biozone, dated at 34.2 Ma using strontium isotope ratios from shells. MLP 77-V-10-1 is a giant penguin, probably the largest ever described, whose coracoids are strikingly wide at the distal surface. The present contribution is a study of this new fossil penguin, with particular emphasis on the coracoids. The osteography and associated muscles are described. Functional connotations of coracoid morphology are thoroughly discussed and its implications on the mechanics of diving are explored. We concluded that the coracoid morphology suggests a change in diving strategy from the earliest penguins until the living representatives. In the oldest penguins, the improvement of diving capacity would have been linked to the development of stronger bone and probably muscular structures enabling endurance of greater forces operating in a denser medium. In contrast, the Neogene penguins would have optimized the force action of the flight apparatus by developing more precise movements, adjusting the angle of attack of each of the effective forces.

ABSTRACT: Worldwide, crested penguins (Eudyptes spp.) are in decline and it is suspected that reduced prey availability plays an important role. However, the population of Snares Penguins (E. robustus) does not follow this trend, with its population being stable if not slightly increasing. To assess whether the success of the Snares Penguins is a result of a rich and stable prey resource within the breeding range of the species, we examined the dietary composition of breeding Snares Penguins by analysis of stomach contents, and analysed ratios of carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ 15N) stable isotopes in feathers of living penguins and historical specimens. The food brought ashore by the Penguins was dominated by a single species of krill, Nyctiphanes australis (̃60% of wet weight of the stomach samples); fish (̃30%) and cephalopods (̃10%) seemed to form only a minor portion. However, numbers of fish otoliths and cephalopod beaks in the samples suggest that these prey classes are more important food source for adult Penguins while at sea. Stable isotope ratios of Snares Penguin feathers collected between 1880 and 2004 revealed no temporal trend in either δ 13C or δ 15N indicating no significant changes in marine productivity or general composition of the diet of Snares Penguins in the past 120 years. We discuss our findings in the light of declining population trends and changing stable isotope ratios recently detected in Rockhopper Penguins (E. chrysocome), and conclude that the Snares Penguins benefit from stable prey availability as a function of the oceanographic setting of their breeding habitat. © Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union 2009.

ABSTRACT: The gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) is one of the most widespread penguin species and has been proven to be highly plastic in many aspects of its ecology. However, data from their sub-Antarctic range suggest an unexplained decline of their populations over the last 10-20 years, stressing the need for additional knowledge on their breeding ecology and demography. The present study provides insights into the breeding ecology of the gentoo penguin at a major breeding site, Kerguelen Archipelago, over three breeding seasons (1987, 2002 and 2003). Similarly to other northern populations, gentoo penguins breeding at Kerguelen exhibited winter laying, slow provisioning rate, slow growth rate associated with an extended rearing period and relatively low breeding success compared to southern populations. Our study also revealed interannual differences in the timing of laying and growth parameters as well as unusual sex differences in parental investment. Despite their high plasticity, there are indications that gentoo penguins at the northern edge of their range might work at the upper limit of their capacities. Sub-Antarctic populations would, therefore, be more sensitive to environmental changes than more southerly ones and need to be closely monitored. © Springer-Verlag 2009.

ABSTRACT: Most penguin species lay two eggs 3-4 days apart that hatch 1-2 days apart. Hypotheses to explain the shorter incubation period for the second egg include differences in porosity of the eggshells. Eggs with more or larger pores and/or thinner shells have higher gas exchange rates and faster embryonic development. We used eggshells from hatchling Magellanic Penguins Spheniscus magellanicus to test whether eggshell thickness and pore density affect incubation period. We expected: (i) second eggs to have thinner shells and/or more pores than first eggs; (ii) eggs to have thinner shells and/or more pores if they were laid by older females, later in the season, or in burrow nests (more humid than open nests under bushes). We found no support for these hypotheses. Egg pores and shell thickness were not related to incubation period. Eggs from the same clutch were similar in eggshell thickness and pore density. Female age, laying date and nest type were poor predictors of eggshell thickness and pore density. Egg pores, we conclude, have little explanatory power for differences in incubation time of eggs in Magellanic Penguins, and suggest that synchronous onset of incubation matters. © 2009 British Ornithologists' Union.

ABSTRACT: Banding penguins is controversial because bands can alter the survival, reproduction, and behavior of marked individuals. The effects of bands are not consistent among band types and, although stainless steel is thought to be better than other materials, tests of the long-term impact of bands on tag-loss rates and the reproduction and survival of individuals are needed. We tested three types of external tags on Magellanic Penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) to measure band effects and tag-loss rates. In 1993, we double-tagged 300 penguins with aluminum flipper bands, stainless-steel flipper bands, or small (2 mm × 10 mm) metal tags attached to foot webbing. We searched for double-tagged birds for 13 of 15 yrs (1994-2008). Aluminum bands deformed, caused feather wear, injured and killed some penguins, and were lost more often than stainless-steel bands or web tags. During the first 2 yrs of our study, at least nine penguins lost one aluminum band (N = 71 penguins resighted), but no penguins lost a stainless-steel band (N = 84) or a web tag (N = 88). During the next 13 yrs, five penguins lost one of their two web tags (N = 89), but none lost a stainless-steel band (N = 84). Females laid eggs of similar size before they carried a band and in the year following tagging (P = 0.09). The type of tags a female carried did not significantly change egg size (P > 0.22). During the first breeding season after tagging, penguins with aluminum bands had lower reproductive success than penguins with stainless-steel bands or web-tags (P = 0.04). The annual survival of females with two stainless-steel bands was lower (0.79) than that of males with two stainless-steel bands or males and females with two web-tags (0.87). Aluminum bands injured Magellanic Penguins, were lost at high rates, and should not be used. Double stainless-steel bands had no apparent effects on adult male Magellanic Penguins, but reduced survival rates of adult females. A single stainless-steel band would likely have less impact than two bands, and our results suggest that the impact of a single band would be difficult to measure. ©2010 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Although the impact of environmental changes on the demographic parameters of top predators is well established, the mechanisms by which populations are affected remain poorly understood. Here, we show that a reduction in the thermal stratification of coastal water masses between 2005 and 2006 was associated with reduced foraging and breeding success of little penguins Eudyptula minor, major bio-indicators of the Bass Strait ecosystem in southern Australia. The foraging patterns of the penguins suggest that their prey disperse widely in poorly stratified waters, leading to reduced foraging efficiency and poor breeding success. Mixed water regimes resulting from storms are currently unusual during the breeding period of these birds, but are expected to become more frequent due to climate change. © 2009 The Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Unsuccessful attempts to identify the leptin gene in birds are well documented, despite the characterization of its receptor (LEPR). Since leptin and LEPR have poor sequence conservation among vertebrates, we speculated that a functional assay should represent the best way to detect leptin in birds. Using a leptin bioassay that is based on activation of the chicken LEPR in cultured cells, blood samples from wild birds with extreme seasonal variation in voluntary food intake and fat deposition (Adélie penguins and bar-tailed godwits) were tested for leptin activity. In these experiments, blood samples collected during the pre-incubation and the chick-rearing periods of Adélie penguins, and during the migratory flight and refueling stages of bar-tailed godwits, were found to contain no detectable leptin activity, while the sensitivity of the assay to activation by human blood samples from donor subjects representing a variety of body mass indices and fat contents was clearly demonstrated. These results suggest that in birds, an alternative control mechanism to that of mammals operates in the communication between the body fat tissues and the central control on energy homeostasis. © 2010 Society for Endocrinology.

ABSTRACT: To understand the effects of foraging behavior on the amount of food provided to chicks (meal mass and frequency), we monitored nest attendance and diving behavior of 20 Adlie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) pairs that were rearing chicks. Because ice forms on the sea surface at night, parents foraged through cracks or within leads in the sea ice mainly during 08002400 hours. Birds that departed the colony in the afternoon and returned in the evening of the same day fed their chicks more frequently than those that made longer trips (i.e., those that departed in the afternoon and returned the next day or departed in the early morning and returned that evening). When the duration of the longest dive bout during each trip was longer, parents brought back heavier meals that contained larger krill. On average, birds made longer dive bouts when diving to greater depths. Thus, daily foraging pattern and foraging depth affected the provisioning rate, but the proportion of time spent foraging during the potential foraging period, total underwater time per day, and parental body condition were not. We suggest that temporal variability in prey availability and individual differences in foraging behavior affect the provisioning rate and, thus, chick growth. © 2010 by The American Ornithologists' Union.

ABSTRACT: In seabirds, variations in stress hormone (cortlcosterone; henceforth CORT) levels have been shown to reflect changing marine conditions and, especially, changes in food availability. However, it remains unclear how CORT levels can be mechanistically affected by these changes at the individual level. Specifically, the influence of food acquisition and foraging success on CORT secretion is poorly understood. In this study, we tested whether food acquisition can reduce baseline CORT levels ('the food intake hypothesis') by experimentally reducing foraging success of King Penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus). Although CORT levels overall decreased during a foraging trip, CORT levels did not differ between experimental birds and controls. These results demonstrate that mass gain at sea is not involved in changes in baseline CORT levels in this species. The overall decrease in CORT levels during a foraging trip could result from CORT-mediated energy regulation ('the energy utilisation hypothesis'). Along with other evidence, we suggest that the influence of foraging success and food intake on CORT levels is complex and that the ecological meaning of baseline CORT levels can definitely vary between species and ecological contexts. Therefore, further studies are needed to better understand (1) how baseline CORT levels are functionally regulated according to energetic status and energetic demands and (2) to what extent CORT can be used to aid in the conservation of seabird populations.

ABSTRACT: Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides are compounds that do not occur naturally in the environment and are not easily degraded by chemical or microbiological action. In the present work, those compounds were analysed in unhatched penguin eggs and whole krill collected in Admiralty Bay, King George Island, Antarctica in the austral summers of 2004-2005 and 2005-2006. The compounds found in higher levels (in a wet weight basis) were, in most of the egg samples, the PCBs (2.53-78.7 ng g-1), DDTs (2.07-38.0 ng g-1) and HCB (4.99-39.1 ng g-1) and after Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA, the occurrence seemed to be species-specific for the Pygoscelis genus. In all of the cases, the levels found were not higher than the ones in Arctic birds in a similar trophic level. The krill samples analysis allowed estimating the biomagnification factors (which resulted in up to 363 for HCB, one order of magnitude higher than DDTs and chlordanes and two orders of magnitude higher than the other groups) of the compounds found in eggs, whose only source of contamination is the female-offspring transfer. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Dimorphism in various morphological traits is widely used to sex birds. However, when a threshold is set and there is overlap in the distribution of traits between sexes, there will be an error rate. Macaroni Penguins show limited sexual dimorphism in size, with the distributions of most phenotypic traits overlapping between sexes, making using morphological characters for sexing difficult, although bill depth is used in one discrimination test Two existing DNA-based PCR tests that use different primer pairs (P2/P8 and 2550/2781 ) were adapted for use with fluorescently labelled primers to enable the size of fragments to be accurately measured via genotyping protocols and sex to be determined. The two molecular tests were applied to the same samples to estimate the error rate within and between tests. Whilst both primer pairs reproducibly identified the sex of the penguins under study with no inconsistencies between tests, the P2/P8 primer pair had a higher success rate of amplification. To estimate the error rates of morphometry tests, they were compared with molecular tests, revealing areas of disagreement. Structure in the error indicated a bias near the morphometric discrimination threshold. We suggest that larger sample sizes in discriminant function analyses and calibration with molecular data can be used to estimate the likelihood of misidentification for any particular value of the trait. A description of where error lies can then be used to target the more expensive and time-consuming DNA tests to check individuals that are most likely to be mis-assigned.

ABSTRACT: Although penguins are key marine predators from the Southern Ocean, their migratory behaviour during the inter-nesting period remains widely unknown. Here, we report for the first time, to our knowledge, the winter foraging movements and feeding habits of a penguin species by using geolocation sensors fitted on penguins with a new attachment method. We focused on the macaroni penguin Eudyptes chrysolophus at Kerguelen, the single largest consumer of marine prey among all seabirds. Overall, macaroni penguins performed very long winter trips, remaining at sea during approximately six months within the limits of the Southern Ocean. They departed from Kerguelen in an eastward direction and distributed widely, over more than 3.106 km2. The penguins spent most of their time in a previously unrecognized foraging area, i.e. a narrow latitudinal band (47-49° S) within the central Indian Ocean (70-110° E), corresponding oceanographically to the Polar Frontal Zone. There, their blood isotopic niche indicated that macaroni penguins preyed mainly upon crustaceans, but not on Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, which does not occur at these northern latitudes. Such winter information is a crucial step for a better integrative approach for the conservation of this species whose world population is known to be declining. © 2009 The Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: The Humboldt penguin, once common throughout its range, is today listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN. Mark-recapture and telemetry studies indicate that adult Humboldt penguins are sedentary, suggesting strong genetic differentiation between colonies. We developed genotypes for 336 individuals at 12 microsatellite loci sampled at four different localities spanning the entire range of this species. Results show that long-term gene flow has occurred but appears to be affected by geographic distance as pairwise F ST comparisons involving the colony at Punta San Juan (Peru) and the two colonies at Algarrobo (central Chile) and Puñihuil (southern Chile) are significant. Bayesian estimates of recent migration rates indicate substantial dispersal among all colonies. Despite the dramatic decline in numbers, we did not observe a bottleneck in any population. Furthermore, we did not detect a founder effect in the recently discovered colony at Puñihuil. As our indirect estimates signal strong gene flow between populations, we suggest that Humboldt penguin colonies need to be managed as a metapopulation rather than as discrete management units. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

ABSTRACT: Penguin censuses on the Antarctic Peninsula are often subject to logistical challenges that preclude nest counts being conducted at the peak of egg laying. Additionally, the historical literature includes many census counts with non-standard timing. The challenge is, therefore, to correct 'off-peak' census counts to make them comparable with current standard methods. Census correction involves knowing (i) how the census is timed relative to the peak of egg laying, and (ii) how nest numbers change through the breeding cycle. In this paper the authors present an analysis relating to both these challenges. Clutch initiation dates for four penguin breeding sites are examined (Cape Shirreff, Admiralty Bay, Humble Island and Petermann Island) in relation to potential drivers of clutch initiation (e.g. temperature, precipitation, sea-ice etc.). It is found that mean October temperatures constitute the most consistent significant factor related to the timing of clutch initiation in all three of the penguin species examined (Adélie (Pygoscelis adeliae), gentoo (P. papua) and chinstrap (P. antarctica)). A statistical model for determining the peak of clutch initiation is presented and, along with a simple estimation of species-specific nest attrition rates, is used to illustrate the procedure for correcting off-peak census counts.

ABSTRACT: In order to reconstruct past changes in penguin populations we performed geochemical analyses on a penguin ornithogenic sediment core DG4 retrieved from a lake catchment on Gardner Island, Vestfold Hills. P, Se, F, S, As, Sr and Cu in DG4 were identified as the bio-element assemblage by R-clustering analyses on the elemental concentrations and comparisons with those in bedrock and fresh penguin guano. Factor analysis on the levels of these bio-elements in the core permitted a reconstruction of variations in historical penguin populations at Gardner Island spanning the past 8500 years. The penguin population showed significant fluctuations, reaching its highest density between 47002400 calibrated years before present. This coincides with evidence for a late Holocene warm period in the Vestfold Hills, similar to that associated with the late Holocene penguin optimum recorded in the Ross Sea and Antarctic Peninsula regions. © 2009 Antarctic Science Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) thrives in the Antarctic underwater environment, diving to depths greater than 500 m and for durations longer than 23 min. To examine mechanisms underlying the exceptional diving ability of this species and further describe blood oxygen (O2) transport and depletion while diving, we characterized the O2- hemoglobin (Hb) dissociation curve of the emperor penguin in whole blood. This allowed us to (1) investigate the biochemical adaptation of Hb in this species, and (2) address blood O2 depletion during diving, by applying the dissociation curve to previously collected partial pressure of O2 (Po2) profiles to estimate in vivo Hb saturation (So2) changes during dives. This investigation revealed enhanced Hb-O2 affinity (P50=28mmHg. pH 7.5) in the emperor penguin, similar to high-altitude birds and other penguin species. This allows for increased O 2 at low blood Po2 levels during diving and more complete depletion of the respiratory O2 store. So2 profiles during diving demonstrated that arterial So2 levels are maintained near 100% throughout much of the dive, not decreasing significantly until the final ascent phase. End-of-dive venous SO2 values were widely distributed and optimization of the venous blood O2 store resulted from arterialization and near complete depletion of venous blood O2 during longer dives. The estimated contribution of the blood O2 store to diving metabolic rate was low and highly variable. This pattern is due, in part, to the influx of O2 from the lungs into the blood during diving, and variable rates of tissue O2 uptake.

ABSTRACT: Cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), and lead (Pb) were determined in samples of liver and breast muscles of first-year Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus), from two different areas on the Brazilian coast, 35 on the Rio de Janeiro coast and 12 on the Rio Grande do Sul coast. In both areas, Cd concentrations in muscle samples were <0.025 μg/g. However, the Cd and Hg concentrations found in liver and Hg concentrations found in muscle showed a significant difference between the two regions. The geometric mean of the concentrations was higher in the specimens from Rio de Janeiro (Cd-6.8 μg/g; Hg- liver, 1.6 μg/g, and muscle, 0.4 μg/g wet weight) than in those from Rio Grande do Sul (Cd-2.3 μg/g; Hg-liver, 0.9 μg/g, and muscle, 0.1 μg/g wet weight). The site differences could be related to differences in diet influenced by geographic factors. Brazil's southeastern coast is highlyurbanized, and its coastal waters are contaminated by the waste of agricultural and industrial activities. There is a lack of information on the levels of heavy metals in S. magellanicus, however, their wide distribution and top position in the trophic chain make the use of stranded specimens an attractive source of information for monitoring heavy metals in the South Atlantic coast. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.

ABSTRACT: Oxygen store depletion and a diving bradycardia in emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) expose tissues to critical levels of hypoxemia and ischemia. To assess the prevention of re-perfusion injury and reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage in emperor penguins, superoxide radical production, lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS)), and antioxidant enzyme activity profiles in biopsy samples from muscle and liver were determined and compared to those in the chicken and 8 species of flighted marine birds (non-divers and plunge divers). In muscle of emperor penguins, superoxide production and TBARS levels were not distinctly different from those in the other species; among the antioxidant enzymes, catalase (CAT) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities were significantly elevated above all species. In the liver of emperor penguins, TBARS levels were not significantly different from other species; only CAT activity was significantly elevated, although GST and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activities were 2-3 times higher than those in other species. The potential for ROS formation and lipid peroxidation is not reduced in the pectoral muscle or liver of the emperor penguin. Scavenging of hydrogen peroxide by CAT and the conjugation of glutathione with reactive intermediates and peroxides by GST and GPX appear to be important in the prevention of ROS damage and re-perfusion injury in these birds. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.
