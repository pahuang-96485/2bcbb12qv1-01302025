ABSTRACT: Leucocytozoon infection has been observed to impact the reproductive ecology and physiology of avian hosts, but its influence on nestling survival remains unclear. We investigated the effect of Leucocytozoon infection intensity, determined through triplicate PCR sample analyses, on the survival of 256 boreal owl (Aegolius funereus) nestlings during an 8-yr study. Contrary to our expectations, the survival probability of boreal owl nestlings was not influenced by their Leucocytozoon infection intensity. Nestling age and Leucocytozoon infection intensity in male and female parents also did not impact nestling survival. Instead, food abundance and hatching order were the key factors influencing nestling survival. Additionally, we observed a significantly higher Leucocytozoon infection intensity in male parents compared to female parents and nestlings. We suggest a distinct division of parental roles may lead females and nestlings staying within the nest boxes (cavities) to experience lower exposure to potential vectors transmitting blood parasites than their male counterparts. Our study shows that Leucocytozoon disease may not be lethal for boreal owl chicks, exhibiting a below-average infection intensity compared to their male parents. © 2024 American Association of Avian Pathologists.

ABSTRACT: Although the evolutionary ecology of melanin pigments and melanin-based coloration has been studied in great details, particularly in birds, little is known about the function of melanin stored inside the body. In the barn owl Tyto alba, in which individuals vary in the degree of reddish pheomelanin-based coloration and in the size of black eumelanic feather spots, we measured the concentration in melanin pigments in seven organs. The eyes had by far the most melanin then the skin, pectoral muscle, heart, liver, trachea, and uropygial gland. The concentration in eumelanin was not necessarily correlated with the concentration in pheomelanin suggesting that their production can be regulated independently from each other. Redder barn owls had more pheomelanin in the skin and uropygial gland than white owls, while owls displaying larger black feather spots had more eumelanin in the skin than small-spotted owls. More data are required to evaluate whether melanin-based traits can evolve as an indirect response to selection exerted on melanin deposition in organs. © The Author(s) 2023.

ABSTRACT: The California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) is an older-forest associated species that resides at the center of forest management planning in the Sierra Nevada and Southern California, USA, which are experiencing increasingly large and severe wildfires and drought-related tree mortality. We leveraged advances in passive acoustic survey technologies to develop an acoustically assisted survey design that could increase the efficiency and effectiveness of project-level surveys for spotted owls, allowing surveys to be completed in a single year instead of in multiple years. We deployed an array of autonomous recording units (ARUs) across a landscape and identified spotted owl vocalizations in the resulting audio using BirdNET. We then evaluated spatio-temporal patterns in spotted owl vocalizations near occupied territories and the ability of a crew naïve to the location of occupied territories to locate spotted owls based on patterns of acoustic detections. After only 3 weeks of acoustic surveys, ≥1 ARU within 750 m of all 17 occupied territories obtained spotted owl detections across ≥2 nights. When active surveys using broadcast calling were conducted near ARUs with spotted owl detections by surveyors naïve to territory occupancy status and locations, surveyors located owls in 93% to 100% of occupied territories with ≤3 surveys. To further improve the efficiency of spotted owl surveys, we developed a statistical model to identify and prioritize areas across the Sierra Nevada for different survey methods (active only, acoustically assisted, no surveys) based on the expected probability of occupancy predicted from remotely sensed measurements of tree height and historical occupancy. Depending on managers' tolerance for false negatives, this model could help identify large areas that might not benefit from surveys based on low expected occupancy probabilities and areas where acoustically assisted surveys might enhance survey effectiveness and efficiency. Collectively, these findings can help managers streamline the survey process and thus increase the pace of forest restoration while minimizing potential near-term adverse effects on California spotted owls. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Owls, members of the avian order Strigiformes, are nocturnal birds of prey that are found worldwide except for Antarctica. Traumatized, free-ranging owls are commonly presented to veterinary hospitals and wildlife rehabilitation facilities with the goal of providing medical care and rehabilitation to enable release back into their natural habitat. Minimal guidelines exist for the release of wildlife, and whereas a need for functional vision is described in raptors, assessing and evaluating hearing is usually not mentioned. This can be problematic for nocturnal predators because hearing is the primary sense utilized by owls when hunting and navigating in their dark environment. The brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER) test is a minimally invasive, objective assessment of hearing commonly used in companion animals. To the authors' knowledge, routine or standardized BAER evaluation has not been reported in traumatized, free-ranging owls. In the following retrospective study, 31 free-ranging owls presented to the University of Georgia Veterinary Teaching Hospital for known or suspected trauma or being found in a debilitated state underwent BAER testing to assess for the presence of complete sensorineural hearing loss. Similar to assessment of hearing in companion animals, the BAER test was elicited using a broad click stimulus delivered at 85 dB nHL. In all owls, qualitative assessment and peak latency measurements of the BAER test reflected hearing ability. This study highlights the importance of hearing in nocturnal raptors, how BAER testing can aid in decision making regarding rehabilitation, and provides a foundation for further investigation of hearing loss in traumatized owls. We suggest that veterinarians working with free-ranging owls in a rehabilitation setting should consider BAER testing as part of routine diagnostic testing. © 2024 by the Association of Avian Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Pest rodents cause extensive damage to crops worldwide. Up to 40% of global crop production is lost annually to pests and diseases, with rodents accounting for 15–30% of this loss amounting to billions of dollars each year. The current method of controlling rodent populations involves the extensive use of chemical rodenticides. While effective in the short term, these chemicals pose serious environmental and health risks, leading to secondary poisoning of non-target species and other long-term negative ecological consequences, underscoring the need to adopt more sustainable pest-control measures. Nature-Based Solutions (NbSs), on the other hand, are increasingly recognized for addressing environmental challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and sustainable development, and they include actions that protect, sustainably manage, and restore ecosystems. In this context, Barn Owls (Tyto alba) are highly effective as a natural pest-rodent control agents in agro-ecosystems. The species has a wide distribution and adaptability to various environments, and its diet consists predominantly of small mammals, with rodents making up from 50–60% up to even 90–95% of the diet according to different geographical regions. Each Barn Owl family can consume thousands of rodents annually, creating a high potential to reduce crop damage and infestations. Deploying nest boxes in agricultural areas can significantly increase Barn Owl populations, ensuring continuous and effective rodent control. Limitations of this solution must also be taken into consideration such as predation on rodents and small mammals that are not pests, and possible competition with other nocturnal birds of prey. Ιn the current paper, we aim to introduce the concept of owls as a NbS for pest rodent control and outline the main challenges, pitfalls, advantages, and disadvantages of implementing this solution in a new geographical region, and all the necessary in-between steps (scientific, societal, administrative, educational) that have to be followed for a successful implementation. So far, several countries have successfully implemented Barn Owl nest box schemes, with Israel and Cyprus achieving reduction in the use of pesticides by 45% and 58%, respectively, whereas the project is spreading to other Mediterranean countries (Jordan, Palestine Authority, Greece, Morocco, Spain), in palm plantations in Malaysia and USA, and in the vineyards of Napa Valley in California. The success of Barn Owl nest box programs relies on integrating scientific research, societal needs, supportive policy frameworks, and education. Barn Owl nest box programs are both bottom-up and top-down initiatives, in need of the participation of farmers and local communities to establish and deploy the Barn Owl solution. Continuous research is also necessary to explore systematically Barn owl trophic ecology, foraging and breeding ecology, interactions with agricultural landscape, and land uses in temporal and spatial scales, and challenges such as habitat suitability, availability of nesting sites, and regional ecological conditions must also be addressed. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Mitigating habitat loss of western burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia hypugaea) often involves relocation from California ground squirrel (Otospermophilus beecheyi) burrows to offsite nest boxes. Naval Air Station Lemoore (NASL), Kings and Fresno counties, California, initiated this approach to displace a regionally important population from airfield grasslands. We examined monitoring data of burrowing owls and fossorial mammals at NASL to assess mitigation options. Occupied nests increased by 33 (61%), with 47 nest box installations in 1997–2001, peaked at 87 in 1999, then declined by 50 through 2013. Although ≥13 nest boxes were occupied in 2000, none were occupied in 2003–2013. Within a 43.1 ha isolated grassland monitored for 13 years, nest site reuse in ground squirrel burrows averaged only 17% between any 2 consecutive years. Compared to the average density across grassland study areas, ground squirrel burrow systems/ha numbered 43% higher within 60 m of occupied nests and non-breeding-season burrows. Vegetation clearing to restore kangaroo rat (Dipodomys n. nitratoides) habitat preceded a 7.4-fold increase in ground squirrel burrow systems and a 4-fold increase in occupied nests, but drought-induced extirpation of ground squirrels eliminated occupied nests from the 43.1 ha grassland study area. Ground cover near occupied nests averaged 58% of the mean vegetation height and 67% of the mean percentage of bare ground in the field. Both nest sites and non-breeding-season burrows occurred >60 m interior to field edges 1.4 times more than expected. Non-breeding-season burrows averaged 328 m from same-year nest sites, and only 7% of non-breeding-season burrows were also used as nest sites. Mitigating habitat loss should be made more effective by fostering natural burrow construction by fossorial mammals on patches of short-stature vegetation that is sufficiently expansive to support breeding colonies of ≥12 pairs averaging ≥60 m from the field’s edge and a separation between non-breeding-season burrows and nest burrows minimally equal to mean nearest-neighbor distances among nests. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Maintaining dense forest habitats for the threatened northern spotted owl (NSO) has proven challenging in seasonally dry, fire-dependent landscapes where low-density conditions were historically dominant and are generally more climate- and disturbance-resilient. To better inform the dual, sometimes-conflicting objectives of species conservation and forest resilience, we developed an approach to evaluate NSO habitat sustainability by: (1) quantifying the structure of high suitability habitat (HSH) associated with NSO using two remotely sensed platforms, (2) estimating current and historical HSH abundance, and (3) identifying HSH locations more likely to persist given current and future forest-zone climate projections and increasing risk of severe wildfire. Tall, closed-canopy conditions effectively comprised the key structural features of HSH, providing a means to map habitat through time. Both historical amounts and contemporary spatial patterns of HSH and other forest and non-forest conditions around occupied NSO sites indicated that HSH and forest resilience goals can be congruent at multiple scales. Independent lines of evidence suggest HSH historically composed ∼18–24% of the dry and moist mixed-conifer landscape – considerably lower levels than current management goals in many areas. Projected shifts in climate and severe-fire likelihood suggest substantial spatial and temporal shifts where HSH will be sustainable into the future – mainly in currently moist as well as some cold forest types. These findings can inform the potential convergence and trade-offs of species conservation and disturbance resilience goals across local and regional landscapes, based on the inherent capacity of the landscape to support both goals under projected shifts in climate and wildfire. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Wild animals, particularly those affected by urban expansion frequently face challenges such as vehicle collisions, and encounters with domestic dogs. Rehabilitation in care facilities usually conducted in ex-situ conditions poses considerable challenges. In rescue centers, these animals are exposed to a new environment characterized by human noise and the presence of multiple species in a confined space. This can potentially trigger stress responses and immunosuppression, further compromising their health. This study aimed to assess the endocrine and immunological parameters of owls (Megascops choliba) under human care for a continuous 49-day period. Twelve adult owls were exposed to audio recordings from a rescue center between days 15 and 35. Fecal samples were collected from each owl every seven days, as well as blood samples from eight of these birds. Fecal samples were analyzed for glucocorticoid metabolites (GCM), while blood samples were used to measure plasma corticosterone levels, bacterial killing ability (BKA), and heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (H/L). Our findings revealed that GCM concentration increased during noise exposure regardless of sex, while plasma corticosterone levels remained unchanged. BKA decreased during noise exposure compared to before treatment, but H/L did not differ between time points. These results show that exposure to rescue center noise induces alterations in allostatic mediators in owls, requiring further research to address other physiological changes in individuals that may affect their recovery and maintenance under human care. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Changing fire regimes have the potential to threaten wildlife populations and communities. Understanding species’ responses to novel fire regimes is critical to formulating effective management and conservation strategies in an era of rapid change. Here, we examined the empirical effects of recent and historical wildfire activity on Mexican spotted owl (Strix occidentalis lucida) populations in the southwestern United States. Using region-wide, standardized detection/non-detection data of Mexican spotted owl breeding pairs collected from 2015 to 2022, we found (i) higher rates of pair occupancy at sites that experienced more frequent fires in the three decades prior to the initiation of our study, and (ii) lower rates of local persistence at sites that experienced more extensive high-severity fire during the study. Historical fire regimes throughout much of our study area were characterized by high fire frequencies and limited high-severity components, indicating that Mexican spotted owls responded to wildfire in a manner consistent with their evolutionary environment. Management activities such as prescribed burning and mechanical thinning that aim to reduce stand-replacing fire risk and re-introduce the potential for frequent-fire regimes will likely benefit Mexican spotted owl conservation objectives, as well as promote more resilient forest landscapes. © This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply 2024.

ABSTRACT: Hatching captive barn owl chicks underwent four developmental phases. In the first 10 days (phase 1), behavior consisted of lateral movements that gradually changed to forward progression and peaked a few days before and after eye-opening. This behavior resembled a general developmental pattern that characterizes other vertebrates. Chicks also underwent a postural change, from head bent underneath the ventrum to resting on the rear end of the trunk with the head lifted in the air. Then, once their eyes were opened, chicks became more stationary and preoccupied with visual exploration, manifested in lateral head movements and peering episodes (phase 2, until day 20). The latter behavior, which is also typical of mature owls when not on the wing, characterized the chicks’ behavior after post-hatching day 20 (phase 3), when their flight and contour feathers grew, along with shedding the down plumage and standing tall. Development culminated in active flight, first observed by days 50–60 (phase 4). Altogether, during post-hatching development, barn owl chicks gradually shifted from egg posture to the adult upright body posture. At the same time, their behavior consisted of speciation from the general developmental pattern to the typical stationary barn owl behavior, and, finally, flight was incorporated. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Agricultural landscapes play a crucial role in enhancing biodiversity because of their widespread presence over the Earth and their ability to encompass diverse ecosystems. Recognizing this, numerous governments are incentivizing farmers through direct payments to adopt sustainable practices, such as managing extensive pastures and meadows, planting wildflowers, or establishing hedgerows. However, the benefit of such sustainable practices on vertebrate species is not well understood. From 2018 to 2020, we investigated nest occupancy, fledging success, and clutch size of a Swiss population of barn owls (Tyto alba) with respect to nest box characteristics and the presence of extensive agriculture and urbanization in areas surrounding nest boxes. Our results revealed that extensively used pastures were negatively associated with site occupancy but positively associated with clutch size. The proportion of urban areas was negatively related to both site occupancy and clutch size. The altitude of the nest box location was negatively correlated with occupancy, and the number of nest boxes placed at the same site (either 1 or 2) was positively correlated with site occupancy. Moreover, clutch size, but not fledging success, was larger in nest boxes placed outside barns than in nest boxes placed inside barns. Based on these findings, we recommend installing nest boxes at locations <700 m in altitude and in pairs on the same barn, incorporating biodiversity promotion areas into agricultural landscapes, and avoiding dense urban areas in favor of rural zones with lower urban density. Understanding the nuanced relationships between nest box characteristics, environmental factors, and breeding success provides valuable insights for optimizing artificial nesting sites and enhancing the overall reproductive success of barn owls. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: In birds, fine-scale selection of habitat, like roosting sites, plays an important role in energy conservation. Many diurnal birds roost in cavities or densely foliated coniferous trees, both of which may provide shelter from predators and precipitation, and reduce heat loss from convective and radiative forces. Thermal benefits of roost sites have not been widely studied in nocturnal birds, like owls, roosting during the day. The objective of this study was to assess possible thermal benefits of coniferous roosting sites for the small, nocturnal Northern Saw-whet Owl (Aegolius acadicus) at the southern extent of its nonbreeding distribution, where winters are often mild with warm days. I deployed operative temperature models (n = 40) for 21 d at 10 sites in Madison County, Arkansas. Sites were either a shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) or eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana) roost tree, each paired with a deciduous tree. At each site, I synchronously deployed models in 4 microsites reflecting potential owl roosting sites that likely varied considerably in their thermal properties: conifer crown, conifer trunk, deciduous crown, deciduous trunk. My objectives were to (1) test for an effect of microsite on 4 composite operative temperature variables, and (2) test for an effect of microsite on mean wind speed. Results suggest conifer crown roost sites are cooler, more thermally buffered, and experience lower wind speed than deciduous crown and both trunk roost sites. Thus, the saw-whet owl likely benefits from overwintering in coniferous trees to avoid thermally stressful temperatures, particularly on warm winter days. © 2024 Wilson Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Feathers comprise a series of evolutionary innovations but also harbour colour, a key biological trait known to co-vary with life history or complex traits. Those relationships are particularly true in melanin-based pigmentation species due to known pleiotropic effects of the melanocortin pathway – originating from melanin-associated phenotypes. Here, we explore the molecular basis of melanin colouration and expected co-variation at the molecular level in the melanin-based, colour polymorphic system of the tawny owl (Strix aluco). An extensive body of literature has revealed that grey and brown tawny owl colour morphs differ in a series of life history and behavioural traits. Thus, it is plausible to expect co-variation also at molecular level between colour morphs. To investigate this possibility, we assembled the first draft genome of the species against which we mapped ddRADseq reads from 220 grey and 150 brown morphs – representing 10 years of pedigree data from a population in Southern Finland – and explored genome-wide associations with colour phenotype. Our results revealed putative molecular signatures of cold adaptation strongly associated with the grey phenotype, namely, a non-synonymous substitution in MCHR1, plus 2 substitutions in non-coding regions of FTCD and FAM135A whose genotype combinations obtained a predictive power of up to 100% (predicting grey colour). These suggest a molecular basis of cold environment adaptations predicted to be grey-morph specific. Our results potentially reveal part of the molecular machinery of melanin-associated phenotypes and provide novel insights towards understanding the functional genomics of colour polymorphism in melanin-based pigmented species. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Nomadic species can rely on unpredictable resources making them challenging to understand and, consequently, to conserve. Here, we present knowledge advancement for a nomadic predator, the Short-eared Owl Asio flammeus, by tracking individuals from a wide latitudinal range inclusive of most breeding populations in western Europe (Iceland, Scotland and Spain). Tracked owls showed pronounced plasticity in both inter- and intra-individual behaviour. Distances between sequential breeding areas of individual owls ranged from 41 to 4216 km, with similar low fidelity to areas used at other times of year. Owls spent most (> 60%) of their time occupying home-ranges (including breeding) and least (< 10%) undertaking long-distance movements. The propensity for long-distance movements was least for the most geographically isolated population, Iceland. Annual survival rates of 47% were lower than expected for an owl of comparable body mass with mortality concentrated during long-distance displacements and immediately after breeding. Extensive, nomadic travel to find areas where large broods might be reared may incur carry-over costs that lower survival. Conservation planning and assessment for nomadic species and their habitats must acknowledge the uncertainties associated with nomadism at scales from local to international. © 2024 British Ornithologists' Union.

ABSTRACT: The diet of the endemic Cyprus scops owl (Otus cyprius) was studied for the first time during the breeding season 2021 in 7 nesting sites from 6 sampling locations using the pellet analysis (n = 65 pellets). Insects, mostly Orthoptera and Coleoptera, comprised the bulk of the owl diet (87% abundance, 31% biomass), whereas small mammals and reptiles were important in terms of biomass, with 41% and 24%, respectively. Birds were the lowest prey order, with 0.6% abundance and 3.6% biomass. The most essential insects were grasshoppers (Acrididae) (17%) and scarab beetles (Scarabaeidae) (6%). From vertebrate prey, Mus spp. (23.7%), Mediterranean house gecko (Hemidactylus turcicus) (8%), Cyprus spiny mice (Acomys nesiotes) (8%), juvenile black rats (Rattus rattus) (7%), and Cyprus agamas (Laudakia cypriaca) (5%) stand out as % biomass. Predation on a bat species (Pipistrellus sp.) by scops owl was documented for the first time in Cyprus. The estimated prey biomass ranged from 0.1 – 25 grams, averaging 2.1 g. © Raptor Protection of Slovakia (RPS)

ABSTRACT: The majority of the 11 species of owl monkeys (Aotus spp.) have declining populations or are listed as data deficient. Deforestation due to agriculture, development, or logging poses threats to owl monkeys throughout their range. In some areas, Aotus are hunted for bushmeat or trapped for the wildlife trade. In Colombia, the country with the greatest number of Aotus species, owl monkeys are also threatened by civil unrest. To help combat these challenges, nonprofit organizations and field researchers in habitat countries have successfully implemented a variety of conservation projects such as censusing and monitoring owl monkey populations, establishing protected areas, reforesting degraded areas, filing lawsuits to protect wild populations, helping law enforcement with environmental regulation, and promoting environmental education. We highlight some of the conservation successes and suggest actions people around the world can take to contribute to these important efforts. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT: Characterizing natal dispersal can help manage the spread of invasive species expanding their ranges in response to land use and climate change. The Barred Owl (Strix varia) is a prominent example of an apex predator undergoing a rapid range expansion, having spread from eastern to western North America where it is now hyperabundant—threatening the Northern Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) with extinction and potentially endangering many other native species. We attached satellite tags to 31 Barred Owl juveniles at the southern leading edge of the Barred Owl’s expanding range in California to characterize natal dispersal patterns and inform management. Juveniles traveled up to 100 km from natal territories and experienced high mortality (annual survival = 0.204). At landscape scales, juveniles preferentially used forests, shrublands, and lower elevations during dispersal and avoided grasslands and burned areas. At finer scales, juveniles preferred shorter (younger) forests, lower elevations, and drainages, and avoided unforested areas. Our results suggest that the Barred Owl range expansion is being driven primarily by high reproductive rates and densities despite low juvenile survival rates and dispersal through putatively suboptimal younger forests as a result of exclusion from high-quality habitat by territorial individuals. These findings also point to several strategies for conserving Spotted Owls and other native species in the Barred Owl’s expanded range, including: (1) creating and maintaining Barred Owl-free reserves bounded by open or high elevation areas, (2) creating reserves large enough to reduce immigration by long-distance dispersers, and (3) removing Barred Owls from large riparian corridors. © American Ornithological Society 2023.

ABSTRACT: As natural predators, owls fly with astonishing stealth due to the serrated feather morphology that produces advantageous flow characteristics. Traditionally, these serrations are tailored for airfoil edges with simple two-dimensional patterns, limiting their effect on noise reduction while negotiating tradeoffs in aerodynamic performance. Conversely, the intricately structured wings of cicadas have evolved for effective flapping, presenting a potential blueprint for alleviating these aerodynamic limitations. In this study, we formulate a synergistic design strategy that harmonizes noise suppression with aerodynamic efficiency by integrating the geometrical attributes of owl feathers and cicada forewings, culminating in a three-dimensional sinusoidal serration propeller topology that facilitates both silent and efficient flight. Experimental results show that our design yields a reduction in overall sound pressure levels by up to 5.5 dB and an increase in propulsive efficiency by over 20% compared to the current industry benchmark. Computational fluid dynamics simulations validate the efficacy of the bioinspired design in augmenting surface vorticity and suppressing noise generation across various flow regimes.

ABSTRACT: The widespread use of anticoagulant rodenticides (ARs) poses a worldwide threat to farmland wildlife. These compounds accumulate in tissues of both target and non-target species, potentially endangering both direct consumers and their predators. However, investigations on ARs in blood of free-ranging predatory birds are rare. Here, the long-eared owl (Asio otus) has been used as a model predator to assess AR exposure in different agricultural landscapes from a Mediterranean semiarid region. A total of 69 owlets from 38 nests were blood-sampled over 2021 and 2022, aiming to detect AR residues and explore factors that determine their exposure, such as land uses. In addition, prothrombin time (PT) test was conducted to assess potential effects of AR contamination. Overall, nearly all the samples (98.6 %) tested positive for at least one compound and multiple ARs were found in most of the individuals (82.6 %). Among the ARs detected, flocoumafen was the most common compound (88.4 % of the samples). AR total concentration (ΣARs) in blood ranged from 0.06 to 34.18 ng mL−1, detecting the highest levels in the most intensively cultivated area. The analysis of owl pellets from 19 breeding territories showed relevant among-site differences in the contribution of rodents and birds into the diet of long-eared owls, supporting its high dietary plasticity and indicating AR presence at multiple trophic levels. Moreover, a positive and significant correlation was found between ΣARs and PT (Rho = 0.547, p < 0.001), which demonstrates the direct effect of ARs on free-living nestlings. Our results provide a preliminary overview of AR exposure in a little-studied owl species inhabiting agricultural and rural landscapes. Despite the low detected levels, these findings indicate widespread exposure -often to multiple compounds- from early life stages, which raises concern and draws attention to an ongoing and unresolved contamination issue. © 2024 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Birds face strong selective pressures to complete individual nesting attempts as quickly as possible to minimize exposure of nests to predators and weather, maximize renesting potential, and maximize hatching success. As a result, the duration of developmental periods and of overall nest periods are often relatively constant within species. However, birds may sometimes be subject to acute energetic constraints that may preclude them from initiating incubation at the optimal time. We report an extraordinary case of delayed incubation by a female Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia) in Oregon, USA, which contrasted sharply with a large sample of nests monitored by motion-activated video cameras in western North America from 2015 to 2018. The focal female delayed incubation by 11 d following clutch completion and subsequently experienced near total hatching failure of her clutch. This observation corroborates previous experimental studies regarding the limits to egg viability and trade-offs between the timing of incubation onset and hatching success. These findings illustrate the acute trade-offs faced by nesting birds, and the cost of delayed incubation that we observed in this owl could help explain the cause of asynchronous hatching. © 2024 Wilson Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Partial migration, in which migrant and resident members of a species spend part of the annual cycle in the same habitat, is a widely-occurring strategy among animal species. However, studies of this behavior are impeded by problems such as distinguishing migrant from resident individuals and detecting resident-migrant hybridization. We used a combination of genomic sequencing and bird banding to determine the migratory status of individuals in a declining population of western burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia hypugaea) in northern California. We banded individuals for four consecutive years in winter and summer. Each summer we surveyed for birds we had banded during previous winters. Using genomic analysis, we analyzed feathers from birds found in winter and summer to assess migratory status and interactions between winter and summer owls. The data showed a pattern of migration in which long-distance migratory birds were found in areas outside the breeding sites and joined resident owls at the breeding sites in the winter, but disappeared from these areas by the next breeding season. These results fit a pattern of partial migration in which long-distance migrants join resident birds in the winter. Although during breeding seasons we never observed any migrants that we banded in winter either within or outside the breeding sites, genomic analysis showed that some migrants stayed into the summer and bred with resident owls to produce hybrid offspring. This interaction brings different genetic material into the small resident population, a contribution that may benefit this declining population. This work demonstrates the value of combining genomic assessments of migratory status with field data collection to better characterize population structure and inform conservation actions. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.

ABSTRACT: Fire shapes biodiversity in many forested ecosystems, but historical management practices and anthropogenic climate change have led to larger, more severe fires that threaten many animal species where such disturbances do not occur naturally. As predators, owls can play important ecological roles in biological communities, but how changing fire regimes affect individual species and species assemblages is largely unknown. Here, we examined the impact of fire severity, history, and configuration over the past 35 years on an assemblage of six forest owl species in the Sierra Nevada, California, using ecosystem-scale passive acoustic monitoring. While the negative impacts of fire on this assemblage appeared to be ephemeral (1–4 years in duration), spotted owls avoided sites burned at high-severity for up to two decades after a fire. Low- to moderate-severity fire benefited small cavity-nesting species and great horned owls. Most forest owl species in this study appeared adapted to fire within the region's natural range of variation, characterized by higher proportions of low- to moderate-severity fire and relatively less high-severity fire. While some species in this assemblage may be more resilient to severe wildfire than others, novel “megafires” that are larger, more frequent, and contiguously severe may limit the distribution of this assemblage by reducing the prevalence of low- to moderate-severity fire and eliminating habitat for a closed-canopy species for multiple decades. Management strategies that restore historical low- to moderate-severity fire with small patches of high-severity fire and promote a mosaic of forest conditions will likely facilitate the conservation of this assemblage of forest predators. © 2025 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The work studied the co-vocalization of Tawny Owl and Ural Owl. Researched primarily using digital voice recorders. Co-vocalization was revealed only in spring. This is due to the breeding season of birds. The roll call of two species of owls was recorded 2 h 30 min after sunset. Co-vocalization was always observed from 21:00 to 22:00 hours. Duration of co-vocalization of the Tawny Owl and the Ural Owl ranged from several sec to 6 min. During periods of co-vocalization, the Tawny Owl managed to produce twice as many calls as the Ural Owl. The Tawny Owl was the first to start calling, and later the calls of the Ural Owl joined it. The Tawny Owl stopped vocalizing, and the Ural Owl continued to call after it. The calls of each of the two owl species in shared habitats were recorded primarily at different times. More often, the Tawny Owl began vocalization 30 min after the Ural Owl stopped calling. The natural and climatic conditions of the area in which co-vocalization was noted were studied. Co-vocalizations were observed in the temperature range from +3 to +7°C. Joint calls were recorded at wind strength from 4 to 7 m/s, at cloud cover from 40 to 90%, at pressure from 734 to 744 mm Hg. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

ABSTRACT: This study investigates the diagenetic history and timing of hydrocarbon migration in the lower Permian Ingleside Formation as revealed in the Ingleside roadcut at Owl Canyon area, Colorado. Fourteen beds were identified within the studied exposure and are composed of quartz arenite sandstone, limestone, dolomite, or siltstone. Observations from outcrop and thin sections, including calcite veins, carbonate-hosted vugs, and carbonate cement, indicate carbonate mobility throughout the outcrop. Stylolites parallel to bedding were probably formed by pressure solution related to compaction, and pressure solution of carbonates is one possible source of carbonate that could have precipitated in veins or as a cement. The Ingleside Formation was affected by other diagenetic processes, including feldspar dissolution and alteration and several stages of cementation. Hematite, calcite, dolomite, kaolinite, and quartz overgrowth cements are the major types of cements identified within the studied exposure. Hematite cement was determined to have precipitated very early, followed immediately by the precipitation of poikilotopic carbonate cement. Blocky calcite and blocky dolomite cements, the most common cements within the formation, formed after the hematite and poikilotopic cements. Kaolinite cement may have precipitated in association with feldspar dissolution and alteration or occurred with feldspar dissolution during modern weathering. Hydrocarbon migration may have taken place before the of the blocky carbonate cement. The CaO in sandstone samples is due to the occurrence of calcite and dolomite cement. The MgO in sandstone samples is related to dolomite content. Furthermore, the low concentration of K2O in sandstone samples could be attributed to the low proportion of K-feldspar, and other K-rich minerals and possibly reflects loss of K during diagenesis. The relationship fact that S and MgO are both more abundant in samples from the middle and upper parts of the outcrop than in deeper samples suggests that they were added by diagenetic fluids. This study of the Ingleside outcrop provides insights on the diagenesis, possible timing of possible hydrocarbon migration through the Ingleside Formation, and geochemical and mineralogical composition of the exposure, which was used to interpret the diagenetic history throughout the outcrop. Therefore, it adds to the understanding of hydrocarbon migration and hydrocarbon pathways in this part of the Denver Basin. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

ABSTRACT: Herpesvirus (HV) has been known to cause disease in owls, with various clinical signs and outcomes for the last several decades. The HV DNA polymerase gene was detected in oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs of a male great grey owl (Strix nebulosa) in a zoological collection in Ljubljana, Slovenia. In the following 4 months, despite continuous HV detection in swabs, no clinical signs with a clear link to HV disease were observed. Hepatoprotective and immunostimulant therapies applied during this period did not prevent HV shedding. Therefore, peroral antiviral therapy with acyclovir (150 mg/kg q24 h for seven days) was performed, and the owl tested negative at the next sampling and remained negative for the next 8 months. After that, the owl again tested positive for HV presence, and the same protocol with antiviral therapy was performed. After 3 weeks with a negative test for HV presence, without any clinical signs of illness, the owl suddenly died because of Usutu virus (USUV) infection. Among all the owls at the zoo, interestingly, only the HV-positive great grey owl died because of USUV infection. The USUV sequence detected and obtained in this study clusters together with other Europe 2 sequences detected in neighboring countries. Our study shows the potential of acyclovir therapy in the prevention of herpesvirus shedding and, moreover, lowering the possibility for spreading HV to other owls and birds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of HV presence and USUV infection in a great grey owl in Slovenia. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Global environmental changes are associated with warmer average temperatures and more extreme weather events, potentially affecting wildlife population dynamics by altering demographic processes. Extreme weather events can reduce food resources and survival in all seasons of the year. Estimates of season-specific survival probabilities are therefore crucial to understand the moderating effect of extreme events on annual mortality. Here, we analysed survival probabilities of 307 radio-tracked juvenile little owls (Athene noctua) over two-week periods from fledging to their first breeding attempt in the following spring to assess the contribution of extreme weather events. Survival probabilities were typically lowest during the first weeks after fledging in summer but were moderated by seasonal extremes in winter. The duration of snow cover in winter had a strong negative effect on survival probability, while being food supplemented during the nestling stage increased survival during the first weeks after fledging in summer and ultimately led to a larger proportion of birds surviving the first year. Overall annual survival probability over the first year varied by 34.3% between 0.117 (95% credible interval 0.052–0.223) and 0.178 (0.097–0.293) depending on the severity of the winter, and was as high as 0.233 (0.127–0.373) for food-supplemented fledglings. In years with mild winters, the season with the lowest survival was the summer post-fledging period (0.508; 0.428–0.594), but in years with extensive snow cover the winter was the season with the lowest survival (0.481; 0.337–0.626). We therefore show that extreme weather events occurring in a particular season reduced the proportion of first-year survivors. Increasing extreme weather events can moderate seasonal survival probability through altering food supply of juvenile little owls either during the nestling period or in winter, with similarly large effects on annual survival and the viability of populations. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: While most studies focused on the impact of intensive agriculture on the barn owl’s diet, little is known about the effect of cropland abandonment. We compared the taxon composition/evenness and feeding guild structure of small mammal prey identified in pellets collected before (2004) and after (2012) the abandonment of 9% of cultivated fields within a cultural landscape. Data on prey abundance per pellet were analysed through non-metric multidimensional scaling and permutational, paired tests. Prey taxon evenness in 2012 was significantly lower than in 2004. That induced a shift in prey taxon composition as indicated by the significantly lower dietary similarity compared with the random expectation. The increasing and declining abundance of Murinae and Crocidurinae, respectively, had the largest contribution to the differentiation of the diet spectrum. Insectivorous prey was significantly more abundant in 2004 compared to 2012, while the opposite was true for omnivorous prey. Our results suggest that even a small fraction of abandoned crops in the landscape might induce a detectable shift in the barn owl’s food niche. The dietary effects are similar to those observed after agricultural intensification, that is, an increase in the abundance of generalists to the detriment of specialist mammal prey. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Optimal clutch size theory predicts a trade-off between egg number and fledgling body mass, potentially affecting their survival rate. Yet, only a few studies have directly linked clutch or brood size to energy (food), nestling growth rate, and timing of breeding. We studied the relationship among all these variables in the Eurasian eagle owl. Of 150 eggs laid in 48 nests, 119 hatched and 117 nestlings fledged, indicating low nestling mortality. The number of eggs, hatchlings and fledglings (possibly indicating territory quality) decreased with ordinal date. The total amount of food brought to the nest increased with brood size, but the average amount per nestling decreased. Nestling growth rate (and thus probably fledgling body mass) was negatively correlated with brood size. A trade-off between brood size and fledgling survival may lessen the benefit of occupying food-rich territories. However, we suggest that fledglings from large broods, despite their relatively low body mass, may have higher survival rates owing to their relatively early fledging. This may be due to: (1) higher prey abundance in late spring compared with late summer and (2) a longer period before entering the cold season. Variation in brood size may therefore represent a set of strategies linked to prey abundance.  © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Linnean Society of London.

ABSTRACT: Land use changes, driven by human activities such as agricultural intensification and urban expansion, have drastic effects on biodiversity. As these changes are anticipated to continue, understanding species’ adaptations to their evolving habitats is essential to find solutions for effective conservation efforts and sustainable management. In this study, we investigated how long-term changes in the agricultural landscape influence the breeding performance of a population of barn owls (Tyto alba) residing in nest boxes using data collected from 1993 until 2020. Specifically, we assessed how agricultural intensification, urbanization, and site availability affected barn owls' site occupancy and breeding success. Our results reveal that nest boxes surrounded by more agricultural fields are more likely to be occupied and have higher fledging success. Additionally, nest boxes installed higher on the barn were more likely to be occupied. Owls laid more eggs in nest boxes facing North than South or East. Clutches laid in nest boxes installed at higher altitudes were smaller. Finally, nest boxes with a higher density of surrounding nest boxes were less likely to be occupied and had smaller clutches. These insights show barn owls high reliance on the agricultural landscape surrounding their nesting sites, but also the importance of nest box characteristics to optimize their breeding success. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Background: The barn owl Tyto alba is a medium-sized nocturnal raptor, predator of small mammals, birds, reptiles, and insects, distributed all over the world. Environmentally uncontaminated wild barn owl pellets are hard and rare to find and provide a natural matrix for biological investigations. Results: Different solutions for collecting wild barn owl pellets at low environmental contamination are proposed. These solutions are based on a daily sanitized surface for sample retrieval, followed by rapid analysis. As an example of the possible investigations that can be carried out on these matrices, with the aim to highlight the relevance of the obtained results also from a biotechnological perspective. Two rare pellet samples from wild barn owl T. alba, appropriately collected in a rural area of central Italy, were analyzed using culture-dependent, molecular (Next-Generation Sequencing), and enzyme profile analysis techniques. The osteological observations of the bone remains provided useful information for identifying the prey, mainly rodents (Apodemus sp.). Under our experimental conditions, the results revealed both a wide heterogeneity between the pellet microbiota and a great percentage of uncultured bacteria not classified at the species level. Furthermore, microbial cultures of Malbranchea albolutea, Debaryomyces hansenii, and Lactobacillus sp. were isolated and studied. Finally, we quantified the environmental impact of our experimental work in terms of CO2 equivalent release. To compensate for the release of 300 kg/CO2 eq., three Taxus. baccata L. were planted. Conclusions: This work provides a starting point for developing an effective strategy to study and characterize wild barn owl pellets at low environmental contamination. It presents a simple and easy technique/protocol for collecting the pellets. The microbiota heterogeneity found in the two analyzed samples suggests that barn owl pellets can represent a potential natural reservoir for the discovery of new microorganisms to be used in various biotechnological applications. This could open the way for further large-scale studies on a greater number of samples and populations. Graphical Abstract: (Figure presented.). © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Syngamid worms (Nematoda: Syngamidae) parasitizing birds of prey are considered cosmopolitan, but the efforts to understand their biology and systematics are restricted to the Holarctic region. However, in the Neotropical region there is only one recent record with no data about its molecular characterization or its significance to the health of its hosts. Thus, this study aimed to identify through an integrative approach the Syngamid worms parasitizing a native owl, and to describe its pathological consequences. A total of 14 barn owls (Tyto alba) were dissected between 2015 and 2021, from which one bird was found to be parasitized by a high parasitic burden (i.e. 185 worms). Considering light microscopy and SEM, these nematodes were morphologically identified as Cyathostoma americana, and then supported through molecular analyses of nuclear loci ITS and LSU. The pathological changes were described as severe airsacculitis and pneumonia, which probably were the cause of death of the bird. This study represents the first effort to characterize the parasitism by this nematode in a nocturnal bird of prey from the Neotropics, with a lethal outcome. Additional studies are required from other geographical areas and Neotropical countries to better understand the dynamics of this parasite and their hosts, considering both diurnal and nocturnal birds of prey. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

ABSTRACT: Disequilibrium chemistry due to vertical mixing in the atmospheres of many brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets is well established. Atmosphere models for these objects typically parameterize mixing with the highly uncertain Kzz diffusion parameter. The role of mixing in altering the abundances of C-N-O-bearing molecules has mostly been explored for atmospheres with a solar composition. However, atmospheric metallicity and the C/O ratio also impact atmospheric chemistry. Therefore, we present the Sonora Elf Owl grid of self-consistent cloud-free 1D radiative-convective equilibrium model atmospheres for JWST observations, which includes a variation in Kzz across several orders of magnitude and also encompasses subsolar to supersolar metallicities and C/O ratios. We find that the impact of Kzz on the T(P) profile and spectra is a strong function of both Teff and metallicity. For metal-poor objects, Kzz has large impacts on the atmosphere at significantly higher Teff than in metal-rich atmospheres, where the impact of Kzz is seen to occur at lower Teff. We identify significant spectral degeneracies between varying Kzz and metallicity in multiple wavelength windows, in particular, at 3-5 μm. We use the Sonora Elf Owl atmospheric grid to fit the observed spectra of a sample of nine early to late T-type objects from Teff = 550-1150 K. We find evidence for very inefficient vertical mixing in these objects, with inferred Kzz values lying in the range between ∼101 and 104 cm2 s−1. Using self-consistent models, we find that this slow vertical mixing is due to the observations, which probe mixing in the deep detached radiative zone in these atmospheres. © 2024. The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: In Israel, Long-eared Owls (Asio otus) were considered primarily a wintering species with documented sporadic breeding. However, by the turn of the last century, it had become an increasingly numerous breeding species in the northern and central parts of the country. Based on the analysis of nest numbers in the Judea region, we determined that the population increased by at least 22% each year between 2003 and 2008, from 28 known nests in 2003 to 118 in 2008. We believe our study was conducted during the initial years for the Long-eared Owl population expansion in the region. We found that birds nesting in more-urban areas produced fewer offspring per brood than birds in more rural areas. We also found that nestlings from more-urban areas, exposed to artificial light at night, fledged earlier than birds from wild areas. The rapid growth in the numbers of nesting Long-eared Owls in the Judea region was likely due, at least in part, to the species' adaptation to urban areas. © 2024 Ornithological Societies of North America.

ABSTRACT: A key aspect of assessing the risk of extinction/extirpation for a particular wild species or population is the status of inbreeding, but the origin of inbreeding and the current mutational load are also two crucial factors to consider when determining survival probability of a population. In this study, we used samples from 502 barn owls from continental and island populations across Europe, with the aim of quantifying and comparing the level of inbreeding between populations with differing demographic histories. In addition to comparing inbreeding status, we determined whether inbreeding is due to non-random mating or high co-ancestry within the population. We show that islands have higher levels of inbreeding than continental populations, and that this is mainly due to small effective population sizes rather than recent consanguineous mating. We assess the probability that a region is autozygous along the genome and show that this probability decreased as the number of genes present in that region increased. Finally, we looked for evidence of reduced selection efficiency and purging in island populations. Among island populations, we found an increase in numbers of both neutral and deleterious minor alleles, possibly as a result of drift and decreased selection efficiency but we found no evidence of purging. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: As climatic variation re-shapes global biodiversity, understanding eco-evolutionary feedbacks during species range shifts is of increasing importance. Theory on range expansions distinguishes between two different forms: “pulled” and “pushed” waves. Pulled waves occur when the source of the expansion comes from low-density peripheral populations, while pushed waves occur when recruitment to the expanding edge is supplied by high-density populations closer to the species' core. How extreme events shape pushed/pulled wave expansion events, as well as trailing-edge declines/contractions, remains largely unexplored. We examined eco-evolutionary responses of a marine invertebrate (the owl limpet, Lottia gigantea) that increased in abundance during the 2014–2016 marine heatwaves near the poleward edge of its geographic range in the northeastern Pacific. We used whole-genome sequencing from 19 populations across >11 degrees of latitude to characterize genomic variation, gene flow, and demographic histories across the species' range. We estimated present-day dispersal potential and past climatic stability to identify how contemporary and historical seascape features shape genomic characteristics. Consistent with expectations of a pushed wave, we found little genomic differentiation between core and leading-edge populations, and higher genomic diversity at range edges. A large and well-mixed population in the northern edge of the species' range is likely a result of ocean current anomalies increasing larval settlement and high-dispersal potential across biogeographic boundaries. Trailing-edge populations have higher differentiation from core populations, possibly driven by local selection and limited gene flow, as well as high genomic diversity likely as a result of climatic stability during the Last Glacial Maximum. Our findings suggest that extreme events can drive poleward range expansions that carry the adaptive potential of core populations, while also cautioning that trailing-edge extirpations may threaten unique evolutionary variation. This work highlights the importance of understanding how both trailing and leading edges respond to global change and extreme events. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Owls hold significant utilitarian and aesthetic values for humans, ranging from pest control to ecotourism. However, cultural beliefs rooted in negative perceptions and emotions have led to conflicts and threats to many owl species. In South America, research on the relationship between owls and people is limited. This study aims to identify the variables involved in the construction of social knowledge, perceptions, and emotions toward owls. Face-to-face questionnaires were administered to residents in southern Ecuador. The data were analyzed using decision trees, a novel approach in ethnobiology. The results indicate that participants exhibited accurate knowledge of owl diet and habitat, with a majority having previous owl sightings and familiarity with their vocalizations. These factors, along with the sources informing their knowledge (such as school and family), contribute to the development of neutral perceptions and emotions toward these birds. The majority of participants recognize the importance of owls for the environment and support their conservation, with these two variables playing a crucial role in shaping positive emotions. Additionally, perceptions and emotions are primarily influenced by the region of residence. The presented data provide valuable insights into the significance of social perceptions and emotions in designing strategies to mitigate intentional owl mortality and persecution resulting from misconceptions and misperceptions. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Climate-driven migrations towards Northern latitudes are expected to reorganize biotic communities as result of range shift dynamics. However, the establishment of healthy populations of migrating species depends on habitat provision by receptor landscapes. Here, we ask if the rising temperatures and changes in precipitation regimes in western North America are likely to lead to an expansion of warm and dry-affiliated species, using the burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia) as a study case. This migratory species depends on grassland habitats for nesting and breeding, so we test for the effect of the lack of grasslands on the occupancy of future suitable environments. To estimate the burrowing owl's potential distribution, we used ecological niche models (ENMs) calibrated with climate and soil information and projected onto future scenarios of climate change (low versus high greenhouse gas emission). Then, we simulated environmental sorting using habitat filter masks derived from information on habitat use and forecasts of future land use change, focusing on grasslands as nesting and breeding habitat. We found that the burrowing owl could expand its geographic distribution by 3 to 10-fold towards Northern latitudes, especially under high-emission scenarios of climate change. However, nearly half of the suitable environments (up to 53,593 km2 of locations with suitable climate and soil) might not be covered by grasslands, due to conversion to agriculture and other human land uses which may prevent the establishment of breeding populations. Our results shed light on the pervasive effects of neglecting the preservation of grasslands across western North America, which could provide critically needed habitat for migrating species from lower latitudes. Enhancing and facilitating the colonization of novel species is a shift in the static paradigm of biodiversity conservation and a proactive measure for climate change adaptation. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Anticoagulant rodenticides (ARs) are widely used for pest control, resulting in their pervasive presence in the environment and posing significant toxicological risks to a range of predatory and scavenging species. Our study mainly aimed to evaluate AR exposure and effects in nestlings of eagle owl (Bubo bubo) from the Region of Murcia (southeastern Spain). We analysed ARs in blood samples (n = 106) using high-performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole (HPLC-TQ), assessed the influence of potential anthropogenic (presence of livestock farms, landfills and human population density) and environmental (land uses and proximity to watercourses) variables, and measured prothrombin time (PT) and plasma biochemical parameters as biomarkers of effects. Our results showed the presence of AR residues in 91.5% of the nestlings, with 70.8% exhibiting multiple ARs (up to six compounds in a single individual). Second-generation ARs (SGARs) were the most prevalent compounds. The analysis of biochemical parameters indicated that the sampled individuals were in good physiological condition. Although PT was positively correlated with total AR concentration (ΣARs), the relationship was not significant (Rho = 0.04; p = 0.49). Regarding environmental factors, higher ΣARs were associated with the most urbanised study site and the presence of landfills, likely due to the increased availability of rodent prey. The prevalence of two SGARs (brodifacoum and difenacoum) was linked to closer proximity to riverbeds, suggesting a contamination pathway associated with inland aquatic ecosystems, where these AR compounds may concentrate due to water scarcity. This study underscores the widespread exposure of eagle owls to ARs and highlights the importance of effective monitoring and management of these pollutants to protect conservation-concern wildlife in Mediterranean semiarid regions. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The maintenance of colour variation in wild populations has long fascinated evolutionary biologists, although most studies have focused on discrete traits exhibiting rather simple inheritance patterns and genetic architectures. However, the study of continuous colour traits and their potentially oligo- or polygenic genetic bases remains rare in wild populations. We studied the genetics of the continuously varying white-to-rufous plumage coloration of the European barn owl (Tyto alba) using a genome-wide association approach on the whole-genome data of 75 individuals. We confirmed a mutation at the melanocortin-1-receptor gene (MC1R) is involved in the coloration and identified two new regions, located in super-scaffolds 9 and 42. The combination of the three regions explains most of the colour variation (80.37%, 95% credible interval 58.45-100%). One discovered region, located in the sex chromosome, differs between the most extreme colorations in owls sharing a specific MC1R genotype. This region may play a role in the colour sex dimorphism of this species, possibly in interaction with the autosomal MC1R. We thus provide insights into the genetic architecture of continuous colour variation, pointing to an oligogenic basis with potential epistatic effects among loci that should aid future studies understanding how continuous colour variation is maintained in nature.  © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Urbanization and expanding road networks threaten some avian populations through habitat loss and degradation. Barn owls (Tyto alba) have been particularly affected through roadway mortality, loss of grassland, and conversion or destruction of nesting sites. To combat declines and bolster reproduction, and as part of integrated pest management to reduce crop damage, some land managers provide supplemental owl nesting sites via the installation of nest boxes. If nearby habitat and land cover characteristics are not considered when placing boxes, such as major roads or other anthropogenic features, owls could be attracted to locations that could hinder populations further. We investigated the effects of roads and urban areas on barn owl breeding occupancy and productivity to provide information to help guide the placement of nest boxes. We monitored >300 nest boxes over the 2020 and 2021 breeding seasons in southwestern Idaho, USA, where substantial roadway mortality of barn owls occurs. Barn owls occupied >60% of nest boxes, but the likelihood of breeding occupancy decreased with increasing proximity of nest boxes to roads. Boxes 500 m from roads had a predicted probability of occupancy of over 0.9, which was nearly double that of boxes within 100 m. Proximity to roads also was associated with reduced productivity such that boxes within 100 m of roads were predicted to produce approximately 1 fewer fledgling than those 500 m away. There was no evidence that the proportion of urban area surrounding nest boxes substantially influenced breeding occupancy or productivity. Thus, land managers can consider placing nest boxes for barn owls farther from roads when possible as a potential tactic to increase the probability of breeding occupancy and to foster higher productivity. © 2024 The Wildlife Society.

ABSTRACT: The burrowing owl Athene cunicularia is a species known for its adaptation to urban environments, able to adjust their behaviors according to environmental conditions. This work reports the record of predation of two species of columbids by Athene cunicularia. Sixty-three burrowing owl nests were monitored in Paraná state between June 2022 and August 2023. The predated species were identified through direct observation at the time of predation and by comparing wings and feathers found in the owls’ nests with pictures of the suspected species. Both Columba livia and Zenaida auriculata were registered, counting seven records. Six occurred in different points of the study area, while one occurred in Roraima state. The predation of these birds by Athene cunicularia should not be isolated cases, as they cohabit urban areas. Our data highlights the species’ adjustment to the urban environment since the domestic pigeon is not part of its known diet and has about 124% of the owl’s body mass, reinforcing the importance of Athene cunicularia in urban environments as they control populations of harmful or even invasive species. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Sociedade Brasileira de Ornitologia 2024.

ABSTRACT: As urban data is becoming more complex, researchers are exploring the use of linked data for studying complex urban phenomena. However, mere transformation of heterogeneous data formats to formal knowledge graph formats such as Ontology Web Language (OWL) result in the loss of data. Therefore, we propose an automated approach based on standards to automatically transform conceptual models of urban data to OWL. In this article, we propose reusable configuration rules for transforming UML to OWL as well as the reasoning behind our choice. Our approach is demonstrated by the transformation of a 3D geospatial urban data model, CityGML 3.0, to a network of computational ontologies, informally entitled “CityOWL”. We also propose several alignments between the resulting ontologies and existing geospatial, semantic, and temporal linked data standards such as GeoSPARQL, SKOS, and OWL-Time.

ABSTRACT: Considering several logistical limitations associated with live trapping in arid environments, owl pellet analysis provides a potentially useful alternative to estimate small mammal diversity. Owl pellet analysis has been used to estimate local small mammal diversity under the assumption that the method can reliably reflect the composition of local small mammal assemblages. However, the validity of owl pellet contents for use in ecological assessments has not been established. Thus, the present study aimed to determine the potential for eastern barn owl (Tyto delicatula) pellet analysis to improve the monitoring of small mammals in arid Australia. We analysed two ecological datasets from Pilungah Reserve on the northern boundary of the Simpson Desert in central Australia to assess their effectiveness for detecting expected small mammal species: 250 owl pellets collected from a known roosting site and 5 years of small mammal records from historical, long-term trapping surveys. Species composition and detection probability of mammals varied depending on the method used. Owl pellet analysis returned higher species richness overall, while traditional trapping methods indicated a higher probability of detecting certain mammal species (e.g., the wongai ningaui Ningaui ridei, brush-tailed mulgara Dasycercus blythi and the hairy-footed dunnart Sminthopsis hirtipes). Importantly, analysis of owl pellets revealed two mammal species that had never been detected at the study site (dusky hopping mouse Notomys fuscus and Carpentarian false antechinus Pseudantechinus cf. mimulus). We suggest that owl pellet analysis could be particularly valuable when used as a precursor or in concert with traditional trapping to monitor and assist in the conservation of small mammal species in arid environments. © 2024 Ecological Society of Australia.

ABSTRACT: The silent flight of barn owls is associated with wing and feather specialisations. Three special features are known: a serrated leading edge that is formed by free-standing barb tips which appears as a comb-like structure, a soft dorsal surface, and a fringed trailing edge. We used a model of the leading edge comb with 3D-curved serrations that was designed based on 3D micro-scans of rows of barbs from selected barn-owl feathers. The interaction of the flow with the serrations was measured with Particle-Image-Velocimetry in a flow channel at uniform steady inflow and was compared to the situation of inflow with freestream turbulence, generated from the turbulent wake of a cylinder placed upstream. In steady uniform flow, the serrations caused regular velocity streaks and a flow turning effect. When vortices of different size impacted the serrations, the serrations reduced the flow fluctuations downstream in each case, exemplified by a decreased root-mean-square value of the fluctuations in the wake of the serrations. This attenuation effect was stronger for the spanwise velocity component, leading to an overall flow homogenization. Our findings suggest that the serrations of the barn owl provide a passive flow control leading to reduced leading-edge noise when flying in turbulent environments. © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Plastic pollution in terrestrial and freshwater environments and its accumulation along food chains has been poorly studied in birds. The Barn owl (Tyto alba) is an opportunistic and nocturnal apex predator feeding mostly on small mammals. In this note, we reported evidence of microplastics (MPs) contamination in Barn owl pellets collected, for the first time, in two sites with different levels of anthropization (low: natural landscape mosaic vs. high extensive croplands). The following polymers have been recorded: polyvinylchloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE), expanded polyester (EPS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), polyester (PL), viscose, and starch-based biopolymer. We found significant higher MPs frequency in the most anthropized site. Our results suggest that pellet’ analysis may represent a cost-effective method for monitoring MP contamination along food chains in terrestrial ecosystems. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

ABSTRACT: We describe the vertebrate remains found in a Holocene deposit inside the Taiti Cave, Socotra Island (Yemen). The fossils were found in a sand dune occupying almost entirely the main cavity of the Cave, with some bones collected on the surface and the majority of them found under its surface, in particular below a tiny level of hardened sand, the latter probably related to a guano deposit. They were mostly isolated bones, but under the guano layer, some of them were aggregated and recognizable as belonging to owl pellets. The analysis of the vertebrate remains reveals a great prey diversity and, together with the location of the pellet accumulation and the almost perfect preservation of the remains, indicates that the deposit derived from a pellet accumulation made by Tyto alba. This hypothesis is corroborated by a Tyto alba beak fragment found in the Hoq cave, in a deposit of uncertain stratigraphic context. The data presented herein represent the first documented evidence of the presence of Tyto alba on Socotra Island and indicate the probable existence of a now extinct population of Tyto alba on the island during the Holocene, already extinct at the time of the first ornithological surveys during the XIX Century. © 2023 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Aim: Climatic gradients shape geographic variation in phenotypic traits that are involved in animal thermoregulation. Therefore, increasing temperatures under global warming are expected to cause change over time in traits that show predictable spatial patterns according to environmental clines (body and appendage size, tegument coloration), as well exemplified by biogeographic rules and shown by increasing literature at a local scale. However, whether temporal shifts in phenotypic traits vary spatially according to the magnitude of the change in local climatic conditions is still unknown. Location: World. Taxon: Barn owl species complex (Tyto alba group). Methods: By using thousands of museum specimens collected across the globe from 1901 to 2018, we calculated within-population change over time in wing length, bill length and melanin-based plumage coloration and examined whether these trends differed across geographic regions, latitudes and gradients of climate changes. Results: We showed that populations exposed to an increasing warmer climate were subjected to a more marked decrease in body size, as gauged by wing length, and also absolute bill length that displayed a similar, although less steep, pattern of shrinking over time. In addition, phaeomelanin-based ventral plumage colour has become paler in regions where the climate changed into warmer and drier, and darker where both temperature and precipitation increased. Main Conclusions: These trends are generally coherent with the predictions based on Bergmann's and Gloger's rules, but not Allen's rule, and suggest that temporal shifts in body size and tegument colour depend on the magnitude of the alteration in climatic conditions, with populations living in regions where the climate has changed the most that are subjected to more marked phenotypic changes. Spatio-temporal variation in climate has driven within-species phenotypic clines, and it is expected to increase differences among populations according to the predicted further climate change. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The global population and status of Snowy Owls Bubo scandiacus are particularly challenging to assess because individuals are irruptive and nomadic, and the breeding range is restricted to the remote circumpolar Arctic tundra. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) uplisted the Snowy Owl to Vulnerable in 2017 because the suggested population estimates appeared considerably lower than historical estimates, and it recommended actions to clarify the population size, structure, and trends. Here we present a broad review and status assessment, an effort led by the International Snowy Owl Working Group (ISOWG) and researchers from around the world, to estimate population trends and the current global status of the Snowy Owl. We use long-term breeding data, genetic studies, satellite-GPS tracking, and survival estimates to assess current population trends at several monitoring sites in the Arctic and we review the ecology and threats throughout the Snowy Owl range. An assessment of the available data suggests that current estimates of a worldwide population of 14,000-28,000 breeding adults are plausible. Our assessment of population trends at five long-term monitoring sites suggests that breeding populations of Snowy Owls in the Arctic have decreased by more than 30% over the past three generations and the species should continue to be categorised as Vulnerable under the IUCN Red List Criterion A2. We offer research recommendations to improve our understanding of Snowy Owl biology and future population assessments in a changing world.  © The Author(s), 2024.

ABSTRACT: Small, isolated populations can be especially sensitive to poor habitat conditions due to their limited capacity to adapt or disperse. Management of such populations, with an objective to implement the most effective strategies, is a conservation priority. The Norfolk Island morepork (Ninox novaeseelandiae undulata) is a Critically Endangered hawk-owl endemic to Norfolk Island with an estimated population of 25 individuals. This species faces compounding threats from habitat degradation and loss, as well as inbreeding depression. It presents an exemplar for the development of habitat management strategies for top-order predators in small, isolated systems. We paired fine-scale light detection and ranging-derived habitat variables with tracking data to quantify habitat suitability and the relative importance of environmental variables. Maximum entropy modeling indicated vegetation patch size and canopy height were important habitat variables, with moreporks more likely to be found in larger patches and canopy heights above 7 m. Morepork presence was not strongly influenced by the type of wooded vegetation; rather, the species appears to be a generalist occupier of forested areas. We demonstrate that suitable habitat during the breeding season is currently constrained, with coverage limited to one-third (34%) of the island and an estimated carrying capacity of 36 morepork pairs. Restoration of native forest in cleared areas adjacent to existing wooded patches, with a specific goal to increase patch size, was the optimized management strategy to increase in situ carrying capacity. This study has demonstrated how habitat suitability modeling can inform targeted habitat restoration to enhance threatened species recovery. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: Species host diverse microbial communities that can impact their digestion and health, which has led to much interest in understanding the factors that influence their microbiota. We studied the developmental, environmental, and social factors that influence the microbiota of nestling barn owls (Tyto alba) through a partial cross-fostering experiment that manipulated the social and nest environment of the nestlings. We then examined the nestling microbiota before and three weeks after the exchange of nestlings between nests, along with the microbiota of the adults at the nest and nestlings in unmanipulated nests. Results: We found that nestlings had higher bacterial diversity and different bacterial communities than adults. The microbiota of nestlings was more like that of their mothers than their fathers, but the similarity to the father tended to increase with the amount of time the father was in close proximity to the nest, as measured from movement data. Cross-fostered offspring had higher bacterial diversity and greater changes in bacterial community composition over time than control offspring. Cross-fostering led the microbiota of the nestlings in the experiment to converge on similar bacterial communities. The microbiota of nestling owls therefore rapidly changed along with alterations to their social and nest environments. Conclusions: These results highlight the dynamic nature of the microbiota during early development and that social interactions can shape microbial communities. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Marine anthropogenic litter (MAL) pollution is a growing concern in coastal environments. These ecosystems are home to rich biodiversity but face significant challenges due to the accumulation of plastics and other solid waste, compromising the region's natural aesthetics and environmental health. This study investigates how marine pollution and the accumulation of MAL impact these ecosystems. We use the burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia) as an example to illustrate the potential risks associated with this pollution, especially for those species that nest near coastal regions along the Brazilian Amazon coast. At Atalaia Beach, the data collected revealed a significant diversity of MAL, totaling approximately 532 items. Among them, styrofoam and foam were the most representative, with 33.08% and 21.05%, respectively, totaling 54.14% of the recorded MAL. The distribution of these materials indicates a correlation with human activities, especially the use of plastics for fishing and recreation. Notably, styrofoam and foam were frequently found in burrowing owl burrows, highlighting the use of MAL around nests and the potential risks this plastic material poses to the species' nesting and rearing of their chicks. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo) has adapted to hunt local fauna that are subject to the influence of human agricultural activities. In the sparse forests, marshes and lakes of the mountainous regions of central Norway, the eagle-owl's diet is dominated by small mammals and gallinaceous birds, but the common frog Rana temporaria features more frequently in regions near the fjords, with various species of seabirds predominating on some islands. The eagle-owls, breeding in several protected regions of the Czech Republic, hunting in agricultural areas small mammals and game animals in addition to waterbirds nesting by fishponds. In Slovakia, the majority of the eagle-owl population nests on the edges of mountain valleys. In the past, they hunted small mammals and amphibians on pastureland located deep in the mountains, but they have adapted to hunting larger prey in more intensively farmed valleys. Predominantly in the eastern part of Turkey, the diet of Eurasian eagle-owl hunting on natural mountain steppes has been studied, where mammals of the family Cricetidae dominate. In the arid conditions of the southern countries of Syria, Jordan and Israel, mammals of the Gerbillinae sub-family predominated in addition to a higher proportion of birds. In the more variable areas of Iran, eagle-owl diets feature a wide range of indigenous mammals and birds, with different species represented in several territories. Studies from the edges of the Fergana Valley in southern Kyrgyzstan found differences in the diets of eagle-owls living at lower elevations and those living higher in the mountains, while birds were the predominant prey in the Kalek site. Smaller samples of eagle-owl diets were also collected in the Altai Mountains of Mongolia, the Barguzinsky Mountains to the east of Lake Baikal and the Vaida Mountain on Sakhalin Island. The results presented in this study can also contribute to our knowledge about the fauna of the above-mentioned regions.  © 2024 Ján Obuch.

ABSTRACT: Our study aimed to compare the anatomical features of the eyeball, lens, and retina between the two raptor birds of different visual active clock hours: the diurnal common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus rupicilaeformis) and the nocturnal little owl (Athene noctua glaux) using gross, morphometric analysis, histological, and scanning and transmission electron microscopy techniques. The semi-spherical eyeball of the kestrel had less convexity on the anterior surface than on the posterior surface; meanwhile, it was relatively larger in the owl. There is a relationship between the corneal diameter (CD) and the eye axial length (AL). There were significant differences in the retinal layer thickness between the two raptors, in which the diurnal kestrel had a thinner pigmented epithelium and photoreceptor layers compared to the nocturnal owl. Moreover, the inner nuclear and outer nuclear, inner plexiform, and outer plexiform layers in the diurnal kestrel were larger than those in the nocturnal owl. The differences in the pigmented epithelium layer lead to the higher visual acuity and better color vision of the diurnal kestrel compared to the nocturnal owl. The photoreceptor layer in diurnal kestrel was composed of single large and double cones, which are composed of chief cones and accessory cones; meanwhile, the photoreceptor layer in nocturnal owl had only single elongated rods. We concluded that the lens and retina of the two raptors revealed great variations in reflecting the adaptation of each bird to different modes of life. The statistical analysis found a strong positive correlation between the axial length of the eye and the corneal diameter in both birds, as indicated by the Pearson correlation coefficient. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: The flammulated owl is a small insectivorous owl that occupies forests in western North America during the spring and summer breeding season. The species has not been extensively studied across its range but is considered sensitive or at risk by many states, provinces, and forest management agencies. We implemented the largest survey ever performed for this species across multiple western states to assess its distribution and habitat associations. We completed one to three survey visits at 3137 points from 2009 – 2021 and detected flammulated owls at 309 (9.8%) survey points. We used machine-learning occurrence modeling to estimate habitat associations. We found flammulated owl presence to be most strongly associated with a specific climate envelope, potentially putting them at increasing risk from climate change. Flammulated owls in our study had a positive association with aspen, Douglas-fir, and to a lesser degree, ponderosa pine forests, and a negative association with lodgepole pine. They occupied sites (100-ha areas centered on the survey point) with higher canopy cover, moderate slope and roughness, located closer to ridgetops, and with higher probability of wildfire. Forests at over 15% of our sampled points have burned in the time since they were surveyed. In addition, our finding of a weak association with ponderosa pine forest may reflect changes due to fire suppression that in many areas may have degraded habitat quality of those forests for flammulated owls. We suggest that maps of the range and distribution for the species be updated to reflect our findings, specifically in western Wyoming, south-central Idaho, and southern California, which may impact planning for forest management in some areas. Furthermore, forest management actions to promote aspen restoration and regeneration, and to restore ponderosa pine stands to their historical structure and condition, may help this sensitive species adapt to impacts of climate change. Lastly, while this study covered a broad portion of the western United States, it did not cover several areas where flammulated owls are known to exist – Montana, Oregon, southern Utah, Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico; we encourage further research in these areas. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The constituent habitat use by remotely tracked tagged Short-eared Owls Asio flammeus on moorland and other dwarf shrubland–grassland mosaics was assessed in Britain and Norway. A preference for the owls to hunt over patches of graminoids within managed moorland in Britain contrasted with a tendency to hunt more over dwarf shrubs in Norway. The observed differences likely reflect the availability of small mammal prey and how this contrasts between largely single-species stands of managed heather Calluna vulgaris in Britain and more naturally diverse (species and structure) dwarf shrubland in Norway. Diurnal patterns of landscape use differed between areas, with owls in Scotland and Norway tending to hunt over ground at higher elevations at night but the reverse being observed in England. The difference demonstrates behavioural plasticity of Short-eared Owls, potentially driven by minimising risks from predation within different areas. Conservation implications include increased and proportionate priority for grassland management on British moorlands and the restoration of natural montane dwarf shrublands, both routes to enhance conditions for and the availability of small mammal prey. As a generality, site protection for Short-eared Owls and their monitoring need to acknowledge uncertainties around variations in abundance and occupation by this nomadic species. © Deutsche Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V. 2024.

ABSTRACT: Platynosomum spp. are parasites that inhabit the gallbladder and bile ducts of various mammals and birds worldwide. Most studies of Platynosomum spp. in birds focus on the observation and morphological characterization of the parasite through parasitological or molecular examinations, with scarce literature describing anatomopathological alterations, mainly histopathological. We report the case of a male barn owl infected with Platynosomum spp. At necropsy, the barn owl showed dilation with parasites and fibrosis of the intrahepatic bile ducts and gallbladder. Microscopically, it was possible to identify trematodes in the bile ducts associated with a lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory infiltrate. The morphological structures of the worms were described on histopathology and direct examination. The presence of parasitism that is usually cosmopolitan in wild animals represents a risk to the biodiversity of fauna in the region, as well as a warning about the spread and maintenance of the biological cycle of the worm in humans and domestic animals. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The pampas of South America represent one of the most productive lands for agriculture in the world, and consequently this activity has expanded throughout the region, especially in Argentina. In this context, native fauna faces various risks associated with agriculture, with exposure to pesticides being one of the most dangerous and deadly. Assessing the impact of pesticides on wildlife becomes fundamental and the use of sentinel species emerges as an important tool to monitor environmental health. In this study, we determined pesticide levels in the burrowing owl Athene cunicularia nesting in both rural and urban areas of the argentinean pampas. We used a multiple scale approach to evaluate the influence of land-uses (urban, crops, and grazing fields) at the nesting site on the contaminant load of A. cunicularia individuals, and assessed the potential use of this owl as a sentinel species. From March 2018 to January 2020, A. cunicularia feathers were collected at their nest sites in one urban and two rural areas. These samples were analyzed for the presence of contaminants, including chlorpyrifos and 18 organochlorine pesticides. All the compounds analyzed were detected in A. cunicularia samples. The chlorpyrifos showed the highest frequency of occurrence and concentration, thus denoting the exposure of owls to current-use pesticides. ∑DDTs showed the highest occurrence among organochlorines, followed by ∑HCHs > ∑Endosulfans > ∑Heptachlors > ∑Drins = ∑Chlordanes > methoxychlor. Principal Component Analysis showed that most of the compounds found in A. cunicularia samples showed a positive association with grazing fields, suggesting that exposure to contaminants does not depend on specific habitat use at the local scale, but probably the regional scale. Our results evidenced the exposure of A. cunicularia individuals to past and current-use pesticides in the pampas of Argentina, and indicate that this owl would be useful as a sentinel species. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: We provide vocalization recordings of a male Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis) in a meadow of the Sierra San Pedro Mártir, Baja California, Mexico, on 27 April 2023, whose presence had been recently noted but not verified with vocalization records. This recording confirms the current presence of the species in northern Baja California and suggests the existence of a potentially important reservoir of intact habitat. © 2024 Brigham Young University.

ABSTRACT: The three-dimensional configuration of the neck that produces extreme head turn in owls was studied using the Joint Coordinate System. The limits of planar axial rotation (AR), lateral, and sagittal bending in each vertebral joint were measured. They are not extraordinary among birds, except probably for the extended ability for AR. The vertebral joint angles involved in the 360° head turn do not generally exceed the limits of planar mobility. Rotation in one plane does not expand the range of motion in the other, with one probable exception being extended dorsal bending in the middle of the neck. Therefore, the extreme 360° head turn can be presented as a simple combination of the three planar motions in the neck joints. Surprisingly, certain joints are always laterally bent or axially rotated to the opposite side than the head was turned. This allows keeping the anterior part of the neck parallel to the thoracic spine, which probably helps preserve the ability for peering head motions throughout the full head turn. The potential ability of one-joint muscles of the owl neck, the mm. intertransversarii, to ensure the 360° head turn was addressed. It was shown that the 360° head turn does not require these muscles to shorten beyond the known contraction limit of striated vertebrate muscles. Shortening by 50% or less is enough for the mm. intertransversarii in the middle neck region for the 360° head turn. This study has broad implications for further research on vertebral mobility and function in a variety of tetrapods, providing a new method for CT scan-based measurement of intervertebral angles. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Two subspecies of the spectacled owl Pulsatrix perspicillata (Latham, 1790) are recorded for Brazil: P.p.perspicillata, widely distributed, and P.p.pulsatrix (Wied, 1820), restricted to the southern portion of the Atlantic Forest. The latter was last documented in 1974 and is considered a critically endangered taxon in Brazil. Here we report on the continued existence of P.p.pulsatrix fifty years later, based on a road-killed bird, and a second one photographed and tape-recorded in December 2022 on the northern coast of the state of São Paulo. These represent the first photographic documentation of this taxon in the wild, and the third available recording of its song. The plumage of P.p.pulsatrix differs from that of other subspecies of P. perspicillata in having the facial markings (forming the ‘spectacle’) less contrasting with the surrounding plumage, and having the crown, nape and breast band concolorous with the back and tail. In addition, we observed that the song of P.p.pulsatrix appears to differ from that of other subspecies of P. perspicillata in having an overall slower pace, with the interval between syllables expanding and the dominant frequency increasing slightly. These acoustic differences, documented here for the first time, are at least partially in line with those previously noted to consider P.p.pulsatrix a separate taxon, which was dismissed in a more recent revision of the genus. We argue that, considering such differences and the geographical distribution of both taxa, P.p.pulsatrix should indeed be recognized as an Evolutionarily Significant Unit, as either a subspecies or a species. Furthermore, we highlight that P.p.perspicillata has been recently recorded in historical record locations of P.p.pulsatrix, which may indicate an expansion of the former’s range and represent an additional threat to this vanishing owl. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Sociedade Brasileira de Ornitologia 2024.

ABSTRACT: Northern Pygmy-Owls (Glaucidium gnoma) occur in mountainous regions of western North America, but their movements and seasonal patterns of distribution are poorly understood. Assumed to be altitudinal migrants, data evaluating their seasonal distributions are scarce. We quantified the seasonal distributions of Northern Pygmy-Owls across elevations in the Oregon Coast Range, USA, by using call playbacks to elicit responses. We hypothesized that pygmy-owls would be more widely distributed at higher elevations during the summer, and during the cooler winter months their distributions would shift downslope to more moderate climates. Northern Pygmy-Owls responded at all elevations and in all seasons but responded most frequently at middle elevations. The pattern of responses with respect to season and elevation was consistent in the 2 years of our study (2020-2021), suggesting that they were not altitudinal migrants in our study area during those years. However, characterizing altitudinal migration from distributions alone requires careful interpretation so we encourage further studies using tagged and tracked individuals. © 2024 Wilson Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: The stability of measurement parameters over the years is essential in long-term monitoring of populations. The goal of this study was to evaluate the variation of selected acoustic parameters in male Tawny Owl territorial calls. A total of ten sites were monitored in low mountains mostly covered by deciduous forests. The owl calls were recorded from February to July and in one case in September. Three acoustic parameters were analysed: the duration of the first and third notes and the total duration of the call. The third note showed the lowest coefficient of variation (10.4%) over the years. This parameter also showed the lowest range between minimum and maximum values. All parameters had higher inter-individual than intra-individual variation. The stability of the parameters was analysed in two males between two years. All parameters showed significant differences in one male. The total duration of the call was also different for the second male. Individual recognition based on the duration of notes is therefore not a suitable method for long-term monitoring. These findings may help in selecting appropriate parameters for individual recognition and a more detailed view of the stability of acoustic parameters. © 2024 Nederlandse Ornithologische Unie.

ABSTRACT: The Long-eared Owl (Asio otus) is one of few owl species with sexually dimorphic plumage coloration, with males displaying a light phenotype and females displaying a dark phenotype. This dichromatism can be a useful tool for sexing these owls in the field; however, we observed that some individuals display an intermediate phenotype, which is neither distinctly light nor dark and limits confidence in identifying sex. In this study, we used plumage coloration of the underwing, face, and legs to predict the sex of Long-eared Owls banded during spring migration at Whitefish Point, Michigan, USA, from 2016 to 2022 (n ¼ 1967) and summarized differences between measurements of size such as body mass, wing length, and tail length among the three phenotypes. We found that Long-eared Owls with light plumage (classified as male) were the smallest, owls with dark plumage (classified as female) were the largest, and owls with intermediate plumage (classified as unknown sex) were intermediate in size. Using molecular sexing on a subsample of these owls (n ¼ 116), we found that only 1 of 76 (1.3%) owls with light or dark plumage had its sex incorrectly predicted using plumage color, and of the 40 unknown sex individuals with intermediate plumage, 35 (87.5%) were female and 5 (12.5%) were male. This study reinforces previous findings that distinctly light or dark plumage is a reliable indicator of sex in Long-eared Owls, and provides new evidence that Long-eared Owls with intermediate plumage are likely small females but may also be large males. We conclude that Long-eared Owls migrating through the Great Lakes region of the United States display significant differences in both size and plumage between the sexes, and that these two measures of dimorphism are correlated. © 2024 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The short-eared owl (Asio flammeus) has a wide distribution across the world, and it inhabits open lands, grasslands, and marshes. Small mammals are its main prey, but it also feeds on other food items according to seasonal variations. Despite its wide distribution, little information about its food habits has been published in Argentina and none for Patagonia. In this study, we report the analysis of nine pellets of this species for a site located 6 km north of Puerto Madryn city (Chubut, Argentina). This area is located in the Monte Phytogeographical Province and has a flooded place with sewage water, invasive weeds, and herbaceous vegetation. We measured pellets and disaggregated them using hot water; all prey remains were identified to the finest taxonomic level. We found 49 prey items: 73.5% of small mammals (mainly native rodents and marsupials) and 26.5% of insects (mainly spider wasps); small mammals were the prey that contributed the most to biomass (99.2%). Our results are consistent with previous works carried on the southern distribution of this species, where rodents were the most consumed prey and the main item to biomass. However, we found the lowest percentage for rodents in comparison with other studies in southern South America. We did not record birds among prey, although this item was found in previous studies. Despite we analyzed a small sample, this study is the first contribution for Argentinean Patagonia on the diet of A. flammeus, a species with a wide geographic distribution that lacked of food habits data in this region. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Sociedade Brasileira de Ornitologia 2023.

ABSTRACT: We determined the population density and number of Eurasian Eagle-Owl in one of the regions of Russia (Republic of Mordovia). The work was carried out over sixteen years (2009-2024). The studies were conducted using methods of direction finding of vocalizing birds with subsequent search for nests and with the use of digital voice recorders. The Eurasian Eagle-Owl reliably lives in 16 out of 22 districts (72.7%). During our research, we built more than 60 artificial nests, in which Eurasian Eagle-Owls subsequently settled. In total, during the research period, 89 Eurasian Eagle-Owl habitats (of which 38 in four stationary sites), 125 nesting cases, and 214 chicks were identified. Over the entire period, the birds laid 282 eggs. Productivity for couples was 76%. The most successful years in terms of the number of eggs and chicks in nests were 2014, 2018, 2022, 2023. The density of the Eurasian Eagle-Owl population ranges from 3.1 to 5 pairs per 100 km2. The total population density in the open spaces of the region can reach 583 habitats. The presence of a large number of ravines with stands determines the high population density of Eurasian Eagle-Owl in Mordovia. Making artificial nesting boxes in ravines improves the suitability of breeding sites and promotes better survival of young individuals.  © 2024 Alexey Andreychev et al., published by Sciendo.

ABSTRACT: An epidemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) began in North America in the winter of 2021. The introduced Eurasian H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b virus subsequently reassorted with North American avian influenza strains. This postmortem study describes the lesions and influenza A virus antigen distribution in 3 species of raptors, including bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus, n = 6), red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis, n = 9), and great horned owls (Bubo virginianus, n = 8), naturally infected with this virus strain based on positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and sequencing results from oropharyngeal swabs. The birds presented with severe neurologic signs and either died or were euthanized because of the severity of their clinical signs and suspected influenza virus infection. Gross lesions were uncommon and included forebrain hemorrhages in 2 eagles, myocarditis in 1 hawk, and multifocal pancreatic necrosis in 3 owls. Histological lesions were common and included encephalitis, myocarditis, multifocal pancreas necrosis, multifocal adrenal necrosis, histiocytic splenitis, and anterior uveitis in decreasing frequency. Influenza A viral antigen was detected in brain, heart, pancreas, adrenal gland, kidney, spleen, liver, and eye. In conclusion, bald eagles, red-tailed hawks, and great horned owls infected with the HPAI clade 2.3.4.4b virus strain and showing neurological signs of illness may develop severe or fatal disease with histologically detectable lesions in the brain that are frequently positive for viral antigen. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To develop an ultrasound (US)-guided ventral approach to the brachial plexus (BP) and evaluate nerve anatomy and staining in barred owl cadavers. Study design: Prospective, cadaveric study. Animals: Eleven adult male and female barred owl cadavers with a body mass of 0.43–0.98 kg. Methods: Eleven frozen cadavers were thawed for 48 hours, weighed and assigned a body condition score. Ten cadavers were placed in dorsal recumbency with wings abducted. US-guided visualization of the BP was achieved by placing a 13-6 MHz linear probe over the ventral aspect of the scapulohumeral joint, parallel to the sternum. A 22 gauge, 50 mm insulated needle was advanced in-plane in a caudal-to-cranial direction. In each owl, injection targeting one BP was performed with 0.4 mL kg–1 of a 1:1 0.5% ropivacaine and 1% methylene blue solution. Dissection was performed 15 minutes postinjection. Nerve staining was deemed successful if ≥ 1 cm of circumferential staining was achieved. The eleventh owl cadaver was injected with a 1:1 solution of 1% methylene blue and 74% ioversol contrast into both wings, and computed tomography (CT) was performed just before and 15 minutes after injection. Results: The BP was clearly identified ultrasonographically in cadavers weighing > 0.5 kg. An injectate volume of 0.4 mL kg–1 provided complete staining of the BP branches in all cadavers. CT scan revealed no contrast within the coelomic cavity. Conclusions and clinical relevance: The US-guided BP injection using a ventral approach was easily performed in barred owl cadavers weighing > 0.5 kg. The injection of 0.4 mL kg–1 of a ropivacaine–dye solution resulted in complete staining of the BP branches in all wings, suggesting that this technique could provide analgesia for structures distal to the scapulohumeral joint. Clinical studies are necessary to confirm the safety and efficacy of this technique in barred owls and other bird species. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Acoustic spatial capture-recapture (SCR) methods appear ideally suited for estimating population trends of cryptic species that are difficult to monitor. Despite evidence suggesting acoustic SCR offers greater precision over estimates obtained through distance sampling or mark-recapture approaches, it has seldom been applied to avian taxa. Here we assess the utility of acoustic SCR for estimating population density of owls, a group of birds for which population estimates are generally lacking. We conducted passive acoustic surveys for Barred Owls (Strix varia) and Great Horned Owls (Bubo virginianus) over the spring breeding seasons of 2020–2021 in a protected park in Georgia, USA. We used a combination of acoustic discrimination techniques to identify individuals, including spectrogram cross-correlation, hierarchical clustering, and visual scanning. The resulting estimates of the density of Great Horned Owl individuals (0.28 6 0.026 [SE] per km2) were consistent with population density estimates from previous studies in other parts of the species’ range. However, our methods appeared unsuitable for distinguishing Barred Owl individuals, which prevented estimation of population density for this species. We provide recommendations to improve acoustic sampling and individual discrimination of owls and suggest that acoustic SCR offers important advantages over conventional methods for monitoring some cryptic birds. © 2024 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Understanding a species' distribution is vital for making sound conservation and management decisions. Secretive behaviors and complicated seasonal movement patterns have made range delimitation surprisingly elusive for some North American birds, including the Northern Saw-whet Owl (Aegolius acadicus). Despite being among the most common of North American forest owls, only the species' breeding range is well demarcated. This has resulted in the species historically being considered a "northern" bird, with eastern migratory and nonbreeding ranges extending only as far south as central Missouri and eastern Tennessee. Recent banding efforts have shown that saw-whet owls are fall migrants much farther south. We extend this work by investigating stopover duration and nonbreeding habitat selection during 2 winters at the edge of the species' southern distribution in the Ozark Highlands of northwest Arkansas. We used radio telemetry to track 27 owls, with 17 individuals detected at least once post-release (n = 54 surveys and 131 total detections). Length of stay in the study area was most influenced by year - birds remained an average of 3.6 weeks longer during an irruption year - and our data suggest that the species uses the Ozark Highlands for both nonbreeding residency and brief stopover periods. During the 2 year study, 37% of marked owls were winter residents, 26% remained in the area temporarily, and 37% were not redetected. Winter habitat preferences of saw-whet owls in the southeast are consistent with what is known about the species in its more northernly range, with birds selecting conifers on south-facing slopes in areas with an open understory. Overall, our results suggest that saw-whet owls are not rare fall migrants and winter residents in Arkansas as was previously assumed, and more generally, are likely underappreciated winter predators in southern pine ecosystems. © 2024 Wilson Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Owls are popular pets in Japan, with the country being the largest importer of live owls in the world. Although several studies have looked at the welfare implications of the country's “owl cafés,” the scale and scope of the Japanese owl trade, and its potential consequences for conservation, remain largely unexplored. Here we present an overview of the volumes and species of owl found in a selection of Japanese pet stores and cafés, based on two physical surveys, an online survey, and an analysis of CITES import data. We found a high number of owls (n = 1914) from a large variety of species (n = 49) across a total of 92 establishments. CITES import records show that species variety has highly increased over time. Although the majority of owls in Japanese pet stores and cafés are likely to be of captive-bred origin, trade histories are often difficult to trace, and the legality of parent stock is impossible to determine. Further complicating monitoring efforts are gaps in international trade data, the mislabeling of species, selective breeding, and the use of outdated taxonomy. Considering the large scale of the Japanese market, efforts to facilitate the improved monitoring of the owl trade are highly warranted to ensure its legality and sustainability. © 2024 National Science Museum of Korea (NSMK) and Korea National Arboretum (KNA)

ABSTRACT: The eagle owl (Bubo bubo) population in Norway is today classified as critically endangered on the red list of endangered species. Because previous studies have detected high concentrations of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) in birds of prey, concerns have been raised whether POPs exposure are a significant factor to the substantial decline of the eagle owl population. The aims of this study were to measure the levels of POPs in eagle owls and to assess whether POPs may represent a potential health risk. POPs were analysed in liver samples from 100 eagle owls collected between 1994 and 2014. The concentrations of POPs were generally very high and individual birds had levels among the highest measured worldwide. The contaminant groups analysed were highly correlated (p < 0.0001). The concentrations of sum of Polychlorinated Biphenyls (∑PCB) exceeded the threshold value from moderate to severe health risk in 90% of the birds. The birds with cachectic or lean body condition had significantly higher levels of contaminants than those with higher body condition scores. No significant temporal or spatial trends were noted. The lack of temporal trends, suggest that the downward trend of POPs, appear to be levelling off. The lack of differences between inland and coastal regions suggest that the risk of exposure may be comparable between predatory birds feeding in marine or terrestrial food webs. The significantly higher POPs levels detected in individuals with poor body condition may be due to reduced fat stores and thereby higher concentration in the remaining fat and/or the weight loss could be induced by toxic effects. The high proportion of birds exceeding the threshold values for severe and high risk of adverse effects, suggest that the high contamination load may reduce the eagle owl's fitness and survival and, thus, contribute to decline of the eagle owl population. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides (SGARs) are commonly used for rodent control, affecting various non-target wildlife species. Here, blood samples from common kestrels (Falco tinnunculus, n = 70 chicks) and barn owls (Tyto alba, n = 54 chicks and 12 adults) from Southeastern Spain were analysed using HPLC-TQ. SGAR prevalence was 68.6% in kestrel chicks, 50% in barn owl chicks and 100% in adult barn owls, with multiple SGARs in both species. Prothrombin time analysis in barn owls revealed a positive correlation with blood ΣSGARs, suggesting a potential adverse effect on coagulation. Analysis of variables potentially influencing SGAR prevalence indicated that, for kestrels, it was only related to the extent of artificial surface, showing no differences across study sites. In owlets, the highest prevalence occurred in the most urbanized study site, with human population density being a key factor. This study highlights species-specific differences in SGAR exposure, likely influenced by ecological traits. Barn owls probably encounter contaminated prey near anthropized areas, with widespread SGAR use and higher presence of target rodents. Conversely, kestrels, hunting a variety of prey often near human settlements, face consistently elevated exposure from multiple sources. Understanding these variations is crucial for effective conservation and minimizing SGAR impact on non-target wildlife. © 2024 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Owl monkeys are small nocturnal new world primates in the genus Aotus that are most used in biomedical research for malaria. Cardiomyopathy and nephropathy are well-described common diseases contributing to their morbidity and mortality; less is known about lesions affecting the gastrointestinal tract. Records from a 14-year period (2008-2022) at the Keeling Center for Comparative Medicine and Research were queried to identify instances of spontaneous gastrointestinal disease that directly contributed to the cause of death from the 235 adult owl monkeys submitted for necropsy. Of the 235, 10.6% (25/235) had gastrointestinal disease listed as a significant factor that contributed to morbidity and mortality. Diagnoses included candidiasis (3/25), gastric bloat (4/25), and intestinal incarceration and ischemia secondary (11/25), which included intussusception (4/25), mesenteric rent (3/25), strangulating lipoma (2/25), intestinal torsion (1/25), and an inguinal hernia (1/25). Intestinal adenocarcinomas affecting the jejunum (4/25) were the most common neoplasia diagnosis. Oral squamous cell carcinoma (1/25) and intestinal lymphoma (2/25) were also diagnosed. This report provides evidence of spontaneous lesions in the species that contribute to morbidity and mortality. © The Author(s) 2023.

ABSTRACT: Urbanization has profound effects on wildlife. Although some species benefit or even thrive in urban environments, most species respond differently to the varying degrees of disturbance that can be found across an urbanized landscape. Quantifying the effects of urbanization in wildlife distributions, however, is complicated: species vary in their patterns of presence/absence, abundance, and detectability across spatial and temporal scales, e.g., daily, seasonal, or throughout the annual cycle. Here, we use occupancy models to offer a realistic approach to the study of populations of urban owls. Most studies on owl population dynamics have not considered temporal variation in occupancy between seasons or assess the uneven effects of urbanization along a habitat gradient. We investigated the seasonal habitat associations of mottled owls along an urban gradient in the Neotropical city of Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico. Using high-resolution satellite images and object-based image classification techniques, were analyzed the relationship between different vegetation and environmental characteristics with the occupancy of mottled owls. We employed different sampling techniques, including playback surveys and silent listening periods, to detect the presence or absence of owls along a gradient from highest to lowest urbanization. Environmental data and different vegetation types were used to analyze the habitat associations of mottled owls during January (late non-breeding season) and May (late breeding season) of 2023. In total, we detected 68 mottled owls during the non-breeding season and 102 during the breeding season, with higher detection rates in areas with >28 % forest surface. Our results revealed that the best occupancy model included forest and forest division (occupancy), ambient noise and moonlight (detection) for the non-breeding season, as well as urban, forest, grass, and forest division (occupancy), and noise (detection) for the breeding season. The percentage of forested and grass areas positively influenced mottled owl occupancy while the percentage of urbanization and forest division influenced it negatively. Moonlight was positively related to mottled owl detection, while ambient noise had a negative effect on detection probabilities of mottled owls during both seasons. Forested areas emerged as pivotal for owl occupancy, indicating their sensitivity to forest changes along the urban gradient. With urban areas increasing, the interplay between forest division, ambient noise, and moonlight unveils critical insights into mottled owl behavior and habitat dynamics, underscoring the necessity for informed conservation strategies amidst urban expansion. Future research should survey different years to provide a more robust assessment of the dynamic occupancy of mottled owls in Neotropical urban gradients. © 2024

ABSTRACT: Raptors are recognized as valuable sentinel species for monitoring environmental contaminants owing to their foraging behavior across terrestrial and aquatic food webs and their high trophic position. The present study monitored environmental contaminants in livers from road-killed owls to evaluate differences in the exposure patterns due to factors such as species, age, and sex of individuals. Carcasses of road-killed individuals of eagle owl (Bubo bubo), long-eared owl (Asio otus), little owl (Athene noctua), tawny owl (Strix aluco), and barn owl (Tyto alba) were collected in Alentejo (Portugal). Eighty-one organic contaminants were analyzed, including organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pharmaceuticals, in-use pesticides, and organophosphate esters (OPEs). Overall, 21 contaminants were detected. In all species ∑OCPs were prevalent at concentrations from 3.24 to 4480 ng/g wet weight, followed by perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), the only PFASs detected (from 2.88 to 848 ng/g wet wt) and ∑PCBs (1.98–2010 ng/g wet wt); ∑PAHs were ubiquitous but detected at the lowest concentrations (7.35–123 ng/g wet wt). Differences among species were observed according to principal component analysis. Eagle owl and long-eared owl presented the highest levels of ∑OCPs, ∑PCBs, and PFOS, consistent with its higher trophic position, while ∑PAHs prevailed in tawny owl, barn owl, and little owl, related to their frequent use of urban areas for nesting and roadsides for hunting. Adults presented higher concentrations of ∑OCPs and ∑PCBs than juveniles, while no differences were observed for PFOS and ∑PAHs. Pharmaceuticals, in-use pesticides, and OPEs were not detected. Overall, the present study shows specific contamination patterns in five species with similar diet but with differences in habitat preferences.

ABSTRACT: Elusive fauna are often studied indirectly, via traces they leave behind, or via other non-invasive survey methods. Critically endangered Tasmanian masked owls are both rare and elusive, which hampers conservation efforts. Spotlighting and call playback often have low success rates in accurately determining the presence/absence of Tasmanian masked owls. Using indirect survey techniques for traces such as owl pellets can be more efficient and provide a more reliable source of detailed data regarding presence/absence, diet, health, population structure and environmental contaminants. However, pellets can be difficult for researchers to find in the field. We evaluate whether detection dogs are effective in finding owl pellets in two steps: an experimental trial comparing the performance of a dog team to that of an ecologist with significant field experience with masked owls; and in a pilot field study where the dog team searched potential owl habitat in Tasmanian forests. During the experimental trials, the dog team significantly outperformed the ecologist. The dog team was more sensitive, finding 89% versus 40% of pellets present for the ecologist, and took half as long to search an equivalent-sized search area. The combined efficiency of the dog team was 4.5 times greater than that of an ecologist working alone. During the pilot study, in searching areas of potential masked owl habitat, no pellets were found. However, when sites were visited where owls were known to have been recently sighted, the dog team were able to find large numbers of owl pellets suitable for collection and potential data extraction. Our trials suggest that dogs can find owl pellets with considerably greater sensitivity and efficiency than ecologists working alone and that they would be best used in combination with targeted surveys, especially when the detection and subsequent collection of as many pellets as possible is desirable for DNA extraction or other analysis. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Urban life is associated with dietary shifts in opportunistic predators, such as raptors. This is presumably true in food-poor environments, such as drylands. We investigated this issue in little owls (Athene noctua) inhabiting an arid southern Tunisian area. Using pellet data, we found that coleopterans accounted for 69% of ingested food items. Controlling for prey availability, this coleopteran-based diet was more notable in the urban environment compared to rural areas. We suggest that habitat conditions in the urban areas have increased the catchability of nocturnal coleopterans which were then more exposed to predation by little owls than in rural areas. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Barn owls are the most widely distributed group of owls in the world and are among the most common accumulators of small vertebrate remains at archeological and paleontological sites. Despite its importance as a bone remains accumulator and predictor of paleoenvironmental conditions due to its generalist habits, the vertebrate prey of this raptor has been scarcely studied from an ecological community perspective, especially considering the diverse range of prey it captures. Archeological, paleontological, and taphonomic studies typically reveal taxon-specific patterns, focusing primarily on small rodents. In order to overcome this problem, we studied an assemblage of vertebrate bones from barn owl pellets in the central Monte Desert of Argentina. Our analysis included the full range of prey taxa, including rodents, marsupials, birds, and reptiles, addressed from both an ecological and neo-taphonomic perspective. We compare the taxonomic and taphonomic findings with those from regional small vertebrate records obtained from various sampling types over the past 50 years to explore recent environmental changes within the Anthropocene. The assemblage of small vertebrate prey presented here comprises five species of cricetids, one species from the Caviidae family, and at least one ctenomyid rodent species. Additionally, the assemblage includes one species of didelphid marsupial, one reptile species, and at least six passeriform bird species that belong to separate families. The overall taphonomic trends are consistent with the typical barn owl pattern. However, our analysis identified a larger percentage of postcranial elements exhibiting signs of digestion compared to pellet-derived vertebrate bone assemblages previously documented. Furthermore, it is important to note that a significant proportion of avian bone fragments exhibit distinct signs of digestion. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: We compared Snowy Owl feeding ecology from 15 breeding season studies throughout Nearctic and Palearctic circumpolar regions. We used raw data and information theory to assess the owls’ feeding niche. Combined studies yielded 59,923 prey items, of which 59,585 were used for calculations. Overall, mean food niche breadth (FNB) was narrow: H′ = 1.95; R = 1.60, D = 0.526. In 10 of 15 studies, lemmings were > 71.8% of the owls’ diet. In four studies, Lemmus was > 90% of the diet, and in three studies Dicrostonyx was >90% of the diet. In three other studies, Lemmus represented 71.8%, 73.8%, and 84.0% of the diet. In one study, Lemmus and Dicrostonyx were about equal: 49.1% and 47.5%. In the four remaining studies, Microtus and Clethrionomys voles were important. In contrast, of 5888 winter prey items from seven North American studies, the mean FNB (H′ = 4.61) was twice that of 15 breeding season scores, FNB (H’ = 1.95). The Snowy Owl is primarily an obligate lemming predator for breeding. Changes to population ecology and distribution of lemmings due to climate change will have direct affects and effects on the Snowy Owls’ reproductive output. The conservation of Snowy Owls is the conservation of lemmings. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Anthropogenic activities have negatively affected many birds, including owls. The Wildlife Hospital of Louisiana (WHL) has seen a 3.2-fold increase in barred owl (Strix varia) cases over the past eight years (2023, 134; 2015, 42). Because most of these animals present with traumatic injuries, analgesics should be considered in their treatment plan. To date, no study has measured the pharmacokinetics of an analgesic in barred owls. The goals of this study were to determine the harmonic means, times to maximum concentration, and elimination half-lives for single 1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg intramuscular doses of meloxicam. Twelve barred owls (1 mg/kg, n = 6; 2 mg/kg, n = 6) admitted to the WHL and determined to be clinically normal based on examination and blood work were recruited for this study. Meloxicam was administered intramuscularly, and blood samples were collected intermittently over 12 h to measure plasma concentrations using high-performance liquid chromatography. Both doses had rapid elimination half-lives (1 mg/kg, 0.99 ± 0.1 h; 2 mg/kg, 1.07 ± 0.43 h) and were below the limits of quantification (0.1 µg/mL) by 6–12 h. Based on these results, 1 and 2 mg/kg doses of meloxicam were found to produce plasma concentrations below therapeutic concentrations for less than four hours, making current twice-daily recommended dosing intervals unlikely to provide desired analgesia. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: We collected 280 pellets cast by Tyto alba (Barn Owl) from 1996, 1997, and 1998 from a silo roost in Harrogate, TN. Blarina brevicauda (Northern Short-tailed Shrew, 42.2%), Synaptomys cooperi (Southern Bog Lemming, 13.6%), Cryptotis parva (Least Shrew, 10.9%), Sigmodon hispidus (Hispid Cotton Rat, 7.9%), Microtus spp. (4.9%), and Aves spp. (4.3%) comprised most of the prey items. Compared to a previous study, percentages of Northern Short-tailed Shrews were proportionately greater than those of Southern Bog Lemmings in the 1996-1998 pellets. Precipitation and fluctuations in prey populations might be responsible for the disparities in diet composition between pellet collections, but more research is necessary to investigate a possible relationship. © 2024 Humboldt Field Research Institute.

ABSTRACT: Birds of prey and owls are susceptible to diseases of and traumatic injuries to their feet, which regularly require surgical intervention. A precise knowledge of the blood vessel topography is essential for a targeted therapy. Therefore, the metatarsal and digital vasculature was examined in eight species of birds of prey and owls. The study included contrast micro-computed tomography scans and anatomical dissections after intravascular injection of colored latex. In all examined species, the dorsal metatarsal arteries provided the main supply to the foot and their branching pattern and number differed between species. They continued distally as digital arteries. All examined species showed a basic pattern of four collaterally located digital blood vessels per toe: a prominent artery and small vein on one side and a small artery and prominent vein on the other side. Digital veins united to form common digital veins, most of which joined into a superficial, medially located metatarsal vein. This vein provided the main drainage of the foot. The detailed visualization of the topography of pedal blood vessels will help veterinary surgeons during surgical procedures. In addition, differences in the plantar arterial arch between hawks and falcons were discussed regarding their possible influence on the prevalence of pododermatitis (bumblefoot). © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The Little Owl (Athene noctua) is a widespread nocturnal raptor whose diet has extensively been studied. In the Mediterranean, a tendency towards increased ingestion of insects has been highlighted, but this tendency still needs more empirical validation. Here, we provide data on the autumn diet of Little Owls in an arid area in southern Tunisia. We analyzed 621 pellets from 30 different territories and identified 4,267 prey items, with insects being by far the most ingested prey. However, based on biomass, the diet was more evenly distributed across the identified prey categories. Vertebrates accounted for 63% of the biomass ingested, while the remaining part of prey composition was almost equally shared between insects and arachnids. The importance of arachnids looks like a characteristic dietary trait of Little Owls in south Mediterranean deserts, where arachnids represent a main component of the community of potential prey. In summary, our findings highlight the great food opportunism of the Little Owl due to its capability of adapting its diet to the availability of potential prey.  © 2024 Intissar Saada et al., published by Sciendo.

ABSTRACT: Bird species that undertake irruptive migrations are good candidates for assessing density-dependent effects on stopover ecology because the number of birds using stopover sites varies considerably from year to year. Using morphometric data from a 9-year banding program and radiotelemetry (n = 25 females), we found that increases in the annual density of Northern Saw-whet Owls (NSWO; Aegolius acadicus) encountered at a fall stopover site in Nova Scotia, Canada, were not linked to female body condition or minimum stopover duration. Rather, most NSWO spent no more than 1 or 2 full days at the stopover site following radio-tagging and during their return visits to the site. Body condition indices were highest for NSWO captured near the end of the migration monitoring season, possibly reflecting birds that had recently established wintering ranges and were elevating energy stores. We used breeding abundance indices derived from Birds Canada’s Atlantic Nocturnal Owl Survey to help test the hypothesis that irruptive fall migrations in NSWO were driven by elevated breeding productivity and dispersal of immature birds (breeding success hypothesis). Indeed, irruptive fall migrations were characterized by elevated densities of immatures, but not adults, and mean breeding abundance indices for the Maritime provinces during years with irruptive migrations were higher than those for non-irruptive years. We hypothesize that prey abundance during years with irruptive migrations was sufficient to enable high breeding densities and minimize effects of elevated fall densities of NSWO on rates of mass gain and stopover duration.

ABSTRACT: Avian preen gland helps birds cope with their environment, although its overall functioning remains unclear. We shed light on the complexity of the preen gland's functioning by studying how multiple factors associate with gland morphology (size and shape) and physiology (wax secreted) in barn owls Tyto alba. Individual factors (sex, breeding stage, body condition) were more important predictors of preen gland than environmental factors (temperature, humidity, brood size). Sex, depending on breeding stage in adults, influenced preen gland traits, pointing to the preen gland's regulation by sex hormones and a greater pressure on females to protect their eggs, offspring and themselves throughout reproduction. Adults and fledglings in better condition had larger glands, pointing to the existence of physiological costs. Temperature and humidity, in interaction with plumage coloration, also influenced but to a lesser extent preen gland traits, suggesting that melanin pigmentation and preen gland act as superseding mechanisms when protecting plumage against microorganisms. Finally, fledglings living in larger broods had larger glands, suggesting a role for the social environment in preen gland's functioning. Overall, our study supports the idea that preen gland functions in diverse biological contexts within the same species and is thus subject to multiple selective pressures. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia Strigiformes) is widely distributed in American continent and mainly feeds on arthropods and small mammals, with anurans as an important prey seasonally. In Argentinean Patagonia, anurans presence was documented in one study that assessed the diet in Somuncurá plateau (Río Negro province, Argentina). Here we assessed the consumption of anurans by burrowing owls in the lower Chubut river valley (Chubut province, Argentina) and its relation with seasons. Two species of anurans are present: Rhinella arenarum (Bufonidae) and Pleurodema bufoninum (Leptodactylidae). Owl pellets were collected seasonally between 2018 and 2022 and dry-disintegrated in the laboratory. Minimum number of anuran individuals was calculated on the basis of ilea and the effect of years and seasons was evaluated with GLM. We analyzed 365 complete owl pellets and 64 prey remains. We used complete pellets for calculating %OC and statistical analyzes due the content of broken pellets is mixed and we are not able to identify to which pellet it belongs. Anurans represented 44%F of consumed vertebrates and GLM analyses showed higher effect in spring and lower in summer. We identified the 24.2%F as R. arenarum and the 75.8%F undetermined species. We can infer that owls feed during day and night, given the activity pattern for anurans. Our results are similar for those found in spring in Argentina, but differ for other seasons, probably in relation to how anurans use the irrigation channels (spring-summer) and also activate when precipitation is more frequent (winter and spring). Considering that all prey remains and cranial bones belong to R. arenarum, and lacking direct evidence of P. bufoninum, we could suppose that unidentified ilea belong to the former. Nevertheless, this assumption cannot be confirmed until the presence or absent of P. bufoninum was recorded through sampling. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Sociedade Brasileira de Ornitologia 2024.

ABSTRACT: The barn owl is a common research subject in auditory science due to its exceptional capacity for high frequency hearing and superb sound source localization capabilities. Despite longstanding interest in the auditory performance of barn owls, the function of its middle ear has attracted remarkably little attention. Here, we report the middle ear transfer function measured by laser Doppler vibrometry and direct measurements of inner ear pressures. Our results illustrate that the barn owl middle ear produces a pressure gain between the ear canal and the inner ear vestibule of up to 35 dB, which is comparable to that seen in mammals. The footplate velocity transfer function magnitudes overlap with those measured in other bird species, however the differences in phase between the footplate velocity and the sound pressure stimulus indicate a middle ear group delay that is notably shorter than other birds. This work brings us closer to a more complete understanding of the physiology of hearing in a model organism in auditory science. © 2025 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Objective: To describe an ultrasound-guided approach to the sciatic nerve and the distribution of nerve staining using two injectate volumes of dye in barred owls. Study design: Descriptive, randomized, assessor-blinded, cadaveric study. Animals: Twelve barred owl cadavers. Methods: The sciatic nerve was visualized with a 13-6 MHz linear ultrasound probe placed on the medial aspect of the proximal femur in barred owl cadavers. A needle was inserted at the proximal caudal thigh, and cranially advanced in-plane until the tip was immediately adjacent and ventral to the sciatic nerve. Eleven owls were injected bilaterally with a 1:1 solution of 1% methylene blue and 0.5% ropivacaine, with high-volume (HV; 0.4 mL kg–1) and low-volume (LV; 0.2 mL kg–1) treatments. Nerve staining ≥ 1 cm circumferentially was determined by dissection 15 minutes post-injection. The coelom was then opened to inspect for aberrant dye spread. In one barred owl cadaver, a 1:1 solution of 1% methylene blue and 74% ioversol contrast was injected, and computed tomography was performed immediately before and 15 minutes after injection for evaluation of injectate spread. Results: The HV treatment (0.4 mL kg–1) resulted in successful nerve staining in 100% of injections, whereas the LV treatment (0.2 mL kg–1) resulted in successful nerve staining in 91% of injections. There was no leakage of injectate into undesired locations (e.g. coelomic cavity) in any cadaver. Conclusions and clinical relevance: In barred owls, the sciatic nerve can be visualized with ultrasound and injecting a ropivacaine/dye solution under ultrasound guidance successfully stained the sciatic nerve in the majority of cases. This technique holds potential for providing analgesia distal to the stifle joint; however, further investigations are necessary to evaluate its practical application in a clinical setting. © 2024 Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists and American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and Analgesia

ABSTRACT: Recent advances in acoustic recording equipment enable autonomous monitoring with extended spatial and temporal scales, which may allow for the censusing of species with individually distinct vocalizations, such as owls. We assessed the potential for identifying individual Barred Owls (Strix varia) through detections of their vocalizations using passive acoustic monitoring. We placed autonomous recording units throughout the John Prince Research Forest (54°27' N, 124°10' W, 700 m ASL) and surrounding area, in northern British Columbia, Canada, from February to April 2021. The study area was 357 km2 with a minimum of 2 km between the 66 recording stations. During this period, we collected 454 Barred Owl calls, specifically the two-phrase hoot, from 10 recording stations, which were of sufficient quality for spectrographic analysis. From each call, we measured 30 features: 12 temporal and 18 frequency features. Using forward stepwise discriminant function analysis, the model correctly categorized 83.2% of the calls to their true recording location based on a 5-fold cross validation. The model showed substantial agreement between the recording station that the call was classified to originate from, and where the call was actually recorded. The most important features of the calls that enabled discrimination were call length, interval between the 4th and the 5th note, interval between the 6th and 7th note, and duration of the 8th note. Our results suggest that passive acoustic monitoring can be used not only to detect presence/absence of species but also, where vocalizations have individually distinct features, for population censusing. © 2024 by the author(s).

ABSTRACT: Apex predators are vulnerable to environmental changes which can cascade through trophic levels of an ecosystem. Investigating prey-predator relationships is important for directing conservation efforts and understanding how species may respond to ecosystem changes. This case study examined the diet and breeding success of the threatened powerful owl Ninox strenua in central Victoria where the box-ironbark forests have undergone widespread clearing, fragmentation, and degradation. The powerful owl preys predominantly on arboreal mammals, however, some birds are also consumed. By analysing the contents of regurgitated owl pellets of two owl pairs, we found that birds comprised 29.3% of all prey items and contributed the largest proportion of prey biomass for one pair (34.4%). All mammalian prey species identified in the pellet remains are dependent on tree hollows, which are now a scarce and competitive resource in box-ironbark forests. Despite consuming a diet lower in mammalian prey than found in other studies, breeding success over five consecutive years was 1.4 chicks fledged per pair per year, which is notably higher than historical observations in the region and similar to powerful owls in other parts of their distribution. Our observations suggest that flexibility in prey selection enables powerful owls to occupy ranges that have undergone significant ecosystem change. © 2024 Ecological Society of Australia.

ABSTRACT: In recent years, air sac parasitic helminths have been reported to cause severe disease in birds. In addition, various species appear to be expanding and infecting new avian hosts in various regions worldwide. In this context, an air sac nematode was initially detected in 2014 infecting the Eurasian scops owl, hospitalized in the local wildlife hospital in Mallorca (Balearic Islands, Spain). Years later, the parasite was detected in 2 other owl species. Air sac nematodes had never been reported in the Mallorcan Strigiformes before. A comprehensive molecular and morphological characterization analysis, including scanning electron microscopy, was required for species confirmation. The species was identified as Lissonema sicki, a parasite infrequently reported in South American owls. Since its first introduction to Mallorca, it has dramatically increased in prevalence in hospitalized birds, being highly prevalent in the Eurasian scops owl (41%), in the long-eared owl (11%) and in the barn owl (4%). The introduction pathway of this parasite to Europe remains unknown. This discovery underscores the expanding range and impact of L. sicki, emphasizing the importance of ongoing surveillance and research to comprehend and manage the implications of its emergence in new territories. © The Author(s), 2024.

ABSTRACT: The article considers the recordings of the vocalization of Tengmalm's owl in the Middle Volga were obtained using dictaphones. The first calls of Tengmalm's owl were recorded 1 h 30 min after sunset. The last calls were recorded 3 h 45 min before sunrise. The longest vocalization interval was observed at night. The frequency range of male calls is 550-950 Hz. Continuous vocal activity in certain periods of the day lasted from 3 min to 27 min. Vocal activity were observed in the temperature range from -5 to +6°C. Calls were recorded at wind strength from 1 to 3 m/s, at cloud cover from 10 to 30%, at pressure from 750 to 764 mm Hg. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

ABSTRACT: A barn owl (Tyto alba) died with neurological signs compatible with a viral infection. After discarding other possible infections caused by circulating viruses in the area, analysis of the central nervous system using a pan-viral microarray revealed hybridization to canary bornavirus 2 (CnBV-2). Subsequent sequence analysis confirmed the presence of a virus sharing more than 83% identity with CnBV-2. Surprisingly, the new sequence corresponds to a new virus, here named Barn owl Bornavirus 1 (BoBV-1), within the Orthobornavirus serini species. Moreover, it is the first member of this species that has been detected in a non-passerine bird, indicating that Orthobornavirus serini species comprises viruses with a wider range of hosts than previously presumed. The use of this microarray has proven to be an excellent tool for viral detection in clinical samples, with capacity to detect new viral variants. This allows the diagnosis of a great range of viruses, which can cause similar disease symptoms and which identification by PCR methods might be tedious, probably unsuccessful and, in the long run, expensive. This platform is highly useful for a fast and precise viral detection, contributing to the improvement of diagnostic methods. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: While the impact of introduced predators is a widely acknowledged issue and key component of conservation considerations for endemic waterbird populations in the Hawaiian Islands, the impact of native predators on endemic, endangered waterbirds is not as frequently discussed or factored into recovery models. The Pueo (Hawaiian Short-eared Owl; Asio flammeus sandwichensis) is a subspecies of Short-eared Owl endemic to the Hawaiian Islands and is State-listed as Endangered on the island of O'ahu. The Ae'o (Hawaiian Stilt; Himantopus mexicanus knudensi) is a subspecies of the Black-necked Stilt endemic to Hawai'i and is federally listed as Endangered throughout its range. A variety of non-native predators are confirmed to consume Ae'o eggs, chicks, and adults, including invasive mammals (e.g., feral cats), birds (e.g., Barn Owls), and amphibians (e.g., bullfrogs). While predation by native predators was suspected, there are no cases documented in the literature to date describing Pueo preying upon Ae'o. Here, we describe four events that provide evidence of Pueo predating Ae'o during the 2019–2021 breeding seasons in a wetland area on the island of O'ahu: (1) confirmed Pueo predating an Ae'o chick, (2) a suspected predation attempt of a Pueo chasing adult Ae'o, and (3) two suspected predation events based on (a) 10 adult-sized Ae'o carcasses and remains found near an active Pueo nest and (b) game camera photos of Pueo visiting two Ae'o nests. To our knowledge, these novel observations are the first published accounts of predator–prey interactions between these two subspecies. © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Herring Gull (Larus argentatus) populations in Pukaskwa National Park have declined by 70% over the last 40 years. Populations of avian predators that prey on Herring Gulls have increased which could be a significant factor impacting gull populations. Here, we investigate Herring Gull daytime and nighttime nest attentiveness at locations with and without evidence of nocturnal predators. In 2017, Herring Gull nest attentiveness was examined at two sites using remote cameras. At one of those sites Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus) predation was observed, and gull nighttime nest attentiveness was lower there than at the site where owls were not observed. There were no inter-site differences in daytime nest attentiveness. In 2018, Herring Gull nest attentiveness was further investigated at the site where owls were present. At that site, Herring Gull nighttime nest attentiveness was significantly lower than during the day. Extended periods of absence of gulls from their nests during the night corresponded with the presence of owls. Predation of nest contents, in addition to the effects of other environmental stressors, are likely contributing to declines in Pukaskwa National Park’s Herring Gull population.

ABSTRACT: In 2020, adult hard ticks (males and females) were collected from great horned owls [Bubo virginianus (Gmelin, 1788)] in the coastal region in southern Brazil. The engorged females were allowed to oviposit in the laboratory and hatched larvae could be obtained. Analyses of the external morphology of the adult ticks revealed that they represent a new species, which was named Amblyomma monteiroae n. sp. Partial sequences of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene and the nuclear second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) were generated from a male and a female. Their 16S rRNA haplotypes were identical to each other and closest (96% identity) to corresponding sequences of Amblyomma parvitarsum Neumann, 1901, and 90% identical to Amblyomma neumanni Ribaga, 1902. Their ITS2 haplotypes were 95.8 to 96.0 identical to the single ITS-2 partial sequence of A. parvitarsum available in GenBank. In the phylogenetic trees inferred by both 16S rRNA and ITS2 partial sequences, A. monteiroae n. sp. formed a clade with A. parvitarsum, with A. neumanni branching sister to this clade. Amblyomma monteiroae n. sp. is genetically and morphologically related to A. parvitarsum. Both tick species are unique in combining the following morphological characters: scutum extensively ornate; eyes rounded and bulging; coxa I with two moderate pointed spurs, the external longer than the internal; a single triangular short spur on coxae II-III; presence of two spines on the tibia of legs II-IV; hypostomal dentition 3/3, trochanters without spurs. However, the males of the two species can be separated by specific features in palps and festoons, whereas the females differ in specific features of the coxal spurs. The larva of A. monteiroae n. sp. can be morphologically distinguished from A. parvitarsum only by morphometry, with the former species being slightly smaller. Currently, A. monteiroae n. sp. is restricted to southern Brazil, and the only known host is B. virginianus (Strigiformes: Strigidae). The present study increases the Amblyomma Brazilian fauna to 34 species. © 2023

ABSTRACT: Protected areas are essential conservation tools for mitigating the rapid decline of biodiversity. However, climate change represents one of the main challenges to their long-term effectiveness, as it induces rapid changes in the geographical distribution of many species. We used ecological niche modelling to predict the impacts of climate change on the distribution of five endemic owls in the Atlantic Forest and evaluated the effectiveness of the protected areas network for their conservation. The results indicate that the protected areas network is currently effective in terms of representativeness for most species; however, there will be a decline for all species in the coming decades because of climate change. We found that the ecoregions in the northern part of the Atlantic Forest will experience a higher loss of species, whereas those ecoregions in the southern part will be important stable climatic refuges in the future. Therefore, we emphasize the need to complement the network of protected areas to increase their representativeness in the distribution of species that will be affected by climate change, reducing species loss and increasing connectivity between suitable areas. We hope the results presented herein will serve as a basis for decision-makers to re-evaluate and improve current conservation policies and decisions in order to address the challenges posed by climate change and secure the survival of these species. © 2023 British Ornithologists' Union.

ABSTRACT: Owls are efficient hunters that depend on an immense variety of food sources. While many favor birds, small mammals, or invertebrates, only a few species have been documented to include fish in their diet. In Brazil, only two owl species, Athene cunicularia, and Megascops santaecatarinae, are documented fish consumers. Here, we present the first documented record of Megascops atricapilla preying on fish, recorded in southern Brazil. The scarcity of such records in some species among owls is likely attributed to limited knowledge rather than rarity. This finding sheds light on the varied dietary practices of owls and emphasizes the need for further research into their feeding habits. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Sociedade Brasileira de Ornitologia.

ABSTRACT: Although the associations between climate, food conditions and reproduction in the wild has been the focus of numerous studies in recent years, we still know little about population level responses to climate and fluctuating food conditions in long-lived species and during longer periods of time. Here, we assessed the relative importance of the abundance of the main prey in winter (small mammals), and winter climate on population size and productivity in a Tawny Owl (Strix aluco) population in southern Finland during a 40-year period. We studied how population trends changed over time and in relation to winter weather and small mammal abundance on three levels: total estimated population size, proportion of breeders and population productivity. We identified declining trends in each population parameter over time, as well as directional changes in climate variables and prey abundance. Overall, small mammal abundance was the foremost predictor in explaining the variation in the number of active territorial pairs (population size). Moreover, both prey abundance and winter temperature significantly affected the proportion of territorial pairs that attempted to breed and thereby total offspring production, which reveals the relevance of winter weather conditions for population productivity. These results provide additional support to the view that changes in climate can modify predator–prey interactions leading to functional changes in the food web. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Published studies on the diet of the Eurasian eagle owl (Bubo bubo) in Türkiye are limited to the eastern and central parts of the country. This study presents the diet composition of a single pair of eagle owl in the breeding season in Northwestern Türkiye. In total, 91 pellets of B. bubo were collected in Bolu Province. They contained 949 prey items of 18 prey species belonging to the orders Rodentia, Eulipotyphla, and Carnivora, class Mammalia and eight species belonging to the order Passeriformes, class Aves. The owl's diet was mostly composed of rodents (94.62%). Microtus hartingi, Microtus subterraneus, and Sciurus anomalus were detected in the diet of Bubo bubo in Türkiye for the first time. In addition, a specimen of Mustela nivalis was recorded in Bubo bubo pellets for the first time in Northwestern Türkiye. Niche breadth, Shannon-Wiener, and Simpson indices were calculated and found to be 6.69, 2.23, and 0.85 respectively. The estimated species richness (Chao1) of eagle owl prey was 30.9. The average prey number per pellet was 10.42 ± 5.76. The predominant species in the diet of Bubo bubo were Microtus mystacinus, Cricetulus migratorius, and Microtus subterraneus. Detailed comparison with other eagle owl prey data collected across Türkiye is also presented. © 2023 Polish Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Background: Owls have been reported as definitive hosts, whereas wild small mammals (naturally and experimentally) as intermediate hosts of several species of Sarcocystis. Recently, dead fledglings were found infected by an unnamed species of Sarcocystis since its intermediate host was unknown. After collecting additional samples of owls and wild small mammals, the present study focused on elucidating the identity, potential intermediate host, and complete life cycle of the found Sarcocystis through experimentally infected rodents. The developmental stages’ morphological and molecular characterizations (28S rRNA gene, ITS1 region) are presented herein. Methods: In total, 21 Tengmalm’s owl carcasses (15 nestlings, 5 fledglings, and 1 adult male) were collected in Kauhava (west-central Finland) and parasitologically examined by wet mounts. Intestinal mucosa scrapings were used to isolate oocysts/sporocysts and employed for experimental infections in dexamethasone-immunosuppressed BALB/cOlaHsd mice. Additionally, sarcocysts were searched in the skeletal muscle of 95 samples from seven wild small mammal species. All these developmental stages were molecularly characterized by the 28S rRNA gene and ITS1 region. Experimental infections were carried out by using immunosuppressed female 8-week-old BALB/cOlaHsd mice, divided into three groups: (1) water with 15 μg/mL of dexamethasone, (2) water with 30 μg/mL of dexamethasone, (3) no dexamethasone treatment. Each group consisted of four individuals. In each group, two mice were infected with 1,000 sporocysts each, and the remaining two with 10,000 sporocysts each. All mice were euthanized on specific days post-infection. Results: The intestinal mucosa of 11 nestlings and 5 fledglings of the Tengmalm’s owl were positive for Sarcocystis funereus sp. nov. The adult male owl and all owls’ breast and heart muscles were negative for Sarcocystis. Two dexamethasone-immunosuppressed BALB/cOlaHsd mice (group 2) were positive to S. funereus sp. nov. in diaphragm and leg muscles after 22- and 24-day post-infection. Some sarcocysts were found in the wild small mammals. Molecular identification at 28S rRNA revealed sequences from naturally infected Tengmalm’s owls, as well as sarcocysts of dexamethasone-immunosuppressed BALB/cOlaHsd mice were 99.87–100% similar to Sarcocystis sp. isolate Af1 previously found in the Tengmalm’s owl. At the ITS1 region, the S. funereus sp. nov. isolates Af2 haplotype B and Af3 haplotype A were 98.77–100% identical to Sarcocystis sp. isolate Af1. The sequences from sarcocysts of naturally infected wild small mammals were 75.23–90.30% similar at ITS1 region to those of S. funereus sp. nov. Conclusion: The morphological and molecular characterizations and phylogenetic placement of S. funereus sp. nov. are presented here for the first time and support the erection of the new species.

ABSTRACT: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are contaminants of global concern due to their ubiquitous occurrence in the environment, bioaccumulation and the adverse effects on organisms. Tawny Owls (Strix aluco) are documented to be exposed to increasing concentrations of perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs), and have been suggested in literature as a key raptor monitoring species. Therefore, non-destructive biomonitoring efforts are of high interest. Thus far, the use of feathers for biomonitoring PFASs in Tawny Owls has not been investigated. In this study, 32 PFASs were analyzed in 49 Tawny Owl body feather samples collected from 2017 to 2020 in Trøndelag, Norway. There were 30 PFASs detected in at least one feather, with the sum concentrations ranging from 31 to 203 ng/g (w.w.). Perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA) (median: 33 ng/g) and perfluorooctane sulfonamidoacetic acid (FOSAA) (median: 18 ng/g) were the two compounds with the highest concentrations. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), which is banned for production and use in Norway since 2007, was found in all samples (median: 4.14 ng/g), indicating its high persistence. 8 PFASs were detected in at least 50 % of the samples: FOSAA (11–127 ng/g), PFHpA (<0.04–115 ng/g), perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS) (<0.28–21 ng/g), PFOS (0.23–13 ng/g), perfluorotridecanoic acid (PFTrDA) (0.24–5.15 ng/g), perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoDA) (<0.28–4.45 ng/g), perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA) (<0.28–2.33 ng/g), and 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (6:2 FTSA) (0.07–1.01 ng/g). No significant differences were found for the concentrations of PFASs between calendar years and locations, but a slight increase could be observed in the sum concentration of PFASs (Ʃ32PFASs) over the sampling years. As Tawny Owls are residential owls that usually do not cover great distances, their feathers can be used as a potential alternative matrix for future biomonitoring studies. To our knowledge, this is the first study on the occurrence of 32 PFASs investigated in feathers of a Tawny Owl population. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Recovering biodiversity across trophic levels is a major challenge in restoration ecology. Specifically, predator population recovery depends on the timely re-establishment of their preferred prey species in restored habitats. Here, we evaluate potential dietary factors contributing to the loss of western burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia hypugaea (Bonaparte, 1825)) from a newly-restored coastal grassland. We examined owl pellets and found that burrowing owl diets were relatively low in vertebrate prey during their brief occupation of the restoration site (2.6% of prey items; found in 61.8% of sampled pellets). We suggest that preferred food limitation may have been one contributor to the loss of owls from the restoration site. These findings suggest the need to prioritise reestablishment of prey communities for effective long-term recovery of burrowing owls in restored landscapes. © 2024 Pensoft Publishers.

ABSTRACT: We present evidence for the first documentation of consumption of a water oak (Quercus nigra) acorn by an eastern screech owl (Megascops asio). A screech owl diet typically consists of small mammals, small birds, and arthropods. In our study, we had a 1-m x 1-m sand pad under observation from a game camera that was set on a 1-min time-lapse delay. On this sand pad, we placed five water oak acorns. In a series of six images over six minutes, we observed an eastern screech owl land near the sand pad, walk to an acorn, and appear to consume the acorn. Although there could be other plausible explanations and events that transpired between 1-min image intervals, we believe this acorn was consumed by the eastern screech owl. The importance of this addition of food type to the diet of a raptor is largely unexplored and undocumented. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: This report documents the first direct evidence of inter-island dispersal of Ryukyu Scops Owl Otus elegans. Out of 134 individuals marked on Hateruma-jima Island in 2021, a female, which had been first captured as an adult bird, was discovered alive on Ishigaki-jima Island in 2022. The distance between the points of capture and resighting was 52.7 km. Since owls in the genus Otus show diversification between islands, direct evidence of movement between islands as given here, can contribute to future studies on the evolutionary process of the Otus owls. © 2023 Ornithological Society of Japan.

ABSTRACT: The JPL OWLS is an instrument suite that combines chemical analysis with microscopy in order to search for life on multiple fronts. In order to accomplish this, it needs a front-end sample processing unit that can deliver specifically prepared sample aliquots to the specific instruments' inlet ports. The microscope requires a liquid sample that is unperturbed from the in situ environment. The chemical analyzer requires a digestion step to access the organic molecules locked within macromolecules and cell walls. The extraction is particularly important to finding molecular biosignatures in samples containing extant life. Since the majority of monomers are embedded in larger biomolecules, a technique is required to lyse cells and hydrolyze biomolecules, such as larger protein molecules, into their constituent amino acids. SubCritical Water Extraction (SCWE) is a digestion process that can be applied to liquid samples using only temperature and pressure to break down proteins into constituent amino acids. While it is possible to add additional solvents, the technique requires only water to break down these large macromolecules. Here, we present the design of the OWLS extraction chamber. In addition to performing SCWE up to 200 °C, the new design has the added functionality of mixing, filter concentration of cells, and customized aliquot delivery. © 2024 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: We report the first records of the Flammulated Owl (Psiloscops flammeolus) in the state of Baja California, Mexico, on the basis of a specimen collected in desert habitat in the town of Bahía de Los Ángeles (elevation 33 m asl) on 13 October 2002, and an audio recording of a vocalization made in the Sierra San Pedro Mártir National Park on 30 September 2020 (elevation 2440 m asl). It is probable that the specimen from Bahía de Los Ángeles represents an accidental record of P. f. idahoensis during migration, while the record of the Sierra Pedro Mártir is an extension of the Southern California (USA) breeding population. © 2023 Brigham Young University.

ABSTRACT: Incorporation of the invasive alien species into the food web by native predators is important both for managing the invasion and for predicting potential predator problems from measures taken against the invasive population. The present study of the Eurasian Eagle Owl (Bubo bubo) diet in the area designated as the initial centre for the introduction of the invasive Coypu (Myocastor coypus) in Bulgaria provided new data on the spread and reproduction of the invader. The small overlap in the distribution of the predator and the invader accounted for the small number of owl pairs with Coypu-containing diets. The long-term study confirmed the hunting of young Coypu by Eurasian Eagle Owls only in years with a very wide food niche of the predator in the respective territory. The occurrence of Coypu in the food of the owl did not depend on the frequency of other wetland inhabitants in the annual diets. The Coypu was incidental prey (range 0.5 – 0.8% by prey number) most likely due to the low density of the invader in the area of cohabitation with the predator. Copyright Milchev & Spassov.

ABSTRACT: Mercury is a ubiquitous contaminant known to accumulate in wildlife, particularly bird species at higher trophic levels. Knowledge of tissue-specific Hg distributions aids our understanding of Hg bioaccumulation in organisms. In this study, one adult and three juvenile Collared Scops Owls (Otus lettia) were studied to elucidate the bioaccumulation of Hg in body tissues. Six tissues and organs (feathers, nails, heart, liver, gizzard, and muscle), as well as gastric contents, were examined for total Hg (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) contents, Hg isotopic compositions including mass-dependent fractionation (MDF; δ202Hg) and mass-independent fractionation (MIF; Δ199Hg and Δ201Hg), and C (δ13C) and N (δ15N) isotopic compositions. Tissue-specific THg and MeHg concentrations in the adult were in the ranges of 150–1360 ng/g and 17–1060 ng/g, and lower in the juveniles at 91–419 ng/g and 67–350 ng/g, respectively. The δ202Hg values in the adult were strongly negative at −1.75‰ ± 0.17‰ compared with the juveniles at −0.99‰ ± 0.25‰. The adult exhibited lower MIF values than the juveniles, at 0.23‰ ± 0.07‰ for Δ199Hg and 0.2‰ ± 0.11‰ for Δ201Hg, compared with 0.81‰ ± 0.09‰ and 0.66‰ ± 0.07‰, respectively. The lower adult MDF and MIF values suggest that the adult tended to accumulate negative Hg isotopes but the juvenile's positive Hg isotopes. Differences between adult and juvenile tissue Hg concentrations indicate that metabolic processes play an important role in Hg accumulation. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Science Press and Institute of Geochemistry, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Background: There is growing attention to individuality in movement, its causes and consequences. Similarly to other well-established personality traits (e.g., boldness or sociability), conspecifics also differ repeatedly in their spatial behaviors, forming behavioral types (“spatial-BTs”). These spatial-BTs are typically described as the difference in the mean-level among individuals, and the intra-individual variation (IIV, i.e., predictability) is only rarely considered. Furthermore, the factors determining predictability or its ecological consequences for broader space-use patterns are largely unknown, in part because predictability was mostly tested in captivity (e.g., with repeated boldness assays). Here we test if (i) individuals differ in their movement and specifically in their predictability. We then investigate (ii) the consequences of this variation for home-range size and survival estimates, and (iii) the factors that affect individual predictability. Methods: We tracked 92 barn owls (Tyto alba) with an ATLAS system and monitored their survival. From these high-resolution (every few seconds) and extensive trajectories (115.2 ± 112.1 nights; X̅ ± SD) we calculated movement and space-use indices (e.g., max-displacement and home-range size, respectively). We then used double-hierarchical and generalized linear mix-models to assess spatial-BTs, individual predictability in nightly max-displacement, and its consistency across time. Finally, we explored if predictability levels were associated with home-range size and survival, as well as the seasonal, geographical, and demographic factors affecting it (e.g., age, sex, and owls’ density). Results: Our dataset (with 74 individuals after filtering) revealed clear patterns of individualism in owls’ movement. Individuals differed consistently both in their mean movement (e.g., max-displacement) and their IIV around it (i.e., predictability). More predictable individuals had smaller home-ranges and lower survival rates, on top and beyond the expected effects of their spatial-BT (max-displacement), sex, age and ecological environments. Juveniles were less predictable than adults, but the sexes did not differ in their predictability. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that individual predictability may act as an overlooked axis of spatial-BT with potential implications for relevant ecological processes at the population level and individual fitness. Considering how individuals differ in their IIV of movement beyond the mean-effect can facilitate understanding the intraspecific diversity, predicting their responses to changing ecological conditions and their population management. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Barred Owls (Strix varia) have recently expanded westward from eastern North America, contributing to substantial declines in Northern Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis caurina). Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) represents a potentially powerful approach for tracking range expansions like the Barred Owl’s, but further methods development is needed to ensure that PAM-informed occupancy models meaningfully reflect population processes. Focusing on the leading edge of the Barred Owl range expansion in coastal California, we used a combination of PAM data, GPS-tagging, and active surveys to (1) estimate breeding home range size, (2) identify patterns of vocal activity that reflect resident occupancy, and (3) estimate resident occupancy rates. Mean breeding season home range size (452 ha) was reasonably consistent with the size of cells (400 ha) sampled with autonomous recording units (ARUs). Nevertheless, false-positive acoustic detections of Barred Owls frequently occurred within cells not containing an activity center such that site occupancy estimates derived using all detected vocalizations (0.61) were unlikely to be representative of resident occupancy. However, the proportion of survey nights with confirmed vocalizations (VN) and the number of ARUs within a sampling cell with confirmed vocalizations (VU) were indicative of Barred Owl residency. Moreover, the false positive error rate could be reduced for occupancy analyses by establishing thresholds of VN and VU to define detections, although doing so increased false negative error rates in some cases. Using different thresholds of VN and VU, we estimated resident occupancy to be 0.29–0.44, which indicates that Barred Owls have become established in the region but also that timely lethal removals could still help prevent the extirpation of Northern Spotted Owls. Our findings provide a scalable framework for monitoring Barred Owl populations throughout their expanded range and, more broadly, a basis for converting site occupancy to resident occupancy in PAM programs.

ABSTRACT: The land transformation of traditional agro-mosaics into progressively more anthropized crops can trigger changes in small mammal communities. Here, we reported data about a treatment–control comparison between small mammal communities preyed by the Barn Owl (Tyto alba) in two sites showing different levels of anthropization: simplified crop mosaic (treatment site; ANT) versus a high heterogeneous mosaic (control; CTR). Data from owl’s pellets showed as normalized richness, Shannon–Wiener diversity, evenness, and trophic level were lower in ANT when compared to CTR. Due to: (1) the strong reduction in shrews (Eulipotyphla) of higher trophic level, and to: (2) the higher frequency of the first dominant species (Microtus savii), the diversity/dominance diagrams plot lines appear steeper in ANT. Moreover, comparison of abundance and biomass patterns both in Whittaker and in k-dominance plots, showed a higher sensitivity of abundance to crop-land simplification, when compared to biomass. Although, shrews appear sensitive to the use of chemical compounds in agriculture, in our study the cropland management in ANT is based on ‘organic farm’ approach, without use of chemicals. In this regard, we propose alternative processes to explain the shrew reduction. © Akadémiai Kiadó Zrt. 2024.

ABSTRACT: Avian malaria is a re-emerging threat to avian species worldwide. It is sustained by several protozoan species belonging to the genus Plasmodium, mainly Plasmodium relictum. The even wider diffusion of the disease, probably because of the increase in the areas covered by their mosquito vectors, may pose new risks for avian species lacking natural resistance (especially those from artic or sub-artic environments) or those hosted in structures like zoos and wildlife rescue centers. With that premise, this study describes the efficacy and safety of a therapeutic protocol to treat avian malaria in three snowy owls (Bubo scandiacus) hosted in a wildlife rescue center in Apulia, south of Italy, and affected by avian malaria by P. relictum. The protocol consisted of administering 10/4 mg/kg atovaquone/proguanil per os once a day for three consecutive days, repeating this seven days later. Seven days after the end of the treatment, P. relictum was not detected in the birds’ blood and no adverse effects were observed during the 60 days of monitoring after the end of the treatment. Therefore, a therapeutic regimen of 10/4 mg/kg/day may be considered safe and effective in a valuable and endangered species such as B. scandiacus. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The American Barn Owl (Tyto furcata) lives in urban, periurban and wild environments and feeds mainly on small rodents, meaning it has great importance in the biological control of pests. The aim of this work was to describe the reproductive, parental and eating habits of a pair of American barn owls naturally living outside a residence in the urban area of the municipality of Campos dos Goytacazes, Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. A wood box was installed on an outside wall of the home, monitored by a video camera. A spreadsheet was created to keep track of the observations recorded. The female laid four eggs, and after an incubation period of 30-32 days all the eggs hatched, but only two chicks survived after cannibalism among the chicks. Initially, the male provided the food to the chicks and the female remained in the nest caring for the brood. After approximately a month, the female also began to leave the nest and return with prey, which was offered to the chicks, with the male also continuing this behavior. The chicks left the nest in September, 2017. The data obtained show the existence of cooperation and division of tasks between male and female owls during the reproductive period. © 2024, Instituto Internacional de Ecologia.

ABSTRACT: Abstract. At present, the intensification of urban landcover is one of the most critical threats for biodiversity. Common side-effects of urban sprawl are anthropogenic noise and artificial light at night (ALAN). Although their negative effects have often been described, little research has concerned nocturnal wildlife, especially avian predators. Here, we investigated the effect of urban and tree cover, traffic noise and ALAN on the presence of the Tawny Owl Strix aluco, a common night-active predator in Europe. We conducted playback surveys along an urban gradient in Turin (Italy) to detect species presence. Traffic noise was measured in the field, the cover of built-up and (semi-)natural areas was estimated using GIS and multiple measures of ALAN were acquired from a light pollution map. We modelled species presence as a function of each environmental predictor and we found a significant negative relationship with light pollution, which was the foremost urban stressor affecting Tawny Owl occurrence. Our findings suggest that Tawny Owls are more likely to be found in less artificially illuminated areas and that their distribution in urban areas is not only influenced by noise pollution and the availability of suitable habitat, but also the intensity of ALAN. Therefore, light pollution could be a key driver of the spatial distribution of Tawny Owls and potentially other nocturnal species in urban ecosystems. © 2023 Polish Academy of Sciences.

ABSTRACT: Abstract—From 2001 to 2020, for each long-eared owl nest on the territory of the Crane Homeland Nature Reserve with an area of 48 km2, the following microhabitat parameters were determined using standard field methods: the nest type built by different bird species, the presence of a nest roof, the nesting tree species, and the nest height above the ground. In most cases, for nesting the long-eared owl reused magpie nests (Pica pica) (77%) and half of the nests were found on willow trees (family Salicaceae) (50%). The nest height above the ground varied from 1.5 to 22 meters. Vegetation on the nesting area with a radius of 500 m was determined using the “Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin” automatic vegetation classifier of the QGIS software. Five habitat types were classified: forests, shrubs, meadows, arable land, and satellite image mistakes. Village areas were allocated separately. The average shares of the largest habitat types for over 20 years on the nesting sites included meadows (51.1%) and shrubs (16%). From 2001 to 2020, a habitat change in the nesting area was observed: forest and shrub areas decreased, while the meadow, village, and arable land areas increased. An analysis of the effect of habitat types on the nesting success was evaluated by means of the “gbm” and “dismo” modules in the R program using the Boosted Tree classifier algorithm. The presence of habitat types in the nesting site such as villages (24.2%), shrubs (19.3%), meadows (11.8%), and habitat heterogeneity (11.6%) most strongly affected the probability of nesting success of the owl. The reason that owls tend to use anthropogenic and agricultural territories is associated with the diversity, easy foraging, and more effective protection from predators during the breeding season. © 2023, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Androgens and estrogens are steroid hormones that regulate reproductive processes in both males and females. Monitoring plasma levels of these steroids or their metabolites present in feces, offers diagnostic support for assessing the reproductive status of animals. Immunoassays are commonly used methods for quantifying these hormones, but their protocols require species-specific validation to ensure reliability. The objective of this study was to perform analytically and biologically validation of enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kits for measuring testosterone (T), estradiol (E2), faecal androgen metabolites (fAM), and faecal estrogenic metabolites (fEM) in the tropical screech owl (Megascops choliba). Serum and fecal samples were collected from six adult females and six males both before and during breeding season, with males' gonadal activity assessed using electroejaculation (EE). The parallelism test confirmed the immunogenic similarity of the antigens in the estradiol and testosterone standards and the antigens in the serum samples and fecal extracts of M. choliba. Additionally, the EIA kits displayed nearly 100% recovery rates, and showed coefficients of variation ranging from 8% to 14% at the intra-assay level and from 10% to 16% at the inter-assay level, underscoring result reliability and consistency. In males, the highest serum T and fAM levels were recorded concurrently with the presence of spermatozoa in samples collected via EE. Although females did not exhibit oviposition events, significantly higher E2 and fEM levels were observed in August compared to May, suggesting potential seasonal variations in estrogenic hormone production. Fecal androgen and estrogen levels were significantly different between sexes in August, with males having higher fAM and females having higher fEM levels. Overall, the immunoassays validated in this study were found to be efficient in diagnosing reproductive activity in owls. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Urbanization is a major land use change across the globe with vast effects on wildlife. In this paper, we studied (1) the territorial displays of Little Owls in urban and rural landscapes, analyzing also (2) the size and habitat composition of the territories, and (3) the factors affecting territory size in both landscapes. To do that, we used t-tests, Principal Components Analysis, and General Linear mixed model procedures. The territory size was smaller in urban than in rural landscapes. Urban territories of Little Owls are characterized by a lower cover of grassland, tall crops, short crops, gardens, and orchards, as well as a higher cover of built-up areas than territories in rural landscapes. Territory size in rural landscapes was negatively correlated with seasonal progress and positively correlated with altitude. The rate of territorial displays was similar between urban and rural territories; however, birds differentially utilized various structures. In urban territories, birds mostly used buildings, whereas in rural territories, birds used electric pylons and trees. The compositional differences between territories in the two landscapes may have important consequences for other behavior types and possibly reproductive output in this species. © 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Urbanisation is a drastic process of environmental modification that often causes negative impacts on wildlife. Effects are diverse, ranging from local extinction to changes in behaviour, life-history traits and physiology. Urban settings represent a great challenge for survival since in such environments selective pressures often differ from those in which species have evolved. However, some species could perceive urban settings as ecological opportunities and may benefit there from anthropogenic food sources, low predation pressures and more stable temperatures among other factors. The Burrowing Owl Athene cunicularia is a small raptor that lives in native short grass areas but is also found in these modified habitats. We compared phenology, breeding parameters (productivity, clutch size and nest success) and breeding behaviour of Burrowing Owls nesting in urban and rural areas. We monitored 89 nests in urban areas and 45 in rural areas over the breeding season (September-January). Weekly, we recorded the breeding stage and the number of adults and chicks at each nest. We used mini HD video-cameras to monitor breeding behaviour and parental care. We found that the breeding period of urban Burrowing Owls was longer than rural owls. Clutch size and productivity were similar for both urban and rural habitats, but urban owls showed greater nesting success compared to rural owls. Rural owls devoted more time to nest vigilance in comparison to urban owls during the incubation stage, thus suggesting a difference in predator pressure between urban and rural areas. All these results indicate that urban settings offer opportunities for Burrowing Owls and that urban characteristics seem to enhance owl breeding performance. - Cavalli, M., Baladrón, A.V., Bó, M.S. & Isacch, J.P.

ABSTRACT: In this paper, we investigated the relationship between the breeding parameters and food composition of the common barn-owl (Tyto alba) comparing the outbreak and subsequent crash periods of the common vole (Microtus arvalis) as the barn owl’s main prey. For the analyses, data of 29 (2014 outbreak: 6, 2016 crash: 8; 2019 outbreak: 7, 2021 crash: 7) breeding pairs of barn owls were selected. First, we examined the differences between the breeding parameters (clutch size, number of hatchlings and fledglings), the main and alternative prey taxa (common vole and Apodemus genus), the two derived indices (trophic level index, Microtinae/Murinae ratio) between the given outbreaks and subsequent crashes as well as the cumulative data of the two demographic periods. In addition, we analysed the difference in rank-abundance distribution of prey composition comparing the outbreak and crash. We investigated the relationships between breeding parameters and demographic periods, the main and alternative prey taxa and the two derived indices using generalized linear mixed models (GLMM). The clutch size was significantly higher in both outbreaks than the crash periods, while the number of hatchlings and fledglings differed only between the second outbreak and crash period. Regarding the cumulative data of outbreaks and crashes, the values of all three breeding parameters were significantly higher in the outbreak period of the common vole. Our results highlighted the main prey role of common voles during the outbreak, as well as the importance of the Apodemus genus during the crash period. GLMM analysis supported that all three breeding parameters were positively determined by the ommon vole’s abundance in the diet of barn owls in outbreak and crash periods, while the reproductive output was positively influenced common by the frequency of the Apodemus genus as potential alternative prey in the crash period. © TÜBİTAK.

ABSTRACT: The dispersal of seeds by birds of prey is an ecological relationship still little studied. Here I report the dispersal of Brazilian pepper seeds by Glaucidium brasilianum through diploendozoochory. The role of this owl in seed dispersal was also analyzed through records of bird predation (photos available on a digital platform and bibliographic review). I found records of predation of 19 species of birds. This result suggests that the predation of frugivorous and omnivorous species may favor the dispersal of seeds of plants that produce fruits with small seeds. Therefore, this type of interaction needs to receive more attention in ecological studies on seed dispersal by birds. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Sociedade Brasileira de Ornitologia.

ABSTRACT: Large and severe wildfires, exacerbated by climate change and human behavior, are occurring more frequently in many forests across the western United States. While wildfire is a natural part of most terrestrial ecosystems, rapidly changing fire regimes have the potential to alter habitat beyond the adaptive capabilities of species. Spatial assessments of wildfire risks to species habitat may allow managers to pinpoint locations for management activities. To illustrate this, we spatially assessed wildfire risk within habitat that supports the nesting activity of the federally threatened northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) in the California redwood coast ecoregion. To accomplish this, we built a scale-optimized ensemble nesting habitat suitability model and identified habitat with the highest wildfire hazard potential. Percent canopy cover at 100-m scale, slope at 400-m scale, and January precipitation at 800-m scale were the most influential environmental covariates for predicting northern spotted owl nesting habitat. Nearly 60% of nesting habitat was predicted to be at high or very high (>1986 index value) wildfire risks. We identified three areas in the Maple Creek Area of Humboldt County, Jackson State Demonstration Forest in Mendocino County, and Point Reyes National Seashore in Marin County, California with a high concentration of nesting habitat that are at a very high risk of experiencing high severity wildfires. We recommend these areas be targeted for future research to understand the impact of wildfire on northern spotted owl as well as management attention. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Early life experiences have carry-over effects that manifest in later life stages. Challenging rearing environments result in more energy invested in immediate survival and less energy on growth and maturation, which can decrease survival in both the short- and long-term. One way to measure differences in energy allocation to growth between individuals is through physiological indices, such as concentrations of the metabolic hormone corticosterone, and body condition. Corticosterone increases in response to challenges to homeostasis and mobilizes stored fat and muscle to meet energetic demands. Maintaining elevated corticosterone can result in poor body condition and decreased survival. Juvenile or pre-breeding age classes are typically a substantial portion of the total population and serve key functions in population dynamics in many long-lived species. Thus, understanding how the rearing environment may influence demographics across life-history stages is crucial to understanding larger population dynamics. Yet, demographic models and conservation planning often lack vital rate estimates for early life stages because, prior to breeding, animals cannot be effectively sampled (i.e., they are unobservable). We used corticosterone concentrations in feathers and body mass of fledged juvenile Northern Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) as indicators of potential energetic limitations early in life and used a multi-state modeling framework to quantify the effect of these indicators on apparent annual survival prior to claiming a territory (pre-territorial birds) and the probability of recruiting into the territorial population. Apparent annual survival for pre-territorial birds was higher for birds with greater mass, earlier banding dates, and intermediate levels of corticosterone. Birds with greater mass at banding were also more likely to recruit into the territorial population. Our results demonstrate the importance of early development and traditionally excluded life-history stages on long-term demographics. Although early life stages are difficult to observe, monitoring and conservation efforts may be improved by increasing studies on pre-territorial animals, control of Barred Owls, and conservation of forest structures important for Spotted Owls. This may contribute to increased juvenile survival and recruitment. © The Author(s) 2023.

ABSTRACT: The diet and neo-taphonomy of Glaucidium nana (Aves, Strigiformes), evaluated from pellets and leftover prey recovered in nest-boxes from a National Park of southeastern Patagonia are studied. Comparative evaluations are conducted with microvertebrate samples obtained from other raptors, particularly those of G. brasilianum from the Chaco forest in Argentina. The diet of G. nana reported here agrees with the generalist trophic behaviour of this species already documented, which feeds on invertebrate (insects and arachnids) and vertebrate prey (amphibian, reptiles, birds and mammals), mainly caviomorph rodents heavier than itself. The taphonomic attributes allow us to place the two species of Glaucidium in the moderate modification category. They could deposit their diet remains in several open-air sites, mainly in wooded and rocky areas, where the cavity nests are located. Later, their bone accumulation –composed of microvertebrates with evidence of moderate bone modifications and/or with articulated skulls and limb bones without digestive corrosion- might integrate into the lithosphere. Understanding the trophic interactions between predators and prey, and their taphonomic signatures, as well as identifying their nesting areas, is crucial for archaeology/palaeontology analysis and for developing effective conservation and management strategies within protected areas. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: We studied the effects of leading-edge serrations on the flow dynamics developed over an owl wing model. Owls are predatory birds. Most owl species are nocturnal, with some active during the day. The nocturnal ones feature stealth capabilities that are partially attributed to their wing microfeatures. One of these microfeatures is small rigid combs (i.e. serrations) aligned at an angle with respect to the incoming flow located at the wings’ leading-edge region of the primaries. These serrations are essentially passive flow control devices that enhance some of the owls’ flight characteristics, such as aeroacoustics and, potentially, aerodynamics. We performed a comparative study between serrated and non-serrated owl wing models and investigated how the boundary layer over these wings changes in the presence of serrations over a range of angles of attack. Using particle image velocimetry, we measured the mean and turbulent flow characteristics and analyzed the flow patterns within the boundary layer region. Our experimental study suggests that leading-edge serrations modify the boundary layer over the wing at all angles of attack, but not in a similar manner. At low angles of attack (<20°), the serrations amplified the turbulence activity over the wing planform without causing any significant change in the mean flow. At 20° angle of attack, the serrations act to suppress existing turbulence conditions, presumably by causing an earlier separation closer to the leading-edge region, thus enabling the flow to reattach prior to shedding downstream into the wake. Following the pressure Hessian equation, turbulence suppression reduces the pressure fluctuations gradients. This reduction over the wing would weaken, to some extent, the scattering of aerodynamic noise in the near wake region. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Ongoing climate change can affect migration phenology in a variety of species. We assessed autumn migration phenology of Northern Saw-whet Owls (Aegolius acadicus) using 25 years of banding data from 7 sites throughout eastern North America. Using a linear mixed model, we found a significant trend toward a later passage for the median passage date. Phenological changes in migration could be a way to cope with changing environmental conditions.  © 2023 by National Association of Biology Teachers. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: This study gives a comprehensive description of eyelids movement in little owl and discusses the impact of some surrounding conditions in their kinetic performance. The present study used the video's recording technique to record the kinetic activity of eyelids, besides the anatomical and histological studies of the eyelid's structure. The fundamental eyelid movements can be uniquely and reliably characterized by their anatomical relationship that was confirmed via video recording for their kinetic activity. The levator palpebrae muscle is considered a main generating motor for the upper eyelid; in the little owl, this muscle splits into multiple directions and is distinguished from the levator palpebrae superioris (Lps) and the levator anguli oculi (Lao) muscle. That anatomical pattern of insertion increases the movement of the upper lid. On the other side, the contraction of depressor palpebrae inferioris (Dpi) muscle and the active upward forces of levator palpebrae muscle help in increasing the opening of the eye's fissure. However, the closure process is produced from the passive downward forces and relaxation of the levator palpebrae superioris (Lps), levator anguli oculi (Lao), and depressor palpebrae inferioris muscle, as well as the contraction of retractor anguli oculi lateralis (Raol) and medialis (Raom) muscle. The present results also recorded that nictitating membrane's (Nm) movement is reversely proportionate to the level of kinetic of other eyelids. The mobility of Nm in little owl occurs under the effect of artificial external stress. These anatomical data and sequence video recordings have confirmed that the upper eyelid moves more compared to other eyelids. The authors also suggest that the mobility of eyelids may get stimulated through external pressure force of some surrounding structure like the periorbital sheet. Also, the histological study exhibited that the structure of two eyelids is very similar in the little owl and the variability is showing in the number of cell layers that forms their epithelium of skin and palpebral surfaces, the distribution of pigment granules, and degree of keratinization on their surface. That variability in the histological characters of eyelids may counteract the abrasive forces occurring during the opening and closing processes. © 2022 Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

ABSTRACT: Context: The concept of landscape heterogeneity is central to species conservation; yet understanding the processes by which heterogeneity affects species can be challenging in practice. Complex and sometimes difficult-to-measure responses of species may reflect the outcome of life-history trade-offs shaped by different landscape properties. Objectives: We tested the hypothesis that a mosaic of forest stand types affected hunting and breeding success for California spotted owls (Strix occidentailis occidentalis). Methods: We integrated high-temporal-resolution GPS tags, video monitoring of nest sites, long-term assessments of reproductive status, and high-resolution remotely sensed vegetation data in a mixed-ownership landscape in the Sierra Nevada, California to test our hypothesis. Results: Spotted owls made shorter nocturnal movements in homogenous territories with large areas of medium-aged forest apparently because this forest type allowed direct movement paths to foraging sites. However, spotted owls delivered prey at a higher rate to nest sites when they had more forest edge in their territory, which presumably provided greater access to large-bodied woodrat (Neotoma spp.) prey. Further, spotted owl reproductive output was relatively high in heterogenous territories containing a mix of mature and open forest. Conclusions: The benefits heterogenous forests provide to hunting success appeared to outweigh costs associated with additional commuting distance to foraging sites and provided potential fitness benefits to spotted owls. We suggest that the effects of landscape heterogeneity can vary not only among, but also within, species and can reflect the outcome of trade-offs among different life history activities. Understanding the effects of landscape properties on biological communities will benefit from additional empirical and mechanistic studies of individual species. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

ABSTRACT: During 2018-2019, the mammal diet of the barn owl (Tyto alba) in the southern region of Albania was studied. A considerable number of barn owl pellets has been collected, of which 1200 specimens of terrestrial small mammals (TSM) have been identified as belonging to 13 species (four insectivore and nine rodent species). Although the diet composition differed spatially from one station to another, the prey species preferred by the barn owl, both as frequency and biomass, were Microtus thomasi, Mus macedonicus, Crocidura suaveolens and Apodemus sylvaticus. In the southernmost region of Albania (Aliko), where the highest number TSM species was recorded, a drastic decline of M. thomasi was noted, accompanied with a significant shift in the barn owl prey preference. The study is a continuation of the previous studies undertaken in the same region since 2004 and provides new data on the dietary habits of the barn owl as well as on the distribution and population dynamics of TSM. © 2023 Institute of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Research - Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.

ABSTRACT: An adult pet tawny owl (Strix aluco) presented to a veterinary hospital at Parma University with a history of head trauma. After a critical care protocol including thermal, oxygen and fluid support aimed at stabilizing the patient, a neurological examination was performed. During neurological evaluation, marked lethargy and an inability to rise from a recumbent position was noted. Anisocoria was also present, with a mydriatic left pupil exhibiting no pupillary light response (PLR) even on direct illumination of both eyes. On ocular fundus examination, retinal hemorrhage and retinal detachment were observed. Based on these clinical findings, a complete work-up was performed, including hematological exams and total body X-ray studies followed by a computed tomography (CT) scan. Additional examinations, such as brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER) measurement and flash visual evoked potential (FVEP) recording, were performed. FVEP measurements performed on the left eye exhibited no peaks in either series of stimulations, indicating an altered functional integration within the visual pathway. A CT scan revealed a large hypoattenuating lesion within the right cerebral hemisphere, suspected to be intraparenchymal edema. The BAER test demonstrated an altered trace consistent with brainstem involvement and left hypoacusis due to cranial nerve VIII deficiency. Head trauma can result in significant neurological impairments in birds, impacting their behavior, mobility, and cognitive abilities. FVEP recordings, BAER tests and CT scans may be useful diagnostic tools in clinical practice. Understanding the causes and neurologic presentation of avian traumas is essential for effective prevention, diagnosis and treatment of affected birds.

ABSTRACT: Trophic interactions between threatened species complicate management. Similarly, interactions between threatened species and pest species present management challenges, given that pest control can lead to non-target impacts (e.g. trophic cascades or secondary poisoning). There are records of the critically endangered Norfolk Island Morepork Ninox novaeseelandiae undulata consuming both threatened songbirds and invasive rodents that are subject to management interventions. Nevertheless, the diet of the morepork remains largely unknown. We visually screened regurgitated pellets using a microscope, alongside environmental DNA (eDNA) screening of pellets and scats, to investigate the diet of the Norfolk Island Morepork. A total of 113 pellets and 19 scats were collected between October 2020 and June 2021. All moreporks screened with eDNA metabarcoding had consumed invasive rodents and at least one-third of samples contained rodents. The owls were also found to have consumed four of five endemic songbirds and possibly an endemic parrot, most of which are threatened. Environmental DNA metabarcoding detected more taxa overall, but visual screening identified a greater richness of Orthoptera and Coleoptera in the diet. The frequency with which the Norfolk Island Morepork consumed rodents presents a conundrum for conservation managers. Control of invasive rodents is considered essential to support threatened songbirds, yet this same action places the species at risk of secondary poisoning. Urgent investigations are needed to identify effective control methods for invasive rodents that are safe for non-target species. © 2024 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Tawny Owls in southern Europe were trapped and measured. Compared to males, the females were larger, heavier, and more greyish in colour, but there was a large biometric overlap. The variable with the highest Storer’s dimorphism index (SDI) was weight, though our population had one of the smallest dimorphisms observed in Europe for weight. It has been proposed that differences in diet could lead to differing behaviour and, in consequence, the observed dimorphism degree (SDI) by natural selection. © 2024 British Trust for Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: The high-resolution forecasting of vegetation type shifts may prove essential in anticipating and mitigating the impacts of future climate change on bird populations. Here, we used the US Forest Service Ecological Response Unit (ERU) classification to develop and assess vegetation-based breeding habitat profiles for eight owl species occurring in the foothills and mountains of the Southwestern US. Shifts in mapped habitat were forecast using an ecosystem vulnerability model based on the pre-1990 climate envelopes of ERUs and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) A1B moderate-emission scenario for the future climate. For five of the eight owl species, the regional breeding habitat extent was projected to decline by at least 60% by 2090. Three species, the boreal owl (Aegolius funereus; at the trailing edge of its distribution), flammulated owl (Psiloscops flammeolus), and northern pygmy-owl (Glaucidium gnoma), were projected to experience the steepest habitat loss rates of 85%, 85%, and 76%, respectively. Projected vegetation shifts overlaid with well-documented flammulated owl breeding populations showed the complete or near complete loss of habitat by 2090 in areas of montane forest currently supporting dense aggregations of owl territories. Generalist or lower-elevation owl species were predicted to be less impacted, while, for the whiskered screech-owl (Megascops trichopsis), the contraction of the current habitat was nearly offset by a projected northward expansion. In general, the results of this study suggest high exposure to climate change impacts for the upper-elevation forest owls of semi-arid Southwestern North America. Long-distance migration and low natal philopatry may prove important to some montane owl populations in adapting to the regional loss of habitat. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Species baseline information is required for effective biodiversity conservation. Here we provide sound ecological data to support effective conservation of the Principe Scops-owl, Otus bikegila Melo, Freitas, Verbelen, Costa, Pereira, Fuchs, Sangster, Correia, de Lima & Crottini 2022, discovered in 2016. We mapped the observed and potential distribution, inferred habitat associations, estimated population size, and assessed the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List category for this species. Surveys were carried out across Príncipe Island during the long and short dry seasons, recording owl presence in sampling points along transects. These data were used to model distribution, revealing that the Principe Scops-owl is restricted to 34.4 km2 in the south of the island, inside the Príncipe Obô Natural Park. Most records were in lower altitude native forest. Remoteness was the most important variable to explain presence at island level, followed by land use, which showed that the species is restricted to forest, clearly depending on native forest. Distance sampling using different models suggested a population density ranging between 33.4 individuals/km2 (95% CI: 23.6-47.2) and 46.4 individuals/km2 (95% CI: 29.3-73.6), which extrapolates to an estimated population size ranging from 1,149 individuals (95% CI: 813-1,623) to 1,597 individuals (95% CI: 1,007-2,533). We propose that the species is classified as Critically Endangered due to the small extent of occurrence, coupled with occurrence in a single location and inferred continuing declines in the extent of occurrence, area of occupancy, number of mature individuals and area, extent, and quality of habitat. Effective conservation of the Principe Scops-owl requires regular monitoring and further studies focusing on reproduction and potential nest predation by introduced mammals. Widespread support for the conservation of the Natural Park is vital to ensure the protection of this species and the endemic-rich native forests of Príncipe on which it depends.  © 2022 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Offspring survival rates in altricial birds during the post-fledging period are an essential factor in determining the fitness of parents and have a significant impact on general population dynamics. However, our current knowledge of post-fledging mortality and its causes remains fragmentary in most bird species, and even less information is available on the mortality of individuals of the same species in different environments. In order to address this gap in our knowledge, we studied fledgling mortality and its causes in Tengmalm’s owls (Aegolius funereus) during six breeding seasons in Central and North Europe using radio-telemetry. A total of 80 nestlings from 18 nests in Czechia (2010–2012, 2015) and 60 nestlings from 24 nests in Finland (2019, 2021) were radio-tracked during the post-fledging dependence period. The overall survival rate was much higher in Czechia (83%) than in Finland (53%), with predation identified as the primary cause of mortality in both areas. Avian predation was far higher in Finland, but mammalian predation was equivalent at both study sites. Pine martens (Martes martes) and goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) were the most common predators in Czechia and Finland, respectively. Starvation and disease, or mostly a combination of both, formed the second most common cause of death in both areas but were much more frequent in Finland than in Czechia. Offspring survival in both study sites was considerably higher in years of food abundance than in those of food scarcity. We suggest that the interactive effects of infections and poor body condition due to scarcity of main prey species induced higher mortality rates in offspring, particularly in the more challenging environment of North Europe. In contrast, fledgling owls were found to be able to fight off infections more successfully during rich food seasons. Finally, we encourage researchers to pay greater attention to the mutual influences of parasites and their definitive hosts and stress the importance of using radio or satellite tracking for mortality studies to identify causes of death more accurately.

ABSTRACT: Many species are difficult to study either due to their rarity, elusiveness, difficult access to their area of occurrence, or any combination of these. This can be particularly problematic for threatened species. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is a recently developed survey technique that has shown great potential in addressing this problem for species that communicate through vocalizations. However, the large amount of data it generates can be difficult to process manually. Here, we present an entirely automatic workflow to record and detect the vocalizations of a bird species that is both elusive (nocturnal) and restricted to difficult terrain in the most remote rainforests of an oceanic island: the recently discovered Principe Scops-Owl. Specifically, we evaluated (i) the performance of the workflow to monitor the presence of the owl, (ii) we assessed the most suitable time for monitoring it; and (iii) we examined the potential of this species to present detectable vocal individual signatures. For 12 days, we deployed omnidirectional recording stations (AudioMoth devices) in 72 points along 10 transects that were surveyed during one night at the same time by observers in the field. We trained TADARIDA, a machine learning software toolbox, to automatically detect owl calls. Results on the presence of the owl per site were similar for both methods. The automatic workflow showed that the owl is active during the whole night and the PAM recording setting should encompass at least the 21–23 h interval. Possibly, vocalizations had individual signatures—but the small sample size and temporal window prevented a definite conclusion. The automatic workflow developed here is an efficient method to monitor the Principe Scops-Owl and can be easily adapted for other elusive vocal species. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

ABSTRACT: As global temperatures and precipitation become more extreme, habitat specialists are at particular risk of being pushed past their environmental tolerance limits. Flammulated Owls (Psiloscops flammeolus) are small migratory owls that breed in temperate conifer forests of western North America. Their highly specialized nesting and foraging requirements make them indicators of ecosystem health. Using 17 years of nest observations, we investigated how annual weather patterns affected Flammulated Owl nesting and foraging behaviors during the breeding season. We used generalized linear models with a changepoint parameter to evaluate nest provisioning and nestling growth rates in years of extreme temperature and precipitation. We also evaluated how adult mass, division of labor, and productivity varied based on precipitation and temperature. Compared to wet and warm years, adults made more frequent prey deliveries to nestlings in dry and cold years, particularly early in the night and early in the season, and they experienced earlier changepoints in these years. We found a significant effect of temperature on the number of fledglings in broods, but weather did not affect other variables including productivity, nestling growth rates, adult masses, and division of labor. Our findings suggest that extreme annual weather patterns influence insect prey availability during the Flammulated Owl breeding season, forcing adults to work harder to provision for nests during dry and cold years. While productivity and nestling growth did not vary between years, these may incur a long-term tradeoff in adult survival. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Seed dispersal is an essential process contributing to the maintenance of plant populations. Zoochory is a widespread way of plant dispersal in every terrestrial ecosystem that can ensure the long-distance dispersal of seeds. Secondary seed dispersal (SSD) by far-ranging raptors is a special type of zoochory, which might have a role in colonizing new habitats. We used the barn owl (Tyto alba) as model species to test the effectivity and seasonality of SSD in open semi-natural landscapes. We collected 582 pellets from six sites in East-Hungary throughout one year. We identified prey items in the pellets and determined the viable seed content of the pellets by germination experiments. We found that herbivorous Microtus arvalis L. was the most abundant prey item through which most of the seeds spread. Owls dispersed the seeds of generalist and disturbance-tolerant plants, indicating the habitat type where small mammals occur abundantly. In another experiment we tested the effect of the pellet material on the seedling survival and found that prey remains enhanced establishment of seedlings. Our study suggests that SSD by barn owl is occasional but important event in long-distance seed dispersal. Since the studied owl species uses several habitat types and has larger mobility than the rodents, the revealed dispersal mechanism can considerably increase seed dispersal distance and seed exchange between habitat types. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Forest avifauna in eastern North America have expanded their range across the Great Plains to the West, likely due to anthropogenic changes. The barred owl (Strix varia) is a focal example of the negative effects that these intracontinental range expansions can have, with this invasive species becoming a major threat to the northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) and potentially larger biological communities. If barred owl populations are not managed immediately, northern spotted owl populations will likely be extirpated from large parts of their range and, ultimately, may become extinct. Of available management options, lethal control of barred owls has the greatest potential to rapidly benefit spotted owls and other impacted species. We argue that immediate action is necessary to buy time while other management options are explored and developed and that lethal control is an ethical management option. The barred owl conundrum exemplifies the challenges of managing native invasive species. © 2024 The Ecological Society of America.

ABSTRACT: Animals often rely on the presence of multiple, spatially segregated cover types to satisfy their ecological needs; the juxtaposition of these cover types is called landscape complementation. In ecosystems that have been homogenized because of human land use, such as fire-suppressed forests, management activities have the potential to increase the heterogeneity of cover types and, therefore, landscape complementation. We modeled changes to California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) nesting/roosting habitat, foraging habitat and habitat co-occurrence (i.e. landscape complementation) within a 971 245-ha forest landscape restoration project area, the Tahoe-Central Sierra Initiative (TCSI) landscape, through mid-century as a function of fuels reduction, fire and climate change. Compared to a minimal management scenario, accelerated management within the TCSI landscape was predicted to increase the number of potential 400-ha spotted owl territories containing a high degree of landscape complementation (defined as containing >20% nest/roost habitat and >20% foraging habitat) at lower elevations (<5000 ft.) by an average of 90 to 118 territories by 2050, depending on the climate scenario examined. At higher elevations (>5000 ft.), potential benefits of treatments to spotted owl nesting/roosting and foraging habitat were less evident, but accelerated management did not result in habitat loss. Our results suggest that accelerated fuels reduction and forest restoration treatments within this large landscape are expected to benefit spotted owls by improving the spatial juxtaposition of nesting/roosting and foraging cover types by 2050 compared to a minimal management scenario. Fuels reduction and forest restoration in this landscape thus can both increase the resilience of forest ecosystems to disturbances as well as benefit the habitat of a sensitive old-forest species.

ABSTRACT: The ability to recognize and be recognized underlies the social behavior of many animals. Individual-level recognition holds special importance in intra-specific recognition, where it is key to central processes like reproduction, locating one’s own offspring, degree of escalation of territorial conflicts with conspecifics, etc. Individual identity signaling involves producing unique, identifiable signatures that remain stable over time. A comparative study of vocally individual traits can reveal commonalities in related species, or common selective pressures in both related and unrelated species. Here, we conducted a literature review on vocal individuality in the owl clade. Owing to their nocturnal habit, the acoustic channel is very important for communication in owls. Territorial calls in many owl species have also been shown to be individually distinct and stable over several years. Further, we also classified the studies as fitting into one or more of Tinbergen’s “four questions” (ontogeny, mechanism, phylogeny, and function) whenever possible. Investigating individuality in the context of these four questions can inform us not only of the mechanism of how and where identity is encoded, but also of the evolution of individuality through the life span of species and through phylogeny. In total, we collected 34 papers on vocal individuality in owls, representing 22 species from 9 genera. Besides elaborating on relevant examples of studies fitting into one or more of the categories, we also highlight the gaps in research so far, and suggest steps to advance the research of vocal individuality in owls. © Deutsche Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V. 2024.

ABSTRACT: From 1898 through approximately 12 decades the status of the Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia) in coastal southern California and particularly Orange County was well documented. The earliest reports considered the species abundant along the south coastal slope, but starting about 1931, the breeding population slipped into a noticeable decline that continued until 2014, when the last known breeding attempt in Orange County occurred. Publications and reports from 1931-2016 have documented a chronic, but slow trend toward extirpation of the breeding population of coastal southern California from Santa Barbara County south through northern San Diego County. On the south coastal slope, only in southern San Diego County does a remnant breeding population exist. Causes of the Orange County decline include habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation; California ground squirrel (Otospermophilus beecheyi) eradication; and coastal predator management at California Least Tern (Sterna antillarum browni) and Western Snowy Plover (Charadrius nivosus) nesting colonies. The impact of these factors was compounded by short natal and breeding dispersal distances and ultimately by Allee effects. This report documents the last known nesting attempts of Burrowing Owls in Orange County, California. Although it remains plausible that an occasional future nesting attempt may still occur, the species in Orange County, as well as nesting colonies in other coastal southern California counties, can now be regarded as ecologically extirpated. © 2023 Ornithological Societies of North America.

ABSTRACT: The diet of a single Maghreb Owl Strix mauritanica (family Strigidae) was examined within its natural habitat at Kahf Lakhal cave on Jbel Moussa, a mountain in northern Morocco. The two distinct batches of pellets collected contained a total of 190 prey items. Pellet analysis revealed a diet comprised of four primary taxonomic classes of prey: mammals, insects, birds and reptiles. We identified 29 prey species, representing 21 families. Mammals were the most prominent component, accounting for 49.5% of the diet items and included at least nine distinct species. Insects constituted 28.9% of the diet, representing at least eight species; birds comprised 20%, representing at least 11 species; and reptiles were represented by a single species (3.4%). Numerically, the most frequently captured prey species were the common bent-wing bat Miniopterus schreibersii (22.1%), black rat Rattus rattus (8.4%) and European rhinoceros beetle Oryctes nasicornis (7.9%). In biomass, black rats were the biggest component of the owl’s diet (31.8%), followed by Barbary Partridges Alectoris barbara and hares Lepus sp. (each 11.9%); together these three species comprised more than half the estimated biomass of the prey types consumed by the owl. This investigation significantly improves our knowledge of the diet of the Maghreb Owl in the North African region. © 2024 NISC (Pty) Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The barn owls (Tyto alba), as a biological control for the rat population, are relatively effective and safe for the oil palm ecosystem. So nowadays, many oil palm plantations are trying to introduce it to reduce the use of rodenticides. This paper's objective is to evaluate a decade of T. alba introduction in ca 80,000 ha oil palm plantations in Central Kalimantan since the initial releasing three pairs of T. alba in July 2011. We use a quantitative descriptive method to provide the primary data on a monthly monitoring basis, i.e., the T. alba population, including its chick and eggs; the number of barn owl boxes occupied; rat damage percentage and the number of rat baiting applications. The population increment during the year 2011 to 2012 was retarded. However, since the year 2013, the population of barn owl population rapidly increased using a combination of self-released barn owl distribution from field barn owl boxes. It assisted augmentation from barn owl hatchery methods. Based on the monthly census in December 2022, the occupancy rates reached 75% from 4,234 boxes; occupied by 6,390 owls, 1,665 chicks, and 1,531 eggs. The established population of T. alba in an oil palm plantation in Central Kalimantan has reduced the rat damage percentage below the threshold level of 5%. It has no rat-baiting application (zero rat bait). © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Pink photoluminescence is activated in the feathers of owls (Strigiformes) and frogmouths (Podargiformes) when exposed to ultraviolet-violet light. This phenomenon has been reported from Western Australia and worldwide, but has not been investigated in tropical north-eastern Australia. The gradual degradation of porphyrin luminophores is used to age owls, but incidental light exposure presents an unquantified variable when examining both live animals and museum specimens for pink-red photoluminescence. I examined roadkill specimens of two species of owl and two species of frogmouth from the Australian Wet Tropics for photoluminescence, and tested the photobleaching effects of timed exposure to direct sunlight and indoor laboratory lighting. All specimens examined displayed orange-pink feather photoluminescence to varying degrees. Porphyrin pink photoluminescence of feathers became noticeably diminished within one to two minutes of exposure to direct sunlight, or several hours of indoor laboratory lighting. Photobleaching is thus highlighted as a confounding factor when examining specimens with an unknown light exposure history. © Plant Science and Biodiversity Centre, Slovak Academy of Sciences (SAS), Institute of Zoology, Slovak Academy of Sciences (SAS), Institute of Molecular Biology, Slovak Academy of Sciences (SAS) 2024.

ABSTRACT: The cosmopolitan distribution of the Barn Owl Tyto alba and its relatively well documented diet through the study of pellets have provided evidence of the broad diversity of prey it relies on. In most studies, both in tropical and temperate regions, rodents are its main prey, with other small mammals and vertebrates, and insects complementing its diet. Although bats have been recorded in the diet of T. alba at many localities, they seldom represent an important part of its diet. This study describes the diet of a small colony of T. alba from a mosaic of agricultural fields, pastures for ca(le ranching and tropical dry forests in Tolima, central Colombia. Overall, we collected 516 pellets between 2016 and 2017 in a non-systematic manner, and recovered 335 skulls of rodents (67%), bats (29%), birds (3%) and shrews (1%), as well as invertebrate prey. The large proportion of bats in the diet of T. alba in this study is only matched by a few other studies, and further documents the wide range of prey included in the diet of this nocturnal raptor. This is one of the first studies on the diet of T. alba in tropical dry forests in Colombia and complements the existing data on its diet in the American tropics and worldwide.

ABSTRACT: A greater knowledge of the intrinsic and extrinsic factors of animal home range (HR) formation can help us to understand the fundamental biological issues underlying, for instance, movement patterns, habitat selection and survival. However, very little is known about the HRs of birds of prey fledglings, even though the post-fledging phase is recognised as crucial due to the high mortality of juvenile birds. We radio-tracked 138 Tengmalm’s owl (Aegolius funereus) fledglings from 43 broods to determine their HRs during the post-fledging dependence period and to investigate the factors affecting their sizes. The study was conducted during four breeding seasons in Czechia and two seasons in Finland. The mean fledglings’ HR size calculated according to the 95% IID Kernel Density Estimation method was 63.7 ± 43.9 ha (± SD; n = 71) during nocturnal activity and 52.0 ± 46.1 ha (n = 63) during diurnal roosting. The sizes of both nocturnal activity and diurnal roosting HRs increased with the longer individual duration of the post-fledging dependence period and also the higher rank of hatching within a brood. Diurnal roosting HRs were two times smaller in the Czech site, probably because of the very limited number of dense forest patches suitable for roosting as a legacy of the air pollution calamity in the 1970s, during which most coniferous stands died out. There was no difference in the size of nocturnal activity HR between the two study areas, although they differed markedly in terms of night length, altitude, weather, and forest age, structure and composition. This suggests that environmental factors are not decisive in determining the size of nocturnal activity HRs of Tengmalm’s owl fledglings. Since the diurnal HRs always occurred within the area of the nocturnal HRs, we suggest that conservation of the densest and preferably oldest forest stands within the areas of the study species occurrence may offer straightforward conservation tasks for protecting Tengmalm’s owl fledglings and also other species.

ABSTRACT: As central-place foragers, owls accumulate prey remains, in the form of rejection pellets, around their roosting and nesting sites, which may modify top soil composition and influence seed germination. However, the effects of owl pellets on seed germination still remain understudied. In this study, we conducted germination assays on two plant species from south Tunisia to assess whether a prior treatment of the seeds with the filtrate of little owl (Athene noctua) pellets affected germination rates under different salinity conditions. Results showed enhanced germination in pellet-treated seeds compared to untreated seeds. Pellet treatment was also associated with reduced inhibitory effects of salt on seed germination. Moreover, at the scale of a little owl territory, the concentrations of organic matter and total nitrogen in the top soil were higher at the nesting site compared to a nearby unused site, providing some evidence of a fertilizing effect of pellets. Overall, our findings suggest that little owls play a significant role in shaping plant dynamics and ecosystem functioning in arid North African areas, where the soil is poor and threatened by salinization. We suggest that little owls may be relevant actors in eventual restoration and rehabilitation plans of degraded ecosystems in these areas. © 2024 Université Laval.

ABSTRACT: Vocal communication plays a key role in behaviour of nocturnal avian species. The amount of specific vocal utterances changes depending on the presence and absence of the target audience and thus it can inform, among others, about possible function of the calls. In this study, we used a passive recording setup and counted all hoot and chewing calls given by focal Little Owl (Athene noctua) males in the presence or absence of other vocalising males and their female partners during one night to investigate possible roles of these two call types in inter- and intra-sexual communication. The total number of hoots increased in males with two or more male neighbours compared to those having a single or no male neighbour. Furthermore, the total number of chewing calls was higher in the presence of vocally active female. These results confirmed the presumed territorial function of hoots, but they imply that chewing calls, which were suggested to function in a broad array of different and even antagonistic contexts, are probably used in male–female interactions. The absence of correlation in the vocal output of both call types further supports different communication roles of hoots and chewing calls. We argue that local social environment (e.g. number of neighbours) rather than broad population descriptions (high/low-density population) appears to be more useful in similar studies. Our study also represents an important contribution to understanding of contextual changes in vocal activity in non-songbirds. © Deutsche Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V. 2024.

ABSTRACT: Neoplasms are only sporadically reported in New World primates and rarely in owl monkeys (Aotus spp.), specifically. Previous reports of neoplasms in owl monkeys are primarily restricted to lymphoma induced by Herpesvirus saimiri infection, although other tumors in the central nervous, genitourinary, gastrointestinal, and endocrine systems have been sporadically reported. Herein, we describe 3 previously unreported neoplasms in owl monkeys (Aotus nancymaae) including a pericardial mesothelioma in a 6-year-old male, a nephroblastoma in a 2-year-old male, and a cervical neoplasm with characteristics of an epithelioid trophoblastic tumor in a 4-year-old female, all occurring in the same closed breeding colony at a research facility in central Texas. Reporting of spontaneously occurring neoplasms in research colony populations is important for identifying potential animal models of human diseases and for improving colony management and species health. © The Author(s) 2024.

ABSTRACT: Barn Owls Tyto alba were recorded breeding in natural nest hollows in a Wandoo Eucalyptus wandoo woodland in the northern wheatbelt of Western Australia infrequently and at low densities during the period 1969-2022. During a record cropping season in 2022, Barn Owls were first recorded nesting successfully in natural hollows and in artificial nest hollows designed for use by Carnaby’s Cockatoos. The large clutch sizes (5-7) and complete fledging success observed in three artificial nest hollows was likely facilitated by a large House Mouse Mus musculus population associated with the record cropping season experienced at the study site. © 2024 Royal Zoological Society of New South Wales.

ABSTRACT: Animals with enhanced dim-light sensitivity are at higher risk of light-induced retinal degeneration when exposed to bright light conditions.1,2,3,4 This trade-off is mediated by the rod photoreceptor sensory protein, rhodopsin (RHO), and its toxic vitamin A chromophore by-product, all-trans retinal.5,6,7,8 Rod arrestin (Arr-1) binds to RHO and promotes sequestration of excess all-trans retinal,9,10 which has recently been suggested as a protective mechanism against photoreceptor cell death.2,11 We investigated Arr-1 evolution in animals at high risk of retinal damage due to periodic bright-light exposure of rod-dominated retinas. Here, we find the convergent evolution of enhanced Arr-1/RHO all-trans-retinal sequestration in owls and deep-diving whales. Statistical analyses reveal a parallel acceleration of Arr-1 evolutionary rates in these lineages, which is associated with the introduction of a rare Arr-1 mutation (Q69R) into the RHO-Arr-1 binding interface. Using in vitro assays, we find that this single mutation significantly enhances RHO-all-trans-retinal sequestration by ∼30%. This functional convergence across 300 million years of evolutionary divergence suggests that Arr-1 and RHO may play an underappreciated role in the photoprotection of the eye, with potentially vast clinical significance. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The successful rehabilitation and release of raptor chicks can be challenging, especially when the chicks are still in the post-fledging dependency period. Here, we report on a recently fledged powerful owl chick that was held in care for 33 days before being successfully reunited with its parents. We document the steps undertaken during the entire process from collection from the wild to post-release monitoring and recommend clinical procedures for treatment of raptors entering veterinary facilities. Success of this rehabilitation was facilitated by early care and treatment for potential rodenticide poisoning, as well as the integration of citizen scientists monitoring the family unit in the field while the chick was in care and during the post-release period. Given the emerging evidence of widespread rodenticide poisoning in raptors both in Australia and globally, it is critical to suspect all raptors may have been exposed to anticoagulant rodenticides and commence treatment with vitamin K immediately. Routine treatment for rodenticides early increases the probability of successful recovery post-trauma as well as reducing the time in treatment as much as possible. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: As one of the unique owl-wing morphologies, trailing-edge (TE) fringes are believed to play a critical role in the silent flight of owls and have been widely investigated using idealized single/tandem airfoils. However, the effect of TE fringes and associated mechanisms on the aeroacoustics of owl wings, which feature curved leading edges, wavy TEs, and several feather slots at the wingtips, have not yet been addressed. In this study, we constructed two 3D owl wing models, one with and one without TE fringes, based on the geometric characteristics of a real owl wing. Large-eddy simulations and the Ffowcs Williams‒Hawkings analogy were combined to resolve the aeroacoustic characteristics of the wing models. Comparisons of the computed aerodynamic forces and far-field acoustic pressure levels demonstrate that the fringes on owl wings can robustly suppress aerodynamic noise while sustaining aerodynamic performance comparable to that of a clean wing. By visualizing the near-field flow dynamics in terms of flow and vortex structures as well as flow fluctuations, the mechanisms of TE fringes in owl wing models are revealed. First, the TE fringes on owl wings are reconfirmed to robustly suppress flow fluctuations near the TE by breaking up large TE vortices. Second, the fringes are observed to effectively suppress the shedding of wingtip vortices by mitigating the flow interaction between feathers (feather-slot interaction). These complementary mechanisms synergize to enhance the robustness and effectiveness of the TE fringe effects in owl wing models, in terms of aerodynamic force production and noise suppression. This study thus deepens our understanding of the role of TE fringes in real owl flight gliding and points to the validity and feasibility of employing owl-inspired TE fringes in practical applications of low-noise fluid machinery. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd

ABSTRACT: Monitoring population size at ecosystem scales is difficult for most species of conservation concern. While assessing site occupancy at broad scales has proven feasible, rigorous tracking of changes in population size over time has not – even though it can provide a stronger basis for assessing population status and conservation-decision making. Therefore, we demonstrate how relatively low-intensity, ecosystem-scale passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) can be linked to local-density monitoring to estimate the population size of native California spotted owls (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) and invasive barred owls (S. varia) across the western Sierra Nevada, California. Based on a PAM sampling grid with 400 ha cells (the approximate home range size of these species), we estimated site occupancy to be between 0.42 (SE = 0.02) and 0.30 (SE = 0.02) for California spotted owls using relatively liberal and strict criteria, respectively, for considering a cell occupied. PAM-based site occupancy estimates within local-scale density monitoring study areas (range = 0.41–0.78 and 0.28–0.76 for liberal and strict criteria, respectively) were strongly and positively correlated with local density (range = 0.08–0.31 owl/km2) for this species. In contrast, ecosystem-wide site occupancy of barred owls was very low based on PAM (0.034, SE < 0.01), as were densities within local monitoring studies (range = 0–0.005 owls/km2). By scaling ecosystem-wide site occupancy estimates to densities estimated with local monitoring studies, we estimated that, depending on occupancy criteria, 2,218 (SE = 278) or 2,328 (SE = 489) California spotted owls occurred in the Sierra Nevada ecosystem in 2021. Thus, while California spotted owls are a rare subspecies, they were well-distributed across the Sierra Nevada. Because there were so few barred owl detections, we could not estimate ecosystem-scale abundance, which reflects the success of prior experimental removals in the region. In conclusion, our study provides a generalizable framework for estimating population size for territorial species with PAM at ecosystem scales when local-scale estimates of density are available. Thus, we demonstrate that this approach can provide novel and valuable insights into monitoring populations to aid species conservation. © 2023

ABSTRACT: Background: Movement is central to understanding the ecology of animals. The most robustly definable segments of an individual’s lifetime track are its diel activity routines (DARs). This robustness is due to fixed start and end points set by a 24-h clock that depends on the individual’s quotidian schedule. An analysis of day-to-day variation in the DARs of individuals, their comparisons among individuals, and the questions that can be asked, particularly in the context of lunar and annual cycles, depends on the relocation frequency and spatial accuracy of movement data. Here we present methods for categorizing the geometry of DARs for high frequency (seconds to minutes) movement data. Methods: Our method involves an initial categorization of DARs using data pooled across all individuals. We approached this categorization using a Ward clustering algorithm that employs four scalar “whole-path metrics” of trajectory geometry: 1. net displacement (distance between start and end points), 2. maximum displacement from start point, 3. maximum diameter, and 4. maximum width. We illustrate the general approach using reverse-GPS data obtained from 44 barn owls, Tyto alba, in north-eastern Israel. We conducted a principle components analysis (PCA) to obtain a factor, PC1, that essentially captures the scale of movement. We then used a generalized linear mixed model with PC1 as the dependent variable to assess the effects of age and sex on movement. Results: We clustered 6230 individual DARs into 7 categories representing different shapes and scale of the owls nightly routines. Five categories based on size and elongation were classified as closed (i.e. returning to the same roost), one as partially open (returning to a nearby roost) and one as fully open (leaving for another region). Our PCA revealed that the DAR scale factor, PC1, accounted for 86.5% of the existing variation. It also showed that PC2 captures the openness of the DAR and accounted for another 8.4% of the variation. We also constructed spatio-temporal distributions of DAR types for individuals and groups of individuals aggregated by age, sex, and seasonal quadrimester, as well as identify some idiosyncratic behavior of individuals within family groups in relation to location. Finally, we showed in two ways that DARs were significantly larger in young than adults and in males than females. Conclusion: Our study offers a new method for using high-frequency movement data to classify animal diel movement routines. Insights into the types and distributions of the geometric shape and size of DARs in populations may well prove to be more invaluable for predicting the space-use response of individuals and populations to climate and land-use changes than other currently used movement track methods of analysis. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The binocular field of vision differs widely in birds depending on ecological traits such as foraging. Owls (Strigiformes) have been considered to have a unique binocular field, but whether it is related to foraging has remained unknown. While taking into account allometry and phylogeny, we hypothesized that both daily activity cycle and diet determine the size and shape of the binocular field in owls. Here, we compared the binocular field configuration of 23 species of owls. While we found no effect of allometry and phylogeny, ecological traits strongly influence the binocular field shape and size. Binocular field shape of owls significantly differed from that of diurnal raptors. Among owls, binocular field shape was relatively conserved, but binocular field size differed among species depending on ecological traits, with larger binocular fields in species living in dense habitat and foraging on invertebrates. Our results suggest that (i) binocular field shape is associated with the time of foraging in the daily cycle (owls versus diurnal raptors) and (ii) that binocular field size differs between closely related owl species even though the general shape is conserved, possibly because the field of view is partially restricted by feathers, in a trade-off with auditory localization. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Examining the transferability of habitat selection models is vital when they are used to forecast predictions in new times or places, but this issue is too often neglected. Nest boxes are often installed in agricultural landscapes to attract barn owls (Tyto spp.) and the ecosystem services they provide. For this practice to be effective, farmers need actionable guidelines for nest box design and placement to optimize nest box use. We addressed 3 primary objectives: 1) develop a nest box selection model in the well-studied region of Napa Valley, California, USA, 2) evaluate this model's predictive performance in other regions of California, and 3) use data from all regions to build a more generalizable model. Based on data from 6 years of monitoring used and unused American barn owl (Tyto furcata) nest boxes in Napa Valley, we found that nest box selection was best predicted by nest box attributes (e.g., pole height, box height, and entrance orientation), local land cover (e.g., grassland within 75 m), and landscape-scale metrics (e.g., grassland within 2.81 km). This model's predictions were strongly correlated with observed nest box use in Napa, but the model performed poorly when used to predict nest box use in other regions that are ecologically similar (Sonoma County) or dissimilar (Fresno, Merced, and Madera counties). A model pooling data from all regions fit the data well and again showed effects of box, local, and landscape predictors. It was more generalizable than the Napa-only model and lost little precision when applied with forecasting predictions to Napa in particular. Taken together, our results indicate that local data should be used to make the most reliable predictions of nest box use. Until those data are available, general recommendations should be made from models that pool data from as many regions as feasible and should provide appropriate caveats. Results of this work can inform nest box design and placement for the benefit of farmers and owls in California, and future research should examine nest box selection by barn owls in other areas of the world with different climates and local habitats. © 2024 The Wildlife Society.

ABSTRACT: Vocal individuality has been widely documented in the Tawny owl (Strix aluco); however, all statistical tools employed thus far to discriminate individual vocalisations have relied on prior knowledge regarding number and identity of individuals. In this study, we tested the effectiveness of four unsupervised clustering algorithms in distinguishing among eight Tawny owl males, solely based on acoustic characteristics of their vocalisations. We also employed both traditional bound-based and robust measurements of acoustic signal to compare their efficacy. We finally evaluated the applicability of this method in identifying the number and distribution of the remaining males recorded in our study area. Three of the four unsupervised techniques had a high rate of success in discriminating among vocalisations of the eight males. In all cases, the best results were obtained using robust measurements. However, when extending the analysis to the remaining unknown males recorded, the highest rate of misclassification errors made results more difficult to interpret. Our study provided a useful tool to discriminate male Tawny owls when only their call recordings are available. Furthermore, this method could be extended to other nocturnal and vociferous species, representing one of the few existing approaches for unsupervised classification of individuals based on acoustic features. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: The Vistula River is one of the largest European semi-natural rivers of high ecological value that functions as an ecological corridor. To assess the structure of small mammal communities along the Vistula River, an analysis of the diet of an opportunistic predator, the tawny owl Strix aluco, was used. A total of 6355 individuals of 19 species were found, including 5 soricomorph species, 12 rodents, 1 carnivore, and 1 bat species. Tawny owls most frequently caught Apodemus agrarius, Clethrionomys glareolus, Apodemus flavicollis, and Microtus arvalis. Rodents dominated small mammal communities (90%), followed by soricomorphs (8%), and the share of Chiroptera was significant (2%). Using Ward’s method in cluster analysis, three clusters of sites with similar mammal communities were identified. The cluster that included 17 study sites with the dominance of agriculture habitats was inhabited by diverse mammal communities with a high number of species. In the cluster composed of three suburban forest sites, mammal communities had the lowest diversity, although the high species richness and the highest shares of the forest species (A. flavicollis, C. glareolus, and Nyctalus noctula). Mammal communities in the cluster were composed of three urban sites were dominated by A. agrarius and M. arvalis. The study indicates the high species richness of small mammals in floodplains of the Vistula River and the adjacent areas in central Poland. The floodplain offers suitable habitats for species associated with forests, water bodies, agricultural land, and developed areas. The data collected confirms earlier model predictions about the presence of well-connected local populations of forest mammals along the Vistula River. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Migration is driven by a combination of environmental and genetic factors, but many questions remain about those drivers. Potential interactions between genetic and environmental variants associated with different migratory phenotypes are rarely the focus of study. We pair low coverage whole genome resequencing with a de novo genome assembly to examine population structure, inbreeding, and the environmental factors associated with genetic differentiation between migratory and resident breeding phenotypes in a species of conservation concern, the western burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia hypugaea). Our analyses reveal a dichotomy in gene flow depending on whether the population is resident or migratory, with the former being genetically structured and the latter exhibiting no signs of structure. Among resident populations, we observed significantly higher genetic differentiation, significant isolation-by-distance, and significantly elevated inbreeding. Among migratory breeding groups, on the other hand, we observed lower genetic differentiation, no isolation-by-distance, and substantially lower inbreeding. Using genotype–environment association analysis, we find significant evidence for relationships between migratory phenotypes (i.e., migrant versus resident) and environmental variation associated with cold temperatures during the winter and barren, open habitats. In the regions of the genome most differentiated between migrants and residents, we find significant enrichment for genes associated with the metabolism of fats. This may be linked to the increased pressure on migrants to process and store fats more efficiently in preparation for and during migration. Our results provide a significant contribution toward understanding the evolution of migratory behavior and vital insight into ongoing conservation and management efforts for the western burrowing owl. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: This paper presents the results of owl surveys conducted in the Žumberak – Samoborsko gorje Nature Park (340 km²), NW Croatia, between 2002 and 2005. Five owl species were recorded, with the Tawny Owl Strix aluco being the most common. A total of 108 Tawny Owl ter-ritories, 22 Ural Owl Strix uralensis territories, 8 Northern Long-eared Owl Asio otus territories, 3 Little Owl Athene noctua territories, and 2 Common Barn Owl Tyto alba territories were identified. The primary conservation challenge is the ongoing succession of open habitats to for-ests, driven by significant depopulation and the decline in traditional agriculture. This poses a major threat to species associated with open habitats, such as the Barn Owl and the Little Owl. To maintain owl di-versity, it is vital to support extensive agricultural practices within the Nature Park’s boundaries, preserving and, where possible, restoring grasslands and traditional orchards. © 2024, Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts.

ABSTRACT: Urbanization is often associated with homogenization, including the homogenization of biodiversity and overpopulation by generalist species that can change community and disease dynamics. In Madrid, nestlings of Eurasian Scops Owl Otus scops frequently suffer necrotic oropharyngeal disease as a result of infection by Gongylonema sp., a parasitic nematode transmitted by adult owls to their offspring through the diet, more specifically through consumption of a pest species: the oriental cockroach Blatta orientalis. We studied how the presence of cockroaches and owl infection rates are affected by urban features such as green areas. We found that a higher number of birds were affected by the parasite in the initial period of the breeding season and in areas with greater surface area of green spaces. We suggest that urban management should promote the diversity of insects in green areas so that the owls diversify their dietary offer to their offspring, to reduce the prevalence of the disease and improve their breeding success in the city of Madrid, as this problem has not yet been described in other cities. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: During cave bear excavations in the Loutra Almopias Cave, Pella District, in Central Macedonia, Greece, an ecologically highly diverse Late Glacial faunal assemblage, mainly micromammals and birds, was sampled from an elevated small niche labelled LAC Ia. The lagomorphs are represented by steppe pika (Ochotona pusilla), brown (or European) hare (Lepus europaeus) and mountain hare (Lepus timidus). The site evidences the first record of this last species in Greece and its southernmost evidence so far. The taphonomic patterns of the fossils refer to eagle owls (Bubo bubo) as an accumulating agent. This is congruent with the total LAC Ia species spectrum and the bone element abundance and destruction patterns. Radiocarbon dates of 12,350±40 14C yrs BP (VERA-5631) from a Lepus sp. bone and 16,427±96 14C yrs BP (VERA-7402) from a L. timidus premolar indicate the emplacement of the assemblage in the (very probably early phase of the) Late Glacial. The taphocoenosis reflects a high variety of habitats and biodiversity from periglacial alpine grassland to deciduous forests and Mediterranean open fore-land areas with scattered brush and thick scrub. The position of the eagle owl site is approximately 50 m inside the cave. Along the distance from the Late Pleistocene entrance, the nocturnal raptors had to manage two direction changes within their flight path. That opening was closed later by talus sediments, and thus the fossil owl nest or feeding place has been sealed. The LAC Ia assemblage is so far a unique terrestrial record of Late Glacial biota in the Southern Balkans. © Geological Institute “Strashimir Dimitrov”, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.

ABSTRACT: The boreal owl (Aegolius funereus) has a circumpolar distribution, typically inhabit extensive conifer forest of higher age classes in the northern hemisphere. Breeding biology, reproductive strategies, and behavioural ecology of these nocturnal birds are well studied in Europe and North America. However, the knowledge of the subspecies of boreal owl (A. f. beickianus) in the coniferous forests at high mountainous altitude of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is still limited. We spent 10 years studying the breeding biology of A. f. beickianus in Lian Hua Shan Nature Reserve (Gansu Province), where we could first confirm the occurrence of this small forest dwelling owl in 1995. During breeding seasons (2003-2009, 2017-2019), we checked nest boxes and recorded the basic breeding data. Thereby a total of 51 broods were found with an average of 5.1 ± 1.7 broods per year. The mean egg mass and volume was 12.42 ± 1.36 g and 12.85 ± 0.79 mm3, respectively. Mean clutch size per brood was 2.61 ± 0.64. The mean number of fledglings was 1.25 ± 0.31 per nesting attempt and 2.07 ± 0.38 per successful brood. Nestling period lasted 35.75 ± 2.80 days in total, but was divided in two stages: in the first stage, which lasted 16.75 ± 1.48 days, the female stood in the breeding hole with its nestlings. In the second stage, which lasted 17 ± 4.34 days until the fledglings left their nest, the female stood outside the hole. The individual fledglings left the nesting site in intervals of 2.55 ± 1.92 days. Copyright 2024 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: A population of burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia) under professional care at Zoomarine Portugal presented with sudden respiratory clinical signs. Clinical management included a thorough diagnosis plan, including in-house fecal analysis that revealed the presence of ovoid unioperculate eggs. In the postmortem examination of one hyperacute dyspneic specimen, adult nematode parasites were collected and identified based on their morphology as Cyathostoma (Hovorkonema) americana. Even after a broad-spectrum deworming protocol as part of the treatment and metaphylaxis approach, the incidence of parasitic reinfection was high. The complete clinical resolution was only accomplished after the identification and management of the possible focus of infection, a wild population of cattle egrets (Bubulcus ibis) that frequently congregated above the owls’ habitat. To the authors’ best knowledge, this is the first report of infection by Cyathostoma (Hovorkonema) americana in burrowing owls. Although nematodes of the family Syngamidae are not commonly included in the differential diagnosis of infectious respiratory agents of birds of the order Strigiformes, this report highlights the possibility of opportunistic parasitism in a zoological context, especially where there is a continued proximity to free-ranging avifauna. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The herbicide active ingredient glyphosate is the most widely applied herbicidal substance worldwide. Currently it is the market-leading pesticide, and its use is projected to further grow 4.5-fold between 2022 and 2029. Today, glyphosate use exceeds one megaton per year worldwide, which represents a serious environmental burden. A factor in the overall boost in the global use of glyphosate has been the spread of glyphosate-tolerant genetically modified (GM) crops that allow post-emergence applications of the herbicide on these transgenic crops. In turn, cultivation of glyphosate-tolerant GM crops represented 56% of the glyphosate use in 2019. Due to its extremely high application rate, xenobiotic behaviour and a water solubility (11.6 mg/mL at 25 °C) unusually high among pesticide active ingredients, glyphosate has become a ubiquitous water pollutant and a primary drinking water contaminant worldwide, presenting a threat to water quality. The goal of our research was to develop a rapid and sensitive method for detecting this herbicide active ingredient. For this purpose, we applied the novel analytical biosensor technique optical waveguide light-mode spectroscopy (OWLS) to the label-free detection of glyphosate in a competitive immunoassay format using glyphosate-specific polyclonal antibodies. After immobilising the antigen conjugate in the form of a glyphosate conjugated to human serum albumin for indirect measurement, the sensor chip was used in a flow-injection analyser system. For the measurements, an antibody stock solution was diluted to 2.5 µg/mL. During the measurement, standard solutions were mixed with the appropriate concentration of antibodies and incubated for 1 min before injection. The linear detection range and the EC50 value of the competitive detection method were between 0.01 and 100 ng/mL and 0.60 ng/mL, respectively. After investigating the indirect method, we tested the cross-reactivity of the antibody with glyphosate and structurally related compounds. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: The success of Eagle Owl breeding in artificial niches and natural nests was studied. Manufacturing and installing artificial nests for Eagle Owls in Mordovia, central European Russia is employed as a factor to increasing the number of both successfully breeding pairs and the population size. At the same time, no differences were found for artificial and natural nests in terms of reproductive success, clutch size, and the number of fledglings. In 51% of nesting cases, pairs laid three eggs, compared to two eggs in 43% or four eggs or one egg each in 3%. The average clutch size was 2.54 ± 0.08 eggs. Over the years of our study of owl nesting in Mordovia, 13.6% pairs raised one chick, compared to two and three chicks in 36.4 and 50%, respectively. The number of reared chicks per successful nest averaged 2.36 ± 0.11. The mortality rate in nests was lower in artificial nesting sites (30%) than in natural ones (40.6%). © 2023, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Rodents are common prey of nocturnal raptor birds, which ingest whole individuals and subsequently expel partially digested remains as regurgitated pellets. This generates accumulations of skeletal elements that may become part of the fossil record. Inferring which predator was responsible of any given fossil microvertebrate assemblage allows assessing potential biases and making paleoecological inferences. Neotaphonomic studies allow modelling the particularities characterizing different raptors under different environmental conditions. Based on them, it is possible to suggest the predator involved in fossil microvertebrate assemblages by considering the taxonomic and anatomical abundance, the degree of digestive corrosion and that of breakage of skeletal remains. Yet, no detailed neotaphonomic studies on raptors had been made so far in NW Argentina, and other studies in South America have been made mainly in open and arid environments. This has forced paleontological studies to use analogues that might not be fully relevant. Here we present an actualistic study on rodent skeletal remains (NISP = 7540) recovered from modern pellets produced by the barn owl (Tyto alba), recovered at Villa Padre Monti (Tucumán, Argentina), a Yungas forest area partially affected by the presence of crops. The aim is to characterize the taphonomic traces of T. alba under these environmental conditions. The assemblage is composed of at least five species of Cricetidae rodents and a varied representation of skeletal elements, especially of the post-cranium; it has a high relative anatomical abundance (58.7%). Skeletal breakage levels are low, especially in the mandibles and post-cranium. Digestive corrosion is predominantly absent (62.1%) to light, although some elements with high degrees of digestive corrosion were found, even in the extreme digestion category. These results generally compare well with other taphonomic studies on the barn owl, and add data to the known variability of modern accumulations by this Strigiformes. They are thus expected to have an impact on the interpretations of fossil faunas. © 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS

ABSTRACT: The Brown Fish-Owl Ketupa zeylonensis is a large nocturnal bird of prey that has a vast distribution range. However, there is a significant literature gap on the ecology of this species in the Western Ghats ecoregion, particularly in regard to its food spectrum. In the present study, we assessed the diet composition of this species in the foothills of the Western Ghats of Goa, India. The diet was evaluated by analysing the undigested prey remains in regurgitated pellets obtained from the banks of forest streams and roosting sites. A total of 104 pellets were collected from two localities that exhibited similar landscape characteristics. Our analysis indicated that crabs contributed to a significant proportion of the diet of the species (75.47%), followed by amphibians (frogs, 8.02%), fishes (7.08%), reptiles (snakes, 2.83%), birds (2.36%), scorpions (1.89%), and insects (Odonata, 0.47%). Additionally, 1.89% (n = 4) of the prey items could not be identified due to their disintegrated nature. Furthermore, an assessment of Food Niche Breadth (FNB) indicated that K. zeylonensis exhibited a high degree of specialization in terms of its diet in the study areas. © Dias & Borker 2023.

ABSTRACT: Across the Americas, great horned owls (Bubo virginianus) are often presented to veterinarians for conditions requiring pain management. Although recent studies have evaluated opioid drugs in raptor species, information in Strigiformes is lacking. The objective of this study was to evaluate the analgesic effect and duration of action of hydromorphone hydrochloride, a full μ-opioid receptor agonist, in great horned owls. In a randomized, blinded, balanced crossover study, 6 adult birds (5 females and 1 male) received hydromorphone (0.3 and 0.6 mg/kg) or saline (0.9% NaCl) solution (0.03 mL/kg; control) in the left pectoral muscle, with a 7-day washout interval between treatments. Each bird was assigned an agitation-sedation score, and the thermal foot withdrawal threshold (TFWT) was measured at predetermined times before (t = 0 hours) and after treatment administration (t = 0.5, 1.5, 3, and 6 hours). Measurements of the TFWT were obtained with a test box equipped with a thermal perch, which delivered a gradually increasing temperature 40-62°C (104-143.6°F) to the right plantar surface of the owl's foot. Compared with controls, hydromorphone at 0.3 mg/kg dose resulted in significantly higher mean TFWT at 0.5 hours (P < 0.001), 1.5 hours (P = 0.003), and 3 hours (P = 0.005), whereas the 0.6 mg/kg dose resulted in significantly higher mean TFWT from 0.5 hours (P = 0.035) to 1.5 hours (P = 0.001). Both hydromorphone doses were associated with a significant change in the agitation-sedation score (P = 0.001), consistent with mild to moderate sedation. Two owls were observed tremoring after administration of the 0.6 mg/kg dose, which was not noted after the 0.5-hour timepoint; no other adverse effects were identified. This study offers scientific evidence to support the use of a μ-opioid agonist in great horned owls for pain management. Pharmacokinetics and other pharmacodynamic studies of other pain models evaluating hydromorphone and other opioid drugs in this species are still needed. © 2023 Association of Avian Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Background: The paper presents the results of studies on the distribution of the parasitic quill mite species Bubophilus aluconis (Acariformes: Syringophilidae) in the feather quills of the Western Palaearctic owls of the genus Strix, that is, tawny owl S. aluco, collected in Poland and Sweden, the Ural owl S. uralensis, from Poland, Sweden, and Finland, and the great grey owl S. nebulosa, from Sweden and Finland. The two latter species are new hosts for B. aluconis. Methods: Feather samples of the tawny owl, Ural owl, and great grey owl used in this study come from Prof. Marian Cieślak’s private collection, which contains feathers of Western Palearctic birds of prey and owls. Each of the 77 tawny owl, 75 Ural owl, and 55 great grey owl specimens are represented either by whole dry wings or a full complement of flight feathers (primaries (P) and secondaries (S)) and tails (rectrices (R)). Particular types of feathers were coded as follows: Ps, Ss, R, primary greater upperwing coverts (PGUppC), secondary greater upperwing coverts (SGUppC), primary greater underwing coverts (PGUndrC), secondary greater underwing coverts (SGUndrC), uppertail coverts (UppTC), and undertail coverts (UndrTC). Results: The prevalence was relatively low for all of the examined birds, that is, 12% for S. uralensis (N = 79), 2.6% for S. aluco (N = 77), and 3.6% for S. nebulosa (N = 55). In total, we examined 37,260 flight feathers and coverts. The mite B. aluconis occupied only the inner S of the tawny owl, secondary greater under and upperwing coverts of the great grey owl, and inner Ss, primary and secondary upperwing coverts, UndrTC, and coverts from the scapulars of the Ural owl. Conclusion: We hypothesise that the absence of these parasites in the examined P, S, and R suggests that these feather types might be unsuitable for the mites due to their thick quill walls, preventing successful feeding. © 2024 Zbigniew Kwieciński et al.

ABSTRACT: Invasive predators can alter ecosystem function and be detrimental to native wildlife by direct predation and through exploitative and interference competition. Barred owls (Strix varia), a native species in eastern North America, have expanded their range to Pacific Northwest forests, threatening native owls and community dynamics. The western screech-owl (Megascops kennicottii) is a species of conservation concern, and the apparent population decline coincides with the arrival of barred owls. We collected data in 2021 under a broad scale passive acoustic monitoring program at 2482 stations in nine study areas to evaluate western screech-owl distribution and potential threats to population persistence in the Pacific Northwest. We fitted single-species occupancy models to estimate barred owl and western screech-owl landscape use and identify important features of habitat. We quantified effects of barred owls on western screech-owl occupancy and detection probability using co-occurrence models. Barred owls used approximately 0.79 (95 % confidence interval: 0.72, 0.85) of our sampling locations. Western screech-owl occupancy and weekly detection varied by study area from 0.24 (0.15, 0.34) to 0.92 (0.89, 0.95) and 0.12 (0.08, 0.16) to 0.71 (0.69, 0.74), respectively. Western screech-owl detection dropped slightly from 0.36 (0.31, 0.41) to 0.29 (0.26, 0.33) where barred owls were present. Western screech-owls frequently occupied sites used by barred owls but occurred less in older forests where barred owls were present, suggesting they may experience higher predation risk in older forests. Western screech-owls may be unable to avoid habitat used by ubiquitous barred owls, but they may adapt behaviorally to avoid this invasive predator. © 2023

ABSTRACT: The niche divergence hypothesis proposes that the evolution and maintenance of colour polymorphism is based on a mechanism of disruptive selection. In a trophic context, the hypothesis predicts that individuals differing in colour vary in their trophic niche, either because they differ in foraging efficiency or feed in different habitats. A major evolutionary conundrum is how these expectations are affected by variation in trophic quality. Using an owl species with colour plumage polymorphism, the Eurasian scops owl Otus scops, we examined diet and habitat segregation during reproduction in relation to plumage colouration and trophic quality. Intensive sampling revealed that trophic quality for scops owls (i.e. abundance of grasshoppers and locusts) varied more among territories than between years, but scops owls did not segregate among territories of different quality by their colouration. However, we found that sex, plumage colouration and territory differences in trophic quality explained differences in the degree of dietary specialization. Brownish males delivered a higher diversity of prey to the nest than greyish ones in high trophic quality territories. We also found that the more diverse the diet provided by males, the heavier the owlets at fledging. Our study provides evidence for a different sensitivity to trophic quality of the colour morphs with potential fitness consequences in scops owls. We highlight the importance of studying the mechanisms leading to the persistence of colour polymorphism in patchy environments, since segregation may pass otherwise unnoticed if only habitats or years with similar conditions are considered. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: This study aims to report the clinical signs, therapeutic strategy, necropsy results, and histopathological findings of airsacculitis caused by enterobacteria and the occurrence of eggs from the superfamily Diplotriaenoidea in the feces of Megascops choliba in the Amazon biome. A tropical screech owl nestling was rescued and admitted for hand-rearing. The animal was kept hospitalized for five months. It was fed a diet based on Zophobas morio larvae and thawed chicken breast meat with vitamin and mineral supplements. On the 37th day of hacking training for release, the owl showed weakness, lack of appetite, regurgitation, cachexia, dyspnea, ruffled feathers, dry droppings in the vent and pericloaca, and diarrhea. The parasitological examination showed eggs of the Diplotriaenoidea superfamily in the feces. The therapy employed included oxytetracycline, sulfamethoxazole, mebendazole, Potenay, sodium chloride 0.9%, and Mercepton. However, five days after starting the treatment, the bird died. Upon necropsy, prominence of the keel, pieces of undigested food in the oral cavity and proventriculus, intestinal gas, and thickened and turbid air sacs were found. The microbiological analysis of air sacs identified Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes. Histopathological examination showed heterophilic bacterial airsacculitis. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Ocular anatomy may differ between species. In study design, it was aimed to create reference values by evaluating the anatomical formations of adult eagle owls with healthy eyes. The study materials consisted of 12 healthy eyes of 6 owl eagle birds brought to our hospital for non-ocular problems. The anterior and posterior eye segments were evaluated with the biomicroscopic examination, Schirmer tear test, color fundus photography, orbital ultrasonography, optical biometry, and keratometry without anesthesia. Anterior chamber deep (ACD), horizontal visible iris diameter (HVID), pupil diameter (PD), and base curve were topographically measured. Axial globe length (AGL), central corneal thickness (CCT), and lens power (LP) were measured. The optic disc, tapetal, non-tapetal region, retina, and choroid were evaluated with fundoscopic examination. Intraocular pressure (IOP) values were also recorded as average values and standard error. ACD 3.21±0.01 mm, HVID 9.02±0.004 mm, PD 7.97±0.10 mm, AGL 31.108±0.1773 mm, CCT 207.83± 0.50 µm, LP 16.5 Dioptri, IOP 13.817±0.2 mmHg, horizontal corneal diameter (HCD) 13.57±0.09 mm, a vertical corneal diameter (VCD) 13.20± 0.14 mm and the mean of basic curve (BC) was found as 10.93±0.10 mm. In conclusion, it is thought that it will be possible to detect more easily pathological conditions of eagle owl birds brought to veterinary clinics with eye or vision problems with reference values presented in this study, and the data obtained from the study will contribute to clinical practice. © 2024, Veteriner Fakultesi Dergisi.

ABSTRACT: In 2022, the trematode Plagiorchis noblei was isolated from a Horned owl (Asio otus) in Shahrekord city. This trematode was isolated from the small intestine of the Horned owl. The trematode was fixed on a microscope slide and stained with Carmine acid. Then the sample was examined with a stereomicroscope and identified with the available diagnostic keys. Studies showed that this trematode belongs to the species Plagiorchis noblei. This parasite belongs to the Plagiorchiidae family, but so far this parasite has not been observed in owls in Shahrekord city. This parasite belongs to the Digenea order, which causes lung, digestive, liver and blood diseases in birds and other vertebrates. COPYRIGHTS ©2022 The author(s).

ABSTRACT: Wildfire has been an important force in shaping biological diversity in forests of western North America. Patterns of reburning helped to maintain heterogenous landscapes with low tree densities that naturally limited the extent of severe stand-replacing fires. However, anthropogenic impacts over the past two centuries have dramatically altered fire activity and its ecological function, creating conditions that promote large and intense fires with no historical analog. Fuels reduction treatments represent proven methods to mitigate extreme fire events, but there is controversy over their potential effects to sensitive wildlife species. The California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) is a forest species that evolved under a frequent-fire regime. Controversy over how spotted owls may be impacted by fuels reduction is one of numerous contributing factors that has limited the pace and scale of implementation. To examine the relationships between spotted owls and fuels reduction treatments, we studied breeding season nocturnal foraging habitat selection related to fuel structural metrics of 159 GPS-tagged California spotted owls across the Sierra Nevada bioregion. Spotted owls selected for higher canopy base height, lower ladder fuel density, and lower canopy bulk density, which represent synergies between fuels reduction treatments and owl space use. Spotted owls also selected for higher surface fuels and higher canopy layer counts, representing potential trade-offs between fuels reduction goals and spotted owl space use. We overlaid the probability of space use by foraging spotted owls with relative stand density index (SDI), a measure of forest resilience, to classify Sierra Nevada landscapes into four groups: low management priority (low owl use/high forest resilience), fuels reduction priority (low owl use/low forest resilience), potential conflict zones (high owl use/low forest resilience), and habitat retention priority (high owl use/high forest resilience). Fuels reduction priority (34.4%) was the largest category, suggesting that potential impacts of fuels reduction on spotted owl foraging habitat may be less widespread in the Sierra Nevada than previously believed. Our results suggest that fuels reduction treatments, especially those focused on mutually beneficial goals such as increasing canopy base height, reducing ladder fuels, and reducing canopy bulk density may directly improve spotted owl foraging habitat while also mitigating the effects of large and severe wildfires on forest species and forest ecosystems. © 2023

ABSTRACT: The threatened Oenpelli rock python (Nyctophilopython oenpelliensis) is the third largest predator in the Arnhem Land region, and is known to occur in Kakadu National Park and Djelk and Warddeken Indigenous Protected Areas, where it lives in sandstone escarpments. While it is a large apex predator, little is known about this python species, including its habitat or diet, other than it being semi-arboreal and including birds and mammals in its diet. Here we report on a remarkable chance sighting of the Oenpelli rock python eating an adult Rufous owl (Ninox rufa) in a tree at the base of a sandstone scarp. While this species is generally observed at night, other sightings such as this one occurred during the day, suggesting that this species may not be wholly nocturnal but also able to hunt and disperse during the day. Our observations provide some more evidence on the feeding behaviour of this little-known python and may suggest that future surveys need to occur during the day as well as at night. © 2024 Royal Zoological Society of New South Wales.

ABSTRACT: The function of intergroup encounters (IGEs) may differ substantially among species of different group sizes and social organizations. Research in group-living primates has shown that the behavioral responses during IGEs can vary widely from affiliative to neutral or aggressive interactions; still, little is known about IGEs in pair-living taxa. We conducted a systematic literature review to find relevant studies on the functions of IGEs in pair-living nonhuman primates that could inform analyses of IGE data (n = 242 IGEs, 21 groups and 10 solitary individuals, 1997−2020) from wild owl monkeys, a pair-living, monogamous primate with extensive biparental care. We identified 1315 studies published between 1965 and 2021; only 13 of them (n = 10 species) contained raw data on the number of IGEs. Our review of those studies showed that IGEs are common, but highly variable in their nature and characteristics in pair-living primates. To examine the non-mutually exclusive hypotheses of resource-, and mate defense, and infanticide avoidance we analyzed data from the Owl Monkey Project 27-year long database to build first an a priori model set. To incorporate prior knowledge from the literature review, we conducted our analyses as a consecutive series of binomial logistic regressions. All IGEs including all biologically relevant parameters (N = 156) were codified into three different behavioral categories (Reaction, Agonism, and Physical Aggression). The analysis showed that owl monkeys regularly engaged in IGEs, most of which were agonistic. They showed more reaction when infants were present, but reactions were less physically aggressive when infants and pregnant females were involved. Overall, our results lend more support for the infant and mate defense hypotheses than they do for the resource defense one. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: From 2015 to 2022, I studied nest box use, sex ratios, reproductive success, and morphometrics of the Western Screech-Owl (Megascops kennicottii) and Whiskered Screech-Owl (M. trichopsis) in southeastern Arizona. The Whiskered Screech-Owl in particular is at the extreme northern end of its distribution in the southwestern United States, with past research suggesting that it does not readily use nest boxes. Both screech-owls occurred in the study area in unknown densities but nest box use was higher with the Whiskered Screech-Owl. The Whiskered Screech-Owl nestling sex ratio varied but averaged about equal, with the mean number of male to female nestlings per brood being 1.11M:1.22F. Nest success was high for both species. Recapture data suggest that juveniles disperse outside of the study area and adults maintain site fidelity. Fourteen adult Whiskered Screech-Owls and 23 nestlings along with 9 adult Western Screech-Owls and 7 nestlings were banded over the course of this study. © 2023 Wilson Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Capsule: Small mammal abundance was greatest in landscapes with a high coverage of grassy field margins, which was also associated with increased fledging success of Barn Owls. Aims: To determine the potential value of agri-environment scheme (AES) habitats for small mammals and, in turn, predatory Barn Owls. Methods: Monitoring of small mammals was conducted across 14 1-km2 British National Grid squares. Survey squares were selected according to a known distribution of Barn Owls derived from monitoring during 2018–2020. We analysed relationships between small mammal activity and coverage of grass-dominated field margins, floristic margins, hedgerows, and tree lines. Barn Owl nest box occupancy in 2021 was analysed in relation to prey abundance (small mammal activity) and the described habitat types. Barn Owl fledging success was then modelled in relation to the prey abundance and the coverage of different habitat types. Results: Our findings suggest that grass field margin habitats are among the AES options most likely to be of value to Barn Owls, as positive relationships with fledging success and prey species were identified. This research is important in providing evidence to support continued implementation and valuing of grass margins under future versions of AES. Conclusion: The study findings suggest that breeding Barn Owls benefit from the provision of grassy field margin habitat, more so than those sown with wildflowers. Our findings add to the body of evidence demonstrating the positive relationships between AES and wildlife and support continued implementation of grass margins on arable farmland. © 2024 Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust.

ABSTRACT: Yarquen dolgopolae gen. et sp. nov. is described from fragmentary fossil bones (humerus and phalanges) found in the Middle Miocene Collón Curá Formation (Río Negro Province, Argentina). Fossil owls in Argentina are limited to occasional fragments as old as the Early Miocene to Late Pleistocene. Here, an extinct species is described. The humerus (MLP 92-V-10-86) is similar in size to that of the Short-eared Owl but differs mainly by the depth and arrangement of the fossa m brachialis, the fossa olecrani is shallow and rimless, the sulcus scapulotricipitalis is shallow, a pneumatic foramen located on a scar proximal to the condylus ventralis, the incisura intercondilaris is narrow and the condylus ventralis is rounded with a conspicuous groove running caudoventrally. The ungual phalanx of digit 1 shows a strongly curved corpus, lateral grooves on both sides, a processus extensorius dorsally directed, a flexor tubercle wide and robust and a crista slightly protruding that separates both cotylae. Aves recovered from the Collón Curá Formation correspond to diurnal hunters (Phorusrhacidae and Falconidae) to which is added this large owl that, like other Strigidae, presumably was nocturnal or crepuscular hunters. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: It is well known that allowing students to put theory into practice is beneficial to consolidate knowledge and to better memorise the topics that are discussed in class. Furthermore, practical work is a valuable asset to stimulate students’ attention and represents one of the keys to the success of the scientific experience in school. Didactic activities involving owl pellets are common in many English-speaking countries, with owl pellet dissection kits designed for classrooms also available for purchase online. This kind of activity, however, is not common in many other countries, Italy being one of them. In fact, as reported by the tests, none of the students that attended the activities had previously worked with owl pellets, but they were nonetheless particularly fascinated to learn more about the biology and ecology of owls and their preys. The experience was proposed to students that attended the last three years of high school. Students from each cohort carried out different parts of the experience to create an organic flow of three different activities that have been presented to the students during their progression in high school years. Along with the practical work, students were asked to take multiple-answer tests before and after the experiences to evaluate the level of knowledge before and after the laboratory phase. Overall, students responded positively to the project, considering it a valuable supplement of their cultural background. © 2024 Royal Society of Biology.

ABSTRACT: Well-being is a critical element of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals. Given the complexity of the concept of well-being, it follows that its measurement requires complex, multivariate methods that can characterize the physical, economic, social and environmental aspects along with the mental state of a city. Although it is not sufficient to carry out settlement-level analyses to make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. It is necessary to understand patterns within settlements. This work aims to present how the urban macrostructure of urban well-being indicators can be estimated based on GIS-based multilayer analysis. Open-source data, e.g. road networks, points of interest, green spaces and vegetation, are used to estimate urban well-being parameters such as noise levels, air quality and health-related impacts supplemented by climate models to assess urban resilience and sustainability. The proposed methodology integrates 24 models into six categories, namely walkability, environment, health, society, climate change and safety, which are weighted based on a multilevel Principal Component Analysis to minimize information loss for aggregated composite indicators. The study revealed two main components of the macrostructure related to well-being in the studied city: one related to the geometrical features and the other can be derived from the structure of the natural environment. In Veszprém a natural restoration of the detached house area, industrial area and downtown is recommended including developments with green and blue infrastructural elements and nature-based solutions. © 2023 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: In recent years, passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) has become one of the main tools for natural history and behavior studies in nocturnal birds. In this study, we explored the Black-banded owl (Strix huhula huhula) vocal activity in the Yungas Andean forests from northwestern Argentina, using one autonomous recording unit from September 2017 to February 2018. We found higher vocal activity on nights with high lunar illumination (76–100%), mainly concentrated during the early night: between 22:00–23:00 h; approximately 1–2 hours after sunset. This study shows the first acoustic phenology pattern of the black-banded owl during a year-round survey with the use of PAM in the Yungas. We highlight the importance of this type of research to gain knowledge on the vocal behavior of Neotropical nocturnal birds. Additionally we highlight the necessity of incorporating PAM, combined with occupation models, to evaluate the population status of threatened nocturnal bird species. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: The American barn owl is a nocturnal bird of prey in which hind limb movements are a key factor in obtaining food; however, the architectural properties of its hind limb muscles have not been studied. This study sought to identify functional trends in the Tyto furcata hindlimb muscles by studying muscular architecture. The architectural parameters of the selected hip, knee, ankle, and digit muscles were studied in three specimens of the Tyto furcata and joint muscular proportions with an additional dataset were calculated. Previously published information on Asio otus was used for comparison. The flexor muscles of the digits had the highest muscle mass. Regarding architectural parameters, the main flexor of the digits (flexor digitorum longus) and the muscles that extend the knee and ankle joints (femorotibialis and gastrocnemius) showed a high physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) and short fibers, allowing powerful digit flexion and knee and ankle extension. These mentioned features are in accordance with hunting behavior, in which prey capture is not only closely linked to the flexion of the digits but also to the movements of the ankle. During hunting, the distal hind limb is flexed and then fully extended at the moment of contact with the prey, whereas the digits are close to grasping the prey. The hip muscles showed a predominance of extensors over flexors, which were more massive, with parallel fibers and without tendons or short fibers. These features lead to a higher capacity to generate velocity to the detriment of forces, as indicated by the high values of the architectural index, their relatively low PCSA, and short or intermediate fiber length, which enhance the control of the joint positions and muscle length. Compared to Asio otus, Tyto furcata showed longer fibers; however, the relationship between fiber length and PCSA was similar for both species. © 2023 American Association for Anatomy.

ABSTRACT: Nocturnal mammals have unique sensory adaptations to facilitate foraging at night. Owl monkeys (Aotus spp.) are pair-living nocturnal platyrrhines adept at capturing insect prey under low-light conditions. Owl monkeys use acoustic and chemical cues in intraspecific communication and use olfaction to detect fruit as they forage. We conducted an experiment to determine which cues (auditory, olfactory, and visual) Aotus nancymaae rely upon when foraging for insects. We scored the behavior of 23 captive owl monkeys during a series of trials in which monkeys were provided sensory boxes with insect cues either present (experimental box) or absent (control box). Each cue was tested alone and in combination with all other cues (multimodal cues). We used generalized linear mixed models to determine which cues elicited the greatest behavioral response. Owl monkeys approached and spent more time near experimental boxes than control boxes. Male owl monkeys were quicker than their female partners to approach the sensory boxes, suggesting that males may be less neophobic than females. The owl monkeys exhibited behaviors associated with olfaction and foraging (e.g., sneezing, trilling) during trials with multimodal cues and when only olfactory cues were present. When only visual or auditory cues were present, owl monkeys exhibited fewer foraging-related behaviors. After approaching a sensory box, however, they often touched boxes containing visual cues. A. nancymaae may rely on olfactory cues at night to detect a food source from several meters away and then rely more on visual cues once they are closer to the food source. Their use of sensory cues during insect foraging differs from nocturnal strepsirrhines, possibly reflecting physiological constraints associated with phylogeny, given that owl monkeys evolved nocturnality secondarily from a more recent diurnal ancestor. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

ABSTRACT: Little Owl (Athene noctua Scop., 1769) is common and widespread throughout Bulgaria, inhabiting various habitats, including farmland, orchards, villages, and urban areas. In recent years, its population has declined in almost all of Europe. The present study revealed an average Little Owl population density of about 0.05 breeding pairs/km2 in Bulgaria. Its density varies depending on the region. The species is more abundant in the lowlands of northern Bulgaria, where the density can reach up to 0.07 breeding pairs/km2, while in the mountains, the density is lower, with only 0.03 breeding pairs/km2 in some areas. The Little Owl population in Bulgaria declined between 2007 and 2016 by 30 %. The main factor in Bulgaria for the decrease in numbers is the construction of new buildings or the renovation of old ones. Among the factors negatively influencing the species’ population are habitat loss and fragmentation, changes in agricultural practices, and changes in prey availability. The places where they nest or roost depend on human presence. In particular, converting traditional farmland to intensive monoculture has been identified as a potential threat to the Little Owl population in some regions of Bulgaria. © NWJZ, Oradea, Romania, 2024

ABSTRACT: Predator–prey interactions can be profoundly influenced by vegetation conditions, particularly when predator and prey prefer different habitats. Although such interactions have proven challenging to study for small and cryptic predators, recent methodological advances substantially improve opportunities for understanding how vegetation influences prey acquisition and strengthen conservation planning for this group. The California Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) is well known as an old-forest species of conservation concern, but whose primary prey in many regions—woodrats (Neotoma spp.)—occurs in a broad range of vegetation conditions. Here, we used high-resolution GPS tracking coupled with nest video monitoring to test the hypothesis that prey capture rates vary as a function of vegetation structure and heterogeneity, with emergent, reproductive consequences for Spotted Owls in Southern California. Foraging owls were more successful capturing prey, including woodrats, in taller multilayered forests, in areas with higher heterogeneity in vegetation types, and near forest-chapparal edges. Consistent with these findings, Spotted Owls delivered prey items more frequently to nests in territories with greater heterogeneity in vegetation types and delivered prey biomass at a higher rate in territories with more forest-chaparral edge. Spotted Owls had higher reproductive success in territories with higher mean canopy cover, taller trees, and more shrubby vegetation. Collectively, our results provide additional and compelling evidence that a mosaic of large tree forest with complex canopy and shrubby vegetation increases access to prey with potential reproductive benefits to Spotted Owls in landscapes where woodrats are a primary prey item. We suggest that forest management activities that enhance forest structure and vegetation heterogeneity could help curb declining Spotted Owl populations while promoting resilient ecosystems in some regions.

ABSTRACT: Reporting new occurrence records of organisms is key to overcome the Wallacean shortfall. Here, we report the first sighting of a Burrowing Owl, Athene cunicularia (Molina, 1782), overwintering on a peninsula in the Tennessee River in Tennessee, USA, during boreal winters 2020–2022. Pellets from this bird showed combina-tion of six species. This is the first record for the species in the Interior Plateau of the USA. Conditions supporting this bird and evidence of it overwintering bear to explore the environmental conditions that support this species in novel areas. © The authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Meloxicam is used widely for exotic animal analgesia, but its toxicity in common raptor species in Thailand is unclear. Objectives: This study evaluated the single-dose effect of intramuscular meloxicam in common raptor species in Thailand for short-term and long-term periods. Methods: Twenty-two raptors were administered a single 1 mg/kg dose of meloxicam individually via intramuscular injection. The following were evaluated: clinical appearance, body weight, body condition score, body temperature, fecal appearance, complete blood cell count, and biochemistry panel before (day 0) and after the injection (1, 7, and 30 days). The collected samples were categorized into three groups: Brahminy kite (Haliastur indus) (n = 10), adult Barn owl (Tyto javanica) (n = 4), and juvenile Barn owl (n = 8). Results: None of the raptors in the study groups showed any abnormalities. The hematological profiles were significantly different in the short-term period (day 1 and day 7). The creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatinine kinase increased in several groups. On the other hand, the packed cell volume decreased in the Brahminy kite and juvenile Barn owl groups. According to the findings, an intramuscular injection of 1 mg/kg meloxicam affected the blood biochemistry panel of the muscle, but the affected raptors recovered within one week. Conclusions: An intramuscular injection of meloxicam at a single 1 mg/kg dose in Brahminy kites and Barn owls was not associated with the morbidity, hepatotoxicity, gastrointestinal toxicity, and nephrotoxicity in the short and long-term periods. © 2023 The Korean Society of Veterinary Science

ABSTRACT: Human-caused disturbances are encroaching on natural areas and quantifying the relative effects of different types of disturbance, and whether they interact on a landscape to create additive or synergistic cumulative effects, will provide a better understanding of how wildlife are affected. We evaluated potential cumulative effects of industrial disturbance on habitat use of Barred Owls (Strix varia), Great Horned Owls (Bubo virginianus), and Boreal Owls (Aegolius funereus) in Alberta’s boreal forest using acoustic survey presence/absence data and boosted regression tree analysis to quantify the relative importance and interactions of different types of industrial disturbance, as well as forest age and composition. Barred Owls were more likely to be found in older mixedwood and deciduous forest, and we found evidence suggestive of cumulative effects from a negative effect of total human footprint on habitat use and an additional negative effect of roads. Great Horned Owls were found in older forest but were relatively tolerant of disturbance, and soft linear features (seismic lines, pipelines, transmission lines) had a positive effect on habitat use, possibly due to these types of disturbances creating suitable hunting habitat. Boreal Owls were more likely to be found in older coniferous forest, and the effects of disturbance did not show clear evidence of sensitivity or tolerance to human disturbance. Our results indicate the importance of forest age and composition on habitat use for these owls. Cumulative effects varied among owl species and were potentially more significant for Barred Owl; for the other two species the effects of industrial disturbance were relatively small and there was no evidence of cumulative effects. Our study also demonstrates that assessing cumulative effects of human disturbance on wildlife using boosted-regression trees can effectively help focus conservation efforts and can be used, for example, for evaluating the environment effects of new projects prior to their implementation. © 2023 by the author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: Dry mixed-conifer forests of the southwestern United States are experiencing rapid, anthropogenically driven fire regime change. Prior to the Euro-American settlement, most of these forests experienced frequent surface fires but are now vulnerable to uncharacteristically large, high-severity fires. Fire directly influences the structure and composition of these forests and, in turn, the wildlife that inhabit them. Changing fire regimes result in a certain decline of some species and uncertain consequences for others. The Mexican spotted owl (Strix occidentalis lucida) is a federally listed threatened species of particular note in southwestern mixed-conifer forests. High-severity fire is cited as the owl’s primary threat in the revised species recovery plan, but uncertainties surround the impacts of high-severity fire on the habitat of the threatened owl, particularly across a timeframe longer than a few years. Our objective was to explore the long-term (100-year) effects of fire severity on elements of forest structure vital for Mexican spotted owl nesting. We quantified structural attributes for nest/roost habitat across mixed-conifer forests that burned at varying severity levels and time periods in the last century. We then examined the drivers of structural attributes by detecting statistical differences between severity classes and time periods through permutational multivariate analysis of variance. Results: High-severity fire has the strongest deleterious impact on elements of forest structure (total basal area, percent medium tree basal area, percent large tree basal area, large tree density, and canopy cover) vital to Mexican spotted owl nesting, and although the structural differences between severity classes diminish with time, it took ≥ 80–100 years to reach the structural conditions desired for Mexican spotted owl nesting after stand-replacing fires. The most important attribute measured, canopy cover, required 90–100 years after high-severity fires to reach levels most suitable for Mexican spotted owls in the Lincoln National Forest. Conclusions: As fires increase in frequency, severity, and size compared to the last century, the Lincoln National Forest is projected to face an overall decrease in the structural conditions needed for Mexican spotted owl nesting habitat in this region. Short intervals between uncharacteristically high-severity fires in particular pose an imminent threat to nesting habitat. © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: In the semiarid Espinal ecoregion from central Argentina, deforestation has produced a large retraction of native forests and an accelerated process of fragmentation. Here we assess the effects of forest fragmentation within an agricultural matrix on the presence of two forest owls: the Ferruginous pygmy-owl (Glaucidium brasilianum) and the Tropical screech-owl (Megascops choliba). We searched for the species in fragments of different sizes and at different distances from large-continuous forest tracts. We detected one or both species at 43% of the 84 surveyed points. The Tropical Screech Owl was detected at 13 points, the Ferruginous Pygmy Owl was detected at 14 points, and both species were detected at 9 points. For the Ferruginous pygmy-owl, the area of the fragment where the point registration was made was the only variable associated with its presence. The model for Tropical Screech-Owl indicated that the variable that best explained its presence was the distance to the nearest forest fragment. For both species the association was negative. Our results suggest that despite being generalist and widely distributed species, both owls were negatively affected by the fragmentation process, highlighting the importance of the preservation of forest remnants and their connectivity. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The northern hawk owl is a real irruptive species that respond to irregular changes in the food supply. When prey levels are adequate, it breeds and winters within northern forests. Decreased prey availability can start winter invasions, the timing and magnitude of which are the subject of this study. Mainly the citizen data were extracted from the national bird websites to obtain data on the number of northern hawk owls observed in 2010-22. This paper demonstrates that through citizen data large amounts of information can be collected over wide areas, entire Europe in this case. From Finland to Poland and Czechia the invasions years were very similar, 2013-14, 2017-18 and 2021-22 but in Sweden and Norway three clear irruption years were a year or two before. In Denmark, the clear invasions years were 2013-14, 2016-17 and 2019-20 but Poland, peak years were not at all as clear as in the other countries. The invasions started earliest in Finland in September and peaked in November. In Estonia and Latvia peaks occurred from November to January. In Poland, irruption peaked a month later in December but continued until April like in Finland, Estonia and Latvia. The origin of the irrupting owls in the region has been debated. In Norway, authors are convinced that owls originate from Fennoscandia but this paper indicates that mass invasions have to originate from northern Russia. However, only in Denmark there was one Russian northern hawk owl ring recovery. Further ring recoveries and preferably GPS tagging and satellite tracking of the northern hawk owls are awaited to have a better picture of invasion movements and future conservation needs.  © 2023 Heimo Mikkola et al., published by Sciendo.

ABSTRACT: The knowledge about the mortality rate of offspring is crucial for estimating bird population dynamics and conserving species with declining populations. Parents of predatory birds provide food for their offspring during the post-fledging dependency period, which is frequently described as essential due to inexpert flying skills. Using radio telemetry, we studied fledglings’ probability of dying by starvation and predation in Tengmalms’ owls (Aegolius funereus). Nestlings (21 and 39) from 10 and 14 broods in 2019 and 2021, respectively, were equipped with leg-mounted tags and monitored throughout the post-fledging dependency period in west-central Finland. In total, 28 out of 60 fledglings did not survive the post-fledging dependency period (12 died due to starvation, and 16 were predated). The fledglings’ probability of dying by starvation and predation was 3.7 and 2.4 times higher, respectively, in the decreasing (2019) than during the increasing (2021) abundance of main foods (voles), showing that prey availability is essential for survival during the post-fledging dependency period. The probability of starvation increased with augmenting agricultural lands in the home range and increasing precipitation after fledging, which indicated that parent owls avoided hunting in open areas and during rainy nights. The predation rate during the post-fledging dependency period increased with augmenting cover of old-growth forests in the home range. This result suggested that coverage of old-growth forests is nowadays so small in the study area that they act as ecological traps for newly-fledged owlets. The reason is that the main avian enemies of Tengmalm’s owls’ (goshawks and Ural owls) also prefer old-growth forests for breeding and hunting.

ABSTRACT: Eating owl pellets by non-predator vertebrates is a rare and difficult-to-prove food chain relationship. In this paper, I reported the first record of a Spur-thighed Tortoise (Testudo graeca) eating a Eurasian Eagle-Owl (Bubo bubo) pellet with remains of a right Wood Pigeon (Columba palumbus) wing. Scavenging of food remains around owl nests by young tortoises may possibly explain the few cases of tortoise-eating Eurasian Eagle-Owls.  © 2023 Boyan Milchev, published by Sciendo.

ABSTRACT: The Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus) inhabits myriad habitats throughout the Americas and shows complex patterns of individual and geographic morphological variation. The owl family Strigidae is known to follow ecogeographic rules, such as Gloger’s rule. Although untested at the species level, these ecogeographic rules may affect B. virginianus plumage coloration and body size. Previous studies have indicated that, despite this species’ morphological variability, little genetic differentiation exists across parts of their range. This study uses reduced representation genome-wide nuclear and complete mitochondrial DNA sequence data to assess range-wide relationships among B. virginianus populations and the disputed species status of B. v. magellanicus (Magellanic or Lesser Horned Owl) of the central and southern Andes. We found shallow phylogenetic relationships generally structured latitudinally to the north of the central Andes, and a deep divergence between a southern and northern clade close to the Marañón Valley in the central Andes, a common biogeographic barrier. We identify evidence of gene flow between B. v. magellanicus and other subspecies based on mitonuclear discordance and F-branch statistics. Overall differences in morphology, plumage coloration, voice, and genomic divergence support species status for B. v. magellanicus. © 2023 PeerJ Inc.. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The little owl (Athene noctua) is a common raptor in Mediterranean habitats. To acquire more information on its diet, this study identified cranial and post-cranial skeletal material from 70 owl pellets collected during the 2016 and 2017 breeding seasons. The material was used to quantify the little owl's relative prey abundance using MNI (minimum number of individuals), a taphonomical unit. This study is the first to examine the diet of the little owl in the Peloponnese (southern Greece). After examining 3,691 isolated skeletal and exoskeletal remains from the processed pellets, a total of 78 and 108 prey items were recorded for the two consecutive years. This study, in congruence with previous research, showed that in both years the little owl favoured primarily small mammals and arthropods, with a clear predominance of Thomas's pine vole (Microtus thomasi) and arthropods from the class Diplopoda. Finally, a redundancy discriminant analysis (RDA) was applied to our two-year results, along with those from similar studies in the Mediterranean region, to examine the relationship between habitat types and prey taxa, which supported the little owl's opportunistic feeding behaviour, depending on variation of ecological factors.  © 2022 Maria Kolendrianou et al.

ABSTRACT: We analyzed 1209 fragments of reptile bones found in pellets of Tyto furcata to report the species composing the owl’s diet. The pellets were collected in an abandoned house at the Parque Nacional da Restinga de Jurubatiba (PARNA Jurubatiba), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The fragments were identified at the species level through comparisons with literature data and specimens deposited in the herpetological collection of Museu Nacional, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (MNRJ). We identified three lizard species among the fragments: two diurnal (Gymnodactylus darwinii and Tropidurus torquatus) and one nocturnal (Hemidactylus mabouia). We argue that the barn owl might not have a strictly nocturnal activity period, as commonly stated in most studies focused on this species. This represents the first effort to identify reptile species on the diet of Tyto furcata, based on its pellets, being the first record of predation of these three lizard species by T. furcata. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Sociedade Brasileira de Ornitologia.

ABSTRACT: Over the last four decades, Barred Owls (Strix varia) have expanded their range to include much of western North America, including California. This expansion is suspected to have contributed to declining populations of a closely related species, the federally threatened Northern Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis caurina). As a result, understanding potential health threats to Barred Owls has implications for Spotted Owl health and recovery. From 2016 to 2020, 69 Barred Owls were collected to determine the apparent prevalence of periorbital nematode infection, to identify the parasite species present, and to investigate the potential pathologic effects on their hosts. The nematodes were morphologically identified as Oxyspirura and Aprocta spp. On the basis of phylogenetic analyses, they were clearly divergent from published sequences of other species within these genera. Overall, 34 (49%) Barred Owls were infected with periorbital nematodes, with Oxyspirura sp. infections being much more common (94%) than Aprocta sp. (18%). Histopathology revealed varying severity of conjunctivitis in infected owls. Despite the frequency of infection and subsequent inflammation, parasite burden was not associated with reduced body weight in these owls. As a result, the potential health effect of these nematodes is unclear. Further taxonomic characterization is needed to determine potential novelty of these nematodes. © Wildlife Disease Association 2023.

ABSTRACT: Feet and talons are the most specialized predatory attributes of raptor morphology. As such, the hindlimb morphology of owls should reflect their dietary specialization. Owls' diet varies widely between species with only a subset of owl species preying predominantly on small mammals. We hypothesize that different owl species have varied hindlimb morphology, adapted to their main prey types, and that only dietary specialists will be distinguishable based on talon morphology (e.g. toe length, talon curvature and thickness, etc.). We used a sample of 63 specimens from 15 owl species to obtain a variety of measurements of hindlimb morphology. We then used a discriminant function analysis to investigate the degree of variation between species and diet groups in terms of their morphological measurements. Our results indicate that talon morphology is linked to prey type in the owl species studied. Insect specialists and small mammal specialists were characterized by a low talon curvature, whereas generalists presented a pronounced talon curvature. Fish specialists presented particularly thick and robust talons, and insect specialists showed lower digit strength than other owl species. These findings could help determine the diet of other owl species, particularly endangered species for which data on diet is often scarce. This study will also be very useful in future studies of the ecology of sympatric species, resource partitioning between species, or between sexes of the same species, and more generally to the evolution of owls. © 2023 Zoological Society of London.

ABSTRACT: As inhabitants of cavities, some owl species benefit from natural processes, different tree compositions and higher volumes of dead wood. We assumed that protected areas would have a positive impact on the owl community. We compared the abundance of calling owls on 22 lines in managed versus protected forests. Here, we recorded the acoustic communication of owls. The composition of the owl community did not differ between areas. However, we found the impact of forest landscape integrity index and altitude on the diversity of owls. Forests in protected areas probably need time to develop natural and heterogeneous habitat structures. The conservation priority should be to increase the integrity of the forests. Our results also confirmed that managed forests can have a high diversity of owls.  © 2023 Vladimír Nemček et al., published by Sciendo.

ABSTRACT: The diet of the Pharaoh eagle owl, Bubo ascalaphus, inhabiting agricultural and natural areas in Saudi Arabia, was studied. Pellet analysis for B. ascalaphus in the agricultural area contained a high percentage (61.3%) of the house mouse, Mus musculus, while pellets collected from natural habitats were void of M. musculus, however, with a high proportion of wild rodents (Meriones crassus (28.6%) and Jaculus loftusi (41.6%). This suggests the importance of this owl as a biological control agent in agricultural areas. © 2023, Instituto Internacional de Ecologia. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: In this study, we analysed the occurrence, nesting, and ringing data spanning 39 years for the Western Barn Owl (Tyto alba) population in Zala County. Data on Barn Owl surveys originate from 166 out of the total of 258 settlements in the county. During the examined period, nesting was recorded in 74 settlements, while an additional 28 locations have confirmed Western Barn Owl presence (pellets, owl sightings). Furthermore, surveys were conducted at least once in an additional 64 locations without any sign of the species. Based on Barn Owl presence and nesting data, preferred locations for the species can be identified at the local and landscape level. Nesting may be occasional in some places, while a few traditional nesting sites, which show nearly continuous occupation over decades, can be considered stable. The results from Zala County are in line with other research, highlighting the continued importance of church buildings for the species' nesting. Maintaining these buildings is essential for the conservation of a stable population. Given the decreasing number of accessible churches, there is a need for providing alternative nesting sites. In addition to building closures, the future doubling of the length of motorways in the county will pose another significant threat to the regional population.  © 2023 Ákos Klein et al., published by Sciendo.

ABSTRACT: Bird irruptions are thought to be triggered by low food availability in breeding areas, thereby causing emigration (push factor). However, few studies have tested whether emigrating individuals are drawn towards areas of high food availability (pull factor). The Northern hawk owl (Surnia ulula), a rodent specialist, occurs irruptively to southern parts of Fennoscandia. We analysed whether irruption size during 1980–2020 in southeastern Norway was related to rodent abundance at four sites 450–990 km to the north-northeast (potential source areas) and at two sites in southeastern Norway to test push and pull dynamics of irruptions. Irruptions occurred when rodent abundance in potential source areas were low, supporting the push hypothesis. High rodent abundance in potential source areas 1–2 years before irruptions suggested that irruptions were preceded by high reproduction. Upon arrival to southeastern Norway, hawk owls did not encounter high rodent abundance in their main habitat (boreal forest). However, hawk owls stayed in boreal forest in hills in years with higher microtine rodent abundance, but occurred in farmland areas in the lowlands when microtine rodents were less abundant. Use of lowlands coincided with higher than median numbers of wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) for 87% of the hawk owls settling in the lowlands, thus suggesting support for the pull hypothesis. In conclusion, hawk owl irruptions to southern Fennoscandia were triggered by low food availability in northern areas (push factor), and appeared to be drawn by high food availability in southeastern Norway to some degree (pull factor). © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Information on the dietary niche is an integral and challenging part of conservation planning, and it is essential for understanding the status of a species in biological communities and conservation. In this study, to investigate the diet of little owls Athene noctua (Strigiformes: Strigidae) in northeastern Iran's Khorasan Razavi Province, a total of 402 pellets were collected during 2019-2020. The results indicated that during four seasons, the diets of the studied little owls (contained: 72.9% rodents, 12% insects, 10.1% eulipotyphla, 2.9% birds, and 2.1% reptiles). Rodents, included Muridae, Dipodidae, and Cricetidae families. Muridae had the highest percentages in the pellets (Mus musculus) and (Meriones sp.) with 48.2% and 33.1% relative abundance, respectively). The percentage of rodents in winter, with 82.8% was superior in comparison to other seasons, and then in autumn with 77.3%, and in spring and summer with 62.9%. Simpson Biodiversity Index was 0.653 for the whole year. Spring and winter had the highest (0.758), and lowest biodiversity index (0.542), respectively. The implication of the results of this study might be in the conservation and management programs, as well. © 2023, Department of Environmental Sciences, Arak University. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: We report a case study of high prey richness of small mammals recorded in Tawny Owl (Strix aluco) pellets from a site of Northern Latium, the highest known for Italy (also after normalization with sample size). We compared our data to a large set of available literature, obtaining a significant correlation between prey species and sample size. However, when controlling for sample size, habitat heterogeneity could explain the high species richness recorded. Our data evidenced a trophic generalism of Tawny Owl in suburban heterogenous landscapes. Nevertheless, we highlighted as only a comparison among normalized data may exclude artifact due to sampling effect. Further research are necessary to test the role of biogeographical factors on small mammal communities as prey, as yet observed for other Strigiformes.. © 2023 Societa Toscana di Scienze Naturali.

ABSTRACT: To our knowledge, this is the first case of concurrent diaphyseal left coracoid and left femoral fractures in a Eurasian eagle owl and its post-release survival in Korea. The femur was surgically repaired using an external skeletal fixator-intramedullary (IM) pin tie-in method, and the coracoid was repaired solely with an IM pin on day 6 after femur surgery. The eagle owl underwent a gradual rehabilitation process. The bird was successfully rehabilitated and released 101 d after initial presentation. The bird was monitored using a wildlife tracking device and was confirmed to have survived for over 5 mon in the wild. © 2023 The Korean Society of Veterinary Science This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

ABSTRACT: The greater horseshoe bat Rhinolophus ferrumequinum is a rare species in the UK that relies heavily on undisturbed stone buildings in which to breed. Barn owls Tyto alba are also a protected species that roost and raise their broods in similar places. This overlap in roosting requirements can lead to barn owls moving into buildings containing well-established greater horseshoe bat maternity colonies. This in turn could result in disturbance and abandonment of the building by the bats. Such an event occurred at one of the largest greater horseshoe bat roosts in the UK in 2018 when the colony deserted the roost after barn owls moved in. We describe measures used to exclude the owls while retaining access for the bats, to encourage the colony to return. The suite of modifications consisted primarily of wooden baffles and smooth surfaces on the entrances and doorways. Monitoring showed that the interventions were effective in excluding barn owls whilst allowing bats to access the building. Exclusion of the owls resulted in the return of the greater horseshoe bat colony in similar numbers to 2017 when owls were absent (2022: 92% of the adults) and breeding resumed (2022: 93% of the juveniles in 2017). This paper is the first to evaluate the before and after effects of protecting a bat roost from disturbance or predation by other species. © 2023, University of Cambridge. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Detectability of morphs in different light environments is one of the mechanisms favoring the persistence of color polymorphism via disruptive selection. This mechanism predicts that different morphs should be more active and successful when light conditions make them more cryptic. In nocturnal birds, no study has analyzed yet whether morphs show a different degree of nocturnality, showing different circadian activity rhythms in relation to night and day light. We analyze activity patterns and hunting efficiency of color morphs in relation to day/night light in the nocturnal polymorphic scops owl (Otus scops). Forty-four percent of owl activity took place in the first hours after sunrise and before sunset. Also, we found that nocturnal activity decreased from grey to brown females and that grey males fed their chicks more than brown ones at night. Visual modeling revealed that grey individuals would be more conspicuous to their prey than brownish ones during the day. These findings suggest that part of the activity of nocturnal scops owls may occur during the day and that grey individuals would be better adapted to forage during night-light than brownish ones. However, brown morphs seemed not to be better adapted to forage at day, suggesting that other mechanisms than visual detection by predators or prey contribute to the persistence of color polymorphism in the species. Significance statement: Circadian activity patterns can vary intraspecifically in response to changing environmental conditions. Color variants in polymorphic species could change their circadian activity rhythms differently in relation to diel luminal variation, switching from nocturnality to diurnality or vice versa, to achieve better background matching. We study for the first time whether different color variants of the nocturnal polymorphic scops owl (Otus scops) show different circadian activity rhythms with respect to night and day light conditions by relying on GPS-tracking data and nest video recordings. We also use perceptual visual modeling to study crypsis of morphs during the day. We found that nearly half of the activity of owls took place in the first hours after sunrise and before sunset. Also, we found that grey individuals would be better adapted to forage during night-light than more brownish ones probably due to their poor background matching during the day for the visual system of insects. These results support the idea that in scops owls, color morphs may show different degree of nocturnality to improve their crypsis. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Hemoparasitism is known to vary according to the presence of vectors and hosts, and hematological examination can be a useful tool for early diagnosis in avian medicine, contributing to monitoring and conservation of bird populations. In this context, we aimed to analyze the clinical and hematological aspects of free-ranging owls seized or rescued from the Atlantic Forest biome of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The animals, with or without clinical signs of diseases, were studied regardless of their age, sex, and physical status. Blood samples were collected and complete blood counts were carried out. Five different species were obtained in this study. These species were Megascops choliba (50%), Asio clamator (18.75%), Athene cunicularia (18.75%), Pulsatrix koeniswaldiana (6.25%), and Strix huhula (6.25%). Orphaned birds and traumatic injuries were the causes of admission to the wildlife rehabilitation facility. The search for hemoparasites revealed infection by protozoa of the genera Haemoproteus, Plasmodium, and Trypanosoma. We concluded that hematological findings in seized or rescued owls predominantly suggested the presence of stress or inflammation resulting from post-traumatic situations. The causes of admission were mostly due to human interference, which demonstrates to have a negative impact on the health aspect of owl populations in urban centers, such as Rio de Janeiro. Blood protozoa are circulating among the different populations of owls and although infection by Haemoproteus spp. and Trypanosoma spp. seems to trigger a low pathogenic potential, Plasmodium infection may indicate unfavorable prognosis, endangering wild species. © 2023, University Federal de Uberlandia.

ABSTRACT: Only four of 40 animals had measurable asymmetric dimethyl arginine (ADMA) levels. The young primate had the lowest value (53.4 ng/ml) when compared with the two adults (218.8 ± 9.3 ng/ml) and the elderly one (320.5 ng/ml). The ADMA levels in this study may relate to the echocardiographic abnormalities found, and possible hypertensive individuals. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Context: Understanding habitat dynamics is essential for effective conservation as landscapes rapidly change. In a companion paper in this issue, Shirk et al. (2023) introduced an automated habitat monitoring system using Google Earth Engine and applied this framework to develop a dynamic model of Mexican spotted owl (Strix occidentalis lucida) habitat across the southwestern US from 1986 to 2020. Objectives: We explored the application of this dynamic model of Mexican spotted owl habitat in the context of the species’ ecology. Methods: We evaluated environmental correlates of Mexican spotted owl habitat, assessed potential spatial non-stationarity in habitat selection, estimated long-term trends in habitat by quantifying changes in habitat amount and quality between 1986 and 2020, and evaluated the extent to which habitat changes over the past 35 years have been driven by wildfire. Results: Topography and climate appeared to outweigh reflectance-based (vegetation) metrics in describing Mexican spotted owl habitat and habitat selection was non-stationary across modeling sub-regions. Total habitat area for Mexican spotted owls declined by ~ 21% since 1986 (0.6% annually), but trends varied spatially and some even reversed over the past decade. Wildfire was responsible for between 8 and 35% of total habitat loss, depending on the sub-region considered. Conclusions: The automated habitat monitoring system allowed trend estimation and accurate assessment of current habitat status for Mexican spotted owls; maps were accurate, spatially detailed, and current. The ability to continually produce accurate maps for large land areas for threatened species such as the Mexican spotted owl facilitates science-based land management on public lands in the southwestern US. © 2022, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.

ABSTRACT: Knowing people are willing to protect wildlife when they feel connected with nature, we used owls as a case study to review owl symbolism in Greek history (2900 BC − 2000 AD). For five millennia, Greek civilization thrived and used owls as a dominant symbol in major cultural expressions. Consequently, a broad spectrum of social beliefs evolved towards owls. Until 1500 BC, they were mainly used as decorative attributes. During the Mycenaean era, though, owls began to be worshipped as eerie creatures in funeral rituals, inducing fear and respect. When Greek civilization peaked during the Archaic, Classical and Hellenistic periods, an important shift is noticed in social perceptions. Owls are transformed into major symbols of wisdom, power, justice and divinity, connected to the goddess Athena and the city of Athens. Their significance faded in the subsequent Roman period and was absent throughout the Byzantine era, for 1500 years. When owls reappeared after 1800 AD in cultural aspects of modern Greece, society again considered them fearsome creatures. We finalize our historical review with a recent survey in Greece, capturing up-to-date trends. Our survey indicates that today: (i) owls are mostly considered beneficial and deserving of protection, but part of the population still perceives owls as bad omens, powerful and scary; (ii) elementary concepts of raptors’ importance in ecosystems are still unknown to many; (iii) a small but impactful percentage still deliberately kill house-nesting owls, outlining the need to educate and provide nest-boxes as a relocation solution. By performing a thorough review of historical perceptions toward owls, important insights are offered on how to positively connect people with their wildlife and cultural heritage.

ABSTRACT: Body condition indices and related metrics can help assess habitat quality and other ecological processes, and ideally, these metrics are based on measures of lipids directly extracted from the species of interest. In recent decades, barred owls (Strix varia) have become a species of conservation concern as they invaded older forests of the US Pacific Northwest, and caused population declines of the closely related and federally threatened northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina). A simple and effective measure of barred owl body condition could help to understand how habitat quality varies within their new range, which in turn can inform their management and other aspects of their ecology. Using 77 barred owl carcasses collected during experimental removals in Washington and Oregon, USA, we measured the amount of lipid in each specimen with proximate body composition analysis. We then fit and compared (with adjusted R2 values) alternative linear regression models to estimate the percent lipids in dry mass of the owls based on morphometric body condition indices, a qualitative fat score of subcutaneous breast fat, sex and the time of year females were collected (relative to egg production). Adjusted R2 values for all models ranged from 0.49 to 0.87, with the best model including mass divided by foot-pad length, fat score, sex and the time of year a female was collected. Most models generated comparable estimates of percent lipids at a population level and we provided correction factors to apply these models when used with live barred owls, allowing for site-specific comparisons of body condition among individuals inhabiting a diversity of environmental conditions.  © 2023 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: According to one of the theses of optimal foraging theory, main prey species abundance in the hunting area is the main factor determining the diet and habitat choices of birds of prey. However other factors can also be important. The habitat structure influences the predators' diets as well. In this study we examined the influence of habitat structure on diet compositions of three species of birds: Long-eared Owl (Asio otus), Short-eared Owl (A. flammeus) and Common Kestrel (Falco tinnunculus). The study was carried out from 2007 to 2019 in a 48 ​km2 area of the Crane's Homeland Reserve, Moscow Region, Russia. The habitat structures of model species' hunting territories (ratio of different types of landscape elements) were classified in module “Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin” based on the QGIS. A boosted regression tree analysis identified that the share of the main prey species in the diet is primarily determined by the landscape structure of hunting territories. The largest share of Common Vole (Microtus arvalis) in birds' diet was determined by the shrubs area (15% of hunting area), the meadow area (75%), the habitat heterogeneity (70%) and the arable land area (5%). The same predictors determined the largest share of Root Vole (Microtus oeconomus): the shrubs area 25%, the meadow area 70%, and the arable land area 3%. The annual mean abundance of prey species did not determine their importance in the diet of birds of prey. Thus, the main prey abundance in the hunting area is not a determining factor for the formation of diet composition of birds of prey. © 2022 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The article considers the co-vocalisation of Eagle Owl and other species of owls. The studies were carried out using digital voice recorders in the habitats of the eagle owl. The natural and climatic conditions of the area in which co-vocalisation was noted were analyzed. Rare cases of co-vocalisation of Eagle Owl and its prey, primarily the Ural Owl and the Long-eared Owl, have been identified. Co-vocalisation was revealed only in winter and spring. This is due to the breeding season of birds. The presented study reflects the environmental sustainability of a particular area. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Strong numerical and functional responses of owls to voles in cyclic environments are well known. However, there is insufficient knowledge from the boreonemoral region in particular, with depleted populations of small mammals. In this study, we describe the dynamics of the small mammal population in Latvia from 1991 to 2016 and link them to owl population characteristics. We used food niche breadth, number of fledglings, and population trends to lay out the numerical response of six owl species to dampened small mammal population cycles. We found temporarily increasing food niche breadth in tawny and Ural owls. There were no other responses in the tawny owl, whereas the breeding performance of three forest specialist species—pygmy, Tengmalm’s, and Ural owls—corresponded to the vole crash years in Fennoscandia. Moreover, the populations of forest specialist owls decreased, and the change in the Ural owl population can be attributed to the depletion of small mammal populations. We found evidence of a carry-over effect in the eagle owl arising from a strong correlation of declining breeding performance with the small mammal abundance indices in the previous autumn. We conclude that dampening of the small mammal population cycles is an important covariate of the likely effects of habitat destruction that needs to be investigated further, with stronger responses in more specialized (to prey or habitat) species. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: In this study we investigated the eye morphology and retinal topography of two owl species in relation to their visual environment. Although Short-eared Owl Asio flammeus is larger and weighs more than Japanese Scops Owl Otus semitorques, its eye dimensions (weight, corneal diameter, and axial length) are all smaller than the scops owl's. Owl retinas were examined in Nissl-stained whole-mount preparations. The total number of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) was greater in the Japanese Scops Owl (4,703.0×103 cells) than in the Short-eared Owl (2,346.8×103 cells). The eye morphology of, and the number of RGCs in the Japanese Scops Owl indicate that it is more adapted to a nocturnal habit. An area of high-density RGCs was horizontally distributed in the temporal retina of the Short-eared Owl, with a peak density of 17.4×103 cells/mm2. In the Japanese Scops Owl's temporal retina, there was an oval-shaped arrangement with a peak density of 23.1×103 cells/mm2. These distributions indicate that whereas Short-eared Owl is adapted to open habitats, Japanese Scops Owl is adapted to enclosed habitats. The RGCs of both species were classified into three categories (small, medium, and large) based on the size and appearance of somas. In both species, medium-sized cells predominated, and the proportion of large-sized cells was smallest. The distribution and high-density areas differed among these groups, suggesting adaptation to the visual environment. The high-density areas of these groups cover the nasal visual fields, which include the overlap for binocular vision. © 2023 Ornithological Society of Japan. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Given the rapid pace of urbanization, mitigation translocations are increasingly being used to reduce human-wildlife conflicts, especially to move animals out of the path of land development. Burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia) are commonly subjected to translocations because of their association with flat, open lands that are attractive to development. But outcomes of burrowing owl translocations and the effects they have on their demographic parameters are seldom documented. From 2017–2019, we tracked the fates of 42 resident (non-translocated) burrowing owls and 43 translocated owls using very high frequency radio-telemetry across 4 release sites in southcentral Arizona, USA. Translocations were conducted by Wild At Heart (WAH), a non-profit raptor rehabilitation program, and owls were moved from areas with planned development activities to release sites that contained artificial burrows. Each year, WAH held translocated owls in groups of 6–10 owls with varying male to female ratios in aviaries prior to taking the owls to release sites where the owls stayed in soft-release tents for an acclimation period of 30 days before release. Resident owls were located at or near the 4 release sites. We used the joint live encounter and dead recovery model to evaluate differences in survival and fidelity probabilities between resident (non-translocated) and translocated burrowing owls and to assess factors that influenced these probabilities including sex, year, site, captivity duration, and the number of males in release cohorts for translocated owls. Annual survival was consistently lower for translocated owls (0.35, 95% CI = 0.10, 0.61 and 0.01, 95% CI = 0.00, 0.03 for 2017 and 2018, respectively) compared to resident owls (0.68, 95% CI = 0.45, 0.92 and 0.69, 95% CI = 0.47, 0.90 for 2017 and 2018, respectively). Annual fidelity was lower for translocated owls (0.05, 95% CI = 0.00, 0.15) compared to resident owls (0.79, 95% CI = 0.57, 1.00) in 2018, but fidelity did not differ significantly between translocated (0.54, 95% CI = 0.19, 0.89) and resident owls (0.62, 95% CI = 0.37, 0.87) in 2017. For translocated owls, the number of males in release cohorts negatively affected survival ((Formula presented.) = −0.74, 95% CI = −1.07, −0.40) and fidelity ((Formula presented.) = −0.73, 95% CI = −1.17, −0.29). Our results indicate the need for substantial changes to the current translocation methodology for burrowing owls in Arizona. Breeding season releases that included owl groups and multiple males within cohorts resulted in agonistic interactions, high mortality, and low fidelity. Translocations of this territorial species should be restricted to male-female pairs or single individuals. Earlier releases may allow owls time to become established on release sites prior to the breeding season, which could promote fidelity. We recommend these changes be implemented and evaluated along with an examination of other release methods. © 2022 The Wildlife Society.

ABSTRACT: Abstract. In August 2018 remains of several birds of prey were recorded at one Eagle Owl Bubo bubo eyrie in southeast Romania. Among these, still articulated wings and leg bones of an adult female Booted Eagle Aquila pennata, feathers and several bone fragments of one adult Long-legged Buzzard Buteo rufinus and several individuals of Common Buzzards Buteo buteo were identified. While predation of Eagle Owls on different raptor species is well known, booted Eagles and Long-legged Buzzards are rarely preyed upon. Based on changes that occurred in the overall diet of owls at this particular eyrie, it is hypothesized that a shortage in the main prey species (induced by land use changes in the region) may be the cause of these extraordinary predation events. While predation of Eagle Owls on large diurnal raptors is more an exception than a norm, in areas where threatened diurnal raptors breed, the presence of Eagle Owls may cause conservation concerns/prove to be problematic. © 2023 Polish Academy of Sciences.

ABSTRACT: Animals constantly respond to stimuli from their surroundings, showing individual behavioral and endocrine differences upon perceived challenging and/or threatening stimuli. The temperament of 13 captive tropical screech owls (Megascops choliba) was defined by performing three challenge tests (novel space, taxidermist predator and trapping) to identify inter-individual differences and their possible relationship with the production of glucocorticoid metabolites (GCM). Feces samples of each bird were taken pre-and-post predator challenge to quantify GCM concentration by means of enzymatic immunoassay (EIA). The intensity of 13 adjectives selected to describe the owls' temperament was determined by three judges during behavioral testing. Only 3 adjectives (passive, vulnerable, and attentive) that showed strong inter-test and intra-individual correlation coefficients were considered. These adjectives were later grouped in a single dimension named “shyness”, enabling establishment of individual scores. The temperament of the owls showed correlation to post-predator challenge GCM levels (ρ = 0.79; p < 0.001). However, no significant differences were found in GCM levels before and after predator challenge. Our results both confirm that nocturnal behavior raptorial birds show positive relation between shy temper and adrenal response, and offer the non-invasive herein implemented methods for establishment of new hypotheses that will assess welfare of species kept under human care. © 2023

ABSTRACT: This study investigated the relationship between landscape structure at different distances from the Drava River in South Hungary and the food composition of the Common Barn-owl. Pellets were collected from 15 villages between 2006 and 2008. Based on the CORINE land cover elements, five land use types were determined, and five landscape metrics were calculated to compare land use and landscape structure in the three distance zones. There were significant differences in the Shannon and Simpson diversity of small mammal assemblages between the three areas. A positive relationship was detected between the distance categories and the abundance distribution of the Striped Field Mouse and Field Vole. The relative abundance of the Striped Field Mouse in the diet of Common Barn-owl was influenced by the increase in the mean perimeter/area ratio and the mean of the contiguity index. The value of the trophic level index was negatively influenced by the decrease in crop patches and the increase in pasture and grassland areas, which land use types facilitate the distribution of insectivores. Our results suggest that landscape characteristics influence prey occurrence in hunting areas and the frequency-dependent availability of small mammal prey, which determines the resource utilization of Common Barn-owl. © 2023 Gyozo F.

ABSTRACT: Chronotype is a reflection of an individual’s preference for sleeping, eating and activity times over a 24 h period. Based on these circadian preferences, three chronotype categories have been identified: morning (MC) (lark), intermediate (IC) and evening (EC) (owl). Chronotype categories have been reported to influence dietary habits; subjects with EC are more prone to follow unhealthy diets. In order to better characterize the eating habits of subjects with obesity belonging to three different chronotype categories, we investigated eating speed during the three main meals in a population of subjects with overweight/obesity. For this purpose, we included 81 subjects with overweight/obesity (aged 46.38 ± 16.62 years; BMI 31.48 ± 7.30 kg/m2) in a cross-sectional, observational study. Anthropometric parameters and lifestyle habits were studied. Chronotype score was assessed using the Morningness–Eveningness questionnaire (based on their scores, subjects were categorized as MC, IC or EC). To investigate the duration of main meals, a dietary interview by a qualified nutritionist was conducted. Subjects with MC spend significantly more time on lunch than subjects with EC (p = 0.017) and significantly more time on dinner than subjects with IC (p = 0.041). Furthermore, the chronotype score correlated positively with the minutes spent at lunch (p = 0.001) and dinner (p = 0.055, trend toward statistical significance). EC had a fast eating speed and this, in addition to better characterizing the eating habits of this chronotype category, could also contribute to the risk of developing obesity-related cardiometabolic diseases. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The present investigation was performed to transpire the celiac artery distribution, histological, and histochemical characteristics of the proventriculus in eight adult barn owls (Tyto alba) of both sexes. Six birds were subjected to anatomical investigation of the celiac artery distribution and two owls were used for routine histomorphological techniques. The proventricular length, width, and lumen diameter were measured at 14.18 ± 0.08, 6.46 ± 0.17 and 1.46 ± 0.14 mm, respectively. The celiac artery in barn owl gave off six collateral arteries before its division into right and left branches. The arteria hepatica dextra does not originate from the right celiac division. Unlike other birds, there were left dorsal and left ventral gastric arteries. Histologically, the proventricular wall consisted of main four tunics. The lining epithelium is simple columnar with plicae and sulci. The muscularis mucosa is absent. The submucosal gastric glands were in two rows in the cranial proventricular portion while were arranged in one parallel row in the middle and caudal portions with pear-shaped, oval to round tubuloalveolar lobules. The mucosal folds, tubular mucosal glands, tubuloalveolar lobules, and their mucus secretion in the collecting ducts were positively reacted to PAS and alcian blue stains. The interlobular collagen fibers, elastic fibers, and reticular network were intensely reacted to Masson’s trichrome, Orcein, and Gomori's reticulin stains, respectively. These anatomical and histomorphological features of the barn owl proventriculus were aimed to provide recent data comparable with most species of birds and the presence of diversity that might be attributed to their feeding demeanor. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Quantitatively evaluating and monitoring augmentation efforts are critical for conservation success. We formally evaluated the success of two Western Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia hypugaea) population augmentation programs in Manitoba and British Columbia by assessing survival of breeding adults, fledging success, and return rates of fledglings. Manitoba’s head-starting program holds hatching year (HY) owls taken from the nests of previous captive-released pairs over winter. After being overwintered in human care, the HY owls are released in pairs as second year (SY) owls. British Columbia has a breeding and release program where owls are bred in facilities; their offspring are then held over winter, paired and soft-released in the spring. Both programs soft-release SY pairs that lay clutches in situ and young are referred to as “wild-hatched owls.” We investigated both individual owl and release site characteristics in relation to our success metrics. In Manitoba, breeding season survival averaged 81%, but no factors investigated had a significant effect on survival. In British Columbia, wild-hatched owls returned more than captive released owls (p < 0.001). Determining the causes behind captive-released owls’ reduced rate of return should be a priority for both recovery programs. Fewer owls returned to release sites with more surrounding cropland. Releases should be prioritized at sites with low percentages of cropland. Interestingly, individuals who returned from migration to form pairs and breed had significantly higher reproductive success than captive-released pairs, suggesting effects of survivor-bias or mate choice. By analyzing post-monitoring data, we have identified opportunities for conservation managers to implement modifications to future release protocols. © 2023 by the author(s).

ABSTRACT: Community Reserves, which are Community Conserved Areas, form the majority of the Protected Area Network in northeast India. Because this biodiverse region is threatened by a variety of anthropogenic activities, Community Reserves likely serve as refugia sites for stenotopic, cavity-nesting species such as some owls. To test this hypothesis, we conducted nocturnal surveys in 11 Community Reserves comprised of primary or secondary forest and outside Community Reserves in Meghalaya state, northeast India. We then used nonparametric tests to assess differences in the occurrence of owls among these three categories. We found that on average, occurrence of owls was higher inside Community Reserves. Inside Community Reserves with secondary forests, we found significantly higher occurrence of the Asian Barred Owlet (Glaucidium cuculoides) and Collared Scops-Owl (Otus lettia), while in Community Reserves with primary forest, we found significantly higher occurrence of the Brown Wood-Owl (Strix leptogrammica), a declining old-growth forest specialist. Hence, Community Reserves are serving as sites of refugia for owls in northeast India. However, anthropogenic pressures such as logging, shifting cultivation, and developmental activities threaten the forests of the region. Old-growth forests are also scarce in Meghalaya and were present in only two of the Community Reserves. Therefore, we find it of prime importance to conserve these reserves, especially those containing primary forests, and to allocate more areas as Community Reserves in the region.  © 2023 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The long-eared owl (Asio otus) is a medium-sized owl species that is well-distributed in almost all of the territories in Portugal. Nematodes were found in the oral cavity of a long-eared owl (A. otus) admitted to CRASSA (Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre of Santo André). During a physical exam and stabilization of the bird, five nematodes were collected. The worms were examined and measured under light microscopy, and photos were taken. After a morphological analysis was conducted, all the nematodes (five females) were identified as Synhimantus (Synhimantus) laticeps. Two specimens were subjected to molecular analysis, which confirmed the result. This study provides a combined morphological and genetic approach to S. laticeps. To the authors’ best knowledge, this is the first report including genetic sequencing of S. laticeps in a long-eared owl (A. otus) from Portugal. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: We recorded vocal interaction in the natural environment of an Eurasian Eagle-Owl (Bubo bubo) with canines Gray Wolves (Canis lupus), Red Foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and domestic dogs (Canis familiaris). Vocalization was recorded using Olympus digital voice recorders. The calls of the male Eurasian Eagle-Owl were recorded by us in the frequency range of 200-420 Hz. The howl of a Gray Wolf was recorded in the frequency range from 300 to 1,100 Hz. Red Fox barking was recorded in the frequency range from 750 to 1,000 Hz. Barking of domestic dogs was recorded in the frequency range from 250 to 1,500 Hz. The vocalization of the Eurasian Eagle-Owl had an independent character inherent in the biology of the species. The Eurasian Eagle-Owl, with its cries, involuntarily provoked the entry of canines into joint vocal interaction, which can be explained by the high social activity of the latter. Co-vocalizations of the Eurasian Eagle-Owl and canines were noted in winter, spring and autumn, but mainly in spring (50%). The increased use of autonomous voice recorders, which record spontaneous vocalizations emitted by animals over long periods, will allow us to better document and study the importance of such interspecific interactions.  © 2023 Alexey Andreychev, published by Sciendo.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: A new method and new techniques are proposed for making artificial nests for Eagle-owls to increase their population. Artificial nesting sites allow Eagle-owls to hatch their chicks successfully and stay in a certain area. The results of field studies show that one of the decisive factors for large owls is the presence of a nesting site protected from both bad weather conditions and humans. This method has been tested under conditions of the forest–steppe zone of the Volga region. According to our observations, a special roof and special walls for artificial nesting protect the nest from adverse weather conditions and shedding. © 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Background The Tawny owl (Strix aluco) is a common owl species in Europe, demonstrating generalist diet strategy. Its main prey are small rodents and numerous studies show that the composition of its diet broadly reflects changes in prey species abundance in its habitats. Due to strictly sedentary habits of adult birds and their year-round territoriality, it is possible to locate habitats of their prey with a precision of several hundred metres. Analysis of owl pellets is a traditional method in faunistic studies to provide data on distribution of small mammals, especially cryptic species which are hard to be found using trapping. New information Here, we present a dataset on mammals found in Tawny owl pellets collected during up to 13-year studies in the Kharkiv Region, Ukraine in three territories. Data from two territories were collected in a systematic way and allowed us to make analysis of seasonal, year-to-year and habitat variability in the Tawny owl diet and local mammal species composition. © 2023 Yatsiuk Y et al.

ABSTRACT: Understanding the threats faced by a bird species requires a knowledge of their movements throughout the annual cycle and, for migratory species, the degree of connectivity between breeding and wintering sites. We studied the philopatry of Snowy Owls (Bubo scandiacus) tagged in central North America to their wintering sites on the Canadian prairies. The tracking of 16 owls over a period spanning six winters revealed consistent and predictable north-south migration trajectories, in contrast to populations farther to the west and east. Individuals were strongly philopatric to the central prairie region, but at a finer spatial scale, winter home ranges did not always overlap between successive years. Both sexes showed periods of nomadic searching for prey over a similar spatial scale, but males tended to settle closer to previous home ranges on average (88 km) than females (149 km). We hypothesize that the socially dominant females are better able to monopolize the spatially unpredictable hotspots of small mammal prey whereas males rely more on familiarity with a previous home range when settling. The population of Snowy Owls in central North America thus shows greater connectivity to wintering sites than do Snowy Owls documented elsewhere, probably related to the relatively high abundance and predictability of small mammal prey on the prairies. Maintaining prairie habitat on a large spatial scale that supports small rodents will be crucial to maintaining populations of Snowy Owls in the central part of the continent. © 2023 by the author(s).

ABSTRACT: A principal cue for sound source localization is the difference in arrival times of sounds at an animal’s two ears (interaural time difference, ITD). Neurons that process ITDs are specialized to compare the timing of inputs with submillisecond precision. In the barn owl, ITD processing begins in the nucleus laminaris (NL) region of the auditory brain stem. Remarkably, NL neurons are sensitive to ITDs in high-frequency sounds (kilohertz-range). This contrasts with ITD-based sound localization in analogous regions in mammals where ITD sensitivity is typically restricted to lower-frequency sounds. Guided by previous experiments and modeling studies of tone-evoked responses of NL neurons, we propose NL neurons achieve high-frequency ITD sensitivity if they respond selectively to the small-amplitude, high-frequency oscillations in their inputs, and remain relatively non-responsive to mean input level. We use a biophysically based model to study the effects of soma–axon coupling on dynamics and function in NL neurons. First, we show that electrical separation of the soma from the axon region in the neuron enhances high-frequency ITD sensitivity. This soma–axon coupling configuration promotes linear subthreshold dynamics and rapid spike initiation, making the model more responsive to input oscillations, rather than mean input level. Second, we provide new evidence for the essential role of phasic dynamics for high-frequency neural coincidence detection. Transforming our model to the phasic firing mode further tunes the model to respond selectively to the oscillating inputs that carry ITD information. Similar structural and dynamical mechanisms specialize mammalian auditory brain stem neurons for ITD sensitivity, and thus, our work identifies common principles of ITD processing and neural coincidence detection across species and for sounds at widely different frequencies. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: We present the complete genome sequence of an aviadenovirus obtained by metagenomics from cloacal swabs taken from a free-living Eurasian scops owl (Otus scops, a small raptor distributed in Europe and several parts of Asia) in China. Thirty protein coding genes were predicted in this 40,239-bp-long genome, which encodes the largest fiber protein among all reported aviadenoviruses. The viral genome sequence is highly divergent, and the encoded proteins have an average of only 55% amino acid sequence identity to those of other adenoviruses. In phylogenetic analysis, the new owl virus grouped with members of the genus Aviadenovirus and formed a common clade with another owl adenovirus reported previously in Japan. This is the second complete genome sequence of an aviadenovirus discovered in owls, and its proteins have an average of 62% amino acid sequence identity to those of the previously reported owl adenovirus. Combining this result with comparative genomic analysis of all aviadenoviruses, we propose that this owl virus and the previously described Japanese owl adenovirus can be assigned to two new species in the genus Aviadenovirus. This study provides new data on the diversity of aviadenoviruses in wild birds. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Nature provides a considerable number of good examples for simple and very efficient joint assemblies. One example is the enormously flexible cervical spine of American barn owls, which consists of 14 cervical vertebrae. Each pair of vertebrae produces a comparatively small individual movement in order to provide a large overall movement of the entire cervical spine. The biomimetic replication of such joints is difficult due to the delicate and geometric unrestricted joint shapes as well as the muscles that have to be mimicked. Using X-ray as well as micro-computed tomography images and with the utilisation of additive manufacturing, it was possible to produce the owl neck vertebrae in scaled-up form, to analyse them and then to transfer them into technically usable joint assemblies. The muscle substitution of these joints was realised by smart materials actuators in the form of shape memory alloy wire actuators. This actuator technology is outstanding for its muscle-like movement and for its high-energy density. The disadvantage of this wire actuator technology is the low rate of contraction, which means that a large length of wire has to be installed to generate adequate movement. For this reason, the actuator wires were integrated into additively manufactured carrier components to mimic biological joints. This resulted in joint designs that compensate for the disadvantages of the small contraction of the actuators by intelligently installing large wire lengths on comparatively small installation spaces, while also providing a sufficient force output. With the help of a test rig, the developed technical joint variants are examined and evaluated. This demonstrated the technical applicability of this biomimetic joints. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Microbiomes are essential to a host’s physiology and health. Despite the overall importance of microbiomes to animal health, they remain understudied in wildlife. Microbiomes function as physical barriers to invading pathogens, and changes in the diversity or composition of microbes within a host may disrupt this barrier. In order to use microbiomes in wildlife ecology, knowledge of the natural variation within and among species is essential. We compare the diversity and composition of two avian species that share the same habitat and niche in our study area, the western screech-owl (Megascops kennicottii) and the whiskered screech-owl (M. trichopsis). We used a targeted 16S sequencing method to improve the taxonomic resolution of microbiomes. We found similar measures of alpha diversity between species and sample types (cloacal samples vs. fecal samples). However, there were significant differences in bacterial species richness among nestlings from different nest boxes, and the composition differed between the two bird species and among nestlings from different nest boxes. Western screech-owls had more variation in alpha diversity and composition and had fewer bacterial species in their core microbiome than whiskered screech-owls. Siblings are likely to yield similar findings for microbiomes; thus, sampling nestlings from different nests may be most informative for monitoring population-level changes. © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: In the present study, we investigated food resource niche parameters and the degree of specialization of two local Western Barn Owl (Tyto alba) populations in two different demographic phases as the crash (2015-2016) and outbreak (2019-2020) of the Common Vole (Microtus arvalis). The study was conducted in two parts of the Transdanubian region of Hungary, namely in Duna-Drava National Park (DDNP) in the southeastern part, and in Ferto-Hanság National Park (FHNP) in the north-western part. For the analysis, we used food consumption data of 20-20 randomly selected breeding pairs from the DDNP population, while 14 and 17 breeding pairs in FHNP population in the crash and outbreak periods, respectively. Since the small mammal consumption of owls represented 99.3% of the total number of individuals, only data of small mammals as main food resource were taken into account during the analysis. Based on a trait-based framework which taking into account the resemblance between resources, Rao's quadratic entropy metrics was used to estimate the food resource niche breadth at local owl populations and the breeding pair level. The small mammal resource utilization of owls was dependent on populations. The niche breadth of DDNP population was significantly smaller than FHNP population. The estimated niche overlap at the individual level was significantly different between the two populations. The calculated value of specialization of barn owl populations was significantly higher in north-western than south-eastern population. The niche breadth of the owl population living in the DDNP was significantly higher during the crash period. In contrast, the estimated niche breadth of the population living in FHNP did not differ significantly between the two demographic phases. Based on our result, the applied trait-based framework of resource niche pattern analysis demonstrated that the differences of niche breadth were explored in more detail by this method between the local Barn Owl populations of different geographical region.  © 2023 Gyozo F.

ABSTRACT: Top predators are often used as sentinel species in contaminant monitoring due to their exposure and vulnerability to persistent, bioaccumulative and, in some cases, biomagnificable contaminants. Some of their ecological traits can vary in space and time, and are known to influence the contamination levels and therefore information on ecological traits should be used as contextual data for correct interpretation of large-scale contaminant spatial patterns. These traits can explain spatiotemporal variation in contaminant exposure (traits such as diet and dispersal distances) or contaminant impacts (traits such as population trend and clutch size). The aim of our research was to review the spatial variation in selected contextual parameters in the Tawny Owl (Strix aluco), a species identified by the COST Action European Raptor Biomonitoring Facility as one of the most suitable candidates for pan-European biomonitoring. A considerable variation in availability of published and unpublished contextual data across Europe was found, with diet being the most extensively studied trait. We demonstrate that the Tawny Owl is a suitable biomonitor at local scale but also that taking spatial variation of other contextual data (e.g. diet) into account is necessary. We found spatial gaps in knowledge about the species ecology and biology in Southern Europe, along with gaps in certain population parameters (e.g. population trends) in several countries. Based on our findings, we proposed a minimal recommended scheme for monitoring of population contextual data as one of the first steps towards a pan-European monitoring scheme using the Tawny Owl. © 2022 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Wildfire is an important natural disturbance shaping the boreal forests of North America. Not surprisingly, many species have adapted to benefit from the structural or functional changes in response to fire. Of these post-fire species, the Northern Hawk Owl (Surnia ulula caparoch) is one of the least studied species on the continent. We surveyed 18 recent fires in the boreal forest region of Alberta, Canada, ranging in age from 1 to 14 years post-fire, to improve our understanding of post-fire habitat relationships for this species. Hawk owls were present in fires ranging from 2 to 11 years post-fire, and occupied burns ranging in size from 1,000–272,000 ha. Hawk owls were strongly associated with areas of older deciduous-dominated forest, based on pre-fire forest inventory. Hawk owl responses to pre-fire forest age structure and composition were consistently stronger at the 1000 m radius (home range) extent than the 400 m (nest site) extent. We also found hawk owls responded differently to time since fire, with an immediate (e.g. 2–6 yr) response to low severity fire and a delayed (10–11 yr) response to high severity fire. We recommend future surveys for this species be conducted earlier in the day, ideally within a few hours of sunrise, based on the timing of detection in this study. Finally, the retention of large patches (e.g. > 300 ha) of older, deciduous-dominated habitat within post-fire forests may be an important management consideration for the conservation of hawk owls and other post-fire species. © 2022

ABSTRACT: Divided along several ethnic, linguistic and religious lines, Iran is a multicultural country and the question of its national identity has been a matter of dispute since the beginning of the last century. Part of this dispute has been going on in literary works by national and diasporic authors. In this paper, Porochista Khakpour’s Sons and Other Flammable Objects has been read in terms of its contribution to the questions of nationalism and national identity famously addressed in Sadegh Hedayat’s The Blind Owl. It seems that Khakpour has modelled her debut novel on Hedayat’s magnum opus as an effective way to join the debate. Focusing on Khakpour’s narrative, this study demonstrates how the novel presents a multicultural narrative of national identity in response to what is sometimes considered as Hedayat’s ethnocentric nationalism in The Blind Owl. © 2021 British Society for Middle Eastern Studies.

ABSTRACT: Development activities associated with urbanization can directly displace animals, causing high mortality and dispersal rates. Wildlife managers have attempted to mitigate the impacts of development on burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia), a species susceptible to ground-disturbing activities, by translocating them away from areas slated for development. In this study, we evaluated the effects of translocation on burrowing owl reproduction by comparing nest survival and productivity of owls involved in an ongoing translocation program in Arizona, USA, with that of resident owls. We used nest survival models to evaluate differences in nest survival and generalized linear models with Poisson error to assess differences in productivity. In 2017, cumulative nest survival (CNS) was lower among current-year translocated owls (i.e., owls translocated within the last year; CNS = 0.34, 95% CI = 0.18, 0.51) compared to non-translocated resident owls (0.83, 95% CI = 0.71, 0.94), but CNS was similar between previously translocated owls (i.e., those translocated >1 yr ago, CNS = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.64, 0.98) and residents. Likewise, in 2018, CNS was lower for current-year translocated owls (CNS = 0.12, 95% CI = 0.00, 0.24) compared to residents (CNS = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.50, 0.87) and previously translocated owls (CNS = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.40, 0.90). Productivity was significantly lower for current-year translocated owls ((Formula presented.) = 0.5 fledglings/nest) compared to residents ((Formula presented.) = 2.4 fledglings/nest) and previously translocated owls ((Formula presented.) = 1.5 fledglings/nest) across sites and years. With the current methods of translocation, owls had poor reproductive success in the first year after release, but if they survived 2 years after release, they had similar nest survival and productivity compared to residents. Our results demonstrate that the current practice of releasing translocated burrowing owls in the Phoenix, Arizona area during the breeding season depresses reproduction and should be substantially changed. Nest survival was low and this was mainly attributed to nest establishment of translocated owls within release tents (acclimation structures used in translocations that involve soft release) where 85% of nests failed following tent removal. Translocation approaches that reflect a closer fit to the timing and behavior of the species should be tested to determine whether they result in better success. In particular, future studies should examine the translocation results of releasing owls as male-female pairs or single birds during the nonbreeding period. © 2022 The Wildlife Society.

ABSTRACT: Telomeres are non-coding DNA sequences located at the end of linear chromosomes, protecting genome integrity. In numerous taxa, telomeres shorten with age and telomere length (TL) is positively correlated with longevity. Moreover, TL is also affected by environmental stressors and/or resource-demanding situations particularly during early-life. Thus, TL has been used as a physiological marker of individual quality and also as an indicator of population trend in conservation physiology. In this study, we investigated the effects of hatching rank, year of birth (2014 to 2017), sex and nest environment on TL of 137 Little Owls nestlings (Athene noctua). Little Owls’ populations in Europe showed a marked declined in the end of the 20th century. Nowadays, in the studied Alsatian population, the population is increasing. In this study, our results indicated that telomeres are longer in females and, independently of sex, in nestlings with the highest body condition. There was also a negative effect of hatching rank but only for last-hatched nestlings in large clutches of 5 nestlings. We did not find any effect of the environmental covariates on nestlings’ TL. Finally, we found that nestlings’ TL were shorter the last year of the study, while nestlings’ body condition stayed unchanged over the same period. This result is intriguing given the local positive population dynamics and is further discussed in the context of physiological conservation. Future studies should investigate the link between reduced TL and survival prospects in this species. © 2023, Centre Mersenne. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Understanding evolutionary phenomena that involve size assortative mating requires elucidating the generating mechanisms on which assortment is based. Although various mechanisms have been suggested, their relative importance may differ across taxonomic groups. Males selecting for large, fecund females combined with the dominance of large males in the competition for females has been suggested as a major mechanism in specific groups. However, raptors do not appear to conform to this, because the selection for smallness among males (assumed in a theory of reversed sexual size dimorphism) and the selection for largeness among males (assumed in the theory of size assortative mating) are in opposite directions. We studied the assortative mating during a long-term study of the Ryukyu Scops Owls Otus elegans interpositus. Significant assortative mating was found for culmen length (from the base to the tip of the bill) and wing length (from the bend of the wing to the tip of the longest primary). Statistical control of the spatial and temporal accessibility of potential mates did not affect the assortment. Males with short wings had slightly higher fitness components than those with long wings, and females settling early tended to have small wings. Considering that early-settling females can preferentially choose their mates, these results suggest that smaller females have an advantage when choosing smaller males with good reproductive performance. Improved flying and hunting ability of smaller individuals may be the background of choosing smaller individuals. We propose that, not passive process like similarity between individuals and their potential mates, but active mate choice for small individuals is an explanation for the assortative mating in this owl. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Mobbing is a widespread but risky behavior where prey actually approach and may even attack their predators. Small songbirds gather in multi-species flocks to direct mobbing at birds of prey such as the Northern Pygmy-Owl (Glaucidium gnoma), a small diurnal species of owl in mountainous western North America. We hypothesized that intensity of mobbing behavior would vary according to risk to songbirds and that risk varied seasonally and across elevations. In particular, we expected mobbing intensity to change seasonally as a function of two primary sources of risk: seasonal dietary changes of pygmy-owls and distribution of pygmy-owls as a function of elevation. Pygmy-owls are known to shift their diet from mostly mammals in early spring to birds in early summer, so we hypothesized risk of predation would vary in parallel. Likewise, risk was expected to vary as the distribution of pygmy-owls was thought to vary seasonally across elevations. To elicit mobbing in a controlled manner, we conducted owl call playback experiments in the Oregon Coast Range mountains, United States. Overall, we found mobbing to be rare, observing it in 8.1% of 663 experiments. The frequency of mobbing did not appear to vary across elevations. Instead, mobbing varied mostly by season. The frequency of mobbing was highest during fall at lower elevations. Mobbing was rarest (1.3% of trials) during winter. Mobbing occurred during seasons when pygmy-owls tend to consume more birds, consistent with the hypothesis that seasonal variation in risk influences mobbing. In our study, mobbing happened when risk was higher. However, the increased risk may be offset by the influence of mobbing group size. Mobbing was more likely to occur at sites where the number of songbirds, especially chickadees (Poecile sp.) and nuthatches (Sitta sp.), was larger. Yet, even when songbird numbers were high, mobbing was rare during winter, suggesting an interaction between risk and energetic costs of mobbing. Additional experiments manipulating food resource availability may be able to reveal the strength and influence of the interaction on mobbing decisions. Copyright © 2023 Scott and Robinson.

ABSTRACT: Glucocorticoids mediate physiological processes to obtain energy, presenting daily variation in basal levels that may be related to behavioural activity pattern. Identification of plasticity in the secretion of these hormones is essential to understand their effects on physiology and behaviour of wild birds and, therefore, their success in their natural or artificial environment. Serial endocrine evaluations are facilitated by implementing non-invasive methodologies that minimize possible effects of manipulation on the animal’s physiological variables. However, non-invasive endocrine-behavioural studies in nocturnal birds, such as owls, are immature. The present work aimed to validate an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to quantify glucocorticoid metabolites (MGC) in Megascops choliba as well as to evaluate differences in their production at the individual, sexual or daily level. We recorded the behaviour of nine owls during three continuous days to establish activity budget under captive conditions and aiming to correlate with daily MGC variation. The EIA proved to be effective in analytical assays and in pharmacological testing with synthetic ACTH, validating this immunoassay for the species. Additionally, individual differences in MGC production were confirmed in relation to the time of day, especially at 1700 and 2100, but not in relation to sex. During night hours, the owls showed greater behavioural activity, positively related to MGC values. Higher MGC concentrations were significantly related to greater expressions of active behaviours, such as maintenance, while lower MGC concentrations were recorded during moments of higher alertness and resting. The results presented show daily MGC variation to be inversed in this nocturnal species. Our findings can aid future theoretical studies of daily rhythm and evaluations of challenging and/or disturbing situations that result in changes in behaviour or hormonal cascades of these changes in ex situ populations of owls. © The Author(s) 2023.

ABSTRACT: The diet of Rufous-legged Owl, Strix rufipes, a small raptor present in an Andean protected area, is described here. During the fall of 2017, 44 pellets were collected in the study area, being subsequently analyzed. The occurrence of small mammal prey items in pellets was compared with capture frequencies with live-trapping through Sherman traps. Regarding occurrence frequencies in the diet, arthropods were the most frequent (49.34%), followed by mammals (39.31%), birds (7.86%) and reptiles (3.37%). However, in terms of biomass, mammals had the highest biomass contribution. The observed frequency of consumed preys showed a random pattern, according to the captures of small mammals obtained with Sherman traps. The role of wildfire in the composition of prey in the observed trophic spectrum of these forest owls is also discussed.  © 2023 Alfredo H. Zúñiga et al., published by Sciendo.

ABSTRACT: Anthropogenic structures and installations in wild areas are known to directly and indirectly affect wildlife populations, especially apex predators such as Eagle Owls (Bubo bubo). To understand the situation at the national level we analyzed data collected by the Scientific Data Department of the Israel Nature and Parks Authority and the wildlife hospital at the Safari in Ramat Gan. We analyzed a total of 189 dead Eagle Owls during fifteen years, 2007–2021; 39.7% were electrocuted, 29.2% roadkill, 12.7% flew into fences/barbed wire, 3.8% drowned, and 14.9% died from other causes. The largest mortality of the Eagle Owls was detected in agricultural (34.92 %) and urban areas (31.74%). Also, the pylons identified as lethal should be prioritized and modified with appropriate insulators. Only a sincere effort on the part of the authorities will the continued electrocution of eagle owls and other avian wildlife be truncated. © 2022 Elsevier GmbH

ABSTRACT: Owls are widely known for their silent flight, which is attributed to their unique wing morphologies comprising leading-edge (LE) serrations, trailing-edge (TE) fringes, and a velvety surface. The aeroacoustic characteristics of owl-inspired TE fringes have been widely investigated through two-dimensional (2D) modeling, but remain yet poorly studied in association with their three-dimensional (3D) effects. Here, we present a numerical study of the 3D aeroacoustic characteristics of owl-inspired TE fringes in which we combined large-eddy simulations (LES) with the Ffowcs Williams‒Hawkings analogy. We constructed a clean wing model and three wing models with TE fringes that were distributed differently spanwise. The aerodynamic forces and 3D acoustic characteristics reveal that, like the 2D results of our previous studies, the 3D TE fringes enable remarkable sound reduction spatially while having aerodynamic performance comparable to the clean model. Visualizations of the near-field 3D flow structures, vortex dynamics, and flow fluctuations show that TE fringes can robustly alter the 3D flow by breaking 3D TE vortices into small eddies and mitigating 3D flow fluctuations. Particularly, it is verified that TE fringes alter spanwise flows, thus dominating the 3D aeroacoustic characteristics in terms of passive flow control and flow stabilizations, whereas the fringes are inefficient in suppressing the acoustic sources induced by wingtip vortices. Moreover, the TE fringes distributed at midspan have better acoustic performance than those in the vicinity of the wingtip, indicating the importance of a spanwise distribution in enhancing aeroacoustic performance. © 2022, Jilin University.

ABSTRACT: Background: A reliable risk prediction model is critically important for identifying individuals with high risk of developing lung cancer as candidates for low-dose chest computed tomography (LDCT) screening. Leveraging a cutting-edge machine learning technique that accommodates a wide list of questionnaire-based predictors, we sought to optimize and validate a lung cancer prediction model. Methods: We developed an Optimized early Warning model for Lung cancer risk (OWL) using the XGBoost algorithm with 323,344 participants from the England area in UK Biobank (training set), and independently validated it with 93,227 participants from UKB Scotland and Wales area (validation set 1), as well as 70,605 and 66,231 participants in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian cancer screening trial (PLCO) control and intervention subpopulations, respectively (validation sets 2 & 3) and 23,138 and 18,669 participants in the United States National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) control and intervention subpopulations, respectively (validation sets 4 & 5). By comparing with three competitive prediction models, i.e., PLCO modified 2012 (PLCOm2012), PLCO modified 2014 (PLCOall2014), and the Liverpool Lung cancer Project risk model version 3 (LLPv3), we assessed the discrimination of OWL by the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) at the designed time point. We further evaluated the calibration using relative improvement in the ratio of expected to observed lung cancer cases (RIEO), and illustrated the clinical utility by the decision curve analysis. Findings: For general population, with validation set 1, OWL (AUC = 0.855, 95% CI: 0.829–0.880) presented a better discriminative capability than PLCOall2014 (AUC = 0.821, 95% CI: 0.794–0.848) (p < 0.001); with validation sets 2 & 3, AUC of OWL was comparable to PLCOall2014 (AUCPLCOall2014-AUCOWL < 1%). For ever-smokers, OWL outperformed PLCOm2012 and PLCOall2014 among ever-smokers in validation set 1 (AUCOWL = 0.842, 95% CI: 0.814–0.871; AUCPLCOm2012 = 0.792, 95% CI: 0.760–0.823; AUCPLCOall2014 = 0.791, 95% CI: 0.760–0.822, all p < 0.001). OWL remained comparable to PLCOm2012 and PLCOall2014 in discrimination (AUC difference from −0.014 to 0.008) among the ever-smokers in validation sets 2 to 5. In all the validation sets, OWL outperformed LLPv3 among the general population and the ever-smokers. Of note, OWL showed significantly better calibration than PLCOm2012, PLCOall2014 (RIEO from 43.1% to 92.3%, all p < 0.001), and LLPv3 (RIEO from 41.4% to 98.7%, all p < 0.001) in most cases. For clinical utility, OWL exhibited significant improvement in average net benefits (NB) over PLCOall2014 in validation set 1 (NB improvement: 32, p < 0.001); among ever smokers of validation set 1, OWL (average NB = 289) retained significant improvement over PLCOm2012 (average NB = 213) (p < 0.001). OWL had equivalent NBs with PLCOm2012 and PLCOall2014 in PLCO and NLST populations, while outperforming LLPv3 in the three populations. Interpretation: OWL, with a high degree of predictive accuracy and robustness, is a general framework with scientific justifications and clinical utility that can aid in screening individuals with high risks of lung cancer.

ABSTRACT: We conducted a range-wide investigation of the dynamics of site-level reproductive rate of northern spotted owls using survey data from 11 study areas across the subspecies geographic range collected during 1993–2018. Our analytical approach accounted for imperfect detection of owl pairs and misclassification of successful reproduction (i.e., at least one young fledged) and contributed further insights into northern spotted owl population ecology and dynamics. Both nondetection and state misclassification were important, especially because factors affecting these sources of error also affected focal ecological parameters. Annual probabilities of site occupancy were greatest at sites with successful reproduction in the previous year and lowest for sites not occupied by a pair in the previous year. Site-specific occupancy transition probabilities declined over time and were negatively affected by barred owl presence. Overall, the site-specific probability of successful reproduction showed substantial year-to-year fluctuations and was similar for occupied sites that did or did not experience successful reproduction the previous year. Site-specific probabilities for successful reproduction were very small for sites that were unoccupied the previous year. Barred owl presence negatively affected the probability of successful reproduction by northern spotted owls in Washington and California, as predicted, but the effect in Oregon was mixed. The proportions of sites occupied by northern spotted owl pairs showed steep, near-monotonic declines over the study period, with all study areas showing the lowest observed levels of occupancy to date. If trends continue it is likely that northern spotted owls will become extirpated throughout large portions of their range in the coming decades. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: A dense island population of Eagle-Owls (Bubo bubo) close to the Arctic circle had suffered considerable mortality due to powerlines (electrocution and collision) throughout many decades. A study using GPS transmitter technology was carried out between 2009 and 2014. We studied home-range sizes, dispersal distances, mortality, and proposed mitigation techniques to prevent accidents. We found as expected that juvenile Eagle-Owls had larger home-ranges and moved farther than adults, but both age-groups moved much less than shown elsewhere in Europe. The probable reason for this was thought to be that this population was isolated by the surrounding sea, which might act as a barrier. The GPS data indicated that the poles of the grid were used as perching posts more than expected from a random distribution. This was explained by the lack of high trees and other elevated landscape features on these low islands. As a mitigation effort, we contributed to designing a perching-device for fitting on the poles that would prevent electrocution of the owls. This is now used by several grid-owners in coastal areas with high electrocution risk and is followed up by the National action plan for Eagle-Owl in Norway. © 2023 University of Helsinki.

ABSTRACT: We summarize recent records of two rare owls in Iran: The Omani Owl Strix butleri and the Western Brown Fish Owl Ketupa zeylonensis semenowi. In the past decade, a significant number of records were submitted to the Iran Bird Record Committee (IBRC) by amateur ornithologists and birdwatchers. In total, there were 35 records of Omani Owl during 2008–2022 and 45 records for Brown Fish Owl during 1997–2022 in Iran. Our results demonstrate that a large portion of the global range of Omani Owl (90%) is situated within Iran. Additionally, the range of the subspecies semenowi of Brown Fish Owl is predominately located in the country. We propose a new English name, “Golden Owl”, instead of Omani Owl and maintain the English name of the subspecies semenowi, as Western Brown Fish Owl. We suggest that the scarcity of these two taxa in Iran can be attributed to a lack of systematic surveys rather than a small population size. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Tyto furcata pratincola (American Barn Owl) is a widespread bird of prey with great adaptability that can be found in partially urbanized areas. We examined the prey composition of a pair of American Barn Owls through dissection and analysis of a subset of cast pellets found at a roost site in an urban park in South Florida by comparing hair, bone, and teeth to online identification guides and museum specimens. The main identified prey species were rodents, with Sigmodon hispidus (Hispid Cotton Rat) accounting for 63.0% of all prey identified. Within the home range of these owls were 9 known colonies of endangered and common species of bats, but no evidence of depredation was found in the pellet analysis. Other small mammals, reptiles, and invertebrates made up the remainder of the diet, which is consistent with other similar studies in more natural settings. © 2023 Humboldt Field Research Institute.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of hydromorphone hydrochloride and its metabolite, hydromorphone-3-glucuronide (H3G), after a single IV and IM dose in great horned owls (Bubo virginianus). ANIMALS 6 healthy adult great horned owls (3 females and 3 males). PROCEDURES A single dose of hydromorphone (0.6 mg/kg) was administered once IM (pectoral muscles) and IV (left jugular) with a 6-week washout period between experiments. Blood samples were collected at 5 minutes and 0.5, 1.5, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 hours after drug administration. Plasma hydromorphone and H3G concentrations were determined with liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry, and a noncompartmental analysis was used for the determination of pharmacokinetic parameters. RESULTS Hydromorphone had a high bioavailability of 170.8 ± 37.6% and rapid elimination after IM administration and rapid plasma clearance and a large volume of distribution after IV administration. Mean Cmax was 225.46 ± 0.2 ng/mL at 13 minutes after IM injection. Mean volume of distribution and plasma drug clearance was 4.29 ± 0.5 L/kg and 62.11 ± 14.6 mL/min/kg, respectively, after IV administration. Mean t1/2 was 1.62 ± 0.36 and 1.35 ± 0.59 hours after IM and IV administration, respectively. The metabolite H3G was readily measured shortly after administration by both routes. CLINICAL RELEVANCE A single dose of 0.6 mg/kg was well tolerated in all birds. Hydromorphone rapidly attained plasma concentrations following IM administration and had high bioavailability and short t1/2. This study is the first to document the presence of the metabolite H3G in avian species, which suggests similar hydromorphone metabolism as in mammals. © 2023, American Veterinary Medical Association.

ABSTRACT: Much confusion has surrounded the taxonomy of the Collared Scops Owl (Otus bakkamoena) complex, distributed widely across tropical and subtropical Asia. Often divided into three species, modern taxonomies disagree on its treatment, as a lack of deep mitochondrial DNA divergence is seemingly in contrast with patterns of vocal differentiation. Analysing a dataset of territorial calls of 122 individuals across Asia, we identified a vocal leapfrog pattern in which owl populations at the eastern and western ends of the distribution sound more similar to each other but are separated by different-sounding populations in between. The boundaries between vocal types are not congruent with traditional species boundaries. Our data allow for a re-drawing of species boundaries and reveal that Collared Scops Owls follow a biogeographic pattern rare in Southeast Asian birds. However, this pattern is shared with several other owl complexes in that peninsular Malaysian populations form part of a continental Asian species centred further north in Southeast Asia rather than forming part of a Sundaic species centred in the adjacent Indonesian Archipelago. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The short-eared owl (Asio flammeus) is a species of conservation concern in the western United States, and populations are declining throughout its range. Because of its low site fidelity, nomadic lifestyle, and irruptive breeding dynamics across large landscapes, estimating trends at regional or broader scales is difficult. To address that challenge, we recruited community-science participants to implement a multi-year survey of short-eared owls across a study area encompassing 8 western states: California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. We stratified our study area by potential habitat, established 50 spatially balanced transects per state, each with 8–11 survey points, and visited each transect twice per year to perform a 5-minute point count. From 2018–2020, transect occupancy rates of short-eared owls were highly variable within individual states but reasonably stable over our study area. California, Idaho, Utah, and Washington were the only states where occupancy rates were stable year to year, with the most stability in Utah and Washington. More monitoring may be warranted to address spatial and temporal variability in abundance of this species that may be influenced by small-mammal cycles. Our results illustrate the large movements of individuals across regions that may be required to support the North American population, emphasizing the need for broad geographic monitoring and conservation strategies for short-eared owls. © 2023 The Wildlife Society.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Intraspecific color variation is often associated with camouflage or protection, but melanin-based color variation is also linked to behavioral and physiological aspects including boldness. In the melanin-based plumage color polymorphic tawny owl (Strix aluco), the grey morph is known to be more cryptic than the brown morph. Using 19 captive tawny owls (11 grey and 8 brown), we tested if these two color morphs that differ in camouflage tend to differently use exposed perches in a familiar environment (home aviary) and a novel environment (experimental aviary), as well as whether their response to predation risk and mobbing cues differs. The two color morphs did not differ in their exposure under known conditions (in their home aviary), but brown tawny owls were more likely to use exposed perches than grey tawny owls after release in a novel environment. Significance statement: Melanin-based coloration can be associated with several behavioral traits. However, it is still unknown how predators with genetically-based color polymorphism vary in their efficiency of active background choice and risk-prone behavior while facing predation risk or mobbing harassment. Using captive tawny owls, we investigated predators’ behavior (attention towards the stimulus and use of space) while confronted to mobbing events and predation risk. We showed that tawny owls were using their space differently according to their color morph in a novel environment (experimental aviary) but not in a familiar environment (home aviary). © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Managing forests for biodiversity conservation while maintaining economic output is a major challenge globally and requires accurate and timely monitoring of imperiled species. In the Pacific Northwest, USA, forest management is heavily influenced by the status of northern spotted owls (Strix occidentalis caurina), which have been in continued population decline for the past four decades. The monitoring program for northern spotted owls is transitioning from mark–resight surveys to a passive acoustic framework, requiring development of alternative analysis approaches. To maintain relevance for conservation and management, these analyses must accurately track underlying population changes, identify responses to disturbance, and estimate occupancy of owl pairs. We randomly selected and surveyed 5-km2 hexagons for 6 weeks using passive acoustic monitoring in the Olympic Peninsula of Washington and the Oregon Coast Range during the 2018 spotted owl breeding season. We used a convolutional neural network to identify spotted owl calls, followed by logistic regression to determine the sex of vocalizing owls to assign pair status. We implemented multistate occupancy models to estimate probabilities of detection, species-level landscape use, and pair occupancy of spotted owls. We also quantified detections of barred owls (Strix varia), a congeneric competitor and important driver of spotted owl population declines. The overall rate of hexagon use by spotted owls was estimated at 0.21 (SD 0.04) after adjusting for imperfect detection, and pair occupancy was 0.07 (SD 0.02). The probability of detecting a pair (i.e., both female and male) during a weekly occasion was relatively low (0.03, SD 0.01), indicating that true pair occupancy was between 1.3 and 4.1 times greater than the proportion of hexagons with observed pair detections. Barred owls were ubiquitous, with a naïve occupancy rate of 0.97. The intensity of calling by barred owls had a weak, negative effect on the probability of spotted owls being paired when present but had little measurable effect on their detectability. This work establishes a framework that may be effective for spotted owl population monitoring and illustrates that pairs have very low detection probability, which—combined with increasingly low numbers of spotted owl pairs—is an important consideration for conservation and management. ©2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Abstract. Understanding the niche differentiation between sympatric species that permit species to coexist and partition resource is the central concept in ecology. In this context, we evaluated the differences in roost site resources between two sympatric Otus species - Andaman Scops-owl Otus balli and Oriental Scops-owl Otus sunia in the Andaman Islands using a multi-scale approach. We measured variables that influence roost site use by owls at three different scales (tree, patch and macro). A total of 38 and 69 independent roost locations of O. balli and O. sunia respectively were recorded. We found that both species showed a high preference for Arecaceae plants at tree scale, possibly for their spiny structures that could offer protection. But both species showed different selection patterns at the patch and macro scales. At the patch scale, O. balli selected roosting sites in patches with relatively mature tree stands (characterised by higher tree height, girth at breast height and canopy cover) with thick understory cover (understory cover, height, and herbaceous elements). In contrast, O. sunia was found to select trees in secondary or highly disturbed forests. Land use and land cover types distinguish both species from their habitat preferences at a macro scale with a very low predicted overlap. The area of potential roost sites is very low for O. balli when compared to O. sunia. Our findings suggest that the two sympatric species' preferences for roost sites are shaped by the characteristics of evergreen forests of the Andaman Islands. Hence, any further changes to this forest type may have adverse effects on the endemic O. balli. © 2023 Polish Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Voles are the most common vertebrate pests in European agriculture. Identifying their distribution and abundance patterns provides valuable information for future management. Barn Owl diet analysis is one of the optimum methods used to record small mammal distribution patterns on large spatial scales. From 2003 to 2005, a total of 10,065 Barn Owl pellets were collected and analyzed from 31 breeding sites in the largest agroecosystem in Greece, the Thessaly plains. A total of 29,061 prey items were identified, offering deep insight into small mammal distribution, specifically voles. Four discrete vole species (Harting’s vole Microtus hartingi, East European vole Microtus levis, Thomas’s pine vole Microtus thomasi, and Grey dwarf hamster Cricetulus migratorius) comprised 40.5% (11,770 vole prey items) of the total Barn Owl prey intake. The presence and abundance of the voles varied according to underlying environmental gradients, with soil texture and type playing a major role. M. levis showed no significant attachments to gradients, other than a mild increase in Mollisol soils. It was syntopic in all sites with M. hartingi, which was the dominant and most abundant small mammal species, preferring non-arable cultivated land, natural grasslands, set-aside fields, and fallow land. M. thomasi was strictly present in western Thessaly and strongly associated with a sandy-clay soil texture and Alfisol soils. C. migratorius was the least represented vole (162 items), exclusively present in eastern Thessaly and demonstrating a stronger association with cereals, Mollisol soils, and an argillaceous-clay soil texture. This is the first study in Greece at such a large spatial scale, offering insights for pest rodents’ distribution in intensive agroecosystems and their response to environmental gradients including soil parameters. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina; hereinafter NSO) was listed as “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act in 1990 and population declines have continued since that listing. Given the species’ protected status, any proposed activities on Federal lands that might impact NSO require consultation with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and part of that consultation often includes surveys to determine presence and occupancy status of the species in the proposed activity area. The objective of this report is to present study-area specific estimates of the probability of detection for NSO pairs from twelve 2-week seasonal survey periods using data from a recent range-wide meta-analysis. These estimates were a by-product of pair occupancy modeling but might provide insight into potential changes in the effect of the invasive barred owl on NSO detection rates. We used two-species multi-season occupancy models to estimate the probability of detection for NSOs on each of 11 study areas for each 2-week survey period and relative to the range-wide effect of barred owl presence or absence. Detection probabilities within the season generally increased from the earliest surveys in March through mid-season, decreasing again in the late season on five study areas. For three other study areas, detection rates were highest during the earliest survey periods in late March or early April. Estimates of cumulative seasonal detection of NSO (across a maximum of six within-season surveys) were less than 0.90 when barred owls (BO) were present on all but one study area, regardless of when surveys were conducted within a season. However, despite low detection rates, the probability that a territory was occupied when an NSO pair was not detected over six within-season surveys was also very low. When BO are not present on a territory, a six-survey protocol had a high probability of detecting an NSO pair at least once during the season on all study areas, except for the very lowest per-survey estimates. Conducting most surveys earlier in the season, when the probability of detecting pairs is highest (through May on most areas) could improve seasonal detection rates. However, alternative methods of population monitoring—such as the use of passive acoustic recorders— may be needed to continue monitoring NSO for research and management. © 2023, US Geological Survey.

ABSTRACT: The Barn Owl (Tyto alba) belongs to iconic species of the Czech countryside. During the 20th century the species declined dramatically and disappeared from many regions, especially at medium altitudes. Today it is listed in the National Red List of Threatened Species as critically endangered. The decline is caused by many factors. Intensification of agriculture and loss of safe breeding sites are the most crucial. In Central Europe, the Barn Owl feeds mainly on the Common Vole (Microtus arvalis) and the prey population cycle affects reproductive success of the owls. The Barn Owl helps in agricultural pest management. It requires diverse farmland habitats with lots of tree lines, hedgerows, old orchards and ditches. Such fine-scale landscape patchwork has a stable water regime, supports species diversity and also attracts people for free time activities. The charismatic Barn Owl with its role in crop protection, dependency on farms for breeding and preferences for diverse agricultural habitats is an ideal umbrella species for countryside wildlife conservation. In spite of all these facts, there is no official national or local action plan for the Barn Owl conservation in the Czech Republic. This paper summarises the most important knowledge about the Barn Owl which is relevant for systematic conservation effort and proposes the rules for such activities at the national or local scale. © 2023 Czech Society for Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: The media often portrays endangered species and ecosystem conservation as at loggerheads with rural communities that depend on natural resource extraction. In recent years, academics and practitioners alike have attempted to remedy this narrative by experimenting with management strategies that involve affected communities rather than impose top-down rules. This Note explores the small communities of western Lane County, Oregon, as a case study to interrogate these narratives in the context of northern spotted owl conservation. Specifically, the Note disaggregates the broad-strokes portrayal of owls versus timber into the relationships between federal government agencies with conservation mandates, small landowners, and county government to better understand the nuances of the tension and how management strategies have fared. The Note concludes by identifying five characteristics of species management strategies that benefit the species and its human neighbors: stakeholder engagement, funding, regulatory and relational certainty, monitoring, and reframing the narrative. © 2023 University of California Boalt Law Business.

ABSTRACT: Sensory systems preferentially strengthen responses to stimuli based on their reliability at conveying accurate information. While previous reports demonstrate that the brain reweighs cues based on dynamic changes in reliability, how the brain may learn and maintain neural responses to sensory statistics expected to be stable over time is unknown. The barn owl's midbrain features a map of auditory space where neurons compute horizontal sound location from the interaural time difference (ITD). Frequency tuning of midbrain map neurons correlates with the most reliable frequencies for the neurons' preferred ITD (Cazettes et al., 2014). Removal of the facial ruff led to a specific decrease in the reliability of high frequencies from frontal space. To directly test whether permanent changes in ITD reliability drive frequency tuning, midbrain map neurons were recorded from adult owls, with the facial ruff removed during development, and juvenile owls, before facial ruff development. In both groups, frontally tuned neurons were tuned to frequencies lower than in normal adult owls, consistent with the change in ITD reliability. In addition, juvenile owls exhibited more heterogeneous frequency tuning, suggesting normal developmental processes refine tuning to match ITD reliability. These results indicate causality of long-term statistics of spatial cues in the development of midbrain frequency tuning properties, implementing probabilistic coding for sound localization. © 2023, Shadron and Peña.

ABSTRACT: The continuous use of pesticides to improve agriculture has not only affected the crop but also altered the food chain and worst affected the non-target organisms. Birds utilizing agricultural landscapes for feeding get exposed to these chemicals through ingestion of sprayed soils, treated granules or seeds and prey items. Raptors like owls are the most likely victims of pesticide exposure as they are at the top level of food chain. In present study, excreta samples of barn owl and spotted owlet were collected from three locations and tested for presence of pesticide residues using gas chromatography. The organophosphate residues of dichlorvos, monocrotophos, phorate, malathion, quinalphos, profenophos, ethion were not reported in excreta of both owl species but the residues of chlorpyriphos (0.037 ppm) were detected in spotted owlet samples collected from village Barnhara only. The pyrethroid residues cyhalothrin, permethrin, cypermethrin were also found to be absent or below detectable limit in samples collected from different locations. The feeding habits of birds attribute to the level of contamination in predatory birds. Although the level of chlorpyriphos residues excreted out from the body of spotted owlet does not reflect the actual level of exposure to this bird but gives an indication of their being at the risk of exposure in the environment. © 2023, The Entomological Society of India.

ABSTRACT: The Western Barn Owl (Tyto alba) is a common breeder in Hungary. It is a resident bird of open areas, staying near nesting sites in winter. Its population is strongly influenced by food availability, weather conditions and several anthropogenic activities. One of the most important factors of these in recent decades has been road mortality. In this work, we processed data of roadkilled individuals and field observation records in the Csanádihát region in south-eastern Hungary from the period 1995-2022. In Battonya, we have been recording roadkill individuals since 1995, while observations of Barn Owl individuals from Kevermes have been available since 2005. The species is a regular, but scarce breeder in the area, so both the number of roadkilled individuals and the number of field observations were relatively low. Nevertheless, we had the opportunity to examine how the number of individuals of the species that were killed in the traffic varied over time and within years. According to our data, more birds collided during the winter, and also between July and November. This can be explained mostly by the seasonal lack of food and the fledging time of inexperienced juveniles. The temporal distribution of field observations were different from the dynamics of the roadkills, as the species was mainly observed during the breeding season. The exact population size of the area can be difficultly estimated, as it breeds mainly in attics of stable, granary and church buildings. The breeding population of Kevermes was estimated at 3-4 pairs and did not change significantly in the studied period. Over the same 28-year period, using the same methods to the two other most common nesting owl species of the region, we found that the within-year roadkill dynamics of the Little Owl (Athene noctua) and the Northern Long-eared Owl (Asio otus) differed from that of the Western Barn Owls, which may be due to the different feeding habits of the species. We can conclude that the number of roadkilled birds was proportional to the local population of the species.  © 2023 András István Csathó et al., published by Sciendo.

ABSTRACT: We describe a partial skeleton of a fossil owl (Strigiformes) from the early Eocene London Clay of Walton-on-the-Naze (Essex, UK). The holotype of Ypresiglaux michaeldanielsi, gen. et sp. nov. is one of the most complete specimens of a Palaeogene owl and elucidates the poorly known ecomorphology of stem group Strigiformes. Whereas most of the postcranial bones show the characteristic strigiform morphology, the new species exhibits plesiomorphic features of the skull and cervical vertebrae that differ distinctly from extant owls. A well-developed supraorbital process of the lacrimal bone suggests that the eyes were not as greatly enlarged and forward-facing as in extant owls. A plesiomorphic quadrate morphology indicates differences in the otic region, and a proportionally longer axis suggests that the fossil species was not able to rotate its head to the degree found in crown group Strigiformes. Therefore, the fossil documents a mosaic evolution of the strigiform body plan, with owls developing raptorial adaptations before specializations of the visual and acoustic systems evolved. Because the latter relate to a crespuscular or nocturnal activity pattern, we hypothesize that Ypresiglaux was diurnal. Nocturnality in owls may have evolved in response to the emergence of evolutionary opportunities, which enabled owls to exploit new ecological niches, or owls may have been driven into nocturnal habits by ecological competition. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: This case series describes the use of in vivo confocal microscopy in the diagnosis and treatment of mycotic keratitis in two owls (one Bubo scandiacus, one Strix varia) and one woodcock (Scolopax minor). Each bird was at increased risk of fungal infection due to recent injury or stress. Ophthalmic findings in all birds included blepharospasm, ocular discharge, ulcerative keratitis, white or yellow corneal plaques, and anterior uveitis. Fungal hyphae were identified in corneal samples from all three eyes examined cytologically and in all three eyes by using in vivo confocal microscopy. Aspergillus fumigatus was isolated from a corneal culture in one bird. Despite medical treatment, progressive ocular disease prompted enucleation in two birds. Fungal hyphae were detected by histopathology in one of the two enucleated eyes. In vivo confocal microscopy aided the diagnosis of fungal keratitis in all birds and was the only diagnostic method that allowed immediate, real-Time quantification of the extent (area and depth) and severity of mycotic keratitis. © 2023 American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Even though birds are some of the most common road-killed animals, it remains to be determined whether avian roadkills are related to breeding numbers and breeding success, mainly due to a lack of study areas that monitor breeding populations and roadkills. We studied whether barn owl breeding numbers and breeding success are related to roadkills. We monitored yearly barn owl breeding numbers (2174 breeding attempts and 1682 adults ringed) and breeding success (9380 nestlings ringed) and monitored 95 km of roads weekly for roadkills from 2009 to 2017 in the Beit Shean and Emek Yizreel Valleys, Israel. During the study period, we documented 1073 road-killed barn owls, of which 328 were ring recoveries. The highest mortality occurred between July to September, coinciding with the barn owl post-fledging period. The number of breeding pairs and the number of nestlings ringed were positively related to the total number of barn owl roadkill, the proportion of roadkill ring recoveries, and the proportion of ring recovered roadkills in the first year of their life. First-year owls represent the majority of ringed owls, accounting for 64.6%, while adult owls compose 35.4%. Notably, a substantial fraction of adult ring recoveries, encompassing 67.2%, may pertain to floaters since we did not observe these individuals as breeding adults. Even though more females were found as roadkill ring recoveries, the proportion of male/female ring recoveries from roadkills was similar to that of adults ringed at the nest boxes. This study is the first that shows that barn owl roadkills are density-dependent and demonstrate the importance of monitoring breeding and population numbers in roadkill studies. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The diet of the Pharaoh Eagle-Owl, Bubo ascalaphus, was investigated based on 338 pellets collected from caves and underground caves in Ara'r region, northern Saudi Arabia. Small mammals constituted the highest number of consumed prey (75.75%), followed by arthropods (20%), birds (2.9%) and reptiles (1.26%). The Libyan Jird, Meriones libycus, was the most consumed rodent (26.46%) followed by Sundevall's Jird, Meriones crassus (20.47%), while the least were Cheesman Gerbil, Gerbillus cheesmani, and Wagner's Gerbil, Gerbillus dasyurus. At least three species of scorpions, Androctonus crassicauda, Compsbuthus sp. and Scorpio sp., and two species of reptiles (Ptyodactylus hasselquistii and Trapellus agnetae) were recovered. Study of owl pellet contents proved to be a valuable tool to study species composition in unexplored regions. Also, our findings substantiate the fact that the Pharaoh Eagle-Owl is an opportunistic species that adapts to available preys in its habitat.  © 2023 Abdul Rahman Al Ghamdi et al., published by Sciendo.

ABSTRACT: Considerable evidence shows that nocturnal chronotypes have increased odds of mental health problems, poor academic performance, and impairment in executive functions. Although the cognitive and health costs of evening-oriented preference are well-documented in the literature, little is known about its interpersonal costs. In this article, we propose that people with a preference for an evening chronotype show a lower tendency to forgive following an interpersonal offense because of their lower self-control ability. Three studies using independent samples and complementary measures reveal that morning-evening preference plays a role in the emergence of forgiveness, which provides support for our theoretical perspective. In Study 1, we found that evening-type students were less forgiving when responding to a transgression than morning-type students. Employing a longer measure of forgiveness and a more representative population, Study 2 replicated our initial findings and supported our hypothesis regarding the mediating role of self-control. To circumvent methodological issues associated with self-report data, Study 3 used a behavioral measure of forgiveness and revealed that chronotype can also predict actual forgiving behavior in a laboratory setting. Together, these findings suggest that diurnal preference towards eveningness not only imposes threats on people’s health, but can also incur interpersonal costs. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

ABSTRACT: As a result of regulatory decisions, atmospheric deposition of most toxic metals and metalloids (MEs) has decreased in Europe over the past few decades. However, little is known about how this reduction translates into exposure at higher trophic levels in the terrestrial environment where temporal trends may be spatially heterogeneous due to local current or legacy sources of emissions (e.g., industry) or long-range transport of elements (e.g., marine transport). The aim of this study was to characterize temporal and spatial trends of exposure to MEs in terrestrial food webs using a predatory bird, the tawny owl Strix aluco, as a biomonitor. Toxic (Al, As, Cd, Hg, Pb) and essential/beneficial (B, Co, Cu, Mn, Se) elemental concentrations were measured in feathers of nest-captured females from 1986 to 2016, extending a previous study published over the time-series 1986–2005 (n = 1051), in a breeding population in Norway. A drastic decline over time was shown for the toxic MEs (−97 % for Pb, −89 % for Cd, −48 % for Al, and −43 % for As) except Hg. The beneficial elements B, Mn, and Se showed oscillations but an overall decline (−86 %, −34 %, and −12 %, respectively) whereas the essentials Co and Cu did not exhibit significant trends. The distance to potential sources of contamination influenced both the spatial patterns of concentrations in owl feathers and their temporal trends. The accumulation of As, Cd, Co, Mn and Pb was overall higher in the vicinity of sites recorded as polluted, and a greater temporal decrease of As, B, and Cd concentrations was found in the areas of further distance to polluted sites. The decrease of Pb concentrations was sharper further from the coast during the 1980s than in coastal areas, while the opposite was observed for Mn. The levels of Hg and Se were higher in coastal areas, and Hg temporal trends differed according to the distance to the coast. This study highlights the valuable insights provided by long-term survey of wildlife exposure to pollutants and landscape indicators to reveal regional or local patterns and detect unexpected events, data that are crucial for regulation and conservation of ecosystem health. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Bird strikes at airports pose a human-wildlife conflict (HWC) present in the world's major cities. Conflict mitigation frequently encompasses translocation, but its effectiveness in resolving HWCs is unclear. Here, we used the Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia) as a model species to test the effectiveness of translocation in reducing the number of bird strikes, the primary HWC at airports. We explored the translocation process, focusing on 3 aspects: 1) the influence of landscape structure on the persistence time of translocated animals at the released sites, 2) the influence of the release distance from the source on the return of translocated animals, and 3) the strike rate involving the species at the capture site at Brasília International Airport (BSB). Our results did not support burrowing owl translocation as a management option for solving the HWC at the BSB. We also found that the landscape composition did not guarantee individual persistence since the animals did not remain at release sites, regardless of the spatial configuration. Release distance did not explain the frequency of return of translocated animals to the capture site. Finally, we registered a higher number of collisions during translocation management. Thus, we believe that wildlife management programs must monitor translocated animals assessing if translocations are suited for the context. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Owls (Strigiformes) play an important ecological role as predators that structure and organize biological communities. Specialized owl species dependent on old-growth forests have suffered declines because of forest loss or degradation by human activities. Few studies have been conducted on Neotropical owls, especially in the Piedmont Forest of Northwestern Argentina. The scarcity of information on habitat requirements and the effect of human impacts preclude the establishment of conservation and management activities. The human footprint index (HFI) is a tool for mapping human impacts on biodiversity that is used at global and regional scales, based on the estimated and standardized contribution of different human impact variables (e.g. road networks, urban centers, agricultural land, etc.). The objectives of this work were to: 1) Determine the call rate of five owl species in the Piedmont Forest of Northwestern Argentina, 2) relate forest structure to the call rate of owl species, and 3) relate human footprint index to the call rate of owls. We placed 28 automatic recorders in the Piedmont Forest, in sites with low and high Human influence, and characterized the forest structure around each recorder within a circular plot of 25 m diameter. We obtained 241 vocalizations in 168 intervals of 2 h for Ferruginous pygmy owl (Glaucidium brasilianum), Tropical screech-owl (Megascops choliba), Black-banded owl (Ciccaba huhula), Spectacled owl (Pulsatrix perspicillata), and Buff-fronted owl (Aegolius harrisii). We found that for Tropical screech-owl live tree basal area had a positive and diameter at breast height standard deviation had a negative influence on call rate. While for Black-banded owl, the dead tree density had a positive and human footprint index >1 had a negative influence on call rate. For Spectacled owl, dead tree density and human footprint index >1 had a negative influence on call rate. We provide first insights into the effects of forest structure and human influence on the call rate of owls in the Piedmont Forest of Northwestern Argentina, information that may guide forest management guidelines and conservation strategies. © 2022 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Based on the results of trapping and ringing long-eared owls on the Curonian Spit in Kaliningrad oblast in the amount of 3391 individuals during 1957–2016, the population numbers, the migration routes and wintering grounds, the age structure, and the causes of bird death were studied. The overall efficiency of ringing was 3.01%, but the number of ring recoveries decreased significantly over time. The annual number of long-eared owls captured varied widely over 60 years, from 1 to 365 individuals. The oscillations were wave-like in nature and showed different amplitudes. In this regard, we discuss the numbers of long-eared owls and the degree of their territorial mobility in relation to abundance variations in the voles as their main food objects. Among the migrating owls, immature individuals (83%) and females (65%) predominated, and the longevity record was 16 years and 3 months. Of all 102 ring recoveries, only 16 birds were found alive. The main direction of flights in autumn was from south to west. The largest number of ring recoveries indicating the main flyways and wintering grounds came from Germany and neighboring countries at latitudes of 50°–54°N. Some ring recoveries indicate the origins of the populations of long-eared owls migrating through the Curonian Spit, since subsequently they were found is Lithuania, Latvia, Belarus, Finland, as well as on different territories of Russia, from Leningrad oblast to Tatarstan. © 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Monitoring the vocal behavior of owls is challenging because of their nocturnal habits and limited vocal activity. Here, we evaluated the use of passive acoustic monitoring coupled with automated signal recognition software to monitor the spontaneous vocal activity of the Ferruginous Pygmy-Owl (Glaucidium brasilianum) over a complete annual cycle at five recording stations in the Brazilian Pantanal. The vocal behavior of this species was concentrated during the crepuscular periods, with highest vocal activity in the hours prior to sunrise. The Ferruginous Pygmy-Owl was vocally active throughout the year, but the species showed a peak of activity from June to August. Paired Ferruginous Pygmy-Owl males tend to perform territorial calls less often during the nestling period, which may partly explain the significant decrease in the vocal activity after August. Our results suggest that the breeding period of the species starts in June, and the nesting phase probably occurs from September onwards, when the wet season starts. The first rains in seasonal tropical areas are usually associated with an increase in food availability, which may explain the species´ breeding period onset. Future surveys aiming to monitor the species, avoiding the use of broadcast calls, should be performed before sunrise between June and August, when the vocal activity was maximal. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Western Barn Owls hunt primarily small mammals in open areas, but they also hunt in urban, forest and wetland habitats. The landscape structure of their hunting range, therefore, affects the composition of their prey, knowledge of which can be a good starting point for estimating the size of their hunting range. Our goal was to estimate whether owls catch most of their prey within a circle with radius of 1, 2, 3, 4 or even 5 kilometres. In this study, we used five pellet samples of different size, collected between 2015 and 2019 from a settlement near the Drava River (Péterhida, Hungary). Our results showed that the annual distribution, diversity, and evenness of small mammal species detected from the samples was similar regardless of the sample size. The distribution of small mammal functional groups preferring urban, open, forest and wetland habitats was also similar. For this reason, the pellet samples were merged. Our results suggest that Western Barn Owls catch a significant part of their prey within a circle of 2-kilometre radius around its breeding or roosting site in the landscape, which consists of patches of habitat with a mosaic distribution. In a hunting range of this size, the proportion of small mammal functional groups preferring different habitats obtained from the pellets overlapped with the proportion of their preferred habitats.  © 2023 Dávid Szép et al., published by Sciendo.

ABSTRACT: Apex predators make excellent bioindicators of habitat quality and anthropogenic changes. Eagle owls (Bubo bubo) are such apex and keystone predators, who show preferential nest-site selection, usually away from human activities and habitation. However, Israel is a small country with a burgeoning human population. Hence, in order to understand the habitat requirements of eagle owls in central Israel, we conducted a multi-scale model analysis on their existing nest sites between 2006 and 2010. We identified 203 successful breeding attempts at 73 different sites. Our data suggested that the breeding population of the eagle owls was limited by the availability of quality nest locations, i.e., quarries, and caves. The probability of an eagle pair breeding increased with the presence of both quarries and caves, but was not related to mesohabitat properties. In addition, eagle owl breeding densities were positively related to the number of nest localities and to the planted woodlands. Furthermore, we found that eagle owls successfully raised their young regardless of the surrounding mesohabitat and sought the presence of other potential nest sites in the vicinity of the active nest sites, most likely due to the owls’ opportunistic and generalist hunting behavior, which facilitated the consumption of a wide prey base. Appropriate nest sites (quarries and caves) appeared to increase population numbers and, therefore, should be protected Further studies should determine whether increasing artificial nest sites and reclaiming abandoned quarries could increase eagle owl numbers in a sustainable manner. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Adenoviruses have been reported to infect a variety of birds. Here, we isolated a novel adenovirus from the liver of a dead owl chick (Bengal eagle owl; Bubo bengalensis) at a raptor-breeding facility in Japan and determined the complete genome sequence of the virus. We performed necropsies on the dead owl chicks and found that they had enlarged livers, pericardial edema, and focal necrosis of the liver tissue. Transmission electron microscopy of the liver tissue revealed a virus-like structure, appearing as paracrystalline arrays in the nucleus, and immunohistochemical staining with anti-adenovirus antibodies showed positive reactions in hepatocytes and other cells. Attempts to isolate the virus from homogenized liver tissue of a dead owl chick showed a cytopathic effect on chicken-derived cultured cells after multiple blind passages. Further, we determined the complete genome sequence of this virus and performed phylogenetic analysis, revealing that this adenovirus belongs to the genus Aviadenovirus, forming a cluster with fowl and turkey aviadenoviruses. The amino acid sequence divergence between the DNA polymerase of this virus and its closest known adenovirus relative is approximately 29%, implying that this virus can be assigned to a new species in the genus Aviadenovirus. Based on our data, this novel owl adenovirus is a likely cause of fatal infections in owls, which may threaten wild and captive owl populations. Further, this virus is unique among raptor adenoviruses in that it infects chicken-derived cultured cells, raising the importance of further investigations to evaluate interspecies transmission of this virus. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Plastic waste has become a hot topic in sustainability and conservation, helped in part by popular documentaries which have highlighted the issue to the general public. Much of the current literature focuses on the effect of microplastics in the marine environment, with very little information on macroplastic interactions or the terrestrial environment. In this report, the management of digit constriction due to macroplastic debris in a Verreaux’s eagle owl (Bubo lacteus) is presented, and the role of zoos in decreasing littering behaviour both within the collection and in the wider global context is discussed. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The Short-eared Owl (Asio flammeus) is a species of conservation concern in the western USA, with evidence for declining population sizes. Monitoring of Short-eared Owls is complicated because of their low site fidelity and nomadic movements. We recruited community-science participants to implement a multi-year survey of Short-eared Owls across eight states in the western USA, resulting in a program of sufficient temporal and spatial dimensions to overcome many of the challenges in monitoring this species. We implemented both multi-scale occupancy and colonization/extinction modeling to provide insights into land-cover use, and to identify which cover types supported higher occurrence. Short-eared Owls were associated with native and anthropogenic land-cover types, but site occupancy varied among these categories and at different scales. Native grasslands, marsh/riparian, hay/fallow agriculture, and cultivated croplands were occupied most consistently across years. Occupancy rates differed at different scales (e.g., marsh/ riparian was the only land-cover type positively associated with occupancy at both transect and point scales). Contrary to expectations, native shrubland was negatively associated with occupancy at the point scale, and exhibited low colonization and high extinction rates. Our results suggest that conserving native landscapes in general, and grasslands, marsh, and riparian areas specifically, would benefit Short-eared Owls. Furthermore, Short-eared Owl occupancy was positively associated with hay/fallow land-cover types, suggesting that some nonnative land-cover types can function as Short-eared Owl habitat. Lastly, our results highlight how developing a broad-scale community science survey can inform conservation for a species not well monitored by existing survey programs.  © 2022 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The powerful owl (Ninox strenua) is a threatened apex predator that consumes mainly arboreal marsupial prey. Low density populations reside in urban landscapes where their viability is tenuous. The catalyst for this research was the reported death of eight powerful owls around Melbourne, Australia, in less than one year (2020/2021). Eighteen deceased owls were toxicologically screened. We assessed toxic metals (Mercury Hg, Lead Pb, Cadmium Cd and Arsenic As) and anticoagulant rodenticides (ARs) in liver (n = 18 owls) and an extensive range of agricultural chemicals in muscle (n = 14). Almost all agricultural chemicals were below detection limits except for p,p-DDE, which was detected in 71% of birds at relatively low levels. Toxic metals detected in some individuals were generally at low levels. However, ARs were detected in 83.3% of powerful owls. The most common second-generation anticoagulant rodenticide (SGAR) detected was brodifacoum, which was present in every bird in which a rodenticide was detected. Brodifacoum was often present at toxic levels and in some instances at potentially lethal levels. Presence of brodifacoum was detected across the complete urban-forest/agriculture gradient, suggesting widespread exposure. Powerful owls do not scavenge but prey upon arboreal marsupials, and generally not rodents, suggesting that brodifacoum is entering the powerful owl food web via accidental or deliberate poisoning of non-target species (possums). We highlight a critical need to investigate SGARs in food webs globally, and not just in species directly targeted for poisoning or their predators. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The Mexican Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis lucida; hereafter spotted owl) is discontinuously distributed in the United States and Mexico. It is an understudied raptor and categorized as near threatened, with populations in rapid decline. Defining the distribution of the spotted owl can help delineate priority areas for monitoring and research. Using the Maxent algorithm, with seven climatic variables and 153 owl presence records, we generated the potential distribution of spotted owl in Mexico. Our distribution model had high predictive accuracy and defined potential areas in the Sierra Madre Occidental, Sierra Madre Oriental, and the Transverse Neovolcanic Belt. These areas were concentrated in the states of Durango, Zacatecas, Jalisco, Aguascalientes, and Chihuahua, as well as within four protected natural areas. Four weather variables contributed 81.8% to the model's prediction: mean diurnal temperature range (BIO 2, 33.5%), maximum temperature of the warmest month (BIO 5, 30.4%), mean temperature of the coldest quarter (BIO 11, 10.5%) and the amount of precipitation in the wettest month (BIO 13, 7.4%). We recommend population monitoring in areas of climatic suitability predicted by the model to improve knowledge about the status of the Mexican Spotted Owl.  © 2022 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Islands, and the particular organisms that populate them, have long fascinated biologists. Due to their isolation, islands offer unique opportunities to study the effect of neutral and adaptive mechanisms in determining genomic and phenotypical divergence. In the Canary Islands, an archipelago rich in endemics, the barn owl (Tyto alba), present in all the islands, is thought to have diverged into a subspecies (T. a. gracilirostris) on the eastern ones, Fuerteventura and Lanzarote. Taking advantage of 40 whole-genomes and modern population genomics tools, we provide the first look at the origin and genetic makeup of barn owls of this archipelago. We show that the Canaries hold diverse, long-standing and monophyletic populations with a neat distinction of gene pools from the different islands. Using a new method, less sensitive to structure than classical FST, to detect regions involved in local adaptation to insular environments, we identified a haplotype-like region likely under selection in all Canaries individuals and genes in this region suggest morphological adaptations to insularity. In the eastern islands, where the subspecies is present, genomic traces of selection pinpoint signs of adapted body proportions and blood pressure, consistent with the smaller size of this population living in a hot arid climate. In turn, genomic regions under selection in the western barn owls from Tenerife showed an enrichment in genes linked to hypoxia, a potential response to inhabiting a small island with a marked altitudinal gradient. Our results illustrate the interplay of neutral and adaptive forces in shaping divergence and early onset speciation. © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Resources allocated in reproduction are traded off against those invested in self-maintenance such as antioxidant response. Glutathione (GSH) is an intracellular antioxidant defence that scavenges reactive oxygen species, the deleterious byproducts of oxygen consumption. Given the role of intracellular GSH in pheomelanogenesis, a trade-off in GSH allocation between resistance in oxidative stress and melanin production may take place. To investigate how intracellular GSH is regulated in differently coloured individuals at the time of reproduction (in adults) and of intense melanogenesis (in nestlings), we measured the total pool of GSH produced (tGSH), consumed (oxGSH) and available (redGSH) in adult tawny owls and their offspring which were cross-fostered between randomly chosen nests. Our goal was to describe potential correlations between resistance in oxidative stress and colour morphs in natural conditions. Nestling GSH levels were correlated with GSH levels in their genetic and foster parents suggesting that producing GSH is genetically and environmentally determined (although the effect of the foster nest seemed stronger). This species shows continuous variation in pheomelanin reddish colouration, which is associated with life-history strategies. Based on the hypothesis of GSH dependence of pheomelanism, we expected a greater amount of oxGSH in dark compared to light pheomelanic nestlings, which was not the case. In contrast, light melanic breeding adults had higher levels of tGSH and redGSH than dark breeders probably because of a higher investment in antioxidant capacity. The link between pheomelanism and GSH may therefore be due to the fact that differently colored individuals have different life-history strategies rather than because the production of pheomelanin pigments requires GSH. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: It is important to understand how animals respond to changes in landscape structure, especially when considering habitat alteration and urbanization. Using the burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia) as an ecological model we tested two hypotheses: (1) the landscape of urban areas influences trajectories of the burrowing owl, which responds changing its displacement patterns, and (2) models incorporating species-specific traits, such as stochasticity and landscape perception, better predict flight trajectories than least-cost path models. Thirty owls were captured at the Brasília International Airport, fitted with VHF transmitters, and released in random locations within 30 km of the airport. We generated a habitat suitability map for use as a resistance raster to model flight trajectories: one model was based on the least-cost path, and four models included stochasticity and variations of the owls’ landscape perception and dependency on natural ecosystems. Observed trajectories were compared with those predicted by models using the following metrics extracted from the trajectories: mean habitat suitability values, sinuosity, and length. The best generalized linear models were selected using the Akaike information criterion. The owls dispersed through areas with a lower cost than expected by chance (z = 104.65, p < 0.05). More complex models performed better than the least-cost path model for suitability (r2 = 0.18, p > 0.05), sinuosity (r2 = 0.03, p > 0.05), and length (r2 = 0.37, p > 0.05). Our results demonstrate that landscape information influences flight trajectories, and models incorporating landscape perception and stochasticity better predict burrowing owl flight trajectories. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Owl monkeys (genus Aotus), or “night monkeys” are platyrrhine primates in the Aotidae family. Early taxonomy only recognized one species, Aotus trivirgatus, until 1983, when Hershkovitz proposed nine unique species designations, classified into red-necked and gray-necked species groups based predominately on pelage coloration. Recent studies questioned this conventional separation of the genus and proposed designations based on the geographical location of wild populations. Alu retrotransposons are a class of mobile element insertion (MEI) widely used to study primate phylogenetics. A scaffold-level genome assembly for one Aotus species, Aotus nancymaae [Anan_2.0], facilitated large-scale ascertainment of nearly 2000 young lineage-specific Alu insertions. This study provides candidate oligonucleotides for locus-specific PCR assays for over 1350 of these elements. For 314 Alu elements across four taxa with multiple specimens, PCR analyses identified 159 insertion polymorphisms, including 21 grouping A. nancymaae and Aotus azarae (red-necked species) as sister taxa, with Aotus vociferans and A. trivirgatus (gray-necked) being more basal. DNA sequencing identified five novel Alu elements from three different taxa. The Alu datasets reported in this study will assist in species identification and provide a valuable resource for Aotus phylogenetics, population genetics and conservation strategies when applied to wild populations. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Urbanization creates new ecological conditions that can affect biodiversity at all levels, including the diversity and prevalence of parasites of species that may occupy these environments. However, few studies have compared bird–ectoparasite interactions between urban and rural individuals. Here, we analyze the ectoparasite community and co-infection patterns of urban and rural burrowing owls, Athene cunicularia, to assess the influence of host traits (i.e., sex, age, and weight), and environmental factors (i.e., number of conspecifics per nest, habitat type and aridity) on its composition. Ectoparasites of burrowing owls included two lice, one flea, and one mite. The overall prevalence for mites, lice and fleas was 1.75%, 8.76% and 3.50%, respectively. A clear pattern of co-infection was detected between mites and fleas and, to less extent, between mites and lice. Adult owls harbored fewer ectoparasites than nestlings, and adult females harbored more lice than males. Our results also show that mite and flea numbers were higher when more conspecifics cohabited the same burrow, while lice showed the opposite pattern. Rural individuals showed higher flea parasitism and lower mite parasitism than urban birds. Moreover, mite numbers were negatively correlated with aridity and host weight. Although the ectoparasitic load of burrowing owls appears to be influenced by individual age, sex, number of conspecifics per nest, and habitat characteristics, the pattern of co-infection found among ectoparasites could also be mediated by unexplored factors such as host immune response, which deserves further research. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Montane temperate forests in central and southern Europe host diverse small mammal assemblages, but the fluctuations in these assemblages in correlation with owl predators are still poorly explored. The key questions of our study were how coexisting owls responded to different prey fluctuations and whether any particular small mammal species governed predator–prey co-dynamics. We conducted a long-term study (2004–2020) in low-elevation (300–1100 m above sea level) mixed Beech and Silver Fir forest in the northern Dinaric Alps (central Slovenia). Monitoring data on the main small mammal groups – mice Muridae, voles Cricetidae, dormice Gliridae and shrews Soricidae – and three owl species – the Ural Owl Strix uralensis, Tawny Owl Strix aluco and Boreal Owl Aegolius funereus – were collected annually. To find relationships between prey and predator populations, we used two types of supervised machine learning approaches and addressed three predictive modelling tasks of multi-target regression. The dominant species in the small mammal assemblage, the Yellow-necked Mouse Apodemus flavicollis, had a key role in determining predator populations and their breeding performance. We noted higher sensitivity to small mammal fluctuations in boreal zone owl species (Boreal Owl and Ural Owl), which reach their southern distribution limit in the Dinaric Alps, whereas the temperate zone species (Tawny Owl) seemed to be less affected. In years of prey shortage, the Boreal Owl was found to presumably abandon its territories, the Ural Owl suppressed breeding and the Tawny Owl sustained breeding activity by shifting prey selection. Low-elevation forests appeared to be suboptimal habitat for the competitive subordinate Boreal Owl, which may exploit occasional outbreaks of small mammal populations in these habitats even in the presence of larger competitors. Whether low-elevation forests can play a role in maintaining threatened and cold-adapted Boreal Owl populations in central and southern Europe in the face of recent ecosystem changes due to climate and environmental changes remains an open scientific question. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Adult barn owls and primates possess an almost symmetric monocular rotational horizontal optocollic reflex. In primates, the reflex is initially asymmetric and becomes symmetric with time after birth. The condition in barn owls has not been studied so far. Here, we present data on the development of this reflex in this bird. We tested juvenile barn owls from the time before they open their eyes after hatching to the time they reach adult feather length. Wide-field visual patterns served as stimuli. They were presented at different rotational speeds in binocular and monocular settings. The binocular horizontal optocollic responses of juvenile barn owls were symmetric and adult-like on the first day that the birds responded to the stimulus. The monocular responses showed different rates of development in respect to stimulus velocity and stimulus direction. For velocities up to 20 deg/s, the monocular reflex was also adult-like on the first day that the birds responded to the stimulus. An initially higher asymmetry for 30 deg/s compared to adults disappeared within about two weeks. The development at even higher velocities remained unclear. © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Studying current and future geographic distribution is essential for conserving endangered species such as the Boreal Owl and Eurasian Pygmy Owl. The main aim of this study was to determine the potential distribution of both species in the Balkan Peninsula by using spatial distribution models (SDMs) in MaxEnt. We used data from field surveys, the scientific and grey literature, and an online database. We considered the current time and two future periods, 2041–2060 and 2061–2080. For future periods, we included different climate scenarios (SSP 126, 245, 370, and 585) in studying the potential geographic distribution of both species. We identified two types of potential future refugia for species: in situ and ex situ. Our study shows the highly suitable area for the Boreal Owl increased during the 2041–2060 period compared with the current area in all scenarios, except in SSP 585. However, during the 2061–2080 period, the highly suitable areas contracted. For the Eurasian Pygmy Owl, highly suitable areas decreased during 2041–2060, but during the 2061–2080 period, it was larger than the current area. Our study is of importance for conservation and preserving areas of potential distribution and refugia for Boreal and Eurasian Pygmy Owls in the face of climate change. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Landscape configuration can influence the distribution of species across multiple spatial scales. The primary factors related to this process are connectivity, the size and position of habitat patches, and edge effects. These factors together determine the overall fragmentation of a landscape, which in turn influences species occurrence. Although some species show a negative response to fragmentation, others benefit from it. Potential effects may act over multiple spatial scales, possibly with contrasting effects on species occurrence. We chose the Tawny Owl (Strix aluco), a ubiquitous and generalist species, to study the influence of fragmentation on species occurrence and to identify relevant landscape metrics, using multi-scale hierarchical modelling. Between 2016 and 2018, we recorded Tawny Owls on 64 sampling sites located in a forested landscape. We used a space-for-time substitution in the framework of occupancy modelling to assess Tawny Owl responses to landscape fragmentation. We found that the Tawny Owl is widespread in the study area. Its distribution across the landscape (larger spatial scale) was related to a heterogeneous configuration of forest patches, while high connectivity of coniferous forest influenced its occurrence at a smaller spatial scale (sites). Overall, the Tawny Owl prefers landscapes with well-connected forest patches and an uneven patch distribution in the surrounding area.  © 2022 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Microplastics (MPs) are recognised as an emerging environmental problem that needs to be carefully monitored. So far, MPs have been widely recorded in marine and freshwater ecosystems. Still, few studies have focused on MP occurrence in terrestrial ecosystems, although soils are suspected to be one of the main MP reservoirs. To test a non-invasive method for assessing MP contamination in terrestrial ecosystems, we analysed the pellets of a top terrestrial predator, the barn owl (Tyto alba). Sixty pellets were collected from three agricultural areas (20 pellets each) and analysed to assess both barn owl diet and MP content. Thirty-four MPs were confirmed by micro-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (μ-FTIR) analysis in 33% of the pellets (min-max 1–5 MPs per pellet). Most of the detected items were microfibres (88.2%). Polyethylene terephthalate, polyacrylonitrile and polyamide were the most abundant polymers. One of the three sites was significantly less contaminated. In the two sites with the highest MP occurrences, barn owl diet was characterised by predation on synanthropic rodents, particularly brown rats (Rattus norvegicus), which may indicate habitat degradation and increased exposure to MPs. Analyses also suggest that Savi's pine vole (Microtus savii) is the prey least at risk of MP contamination, probably due to its strictly herbivorous diet. We argue that the analysis of barn owl pellets may represent a cost-effective method for monitoring MP contamination in terrestrial ecosystems. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Mitigation translocations are increasing and if they are to fulfill their regulatory intent, the application of best-practice principles to release strategy and monitoring is required. With an investment of 3 years, we engaged with stakeholders, including developers, to improve outcomes from mitigation translocations of an at-risk species, the western burrowing owl Athene cunicularia hypugaea (BUOW). We evaluated the consequences of two primary translocation methods, displacement (i.e. exclusion from burrow) and translocation, against control owls, using a suite of success metrics focused on dispersal, survival and reproduction. We also tested the provision of visual and acoustic conspecific cues to dampen dispersal away from release sites. Within the displaced group, BUOW settled closer to the origin site if burrows were available nearby. Although translocated BUOW dispersed farther from the release site than displaced BUOW, this difference disappeared when conspecific cues were present. BUOW were 20 times more likely to settle at the release site when conspecifics or their cues were present. Translocating animals over longer distances (>17.5 km) reduced the incidence of BUOW returning to the origin site. When avoiding direct impacts to BUOW is not feasible, a determination of the most beneficial translocation method must be made, driven by site-specific conditions and the feasibility of implementing best management practices. The known costs of translocation to survival may be offset by long-term advantages such as the establishment of breeding populations inside protected areas. Mitigation translocations can benefit from carefully devised and tested hypotheses to determine what works and what does not; we advocate the increased use of evidence in mitigation translocation to guide management decisions and policies. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The relative abundance of small mammal species detected from Common Barn-owl pellets reflects the landscape structure and habitat pattern of the owl’s hunting area, but it is also affected by the size of the collected pellet sample and the size of the supposed hunting area. The questions arise: how many pellets should be collected and analyzed as well as how large hunting area should be taken into consideration in order to reach the best correspondence between the owl’s prey composition and the distribution of habitats preferred by small mammals preyed in supposed hunting areas? For this study, we collected 1045 Common Barn-owl pellets in a village in southern Hungary. All detected small mammal species were classified into functional groups (guilds) preferring urban, open, forest and wetland habitats. The proportion of functional groups was compared to the proportion of these habitats around the pellet collection site within circles of one, two, and three km radius. Saturation curves showed that at least 300 pellets or ca. 600 mammalian remains are required for the detection of the 19 small mammal species. The share of small mammals detected in the prey and their functional groups according to their habitat preference showed an increasing consistency with the distribution of real habitats in the potential hunting area of a radius of 3 km around the owl’s breeding or resting place. © The Author(s) 2021.

ABSTRACT: Hypothesized reasons for the decline of many woodrat populations in the eastern United States include parasitism by raccoon roundworm (Baylisascaris procyonis; Ascaridida: Ascarididae), hard mast shortages, owl predation, and reductions in suitable structures (e.g., rock crevices) for nest construction. We investigated whether abundance and apparent survival of eastern woodrats (Neotoma floridana) within a successfully reintroduced metapopulation in southern Illinois could be predicted by factors underlying these hypothesized reasons for woodrat declines. We analyzed capture histories of 205 eastern woodrats from eight rock outcrop sites in summers of 2013 and 2014 to estimate local population size and apparent survival. We then used repeated-measures models to test how woodrat abundance and apparent survival were associated with availability of mast trees, owl abundance, risk of raccoon roundworm infection, and crevice availability. Mean monthly estimated woodrat abundance at sites ranged from 0.78 to 21.58 in 2013 and 0.48 to 18.08 in 2014, while monthly apparent survival ranged from 0.00 to 0.76 during the summers and 0.05 to 0.90 during the trapping intersession. Crevice availability was positively associated both with abundance and apparent survival of woodrats. Our results did not support the hypothesis that owls reduce woodrat populations because woodrat abundance was positively associated with owl abundance across sites. No raccoon roundworm eggs were found at any site. We conclude that crevice availability was the best predictor of woodrat population success in our study area, while owl abundance may be a proxy for other habitat variables or a response to woodrat abundance. Our findings suggest measures that could be taken to benefit woodrat survival and abundance.  © 2022 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Introduction: The Mexican spotted owl (Strix occidentalis lucida Nelson 1903) is a subspecies threatened by habitat destruction and sensitive to climate change. It is distributed in the old forests of the United States and Mexico. Objective: To determine the potential historical (1970-2000) and future (2021-2040, 2041-2060 y 2061-2080) distribution of the Mexican spotted owl under two climate change scenarios (SSP 245 and SSP 585). Materials and methods: Potential distribution was modeled using the R software with the MaxEnt algorithm, 155 geographically uncorrelated occurrence records, and five bioclimatic layers. Areas of environmental suitability were predicted for eight environmental management units in the United States and Mexico. Results and discussion: Three temperature variables contributed 93.1 % to the model prediction: mean diurnal range (44.8 %), maximum temperature of the warmest month (28.8 %) and average of the coldest quarter (19.5 %). Future scenarios showed gradual and continuous losses of suitable bioclimatic space for the bird in seven management units, especially in the high emissions scenario (SSP 585) in the Sierra Madre Oriental de México (-56.1 to -96.4 %). The Southern Rocky Mountains environmental management unit in the United States was the only one that gained suitable bioclimatic space (51.3 to 167.2 %) in all periods. Conclusion: Although changes are not significant, the loss of areas of bioclimatic suitability begins in 2030 and increases in 2041 and, therefore, climate change represents a current threat to this bird of prey. © 2022 Universidad Autonoma Chapingo.

ABSTRACT: With the popularization of mobile Internet and the continuous improvement of automation, the huge amount of data and information that WWW (World Wide Web) can contain is in an exponential explosive growth trend. OWL (Web Ontology Language) is the official WWW Ontology Language recommended by W3C and is extended by RDF and RDFS. It has strong semantic representation and description ability and is widely used in Semantic Web. However, because most real-life instances have temporal and spatial attributes, the original OWL language, which lacks the ability to express temporal and spatial attributes, no longer has good semantic representation ability. To solve the problem, we fuse the spatiotemporal attributes of the existing OWL conceptual triples and propose the methods for representing spatiotemporal data. Then we define spatiotemporal OWL class relationships and spatiotemporal extended OWL class relationships which mainly based on the fusion of spatiotemporal attributes. To better explain the definitions, we give some examples to illustrate the use of definitions in instances. Our definitions fuse spatiotemporal attributes into each element of the triples, and solve the problem that the previous definitions ignore that each element in triples has spatiotemporal attribute. These definitions make the relationship between classes more comprehensive, and make the model more applicable to spatiotemporal data. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: In Peninsular Malaysia, barn owls (Tyto javanica javanica) have been utilized as biological control of rats since the 1960s. In this study, the impact of introduced barn owls on rat populations in an oil palm plantation in Sabah, Malaysia, were studied. There were three treatment areas in this study: T1 (barn owl area) was an oil palm plot where no rodenticides were applied and rat control relied solely on predation of the introduced barn owls, T2 was an oil palm plot where one fixed baiting campaign was carried out per year, and T3 was an oil palm plot where two fixed baiting campaigns were carried out per year. Rat abundance and fresh fruit bunch (FFB) damage were assessed monthly throughout the four-year study period. The dominant species at all treatment areas was the House rat, Rattus rattus diardii. Both rat abundance and FFB damage were higher in the first year of study at all three treatment areas. FFB damage was lowest at T3 compared to the other two treatment areas throughout the entire study period, probably due to the intensive baiting carried out at T3. FFB damage at T1 was comparable to FFB damage at T2 (with the exception of the first year of study). Additionally, FFB damage at T1 after the first year was frequently below the 5% FFB damage threshold level. The results of this study indicate that introduced barn owl control of rat pests was sufficient for at least three years and perhaps more. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Seasonal migration is a widespread phenomenon undertaken by myriad organisms, including birds. Competing hypotheses about ultimate drivers of seasonal migration in birds contrast relative resource abundances at high latitudes (“southern home hypothesis”) against avoidance of winter resource scarcity (“dispersal-migration hypothesis”). However, direct tests of these competing hypotheses have been rare and to date limited to historical biogeographic reconstructions. Here we derive novel predictions about the dynamics of individual niches from each hypothesis and provide a framework for evaluating support for these competing hypotheses using contemporary environmental and behavioral data. Using flammulated owls (Psiloscops flammeolus) as a model, we characterized year-round occupied niche dynamics using high-resolution global positioning system tracking and remote-sensed environmental data. We also compared occupied niche dynamics to counterfactual niches using simulated alternative nonmigratory strategies. Owl occupied mean niche was conserved among seasons, whereas niche variance was generally higher during migratory periods. Simulated year-round residents in Mexico would have experienced putatively more productive niches than migrants. These findings provide ecological support for the “dispersal-migration” hypothesis in which winter resource scarcity is the primary driver of migration rather than summer resource abundances. © 2021 The Ecological Society of America.

ABSTRACT: Northern Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) are of management and conservation concern in the US Pacific Northwest where populations have been monitored since the 1990s using mark-resight methods. Passive acoustic monitoring has the potential to support monitoring efforts; however, its use is currently primarily restricted to determining species presence rather than breeding status. Distinguishing female from male Northern Spotted Owl vocalizations could facilitate determination of pair status using passive acoustic methods, greatly enhancing inference derived from noninvasive monitoring data. In 2017, we deployed 150 autonomous recording units (ARUs) within 30 5-km2 hexagons overlapping recently occupied owl territories in Oregon and Washington, USA, where mark-resight methods were simultaneously occurring. We collected approximately 150,000 hours of recordings and detected 22,458 Northern Spotted Owl vocalizations at 76 ARUs. We summarized vocalizations by call type and found differences in the proportion of call types made by single, paired, and nesting owls. We used expert opinion to classify 2812 four-note location calls as female or male. We summarized inter-sex variation within 19 acoustic attributes of the four-note location call and its subcomponents, and developed a mixed logistic regression model to classify sex based on call-segment acoustic attributes. Males generally called at lower frequencies than females, with mean fundamental frequencies of 556 Hz and 666 Hz, respectively. Male four-note location calls were also longer than female calls, with signal median times of 1.99 s and 1.71 s, respectively. The middle-two-note and the full-call segment of the four-note location call were both useful for classifying sex of the calling owl. Our top-ranked models were able to predict 82-83% of our testing data consistent with expert classification as either male or female with 98-99% accuracy (17-18% of test set was classified as unknown). Our results suggest that acoustic characteristics of Northern Spotted Owl calls captured with ARUs can be used to identify whether sites have males and/or females present, and we suggest that further investigation into the full repertoire of Northern Spotted Owl call types is warranted.  © 2022 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Scavenging by owls is rarely documented, and fidelity to a scavenged carcass is even less common. Herein we describe multiple visits by presumably the same Strix varia (Barred Owl) to a carcass over 4 consecutive nights during the breeding season. Our observations demonstrate higher site-fidelity than is typically reported for owls and suggest that opportunistic scavenging may occasionally represent a low-cost means of meeting energetic demands with potentially important consequences for individual survival during nesting. © 2022 Humboldt Field Research Institute.

ABSTRACT: For many species, the artificial raising of orphaned nestlings is a time and cost-prohibitive task, usually accompanied by low survivability. The introduction of orphaned nestlings to other natural nests was found to be a successful technique wherein fostered nestling(s) developed better in the wild and imprinting on humans is avoided. To date, the number of diurnal species in which induced alloparenting has been conducted is limited to several eagle species, falcons, buzzards, and vultures. In the owls, it has only been demonstrated to work in two species, but the eagle owl has not been studied in this aspect. Eagle Owls, amongst the largest of the owls with a geographic distribution stretching across Europe and Asia, are a favored species in the wildlife trade, and many a nestling is removed from the nest. In Israel, when reported or rescued, the nestlings are removed to the wildlife hospital where they are rehabilitated and then introduced into a wild nest with similarly aged nestlings. From 2009 to 2021 we conducted 44 successful adoptions of Eagle Owl orphans into active, wild nests. This success stresses the importance of our work as a conservation tool for the preservation of an apex predator across its breeding range. © 2022 Elsevier GmbH

ABSTRACT: We evaluated feathers as a non-destructive biomonitoring tool documenting organochlorine pesticides (OCP) in liver and checked possible trends in pesticide use in two areas based on OCP concentrations in barn owls (Tyto alba). We measured the concentrations of 16 OCP in 15 primary feathers and 15 livers from barn owl carcasses collected on roadsides in Tagus Valley and Évora regions, south Portugal. Total OCP mean concentration was 8 120 ng g−1 in feathers and 178 ng g−1 in livers. All compounds were detected in feathers while in livers δ-HCH, endosulfan sulphate, p,p′-DDT and p,p′-DDD were not detected. The high β-HCH and heptachlor concentrations in feathers most likely derived from external endogenous contamination. P,p′-DDE was the OCP with the highest hepatic concentration. Both matrices indicated an exposure to recently released heptachlor. The differing OCP concentrations between Tagus Valley and Évora seem to reflect differences in land-use and pesticide use histories of the two locations, and/or faster degradation of OCP in the Tagus area. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: In birds, early experiences determine the later behavioural phenotype of individuals and their way of adapting to the challenges they encounter in their environment. We investigated how the degree of exposure of barn owl chicks to humans and their biological parents influenced their behavioural response to humans and different environments. Only the treatment groups raised by human beings, or those that remained for less time with their biological parents (15 days posthatching), learned to fly towards their trainer. However, the two groups of chicks that were raised the longest by their biological parents (20 and 25 days) never flew towards their trainer. In these last groups, the filial imprint was shown not to be able to be reversed. Neophobia was estimated to emerge between 17 and 19 days of age, as barn owls were able to recognize the environment in which they were habituated, showing fear of a new environment. Birds were able to recognize the person who raised them and objects with which they had been raised. The results obtained in this work can help to establish breeding protocols in this and other species of birds of prey, which improve their adaptability to the environment where they will live, whether in captivity or in the wild. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Wind power is useful for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but the construction and operation might have negative effects on biodiversity. The purpose of this study was to investigate any effects of wind farm and power line construction on territory occupancy in the vulnerable Eurasian eagle owl. We investigated 48 eagle owl territories before and after the whole construction period and a short operation period with the use of sound meters. We found that territorial eagle owls within 4–5 km from the wind farm and power line construction disturbance left their territories to a significantly higher extent (41% reduction in the number of territories with eagle owls) compared with the eagle owls in territories further away (23% reduction). The distance from the nest site to the disturbance was significantly shorter for those territories that were abandoned compared with territories where the birds stayed. Possible reasons for this decline might be a higher mortality caused by collisions, desertion and avoidance of wind power areas caused by the noise and disturbance from their construction. In addition, there are possible indirect effects, for example reductions in prey species may force eagle owls to abandon their territories. The construction period lasted much longer than the period with active wind turbines and power lines in this investigation, but we cannot separate the effects of the two because the investigations were only possible in the eagle owl breeding season, and the wind turbines were activated shortly after the construction period. Our results imply that careful investigations are needed to detect the possible occurrence of eagle owls near any type of construction work. Studies of these territories should strongly influence how and when the construction work can be carried out, but more investigations are needed to find details about the influence of distance. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to obtain an effective tool for sex determination in Eurasian Eagle Owls (Bubo bubo), a species without marked sexual dimorphism, by taking external body and bone measurements. Thirty-one individuals were used for this purpose, 16 males and 15 females, and 42 measurements were obtained: 19 external and 23 bone measurements. Three discriminant analyses were carried out: The first with external measurements only, a second one with bone measurements only, and a third combining both. The validation of the classification was performed by cross-validation. The first analysis led to a discrimination function with five external measures, with a Wilk’s Lambda of 0.064 and 100% of the individuals classified correctly. The second analysis led to a discrimination function with two bone measures, with a Wilk’s Lambda of 0.282 and 90% of individuals correctly classified. The third analysis led to a discrimination function with six external and two bone measures, with a Wilk’s Lambda of 0.022 and 100% of individuals classified correctly. The study has shown that external measurements are more efficient than bone measurements, and likely sufficient for sexing. Nevertheless, bone measurements can provide complementary information, although alone they are insufficient for sexing owls, given that the length of the ulna and the nose bones were the only useful bone measurements. It can be generalized that this work provides an optimal sexing method, useful in ornithological ecology, clinical and forensic medicine, as well as in archaeozoological studies. © 2022 by the author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: Owl monkeys (Aotus infulatus) are frequently affected by heart diseases and, as in humans, dyslipidemia is one of the predisposing factors for adverse cardiovascular events. In view of this, the study of the lipid profile and plasma apolipoproteins can contribute to the clinical management of this neotropical primate species. Methods: Lipid profile as well as A-1 and B apolipoprotein values were analyzed in 60 owl monkeys, studying their relationship with body biometry and the presence of cardiac alterations. Results: Animals suspected of having heart disease did not show significant differences (p <.05) in terms of biometry or in relation to lipid profile and apolipoproteins A-1 and B values; however, higher values of LDL and ApoB and ApoB/ApoA-1 were observed in this group. Conclusions: This study is the first to describe the lipid profile and apolipoprotein values in owl monkeys, and further work will be needed to better elucidate the worthiness of LDL, ApoB, and the ApoB/ApoA-1 ratio in this primate species. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

ABSTRACT: The alternative prey hypothesis (APH) states that temporally synchronous population fluctuations of microtine rodents and other small herbivores are caused by generalist predators that show functional and numerical responses to the abundance of microtines. This would lead to an increased predation of alternative prey in the low phase of the microtine population fluctuations. One candidate for such a predator is the tree-climbing pine marten (Martes martes), which includes bird eggs in its diet, among them eggs of the cavity-nesting boreal owl (Aegolius funereus). I used long-term data to test whether pine marten predation of boreal owl eggs in nest boxes varied as predicted by the APH. The probability of predation of owl nests situated < 45 km from a site where microtines were trapped in spring during four decades increased with microtine trapping index, which is opposite to the prediction from the APH. As the data set was limited to one nest per box, I extended it spatially and temporally using the clutch size of each boreal owl nest as a proxy for the actual microtine abundance at the site. The probability of nest predation increased with clutch size. However, the effects of microtine index and owl clutch size became non-significant when I controlled for habitat, and in particular cavity age, which had an overriding effect. The increase in predation probability with cavity age suggests that the long-term spatial memory of pine marten is an important factor in the pattern of its nest predation in tree cavities. © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: The scleral ring in birds consists of ossicles that are fixed as small plates by cartilage joints and have no articulation to other parts of the skeleton. Objective: Due to inadequate examination of the scleral ring anatomy and its specific form in owls, this study aimed to investigate the exact structure of the scleral ring and some morphometric characteristics of the eyeball in a long-eared owl (Asio otus). Methods: The eyes of 20 alive and 10 dead male and female owls were examined. In addition to common anatomical methods, computed tomography scans and radiographic and ultrasonographic imaging techniques were used in this study. Results: The structure consisted of 15 ossicles. In the ventral part of the ring, these tubercles were observed in the scleral rings of all owls; in each ring, there were four bones with these tubercles. Additionally, there was no significant difference between the left and right eye parameters. Most ocular parameters in female owls were larger than those in males, but in the case of some parameters, such as optic nerve length and optic nerve sheath diameter, this difference was not observed. Conclusions: According to this study, the scleral ring in the Asio otus has anterior and posterior parts, and the lens is in the immediate vicinity of the anterior part. The right and left scleral rings and eyeballs are bilaterally symmetrical in terms of the shape, size, and number of ossicles that form the ring. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: This report describes successful transspecies blood transfusion from a Magellanic horned owl (Bubo virginianus magellanicus) to a barn owl (Tyto alba). The barn owl was admitted to a wildlife rehabilitation center with severe anemia (packed cell volume [PCV] = 6.7%) from suspected anticoagulant rodenticide poisoning. Procedures performed included patient stabilization, pharmacological treatment, and persistent monitoring following the blood transfusion. The patient's PCV was measured daily, increasing progressively, and attaining a normal value for the species (PCV > 40%) on the eighth day posttransfusion. With no possibility of obtaining a same-species donor and because of the serious condition of the patient and unfavorable prognosis, a decision was made to perform the xenotransfusion. The result was a successful recovery and ultimately the release of the owl into its natural habitat. We concluded that xenotransfusion for avian species should be considered in cases with no possibility of obtaining a homologous donor.  © 2022 Association of Avian Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Nest boxes have been used for years to increase breeding bird numbers for conservation and also in biological pest control projects. Barn owls (Tyto alba) have been used as biological pest control agents for rodents for years, and since nest boxes are costly for growers there is a need to determine whether nest box placement can increase the occupation of nest boxes and breeding success. We studied whether barn owl breeding in agricultural areas varied in nest boxes located on trees, poles located in the shade, and poles in the sun. The occupation of nest boxes was highest in nest boxes located on trees, followed by poles in the shade, and finally poles in the sun. In comparison, the number of fledglings was highest for nest boxes on poles in the sun followed by poles in the shade in the first half of the breeding season, whereas more nestlings were fledged in nest boxes on trees in the second part of the breeding season, which is most likely due to the higher internal temperatures in the nest boxes located in the sun. Interestingly, all the nest boxes’ internal temperatures were lower than the ambient temperatures but were much lower on trees than those on poles, most likely due to the trees providing better protection from the heat. It is therefore important to not only consider the placement of nest boxes, but how occupation and breeding success may vary seasonally. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Many nocturnal avian species, such as Strigiformes, Caprimulgiformes and Apterygiformes, have sensitive vibrotactile bristles on their upper bill, especially on their rictus. The anatomy of these bristles can vary, especially in terms of sensitivity (Herbst corpuscle number), bristle length and bristle number. This variation is thought to be associated with foraging – such that diurnal, open foragers have smaller and less-sensitive bristles. Here, we describe bristle morphology and follicle anatomy in the western barn owl (Tyto alba) for the first time, using both live and roadkill wild owls. We show that T. alba have both narial and rictal bristles that are likely to be vibrotactile, since they have Herbst corpuscles around their follicles. We observed more numerous (~8) and longer bristles (~16 mm) on the nares of T. alba, than on the rictal region (~4 and ~13 mm respectively). However, the narial bristle follicles contained fewer Herbst corpuscles in their surroundings (~5) than the rictal bristles (~7); indicating that bristle length is not indicative of sensitivity. As well as bristle length and number varying between different facial regions, they also varied between individuals, although the cause of this variation remains unclear. Despite this variation, the gross anatomy of facial bristle follicles appears to be conserved between nocturnal Strigiformes, Caprimulgiformes and Apterygiformes. Understanding more about how T. alba use their bristles would, therefore, give us greater insights into the function of avian bristles in general. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The diet of the Austral Pygmy Owl, Glaucidium nana, a small raptor, was studied by pellet analysis. During fall of 2020, 52 pellets were collected in a peri-urban protected area. Amongst 122 prey items, Muridae, represented exclusively by the alien species Rattus rattus and Rattus norvegicus, made up 35.24 % by number and 67.1 % of the biomass, followed by native Cricetidae, at a 37.69 % by number and 17.9 % by biomass. In the last place in relative frequency were birds and arthropods. The biomass contribution was unequal among the different prey, being the alien prey the group with the highest profit. The role of the landscape in the composition of prey in the observed trophic spectrum is discussed. © 2022, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Wildlife monitoring programs designed to inform forest management and conservation decisions in the face of climate change benefit from long-term datasets with consistent methodology. Nevertheless, many monitoring programs may seek to transition to alternative methods because emerging technologies can improve trend tracking and expand the number of target populations, increase spatial scale, and reduce long-term costs. Integrated models strengthen the capacity to adapt long-term monitoring programs to next generation methods. Here we present a case study of northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) population monitoring that is under transition. The first monitoring phase focused on territory occupancy and mark-resighting individual owls. Owing to rapidly declining populations and increasing costs, traditional methods are less viable for long-term monitoring. A non-invasive approach, passive acoustic monitoring, is effective for detecting spotted owl presence, estimating occupancy rates, distinguishing sex, detecting trends in populations, and monitoring many additional species. A key component to support transition to passive acoustic monitoring was the development of machine learning models to automate species detections that enable rapid and effective data processing and analysis workflows. Coupling passive acoustic monitoring networks with Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) and gradient nearest neighbor (GNN) datasets provide powerful tools for predicting forest change impacts on wildlife populations and identify winners and losers in dynamic landscapes. The second monitoring phase will leverage new technologies, expand the scope of inference, link forest inventory and remote sensing datasets, and transition the program to broad biodiversity monitoring that assists managers as they face myriad challenges in dynamic landscapes.

ABSTRACT: The B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), a member of the natriuretic peptide family and a cardiac hormone, is produced mainly in the ventricular myocytes and released into the circulation due to mechanical stimuli during an increasing cardiac wall stretch. BNP has a significant role in the regulation of the cardiovascular system and body fluid. The concentration of this hormone and of the biologically inactive amino-terminal-prohormone in the blood plasma is a helpful diagnostic tool for detecting cardiovascular diseases in human medicine and can be used as a prognostic marker for the risk of mortality, whilst such a tool does not exist for avian medicine. To date, the amino acid sequence of BNP is not known for many of the species commonly presented in avian consultation. In this study, the amino acid sequence of BNP and the prepropeptide was described for 12 parrot species as well as 3 raptor and 3 owl species by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) after RNA isolation from the heart. The results showed a high similarity between the amino acid sequences in the mature peptide region of the BNP. The prepropeptide showed several differences between the examined species, some of them shared by closely related species. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: Objective: Investigate histopathology and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging of wild owls with chorioretinitis and identify any potential correlation with an infectious etiology. Materials and Methods: Ophthalmic examination and retinal OCT imaging were performed on fifteen great horned (Strix varia) and barred (Bubo virginianus) owls (30 eyes) with chorioretinitis and five owls with normal eyes (10 eyes). Testing to investigate the presence of potential infectious diseases included a complete blood count, biochemistry, protein electrophoresis, West Nile virus (WNV) plaque reduction neutralization test, Toxoplasma gondii modified direct agglutination test, WNV RT-PCR, and Avian Influenza RT-PCR. A necropsy was performed on all owls, including ocular histopathology. Results: Fundus lesions included retinal detachment (7/15 owls), depigmented lesions (12/15), pigment clumping (8/15), and retinal tear (4/15). All birds were negative for WNV and Avian Influenza on RT-PCR. Of the owls with chorioretinitis, 3/15 were seropositive for WNV and 7/15 for T. gondii. Optical coherence tomography of 25/30 affected eyes revealed outer retinal lesions (19/25 eyes), retinal detachment (16/25), and retinal tears (3/25). Histopathological examination revealed outer nuclear layer atrophy (19/30 eyes), retinal detachment (18/30), retinal tears (7/30), suprachoroidal hemorrhage (12/30), scleral rupture (3/30), and ossicle fracture (3/30). Conclusions: Although 20% of birds were seropositive for WNV and 46.6% for T. gondii, histopathologic findings supported that the posterior segment lesions in the study group were likely due to blunt ocular trauma rather than an infectious etiology. The results of OCT imaging and histopathology documented retinal changes most consistent with blunt ocular trauma. © 2021 American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists.

ABSTRACT: The Reddish Scops-Owl (Otus rufescens) is a Near Threatened Sunda endemic associated with lowland closed-canopy forests. We radio-tracked the male Reddish Scops-Owl of a breeding pair in the Ayer Hitam Forest Reserve in southwestern Peninsular Malaysia from July to September 2019. From a total of 137 radio fixes, and based on its minimum convex polygon, harmonic mean, and kernel density estimations, the home range of this bird was estimated as 1.31-2.16 ha, with 2 roosts found within this area.

ABSTRACT: Passive acoustic monitoring is a wildlife monitoring method used especially for the study of vocally active species which are difficult to observe directly. The tawny owl (Strix aluco, Linnaeus 1758) is such a species, and has not been previously studied in Greece. The aim of the study was to provide a first insight into the species' acoustic ecology in the Rhodope Mountains by describing its calling activity at four sites over a period of 3-6 months, and to examine possible correlation with natural and climatic parameters. Based on 24,937 calls, we report a significant increase in the number of calls per night (18:00 pm to 9:00 am) as the length of the night increased, as well as a negative relation with wind speed. We did not observe a relationship between calling frequency and the phase of the moon. © 2022 Sciendo. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The Eurasian Scops-Owl (Otus scops) is a protected species whose successful reproduction is critical for the maintenance of its population. However, due to the scarcity of information on its breeding habits and nest-site selection, we conducted a study using artificial nest boxes in the Zuojia Nature Reserve, Jilin Province, China, from 2007 to 2019. The mean clutch size was 3.85 ± 0.53 (n = 35 nests), mean hatching rate was 98.84%, and mean survival rate of nestlings was 96%. A logistic equation fitting the increase in nestlings' mass showed an S-Type growth curve. The key ecological factors in nest-site selection included the canopy over the nesting site, nearby shrub species, and shrub canopy density. © 2022 Wilson Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Tempel, D. J., H. A. Kramer, G. M. Jones, R. J. Gutiérrez, S. C. Sawyer, A. Koltunov, M. Slaton, R. Tanner, B. K. Hobart, and M. Z. Peery. 2022. Population decline in California spotted owls near their southern range boundary. Journal of Wildlife Management 86:e22168. We (Tempel et al. 2022) stated in our Abstract that “Spotted owl reproductive output was lower at territories where fuel treatments occurred, but low- to moderate-severity fire resulted in much larger, population-level reductions in reproductive output (141 fewer young) from 2006–2019 than treatments (19 fewer young).” This statement referred to our population impact analyses where we simulated occupancy and reproduction dynamics at California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) territories on our study area. However, the fire-related reduction in simulated total reproductive output was not only the result of reduced reproduction after low- to moderate-severity fire but also reduced occupancy after high-severity fire (if a territory was unoccupied during a given year, reproductive output was zero). Therefore, we examined the relative effects of low- to moderate-severity and high-severity fire on total reproductive output by simulating additional scenarios in our population impact analyses in which we excluded low- to moderate-severity fire, but not high-severity fire, using both the full (1991–2019) and secondary (2006–2019) data sets. We present these results in Table 1 below, which is a modified version of Table 5 from Tempel et al. (2022). We found that reduced reproduction after low- to moderate-severity fire was responsible for only 25% (27/108) and 13% (19/141) of the fire-related reduction in total reproductive output for the full and secondary data sets, respectively. Thus, reduced occupancy in territories that burned at high-severity was primarily responsible (75–87%) for the lower total reproductive output after fire. The effect of high-severity fire on total reproductive output was also much greater than the effect of fuel treatments, which was nearly identical to the effect of low- to moderate-severity fire (Table 1). These results further reinforce our findings that the benefits of fuel treatments to reduce fire occurrence and severity appear to outweigh potential short-term costs to spotted owls and their habitat. 1 Table Results of population impact analyses for territorial California spotted owls in the San Bernardino and Angeles national forests in California, USA, 1991–2019. We conducted 10,000 simulations of occupancy and reproduction dynamics at each territory under the following scenarios: baseline, where we used actual covariate values at each territory; no low- to moderate-severity fire, where we assigned zero values for all low- to moderate-severity fire covariates; and no fire, where we assigned zero values for all fire covariates (including high-severity fire). Because we lacked fuel treatment data for part of the study period, we repeated the simulations from 2006–2019 for the following scenarios: baseline, no low- to moderate-severity fire, no fire, and no treatments, where we assigned zero values for all fuel treatment covariates. We provide mean values and standard deviation for occupancy rate in 2019, turnover rate, and total reproduction. (Table presented.). © 2022 The Wildlife Society.

ABSTRACT: Human-dominated environments often include ecological traps for wildlife, such as airports that may be perceived as suitable habitat by grassland birds but reduce fitness because of collisions with aircraft. Birds of prey are often attracted to airports where collisions with aircraft (i.e., bird strikes) are usually fatal for the birds and are a significant threat to flight safety. The snowy owl (Bubo scandiacus) is known for its nomadism, exhibiting unpredictable and highly variable movements during the nonbreeding season, including being a common visitor to airports, which often have high small-mammal populations and mimic flat, open habitats used naturally by owls. Since 2009, the Federal Aviation Administration reported an average of 22 snowy owl deaths annually due to aircraft collisions throughout 55 North American airports. To aid in active management of owls at airports, we assessed relocation data of 42 telemetry-tracked snowy owls from 2000–2020 in the United States and Canada. Owls that returned to the airport after relocation (33%) frequently crisscrossed and perched near runways where they were at risk of strikes. Adult females and immature males were more likely to return than the other sex and age classes, and returns were less likely to occur as the distance between the release site and the airport increased. Owls relocated in open habitats with a greater proportion of wetland and cropland (including grasslands and pasture) land cover classes were also less likely to return. We conclude that inclusion of multiple factors to limit return rates of relocated snowy owls from airport facilities can unspring the ecological trap presented by airports to these owls. © 2022 The Wildlife Society.

ABSTRACT: The occurrence of vocal dimorphism in strigid owls has been known for a long time and it is widely accepted that males emit songs with lower frequency than those of females. However, there are several gaps in our knowledge about this phenomenon, which may be related to a scarcity of sound recordings of sexed individuals and difficulties in obtaining this kind of material. In this paper, we present a novel permutation-based analysis that allows the study of vocal dimorphism using recordings of unsexed individuals presumably forming breeding pairs. We used this method to investigate vocal dimorphism in the Tawny-browed Owl (Pulsatrix koeniswaldiana) alongside more conventional t tests, applied only to a subsample of individuals of known sex. Our results indicate that males of P. koeniswaldiana emit songs with lower frequencies and a narrower frequency range than those of females. There was also some evidence, which emerged only from the analysis of sexed individuals, that males emit longer songs with fewer harmonics. Even though our novel method does not estimate dimorphism directly and does not show its direction, it allows investigating it in a relatively easy and economical way and seems promising to help increase our knowledge about vocal dimorphism in strigids and other taxa. © 2022, Deutsche Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.

ABSTRACT: For ground-And burrow-nesting birds, heavy rain events can lead to reproductive failure when nests flood. This paper describes the exposure of Florida Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia floridana) to breeding season flooding, its relationship to annual reproductive success rates, and effect on nest failure across 5 cattle ranches in southwestern Florida, USA. In May 2016, a heavy rain event following an unusually wet dry season led to extensive burrow flooding and widespread reproductive failure in 1 of the breeding sites under study. In 2017 and 2018, burrows flooded frequently but the occurrence of flooding later in the breeding season was not associated with a lower overall annual reproductive success rate. Brood age at the time of flooding had a significant relationship with the probability that a particular nest failed, with the chance of event survival increasing from 12% in week 3 to 58% in week 4. All but 1 brood that experienced flooding in week 5 or later survived at least partially. Our findings indicate that flooding is a common occurrence that Florida Burrowing Owls breeding on cattle ranches can tolerate, but extreme precipitation, especially early in the breeding season or when broods are young, can cause widespread nest failure. Annual productivity could be affected if these events increase in frequency with climate change, but the inclusion or maintenance of elevated ground within the ranch landscape could provide refugia. © 2022 Wilson Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Hepatosplenitis or inclusion body disease is a fatal disease in owls caused by Columbid alphaherpesvirus 1 (CoHV-1). A few old case reports describe it worldwide. In Italy, knowledge regarding virus circulation and disease development is lacking. Four Eurasian eagle-owls (Bubo bubo), two adults and two juveniles, were submitted for postmortem examination showing aspecific clinical signs a few hours before death. Grossly disseminated petechial hemorrhages on serosal surfaces (n = 4), hepatic and splenic necrosis (n = 3), bilateral and symmetric necrosis of pharyngeal tonsils (n = 2), and diffuse and bilateral dark-red discoloration and firmness in lungs (n = 2) were seen. Tissues were sampled for histology, bacteriology, molecular testing, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). On histology, disseminated petechial hemorrhages (n = 4) and necrosis of liver (n = 3) and spleen (n = 3) were seen, as well as lympho-histiocytic interstitial pneumonia and meningoencephalitis (n = 2). Intranuclear inclusion bodies (INIBs) were detected in one case. A panherpesviral PCR led to positive results in one case, identified in sequencing as CoHV-1. On TEM, intranuclear and intracytoplasmic virions with herpesviral morphology were seen in the same case. For the other three birds, the lack of PCR positivity, INIBs, and TEM detection could be linked to a possible reduction of the virus to undetectable levels. Death possibly occurred secondarily to bacterial infections, supposedly established during the acute phase of CoHV-1 infection.

ABSTRACT: Understanding patterns in the occupancy of Neotropical owls can help inform land managers and conservation efforts; however, Neotropical owls are understudied compared to their temperate kin. We conducted the first long-term (10-yr) study of owls in El Salvador to assess occurrence patterns and species richness using occupancy modeling. Our study occurred in El Imposible National Park, Montecristo National Park, and Nancuchiname Forest, and we chose two survey routes per protected area to represent the landscape diversity of the country. Surveys involved passive listening and broadcasting calls of several species at selected points along each route, and we sought to repeat each survey route twice per year. We completed 86 surveys between March and May each year from 2003 through 2013, except in 2006 when no surveys occurred. We detected nine species of owls, including the Stygian Owl (Asio stygius), which was previously undocumented in El Salvador, and we documented 1211 owl records overall. We developed Bayesian, hierarchical, single-species occupancy models for the Mottled Owl (Ciccaba virgata), Ferruginous Pygmy-Owl (Glaucidium brasilianum), and Spectacled Owl (Pulsatrix perspicillata), and a multi-species richness model for all El Salvador owls. We found that the effects of broadcasting calls were species-specific (i.e., broadcasting some species' calls increased detection probabilities while others decreased detection). Nancuchiname Forest was the most species-rich, while the cloud forest of Montecristo National Park had several species that we did not observe elsewhere. In general, we found relatively stable occupancy patterns across the study period, and we recommend some specific areas of further study to inform management decisions.  © 2022 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Populations at the warm edge of distribution are more genetically diverse, and at the same time are more susceptible to climate change. Between 1987–1996, we studied Tawny Owls in Israel, the species’ global southern edge of distribution and a country undergoing a rapid land cover transformation for over a century. To assess the potential impacts of land cover transformation, we modelled the species’ most suitable habitat and climate and analyzed how climate and habitat affected the nesting success and prey selection. Moreover, we monitored Tawny Owl juveniles’ survival and ontogeny from eggs to dietary independent young, to find out whether the Israeli population is a sink. While the species distribution model correctly predicted the Tawny Owl’s densest areas of occurrence, it failed to predict its occurrence in adjacent regions. The model also predicted that areas included in the species’ historical range remained suitable habitats. The number of fledglings increased with precipitation and in rural settings but was adversely affected by extreme temperatures. While voles dominated the diet in all habitats, the Tawny Owl’s diet is considerably more variable than other Israeli owls. Our results suggest that the Tawny Owl can adapt to rural-agricultural environments, but is susceptible to climate change. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: Fossil pollen and geochemical sequences from a series of hyrax dung deposits from rock shelters along the eastern margin of the central Namib Desert shed light on the Holocene environmental history of Namibia. Grassy pollen assemblages suggest relatively humid conditions during the early Holocene between ca. 9.6 and 7.7 ka. A series of stepwise changes follows, including the prominence of different pioneer plant communities of which changes in ratios between grassy and shrub pollen types suggests moisture oscillations. The development of more C4 plants around ca. 4.5 ka, as indicated by isotope concentrations and persistent grass pollen percentages, point to the development of a different climatic regime than that in the early Holocene, which extended the area of subtropical savanna towards the south at ca. 24°S. This transition can in part be interpreted as a vegetation response to a shift in the rainfall distribution from an early even seasonal distribution to the current late Holocene summer rainfall regime. Climate changes may have been driven by variations in austral summer and winter solar insolation with changes in total solar irradiance (TSI) superimposed upon them. Through its link to Bond events in the North Atlantic, and thus Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), TSI may have affected SSTs in the SE Atlantic and SW Indian Ocean, which influence both summer and winter rainfall in southern Africa. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The occurrence of organohalogenated compounds (OHCs) in wildlife has received considerable attention over the last decades. Among the matrices used for OHCs biomonitoring, feathers are particularly useful as they can be collected in a minimally or non-invasive manner. In this study, concentrations of various legacy OHCs –polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs)–, as well as emerging OHCs –per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and organophosphate ester flame retardants (OPEs)– were determined in feathers of 72 Eurasian eagle-owls (Bubo bubo) from Norway, with the goal of studying spatiotemporal variation using a non-invasive approach. Molted feathers were collected at nest sites from northern, central and southern Norway across four summers (2013–2016). Additionally, two museum-archived feathers from 1979 to 1989 were included. Stable carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen isotopes (δ15N) were used as dietary proxies. In total, 11 PFAS (sum range 8.25–215.90 ng g−1), 15 PCBs (4.19–430.01 ng g−1), 6 OCPs (1.48–220.94 ng g−1), 5 PBDEs (0.21–5.32 ng g−1) and 3 OPEs (4.49–222.21 ng g−1) were quantified. While we observed large variation in the values of both stable isotopes, suggesting a diverse diet of the eagle-owls, only δ13C seemed to explain variation in PFAS concentrations. Geographic area and year were influential factors for δ15N and δ13C. Considerable spatial variation was observed in PFAS levels, with the southern area showing higher levels compared to northern and central Norway. For the rest of OHCs, we observed between-year variations; sum concentrations of PCBs, OCPs, PBDEs and OPEs reached a maximum in 2015 and 2016. Concentrations from 1979 to 1989 were within the ranges observed between 2013 and 2016. Overall, our data indicate high levels of legacy and emerging OHCs in a top predator in Norway, further highlighting the risk posed by OHCs to wildlife. © 2021

ABSTRACT: Aerodynamic parameters, such as wing loading, are important indicators of flight maneuverability. We studied two subspecies of the American Barn owl (Tyto furcata), the North American subspecies, T.f.pratincola, and the Galapagos subspecies, T.f.punctatissima, with respect to aerodynamic parameters and compared our findings with those in other owl and bird species. The body mass of T.f.pratincola is about two times higher than that of T.f.punctatissima. Wing loading between the two subspecies scales allometrically. Wing loading in T.f.pratincola is about 50% higher than in T.f.punctatissima. The scaling of wing length is not statistically different from the prediction for isometric scaling. By contrast, the wing chord in T.f.punctatissima is larger than predicted by isometric scaling, as is the wing area. The scaling of wing loading observed here for T.f.punctatissima differs considerably from the scaling in other owl and bird species as available in the literature. We speculate that the allometric scaling helps T.f.punctatissima to catch smaller prey such, as insects that are found in many pellets of T.f.punctatissima, despite the fact that in both subspecies, small rodents make up most of the diet. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Owl cafes, where customers view and interact with owls, have become popular in Japan. There are multiple aspects of the environment which may be stressful to nocturnal owls, including lighting, tethering and frequent interactions with humans but, to date, welfare has not been investigated. This preliminary study examines the effects of owl cafes and customers on the physiological stress (faecal corticosterone levels [FCL]) and behaviour of the owls. Seven eagle owls (Bubo bubo) and two African scops owls (Ptilopsis leucotis), in two cafes, were studied over an eight-day period. Cafe A (n = 5) was closed for one day per week, whilst cafe B (n = 4) was open every day. In cafe A there was higher FCL in owls during open days than closed days suggesting that the conditions on open days increase stress in owls. Eight of nine owls showed evidence of some aversion or avoidance of humans, whilst no affiliative behaviours were observed. The number of visitor interactions was not associated with the level of physiological stress; and when comparing owls, there was a tendency for individual owls with a higher percentage of aversive responses to customers to also have higher FCL. Close human interactions of a negative nature, that result in aversion, may be a significant stressor, but further research is required.  © 2022 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare.

ABSTRACT: Determining the diet of species that nest underground, such as the Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia), is challenging. Prey information for Burrowing Owls is often limited to prey remains at nest sites and in owl pellets, images collected from above-ground trail cameras, or direct observations of prey acquisition and delivery. To document prey use and nesting behaviors, we equipped an artificial nest box and burrows at Rio Bosque Wetlands Park in El Paso, Texas, with a digital video recorder and three underground infrared cameras. Herein we document the types and frequencies of prey items delivered inside the nest box during the 2019 nesting season, as reflected in videos and images collected continuously from 1 April to 5 July. We reviewed 23,039 video files and documented 580 prey deliveries. We identified 463 (80%) of the delivered prey items to class and 237 items (41%) to family. Invertebrates made up 75% and vertebrates 25% of the identifiable prey items by frequency. Most (55%) of the invertebrates were insects, especially in the orders Orthoptera and Blattodea; scorpions (Scorpiones) were the second most common group (2% of all items). Vertebrate prey were delivered less often and mostly consisted of rodents (14% of all prey items), especially heteromyids, followed by squamate reptiles (6%). Results from this project will aid in conservation and management of this species.  © 2022 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Background: Owl monkeys are commonly used in biomedical research which is affected by the high incidence of cardiomyopathy in this species. Occasionally, owl monkeys with no clinical signs of heart disease are found dead and at necropsy show no, or very mild, cardiomyopathy. A possible explanation for sudden death is acute myocardial infarction; however, early myocardial changes may be difficult to assess by conventional stains and light microscopy. Methods: Complement component C9 immunohistochemistry was performed in paraffin-embedded heart tissue samples from owl monkeys who died suddenly, or were euthanized due to sickness, to determine whether these animals suffered from acute myocardial infarcts. Results and Conclusion: C9 deposits were found in the myocardium of 19 out of 20 (95%) animals. The findings in this study suggest owl monkeys suffer from acute myocardial infarcts, and complement component C9 immunohistochemistry may be a useful diagnostic tool. Published 2021.

ABSTRACT: Species worldwide have begun to shift their range boundaries in response to climate change and other anthropogenic causes, with population declines at the trailing edge of a species' range often foreshadowing future changes in core parts of the range. Therefore, we analyzed a 30-year (1991–2019) data set for the California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) near its southern range boundary in southern California, USA, that included the largest regional population (San Bernardino Mountains) to estimate trends in territory occupancy and reproduction. We then assessed how these demographic rates were affected by habitat, wildfire, fuel treatments, and climate. Mean occupancy declined from 0.82 to 0.39 during our study, whereas reproductive output showed no temporal trends ((Formula presented.) young/occupied territory). Territory extinction (extirpation) rates were relatively low in territories with more large trees (≥50 cm dbh), and colonization increased strongly with large tree density for low-elevation territories within the shrub-woodland ecotype but not for higher-elevation territories within mixed-conifer forest. High-severity wildfire had an adverse effect on occupancy: territory extinction rates steadily increased with the amount of high-severity fire within an owl territory during the previous 10 years, while colonization declined to nearly zero when ≥40% of a territory burned at high-severity during the previous 10 years. The effects of high-severity fire were unlikely to be confounded with post-fire fuel treatments, which primarily consisted of the removal, burning, or scattering of brush and small trees and snags (<40.6 cm dbh) and affected much smaller areas than high-severity fire. Of the 40 territories that received fuel treatments within 10 years of a fire, only 3 of them had post-fire fuel treatments that affected >5% of the territory, whereas average area burned at high severity for all 40 territories was 17%. Fuel treatments intended to modify fire behavior and reduce the likelihood of large, high-severity fires led to increases in territory extinction and colonization such that their net effect on occupancy was minimal. Our simulations of occupancy dynamics indicated that high-severity fire accounted for 9.6% of the observed decline in occupancy, whereas fuel treatments effectively accounted for none of the decline. Spotted owl reproductive output was lower at territories where fuel treatments occurred, but low- to moderate-severity fire resulted in much larger, population-level reductions in reproductive output (141 fewer young) from 2006–2019 than treatments (19 fewer young). Thus, the benefits of fuel treatments that reduce fire occurrence and severity appear to outweigh potential short-term costs to spotted owls and their habitat. Because high-severity fire only explained a modest amount of the long-term occupancy decline and much of the decline occurred in the 1990s before large fires occurred, additional factors are likely adversely affecting the owl population and merit further study. Nevertheless, the large observed population decline, limited evidence of owl dispersal among mountain ranges in the southern California metapopulation, and negative effects of increasingly large and severe fire suggest that California spotted owls at their southern range boundary are vulnerable to extirpation. In an era of climate change, owls in the core part of the range will likely become increasingly susceptible to warmer temperatures and increased severe fire activity in the future. Thus, the restoration of historical, low-severity fire regimes through fuels management while maintaining large trees is important to improving owl persistence. © 2022 The Wildlife Society

ABSTRACT: Wonderwerk Cave, in South Africa, is an exceptional site that has yielded a large collection of small mammal fossils in a stratigraphic sequence reaching back ca. 2 million years. Taphonomic studies undertaken to date, show that Tytonidae (likely Tyto alba) was the dominant predator during the Earlier Stone Age. They produced masses of pellets that formed a dense carpet-like surface that covered the cave floor at intervals throughout the sequence. This paper compares the taphonomic signatures of five different Earlier Stone Age small mammal assemblages from Wonderwerk Cave, including assemblages not studied before, as well as a modern pellet assemblage collected from inside the cave. These samples were examined using taphonomic signatures, bone density and spatial distribution which confirm that the main predator in all periods of cave occupation were members of the Family Tytonidae, most likely Barn owls. The Wonderwerk small mammals have enabled us to clarify site formation processes and confirm that there was no transport or mixing of fossils, neither spatially (re-sedimentation) nor chronologically (reworking). This has confirmed the integrity of the stratigraphic sequence in the cave, reinforcing interpretations of palaeoecology, and elucidating intensity of occupation by hominins versus predators, and the behaviour of the predators vis a vis their prey. © 2021

ABSTRACT: American barn owls (Tyto furcata) often rely on nest box networks for breeding, especially within agricultural landscapes. Nest boxes are commonly installed for pest management purposes and require regular maintenance, such as removal of pellet debris and repairs, to remain functional and safe for breeding owls. Ideally, nest box maintenance should be conducted before the breeding season begins to minimize nest disturbance. The timing of the barn owl breeding season is especially important to understand in California, USA, which has a high diversity of ecoregions and expansive latitudinal range. Our objective was to describe the barn owl breeding season throughout California using nestling records to assist with data-driven management recommendations. We queried 96 years of barn owl nestling banding records (n = 22,670) from the United States Geological Survey Bird Banding Lab to estimate egg laying dates across California and summarized 39 years of intake records (n = 1,741) from the California Raptor Center in the Central Valley. Our results suggest that barn owls typically begin to lay eggs in California in winter months; the median egg laying date for the state was 20 February. Based on these reports, planning for barn owl nest box maintenance to begin in fall (Sep–Nov) would align with the season that breeding activity and nest disturbance may be lowest, especially in the Central Valley and Southern Coast ecoregions. © 2022 The Wildlife Society.

ABSTRACT: Background and Research Aims: Myths and beliefs shape the relationships that people have with different species. They lead to the protection of revered species and the persecution of negatively viewed species. In some instances, people fear these species resulting in a failure to tap into their benefits. This study investigates the possibility of using Barn Owls, a species largely linked to traditional beliefs, as a biological control for rodent pests. Methods: Data was collected through a questionnaire survey. Chi-square tests were used to assess the links between socio-demographic variables and the people’s attitude towards the use of owls in rodent control. A Generalised Linear Model was used to investigate the influence of the distance of the homestead from a protected area on their perceptions of owls. Results: Although most respondents acknowledged that they had a rodent problem, 41% would not use owls for their control. More females than males did not want to use owls for fear of being labelled as witches, whilst males felt owls were good for rodent control and ecosystem balance. Level of education and age did not influence people’s perceptions. People living closer to a protected area embraced the use of owls in rodent control and village of origin influenced perception of owls. Most teenagers displayed the same attitude towards owls as their mothers. Conclusion: Gender and parental influence play a role in influencing the perceptions of the community on owls. There is need to further investigate the factors within a village which influence perceptions on owls. Implications for Conservation: Cultural beliefs should be considered in conservation as the belief in witchcraft transcends age and education. There is need for conservation efforts to focus on improving ecological literacy of target groups to improve the conservation of feared species. © The Author(s) 2022.

ABSTRACT: Since 1997, fledgling Scops owls (Chordata: Strigidae) have been brought to the Brinzal Owl Rescue Centre (Madrid, Spain) with severe lesions in their oral cavities. Lesions consist of the presence of proliferative necrotic material in the oral cavity resulting in white plaques, which can lead to death by starvation. This disease has been detected in owls only within the limits of the city of Madrid. The etiologic agent has been identified as Gongylonema sp. (Nematoda: Spirurida), a nematode genus that includes a coprophagous arthropod as intermediate host in its cycle. The aim of this study was to identify the intermediate host of the parasite. Our work was structured in four component phases: i) Diet study of newborn chicks; ii) trapping arthropods that could be intermediate hosts; iii) molecular detection of the parasite in the selected arthropods: and iv) molecular characterization of the detected parasites by amplifying the cox1 gene. Four male owls were radio-tagged in order to locate their nests and a camera trap was placed to identify the prey brought to the owlets. Secondly, the arthropods present in the hunting areas of the owls were sampled, identified and analyzed by real time PCR (rtPCR). Only oriental cockroaches, B. orientalis (Arthropoda: Blattodea), were positive by rtPCR detection of Gongylonema sp. (66.7%). The nematodes obtained from cockroaches had a 99.8% identity of the cox1 gene with the Gongylonema sp. isolated for the first time in a Scops owl. Furthermore, these sequences only showed an <89% identity with all the other Gongylonema sequences available in the GenBank database. We conclude that the oriental cockroach should be considered as an intermediate host of the etiologic agent of NOD. © 2021

ABSTRACT: Automated signal detection of passive acoustic data produces enormous amounts of data that requires efficient processing. Furthermore, processed data requires assessment to ensure correct categorization of sounds to match field observations. Failure to compare data directly may lead to inaccurate estimates of occupancy state or population status and contribute to sub-optimal management decisions. We evaluated three automated detection methods for Northern Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) four-note location calls at two sites representing vegetational and topographic conditions common to Northern Spotted Owl sites in western Oregon, United States. Our results indicated that the detection distance, resulting areal coverage, and occupancy status all varied with site, call broadcast direction, and software used for analysis. A machine learning algorithm (convolutional neural network) built specifically for detection of Northern Spotted Owl performed better at determining occupancy than two commercially developed software packages. At distances less than 250 m, the convolutional neural network correctly identified occupancy in more than 73% of trials and both commercial methods correctly identified occupancy in less than 60% of trials. Areal coverage was a function of distance from source to microphone, location of the source relative to the microphone, and method of call analysis. Calls broadcast toward the microphones were more likely to be detected than calls broadcast away from the microphones. Our results, although limited in scope, suggest that detection distance merits extended evaluation before autonomous recording units are deployed broadly as replacements for human observers. © 2022 by the author(s).

ABSTRACT: The Rat was one of the main pests in oil palm plantations cause able to significantly reduce oil palm yield. This research aimed to know the role of T. alba in controlling rat pest attacks in oil palm plantations. Observations were made on estates that had different ratios/hectare of T. alba nest boxes such as Pantai Harapan Estate (1:54), Kruing Estate (1:80), and Sungai Mirah Estate (1: 162). The presence of T. alba was observed every month at each nest box. The attack rate of rats was observed every month during January - December 2020 through a census attack in each plant block. Kruing estate was the highest nest box occupancy rate of T. alba of 37 %. The occupancy rates of Pantai Harapan Estate and Sungai Mirah Estate were 31% and 6%, respectively. While the rate of rat attacks in Pantai Harapan Estate, Kruing Estate, and Sungai Mirah Estate were 0.70 % a, 0.60 % a, 2,30 % b, respectively. The barn owl T. alba can control the attack of rats naturally and reduce the use of rodenticide. Rodenticide applications at Bumitama Agri Ltd for rat pest control in 2020 also decreased by 45% when compared to applications in 2019. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The diet and breeding success of Eagle Owls (Bubo bubo) have been suggested to vary at different latitudes. However, it is still unclear whether and how these relationships exist at lower latitudes outside of Europe. We therefore studied the diet and breeding success of Eagle Owls during four breeding seasons at 14 nests in the Judea region, Israel. Of a total of 9461 prey species were identified; mammals (N = 6896, 35 species; 72.89%, biomass 62.3%) and birds (N = 2255, 55 species, 23.83%; biomass 36.0%) predominated the prey-base. We found that the gradient of diversity of the mammalian prey decreased from west to east; and avian prey increased from east to west. The index of species diversity, H’ for all prey, had no relationship with breeding success. The prey-base of the Eagle Owls helped identify the changes in geographic distributions of several species. Marbled polecat (Vormela peregusna), especially threatened, appear to be relatively abundant, as are brown rats (Ratttus norvegicus) which were previously considered to be restricted to the coastal regions. In addition to Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus), the Eagle Owls also preyed on nine different species of insectivorous bats, several of which appear to have enlarged their geographic distribution within Israel. The Eagle Owl’s diet emphasizes its generalist foraging habits, but pairs may be species-specific specialists. This adaptation is especially important in a fast-developing and congested country like Israel, because a generalist hunting strategy probably allows the species to subsist in the region. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Despite the pervasiveness of IoT domotic devices in the home automation landscape, their potential is still quite under-exploited due to the high heterogeneity and the scarce expressivity of the most commonly adopted scenario programming paradigms. The aim of this study is to show that Semantic Web technologies constitute a viable solution to tackle not only the interoperability issues, but also the overall programming complexity of modern IoT home automation scenarios. For this purpose, we developed a knowledge-based home automation system in which scenarios are the result of logical inferences over the IoT sensors data combined with formalised knowledge. In particular, we describe how the SWRL language can be employed to overcome the limitations of the well-known trigger-action paradigm. Through various experiments in three distinct scenarios, we demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed approach and its applicability in a standardised and validated context such as SAREF. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Imaging diagnostic methods are essential for a complete understanding of the liver function and may aid in early detection of hepatic disorders. Methods: Sixty-nine owl monkeys were grouped in three age groups (AG): AG1 (<2 years old, n = 14), 2 (2–6 years old, n = 21), and 3 (>7 years old, n = 34). The animals were evaluated by ultrasound, liver function tests, and hemogram. Results: The ultrasound revealed abnormal findings in the parenchyma (“starry sky” and steatosis) and/or in the gallbladder (cholelithiasis, septum, and wall edema) in 17 individuals, with higher incidence in AG3 individuals. Seven hepatic individuals showed alterations in the blood tests. Conclusion: Our study reported the occurrence of abnormal liver findings by ultrasound in owl monkeys and their associated clinical analyses. We recommend the regular use of ultrasound to evaluate liver condition in owl monkeys, particularly in old individuals. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Blakiston's Fish Owl (also known as Blakiston's Eagle-Owl; Bubo blakistoni) is an endangered species that inhabits northeast Asia. Blakiston's Fish Owls were rare (approximately 70 individuals) on Hokkaid , Japan, at the start of my study, but rigorous protection and intervention programs have led to more than a doubling of the population (approximately 165 individuals) since 1970. Despite its elusive nature and rarity, I have studied this owl species by direct observation and banding for 46 yr throughout Hokkaid . I here report on little known aspects of its intraspecific interactions and breeding behavior (specifically, pair formation). Identification of individual birds was facilitated by color-banding (a total of 447 owls from 1985-2019). Most pair formations began with an individual male or female flying into the territory of a single owl of the opposite sex, duetting with the resident owl, and then the pair flying together through the forest. However, pair formation occasionally occurred by displacement of a member of an established pair; in some cases, a replacement male took over parental duties. Under government permit, I cared for injured owls, which were housed in large outdoor aviaries; these captive owls sometimes attempted to form pair bonds with wild birds in the area. To test the feasibility of "matchmaking"to increase the number of territorial pairs on Hokkaid , I attempted to induce pairing of releasable captive birds with wild birds, or to release them into territories with single adults; these tests resulted in successful pair-bonding of the target birds in two cases. I here describe these observations of intraspecific interactions and pair formation to aid future conservation efforts for this endangered species.  © 2022 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: In this study we show the results of the eagle owls’ (Bubo bubo) helminthfauna found in Andalusia. A total number of 50 specimens have been analysed in a period of 10 years (from 2011 to 2020). Prevalence (P%), mean intensity (IM) and mean abundance (AM) of parasitation have been obtained. The percentage of parasitation in the total sample was 80% (40 out of 50 eagle owls): 78% nematodes, 8% trematodes, 6% cestodes and 4% acantocephalans. 7 species of helminths were identified: 6 nematodes, and 1 trematode. In the case of cestodes and acantocephalans it was not possible to determine species and only the genus was identified. The intestinal nematode Capillaria tenuissima (P% = 58% (44–71.2); IM = 11,52 (5.83–28.9)) was the core species whereas Synhimantus laticeps (P% = 16 (7.5–28.8); IM = 4 (1.75–7.25)) and Hartertia hispanica (P% = 16 (7.5–28.8); IM = 1,5 (1–2)) were the secondary species. The remainder species were considered satellite species, with low prevalence and average abundance. Likewise, descriptive parameters of the helminth community were determined: species richness, 1.56 (1.29–1.94), total abundance, 12 (7.24–26.40), Brillouin's diversity index, 0.18 (0.10–0.29) and Berger-Parker dominance index, 0.88 (0.81–0.93). The data from this study show a non-diverse helminthic community, without species dominance with C. tenuissima as the central species, followed by S. laticeps and H. hispanica as secondary species. Worth mentioning is the presence of H. hispanica, which is considered an endemic species in Spain and specifically in Andalusia. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the largest population sample taken in parasitological studies about helminths of this raptor in Europe and the first one carried out in the south of Spain (Andalusia). © 2022 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Predators are among the most threatened animal groups globally, with prey declines contributing to their endangerment. However, assessments of the habitat conditions that influence the successful capture of different prey species are rare, especially for small, cryptic predators. Accordingly, most predator conservation plans are based on the relative importance of habitats inferred from coarse-scale studies that do not consider habitat features contributing to hunting success, which can vary among prey species. To address this limitation, we integrated high-resolution global positioning system tracking and nest video monitoring to characterize habitat features at prey capture locations during the nestling provisioning stage for the Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis) a small, cryptic predator that has been at the center of a decades-long forest management conflict in western North America. When all prey species were considered collectively, males provisioning nests tended to capture prey: (1) in areas with more large-tree forest, (2) in areas with more medium trees/medium canopy forest, and (3) at edges between conifer and hardwood forests. However, when we considered the owl's two key prey species separately, males captured woodrats (Neotoma fuscipes) and Humboldt flying squirrels (Glaucomys oregonensis) in areas with markedly different habitat features. Our study provides clarity for forest management in mixed-ownership landscapes because different prey species achieve high densities in different habitat types. Specifically, our results suggest that promoting large trees, increasing forest heterogeneity, and creating canopy gaps in forests with medium trees/high canopy cover could benefit Spotted Owls and their prey, which has the ancillary benefit of enhancing forest resilience. Combining high-resolution global positioning system tagging with video-based information on prey deliveries to breeding sites can strengthen conservation planning for small predators by more rigorously defining those habitat features that are associated with successful prey acquisition.  © American Ornithological Society 2022.

ABSTRACT: The Northern Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) (NSO) was listed as federally threatened in 1992 due to widespread logging of its old-growth forest habitat. The NSO recovery plan in 2011 elevated competition with Barred Owls (Strix varia) (BO) and wildfires as primary NSO threats based partly on the assumption that severely burned forests were no longer NSO nesting and roosting habitat. We quantified amount of logging before and/or after wildfire and opportunistic detections of BOs within two home range scales (0.8 and 2.09 km) at 105 NSO sites that experienced severe wildfire from 2000–2017. Logging affected 87% of severely burned NSO sites, with BO recorded at 22% of burned-and-logged sites. Most (60%) severely burned NSO sites had evidence of logging both before and after fires while only 12% of severely burned sites had no logging or BO detections, indicating rarity of NSO territories subjected to severe fire without the compounding stressors of logging and invasive BOs. We recommend changes to NSO habitat modeling that assume nesting and roosting habitat is no longer viable if severely burned, and to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s practice of granting incidental take permits for NSOs in logging operations within severely burned owl sites. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Vocal territory defense can vary within a species due to many factors such as sex and breeding status, influencing territory size and thus population density across a landscape. Therefore, understanding what influences variation in territorial vocalizations can help to illuminate trade-offs between territoriality and other life history demands, which benefits our general understanding of animal ecology as well as helps to inform emerging passive acoustic monitoring approaches. Here, we investigated how sex and breeding status affected territoriality and vocal behavior in the California spotted owl Strix occidentalis occidentalis in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA, using high-resolution acoustic/GPS tags. We discovered that territorial vocal behavior was related to breeding status and to a lesser extent sex. Breeding owls with fledged young had a less diverse vocal repertoire, produced fewer and quieter territorial calls, and typically called only when close to their nest. Males were also more likely to engage in territorial calling than females. Breeding spotted owls also maintained significantly smaller territories – but utilized larger home ranges – than non-breeding individuals. Our results suggest that breeding spotted owls may reduce their investment in territorial behaviors to mitigate the demands and risks associated with rearing young. Further, our results have important implications for the passive acoustic monitoring of spotted owls and, more broadly, highlight the utility of using multiple call types to detect species of interest. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Avian haemosporidian parasites (Haemosporida, Apicomplexa) are globally distributed and infect birds of many orders. These pathogens have been much investigated in domestic and wild passeriform birds, in which they are relatively easy to access. In birds belonging to other orders, including owls (order Strigiformes), these parasites have been studied fragmentarily. Particularly little is known about the exo-erythrocytic development of avian haemosporidians. The goal of this study was to gain new knowledge about the parasites infecting owls in Europe and investigate their exo-erythrocytic stages. Tissue samples of 121 deceased owls were collected in Austria and Lithuania, and examined using polymerase chain reactions (PCR), histology, and chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH). PCR-based diagnostics showed a total prevalence of 73.6%, revealing two previously unreported Haemoproteus and five novel Leucocytozoon lineages. By CISH and histology, meronts of several Leucocytozoon lineages (lASOT06, lSTAL5, lSTAL7) were discovered in the brains, heart muscles, and kidneys of infected birds. Further, megalomeronts of Haemoproteus syrnii (lineage hSTAL2) were discovered. This study contributes new knowledge to a better understanding of the biodiversity of avian haemosporidian parasites infecting owls in Europe, provides information on tissue stages of the parasites, and calls for further research of these under-investigated pathogens relevant to bird health. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Aim: Ecogeographical rules link animal colours, especially those produced by melanin pigments, with variation in environmental conditions over wide geographical scales. In particular, Gloger’s rule, coined for endothermic animals in two versions, suggests that tegument darkness should increase at high temperature, as well as in highly humid environments. On the other hand, the thermal melanism hypothesis predicts that darker colourations should be more frequent in colder areas given their thermoregulation benefits. Location: Global. Time period: Contemporary. Major taxa studied: Strigiformes. Methods: Here, we provide a global comparative test of these contrasting expectations in all extant owls (n = 198 species), a group of nocturnal birds displaying huge variability in the degree of melanin-based plumage colouration and environmental specialization. Combining analyses at both species and assemblage level, we assessed the climatic and environmental variables explaining variation in plumage lightness and redness across broad geographical gradients. Results: Darker and redder owl phenotypes are more likely found near the equator. Species and assemblage level analyses reveal that owls have more frequently darker and redder plumages in warmer regions. In addition, owl species living in more vegetated areas are darker, and owl assemblages show darker colours in wetter areas. Main conclusions: Global patterns of colour variation in owls do not fit expectations from the thermal melanism hypothesis but support Gloger’s rule. Our findings also stress that several alternative selective forces may explain climatic effects on colouration over large geographical scales. Experimental work is urged to uncover the possible mechanisms behind the detected associations between owl colour and environmental variables. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

ABSTRACT: The Rufous-legged Owl (Strix rufipes) is the southernmost Strix owl species and its breeding ecology remains little known. We report new observations on the species' breeding ecology, including clutch size, egg size, duration of the incubation and nestling periods, and nestling diet. We conducted our observations on nests found during the summers of 1999 through 2004 in a forestry landscape of central Chile, dominated by Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) plantations with intermixed fragments of native southern beech (Nothofagus) forests. Clutch size was two eggs (n = 2 nests), with one egg larger than the other (mean = 48.8 × 40.1 mm). The incubation period was 30 d and the nestling period 34 d. We analyzed 10 pellets from nestling owls and identified 45 prey items, mostly dominated by large beetles, grasshoppers, and rodents (native and exotic). This information, though based on a limited number of nests, provides baseline ecological data that can inform future studies.  © 2022 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Barn owls, like primates, have frontally oriented eyes, which allow for a large binocular overlap. While owls have similar binocular vision and visual-search strategies as primates, it is less clear whether reflexive visual behavior also resembles that of primates or is more similar to that of closer related, but lateral-eyed bird species. Test cases are visual responses driven by wide-field movement: the optokinetic, optocollic, and optomotor responses, mediated by eye, head and body movements, respectively. Adult primates have a so-called symmetric horizontal response: they show the same following behavior, if the stimulus, presented to one eye only, moves in the nasal-to-temporal direction or in the temporal-to-nasal direction. By contrast, lateral-eyed birds have an asymmetric response, responding better to temporal-to-nasal movement than to nasal-to-temporal movement. We show here that the horizontal optocollic response of adult barn owls is less asymmetric than that in the chicken for all velocities tested. Moreover, the response is symmetric for low velocities (< 20 deg/s), and similar to that of primates. The response becomes moderately asymmetric for middle-range velocities (20–40 deg/s). A definitive statement for the complex situation for higher velocities (> 40 deg/s) is not possible. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The body condition of boreal species of vole-eaters seems to vary largely according to fluctuations in vole populations and weather conditions of the preceding winter. I studied females and males of the Tawny Owl Strix aluco of temperate origin near the northern limit of the species’ range in southern Finland to reveal if they show similar patterns to the boreal species. Winter weather conditions before breeding seemed to have pronounced effects on the food availability of Tawny Owls. In females, intrinsic factors such as colour morph and age, as well as the body condition of the mate and the stage of the season (Julian date), governed body condition. In males, only age and Julian date showed pronounced relationships with body condition. The results suggest that deep snow cover protects vole populations through winter until spring better than a minor amount of snow and that frequent temperature fluctuations around the freezing point in early spring make voles more available for owls that are preparing for breeding. This was also reflected positively in the body condition of female owls.

ABSTRACT: Massive quantities of unadvisable synthetic pesticides are used in modern agricultural industries in order to increase productivity to convene food demands. Wild birds are an excellent bio-indicator of environmental contaminations as pesticides and heavy metals are intentionally highly hazardous pollutants. Considerably, raptorial birds (owls) attract consumers in the food chain and food web because they have wider forager and foraging grounds. In the current investigation, owl pellets were used as a viable tool and novel approach to detecting environmental contaminants. In total, 30 pellets comprising five species were collected from selected farmlands, and 11 metals (Cr, Mn, Co, Mo, Se, V, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, and Fe) were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Undeniably, the Brown Fish Owl showed more metal accumulation than the Barn Owl, Spotted Owl, Indian Eagle Owl, and Mottled Wood Owl. Among the species, the levels of metals such as Manganese (Mn), Molybdenum (Mo), Vanadium (V), Copper (Cu) and Zinc (Zn) varied significantly (p < 0.05). Nonetheless, the research revealed that the agroecosystem was contaminated with heavy metals. The present outcome highlights that the management of the environment, especially the agroecosystem, must be examined with a careful assessment of contaminants, and it is a vital resource for human and other related wildlife faunal communities. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: European populations of the barn owl Tyto alba are undergoing a sharp decline. The assessment of habitat structure, feeding habits and nestling quality is relevant to the conservation of this bird of prey, particularly in the Iberian Peninsula. The aim of this study was to analyse habitat features of nesting sites and diet of chicks in order to assess their effects on brood size, body condition and nutritional status of Iberian barn owl offspring. Nests were sampled in Madrid County (central Spain) during spring 2019. After pellet analysis from chicks, prey richness and prey diversity were higher in more heterogeneous habitats (identified by data processing with GIS). Large brood sizes were more frequent next to urban areas, with greater consumption of human-associated Muridae (house mouse Mus musculus and brown rat Rattus norvegicus). Conversely, chicks showed better body condition (body mass controlled by size measurements) and nutritional status (blood samples: glucose, proteins, triglycerides and alkaline phosphatase levels) in mountainous habitats with well-developed vegetation. In this habitat type, diet was based on wild micromammals (Etruscan shrew Suncus etruscus, Cabrera's vole Microtus cabrerae and wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus). Ecological, morphological and physiological traits are different indicators that provide more accurate insights into the productivity and nestling quality in the barn owl. This information may be applied by policy-makers and environmental managers for the conservation of Iberian barn owl populations. © 2022 Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Lunar phases might favor the maintenance of color polymorphism via disruptive selection if the different color variants performed differently in terms of prey capture under different moonlight levels. Moonlight, however, may affect prey capture as a side effect of its influence on prey behavior. Here we combine data of parental provisioning and quality of owlets with one ex-situ study of grasshopper activity to test whether Eurasian scops owls (Otus scops) with different plumage color and their prey are differently affected by moonlight. Food provisioning increased from new- to full-moon. However, the effect of moonlight on owlet mass gain and immune response depended on paternal coloration. On the one hand, body mass gain of nestlings of the greyest fathers increased from nights with new- to full-moon, whereas it did not change with moonlight for the brownest fathers. On the other hand, PHA response of nestlings of the brownest fathers increased with high moonlight levels during the first week of life, whereas it did not change with moonlight levels for the greyest fathers. Grasshoppers were more active at new moon than at full or waning moon. Our study provides supporting evidence that moonlight influences the behavior of both scops owls and its prey and suggests that fluctuations in environmental conditions can modulate the advantages of morphs. These results are important because they provide a general insight into a little appreciated mechanism for the maintenance of color polymorphism in natural populations based on the interactive effect of different environmental factors. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

ABSTRACT: Invasive predators can have detrimental impacts on native species and biological communities through direct consumptive effects and indirect effects on trophic interactions, yet these relations are often poorly understood through the initial stages of predator expansion. Leveraging early, lethal collection efforts to study invasive barred owls (Strix varia) at the leading edge of their range expansion in northeastern California, we conducted DNA metabarcoding of intestinal samples to assess the diet of this invasive predator. Through the development of customized primers and this novel approach to observing owl diet, we screened the intestinal contents of 124 barred owls and detected a broad diet of 78 unique prey types (48 vertebrates and 30 invertebrates), including prey types undetected in previous methodologies. Mammals were the most consumed vertebrate class (frequency of occurrence = 65 %), followed by amphibians (32 %), birds (22 %), and reptiles (19 %). Diets differed regionally but were similar among ages and sexes and exhibited limited variation in response to local environmental conditions. Our work highlights the generalist predatory strategy of invasive barred owls, identifies numerous native species potentially threatened by their range expansion, and indicates that they will not serve as ecological replacements for congeneric spotted owls (Strix occidentalis) they displace. These findings suggest that expanding currently limited barred owl removals could benefit native species and communities in western North America. More broadly, we demonstrate DNA metabarcoding, combined with early intervention, provides a powerful tool for conducting detailed assessments of species consumed by invasive predators, potentially incentivizing conservation actions and improving outcomes. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Ural Owls Strix uralensis often use nest boxes, but there have been few reports of them using other man-made structures. We discovered a Ural Owl nest on a steel tower in a suburban area in Ibaraki Prefecture, central Japan, in May 2019. The nest had been built in a jointed part of the steel frame that supported the body of the tower, which was approximately 10 m-high. In this case, a neighboring shelterbelt seemed to provide the owls with leaf litter for the nest floor and hiding places for the parents and their fledglings.  © 2022 Ornithological Society of Japan.

ABSTRACT: We outline a concept for OWL-Moon, a 50-100 m aperture telescope located on the surface of the Moon, to address three major areas in astronomy, namely the detection of biosignatures on habitable exoplanets, the geophysics of exoplanets, and cosmology. Such a large lunar telescope, when coupled with large Earth-based telescopes, would allow Intensity Interferometric measurements, leading to pico-arcsecond angular resolution. This would have applications in many areas of astronomy and is timely in light of the renewed interest of space agencies in returning to the Moon. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

ABSTRACT: The validation of the use of primary cell lines from non-lethal matrixes of feathers and blood of nestlings of a wild bird species, the tawny owl (Strix aluco) is described. Tawny Owl Feather Fibroblast (TOFF) cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and cultured from the pulp of the secondary wing feathers and whole blood respectively from free-living tawny owl nestlings. Cell growth was registered up until 48 h for both the PBMC cells and the TOFFs. The validation of these primary cell lines in free-living birds has the potential to advance the assessment of immunotoxicological effects in wildlife via non-lethal manner. They provide a key tool with which to study cell toxicity and responses to environmental stressors on a cellular level in wild bird species of interest.

ABSTRACT: Fundamental demographic data of insular populations of Otus owls are not available for most species. This study investigated the population size and the sex ratio of the Ryukyu Scops Owls Otus elegans on Hateruma Island. Capture-recapture data was obtained by intensive marking and route census surveys from July to September in 2021. Analysing the data using a site-occupancy model combined with a data-augmentation technique, the population size was estimated as 155.470 individuals (97.575 males and 57.895 females), with a significant male-biased sex ratio (0.631).  © 2022 Ornithological Society of Japan.

ABSTRACT: Objective. To observe the behavior, hormonal patterns, and welfare in captive mottled owl Strix virgata (Strigidae). Materials and methods. The study was conducted at environmental management units (UMA) in Xalapa, Mexico, on six owls: two females in one enclosure, one male and one female in another, all without public exhibition and with environmental enrichment, and two isolated owls, kept caged or perched, with daytime public exhibition. Behaviors were monitored in each pair or individual during 120 hours of filming (60 h during the day and 60 h at night). Concentrations of fecal metabolites of corticosterone, estradiol, and progesterone were measured, and welfare was assessed with observational indicators and surveys. Results. The paired owls showed normal behaviors and excellent welfare (95.5%), while the isolated individuals showed undesirable behaviors and regular welfare (51.4%). Of 24 behaviors considered in an ethogram, 11 were observed repeatedly in all specimens. The isolated birds had higher agonistic, feeding, and individual activity (p<0.001) than the paired birds, although it did not result in lower levels of corticosterone (p=0.09) nor estrogens (p=0.29) in females, only in progesterone (p=0.001). Conclusions. In captive mottled owls, daytime exhibition and inadequate facilities promote the presence of undesirable behaviors that can affect their welfare. Therefore, the use of enrichment measures, such as larger enclosures, feeding at night, and pair housing (female and male, or two females) should be considered to reduce the negative effects of captivity and increase their welfare. © The Author(s) 2021.

ABSTRACT: Twelve adult burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia) maintained in a managed environment underwent complete bilateral ophthalmic examinations to assess ocular parameters and, if present, describe lesions (n = 24 eyes). Tear production was measured with a Schirmer tear test (STT), and intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured with rebound tonometry using established calibration settings (D = dog/cat, P = other species). Retinography was performed for all birds after application of topical rocuronium bromide, and corneal diameter was measured. Menace response was absent bilaterally in 7 of 12 (58.3%) owls; however, this did not appear to be related to the presence of fundic lesions. Ocular lesions were visualized in 6 of 12 (50%) owls. The most common ophthalmic abnormality noted was mild multifocal fundic pigment clumping, suggestive of chorioretinal scarring. Other ocular lesions included 1 retinal tear and 1 incipient cataract. Mean tear production was 6.1 ± 3.0 mm/min. Mean IOPs were 11.6 ± 1.8 mm Hg and 7.1 ± 1.3 mm Hg for the D and P settings, respectively, and these were significantly different (P < 0.001). The IOP results did not differ significantly based on patient age or between the right and left eyes, but a higher mean was obtained from males versus females using the D setting (P < 0.039; male mean 12.1 ± 1.9 mm Hg; female mean 10.9 ± 1.2 mm Hg). Measurements obtained from the STT were not affected by either age or sex. Corneal height was 11 mm and width was 12 mm, regardless of age or sex. The rebound tonometer D setting is recommended for measuring IOP values in this species. Burrowing owls had inconsistent mydriasis following topical rocuronium bromide application to the eye; however, a complete fundic examination was possible with or without complete mydriasis.  ©

ABSTRACT: The study of insular populations was key in the development of evolutionary theory. The successful colonisation of an island depends on the geographic context, and specific characteristics of the organism and the island, but also on stochastic processes. As a result, apparently identical islands may harbour populations with contrasting histories. Here, we use whole genome sequences of 65 barn owls to investigate the patterns of inbreeding and genetic diversity of insular populations in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. We focus on Crete and Cyprus, islands with similar size, climate and distance to mainland, that provide natural replicates for a comparative analysis of the impacts of microevolutionary processes on isolated populations. We show that barn owl populations from each island have a separate origin, Crete being genetically more similar to other Greek islands and mainland Greece, and Cyprus more similar to the Levant. Further, our data show that their respective demographic histories following colonisation were also distinct. On the one hand, Crete harbours a small population and maintains very low levels of gene flow with neighbouring populations. This has resulted in low genetic diversity, strong genetic drift, increased relatedness in the population and remote inbreeding. Cyprus, on the other hand, appears to maintain enough gene flow with the mainland to avoid such an outcome. Our study provides a comparative population genomic analysis of the effects of neutral processes on a classical island-mainland model system. It provides empirical evidence for the role of stochastic processes in determining the fate of diverging isolated populations. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: How do Great Gray Owls (Strix nebulosa) capture voles (Cricetidae) through a layer of snow? As snow is a visual barrier, the owls locate voles by ear alone. To test how snow absorbs and refracts vole sound, we inserted a loudspeaker under the snowpack and analysed sound from the loudspeaker, first buried, then unburied. Snow attenuation coefficients rose with frequency (0.3 dB cm -1 at 500 Hz, 0.6 dB cm -1 at 3 kHz) such that low-frequency sound transmitted best. The Great Gray Owl has the largest facial disc of any owl, suggesting they are adapted to use this low-frequency sound. We used an acoustic camera to spatially localize sound source location, and show that snow also refracts prey sounds (refractive index: 1.16). To an owl not directly above the prey, this refraction creates an 'acoustic mirage': prey acoustic position is offset from its actual location. Their hunting strategy defeats this mirage because they hover directly over prey, which is the listening position with least refraction and least attenuation. Among all birds, the Great Gray Owl has the most extreme wing morphologies associated with quiet flight. These extreme wing traits may function to reduce the sounds of hovering, with implications for bioinspiration.  © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Barking Owl Ninox connivens has two recognised subspecies in Australia: N. c. connivens and N. c. peninsularis. N. c. connivens currently includes the isolated south-west Australian population, which is separated from eastern populations by the Nullarbor Plain and from N. c. peninsularis to the north. N. c. connivens in south-west Australia occurs from near Perth in the north, east to Northam and south-east to Katanning and Bremer Bay; it has been treated subspecifically as N. c. addendaMathews, 1912, but this name is not currently in use. Given concern over the apparent rarity of the south-west Australian population, we sought to compile all known historical and contemporary records in order to assess its conservation status and ecology. We located the holotype of N. c. addendaMathews, 1912, and found only ten sightings in the past 20 years that met our criteria for acceptance. No sound-recordings or photographs of wild birds are known.  © 2022 The Authors;.

ABSTRACT: Studying species that nest underground, such as the Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia) is challenging. Ecological and behavioral information about Burrowing Owls is often limited to activities occurring aboveground or to insights gained from live viewing using downhole cameras and burrow scopes with limited recording capacity. Although automated monitoring systems may enhance underground observations, such systems need to be self-powered to support research conducted in remote areas. We describe a self-powered (off-grid) digital video recording system developed in 2014 to monitor nesting Burrowing Owls at Rio Bosque Wetlands Park in El Paso, Texas, USA. We used solar panels, infrared cameras, and digital video recorders to create a self-contained system for monitoring two artificial Burrowing Owl nest sites. From 2014 to 2018, we collected high-resolution video recordings of Burrowing Owl nesting ecology and behavior in their underground artificial burrows and nest boxes in remote areas. We provide detailed instructions and recommendations for the design, construction, installation, and maintenance of this system. Although our system required some initial material and labor costs, it required less on-site work than traditional behavioral observations, while also providing high-quality video images of an understudied aspect of Burrowing Owl ecology. Key ecological insight gained included nest initiation dates, clutch sizes, incubation dates, hatching sequences, prey items delivered to the nest, and predators of Burrowing Owls in the El Paso area. We encountered substantial technical problems but recommend the overall design of our system.  © 2021 Ornithological Societies of North America. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Paleo-and neo-taphonomic analyses of bone assemblages rarely consider all the occurring taxa in a single study and works concerning birds of prey as accumulators of microvertebrate bone remains mostly focus on small mammals such as rodents and soricomorphs. However, raptors often hunt and consume a large range of taxa, including vertebrates such as small mammals, fishes, amphibians, squamates and birds. Bone remains of all these taxonomic groups are numerous in many paleontological and archaeological records, especially in cave deposits. To better characterize the predators at the origin of fossil and sub-fossil microvertebrate accumulations and the taphonomic history of the deposit, it is thus mandatory to conduct global and multi-taxa taphonomic approaches. The aim of this study is to provide an example of such a global approach through the investigation of a modern bone assemblage from a sample of pellets produced by the Lesser Antillean Barn Owl (Tyto insularis) in the island of Dominica. We propose a new methodology that allows us to compare different taxa (rodents, bats, squamates and birds) and to experiment with a cross-validation process using two observers for each taxonomic group to test the reliability of the taphonomic observations. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Diurnal preference for evening time has been associated with poorer physical and mental health outcomes. In the current report, perceived loneliness and brain structure (hippocampal and amygdala volumes) were compared in a large (N = 4684) sample of morning- and evening-type individuals. Definite eveningness was associated with increased odds for reporting self-perceived loneliness and lonely evening-types had significantly smaller right hippocampal volume as compared to morning and more socially connected evening types. These data add to the mounting body of evidence linking an evening profile with increased risk for psychiatric disorder. © 2021 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Many predators can adapt to human-altered habitats, but varying responses to human activity mean that the findings of studies of a species in one region may not apply even to related species at other locations. The Eastern Screech- Owl (Megascops asio) has been extensively studied in suburban environments, but comparatively little research has investigated to what extent the closely related Western Screech-Owl (M. kennicottii) persists in developed areas. I studied Western Screech-Owl occupancy in the town of Alpine in the foothills of San Diego County, California, finding the species at the majority of sites sampled, more likely in larger wooded patches and in those adjacent to undeveloped chaparral. The distance to and size of nearby wooded patches did not statistically influence occupancy. This study confirmed that the Western Screech-Owl can persist in suburban residential areas as does its eastern relative. Ensuring that patches of woodland remain larger than the minimum modeled threshold for the Western Screech-Owl's occupancy, 4.2 ha, will be important for its persistence in the suburban sprawl of Alpine. © 2022 Western Field Ornithologists.

ABSTRACT: Several studies emphasize the use of owl pellets in small mammal inventories in natural areas harboring high richness of rare species, but few Brazilian Atlantic forest localities have been surveyed by this method. The present study documents the species composition and abundance of small mammals in the diet of Tyto furcata in an urban area of the municipality of Campos dos Goytacazes, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, remarking on a new record of the dwarf mouse opossum genus Cryptonanus in the Atlantic forest. We analyzed 265 pellets regurgitated by a pair of T. furcata from November 2016 to September 2017 found in a nesting box. Analysis of the samples enabled finding a total of 596 individuals of four small mammal species. Mus musculus was predominant among the prey items (98.3%), while the native rodents Necromys lasiurus (1.3%) and Holochilus brasiliensis (0,17%) were much rarer. A single specimen of Cryptonanus sp. was identified among the diet items based on distinctive dental characters. The identification of this genus in the present study represents the second record in the state of Rio de Janeiro, and the sixth in the Atlantic Forest biome, suggesting that this marsupial occupies a wider ecological and biogeographic range. The present study underscores the relevance of owl pellets for small mammal surveys, even in urban and highly disturbed areas. © 2022, Instituto Internacional de Ecologia. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Predator–prey relationships are of great significance to ecosystems, and their effects on the population dynamics of voles and lemmings (Microtinae) in Boreal and Arctic environments have long been of particular interest. A simple ecosystem with one major prey and one major predator could be an ideal setting for a study of their interactions. This is the situation on several small islands on the coast of northern Norway just below the Arctic Circle, with populations of water voles Arvicola amphibius preyed upon by the eagle owl Bubo bubo. The population dynamics of the water vole was studied by trapping and tagging in 2003–2018, eagle owl pellets were collected for analyses, eagle owl breeding attempts were recorded, and some weather variables collected from official recordings. After having been introduced well into the study period, the number of sheep Ovis aries was also recorded. Water voles were the main prey of the eagle owl, with 89% occurrence in pellets, with an overrepresentation of adults and males. Both predation, sheep grazing and extreme weather events influenced the vole population. Predator exclusion, as happened in three summers due to an intensive radio tracking study, especially increased the number of surviving young (in particular from the early cohorts) and the mass of adults. Extreme weather events, such as flooding in summer and deeply frozen ground in winter, most significantly reduced vole populations. Sheep grazing may exacerbate the effects of predation. A similar multitude of factors may affect populations of other rodent species as well. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: Birds act as intermediate or definitive hosts of cyst-forming coccidia parasites of the genus Sarcocystis Lankester, 1882. However, the spectrum of species of Sarcocystis in birds and the role of the latter in the transmission of coccidia are still incomplete for many avian species, including the Tengmalm's owl Aegolius funereus (Linnaeus, 1758). During the research on Tengmalm's owls in Finland, some fledglings were found dead and subsequently parasitologically examined. Therefore, this study is focused on the morphological and molecular description of a Sarcocystis species found in the intestine of the Tengmalm's owl and its possible role as a definitive host. Methods: Eleven fledgling owls in the Kauhava region of west-central Finland were found dead and subsequently were submitted for necropsy and parasitologically examined through the flotation–centrifugation coprological technique for the presence of oocysts/sporocysts of the genus Sarcocystis by light microscopy. Wet mounts were used for the examination of muscle samples (breast, legs, and heart). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nested-PCR were carried out using primers for 18S rRNA, 28S rRNA, ITS1 region, and CO1 genes. Results: All 11 examined owls were parasitized by numerous sporocysts and oocysts in the intestinal mucosa scrapings (prevalence, 100%). Sporulated oocysts and sporocysts measured 16.34–16.96 × 11.47–12.09 μm and 11.85–13.52 × 7.77–9.25 μm, respectively. The skeletal and heart muscles were negative for sarcocysts. Sarcocystis sp. ex Aegolius funereus (hereafter Sarcocystis sp. Af) is closely related to Sarcocystis strixi in the barred owl (Strix varia Barton, 1799) from the USA and Sarcocystis sp. isolate 5 in the European shrew (Sorex araneus Linnaeus, 1758) from the Czech Republic. Phylogenetic analysis allowed determining the relationship of the herein reported Sarcocystis sp. with its congeners. Conclusions: This work provided the first and most comprehensive record on Sarcocystis from owls obtained in Finland, thus highlighting the importance of molecular data in species identification.

ABSTRACT: During summer 2019, we recorded an apparent vocal interaction, lasting just under 4 min, between a pair of Great Horned Owls (Bubo virginianus) and a gray wolf (Canis lupus) in Yellowstone National Park. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such an acoustic interaction in the scientific literature. The increased use of passive acoustic recorders, which record spontaneous vocalizations emitted by animals over long periods, will allow us to better document and study the importance of such interspecific interactions.  ©

ABSTRACT: Territorial animals often reduce aggression towards familiar neighbours compared to unfamiliar conspecifics. However, variation in the response to different neighbours is less known. In this work, I examined the territorial behaviour of male scops owls during countersinging interactions with two familiar neighbours and I asked whether vocal behaviour of the focal male reflected dear-enemy relationships. Analysis revealed that the focal male's vocal frequency was associated with (1) the degree of instability of the territory boundary shared with a neighbour and (2) the motivation to persist in the dyadic interaction with that neighbour. Patterns of movement directed to specific individuals suggest that scops owls do discriminate between neighbours. A case of partial territory takeover was observed that was accompanied by temporal changes in vocal frequency in one of the opponents, confirming that vocal frequency is a flexible, context-dependent feature of the relationship of neighbouring scops owls.  © KONINKLIJKE BRILL NV, LEIDEN, 2023.

ABSTRACT: Rapid population declines of many long-distance Afro-Palaearctic migratory bird species are ongoing across Europe but the demographic drivers are often poorly understood, thereby limiting the development of appropriate conservation actions. Using long-term population monitoring (39 years), capture–mark–recapture data and a matrix model, we estimated demographic parameters and the effect of climate variables on adult survival, and modelled the dynamics of an increasing population of Eurasian Scops Owls Otus scops in a landscape with agricultural abandonment in western France. The observed mean annual population growth rate was 1.055 (from 68 to 523 territorial males between 1981 and 2019). Over the study period, clutch size and hatching success were stable, but fledging success and breeding success showed slight negative trends, probably due to density-dependence. Survival varied with age, with an increase during early life and evidence for rapid senescence from 4 years old. Adult survival remained stable and was positively linked to the amount of autumn rainfall in the Sahel and to the winter North Atlantic Oscillation. Survival of younger age-classes made the largest contribution to the variance of the population growth rate, followed by clutch size, fledging success and survival of older birds. Such a long-term population increase in a landscape where intensive agriculture has decreased by 64.6% sheds some new light on the causes of the decline of European Scops Owl and other Afro-Palaearctic bird populations. We infer some of the possible causes of this large-scale decline, in particular food shortage, and discuss conservation measures that could be applicable to reverse this trend. © 2021 British Ornithologists' Union.

ABSTRACT: Avian evaporative cooling and the maintenance of body temperature (Tb) below lethal limits during heat exposure has received more attention in small species compared to larger-bodied taxa. Here, we examined thermoregulation at air temperatures (Tair) approaching and exceeding normothermic Tb in three larger birds that use gular flutter, thought to provide the basis for pronounced evaporative cooling capacity and heat tolerance. We quantified Tb, evaporative water loss (EWL) and resting metabolic rate (RMR) in the ∼170-g Namaqua sandgrouse (Pterocles namaqua), ∼430-g spotted thick-knee (Burhinus capensis) and ∼670-g spotted eagle-owl (Bubo africanus), using flow-through respirometry and a stepped Tair profile with very low chamber humidities. All three species tolerated Tair of 56–60°C before the onset of severe hyperthermia, with maximum Tb of 43.2°C, 44.3°C, and 44.2°C in sandgrouse, thick-knees and eagle-owls, respectively. Evaporative scope (i.e., maximum EWL/minimum thermoneutral EWL) was 7.4 in sandgrouse, 12.9 in thick-knees and 7.8 in eagle-owls. The relationship between RMR and Tair varied substantially among species: whereas thick-knees and eagle-owls showed clear upper critical limits of thermoneutrality above which RMR increased rapidly and linearly, sandgrouse did not. Maximum evaporative heat loss/metabolic heat production ranged from 2.8 (eagle-owls) to 5.5 (sandgrouse), the latter the highest avian value yet reported. Our data reveal some larger species with gular flutter possess pronounced evaporative cooling capacity and heat tolerance and, when taken together with published data, show thermoregulatory performance varies widely among species larger than 250 g. Our data for Namaqua sandgrouse reveal unexpectedly pronounced variation in the metabolic costs of evaporative cooling within the genus Pterocles.

ABSTRACT: In mammals, scent marking behavior is a pervasive form of chemical communication that regulates social interactions within and between groups. Glandular microbiota consist of bacterial communities capable of producing chemical cues used in olfactory communication. Despite countless studies on scent marking in primates, few have examined the microbiota associated with glandular secretions. Nancy Ma's owl monkeys (Aotus nancymaae) are nocturnal, socially monogamous primates that frequently scent mark using their subcaudal glands. Previous analyses revealed that unique chemical signatures of Aotus may convey information about sex and age. We used positive reinforcement to sample the subcaudal glands of 23 captive owl monkeys to describe their glandular microbiomes and examine how patterns in these bacterial communities vary with age, sex, rearing environment and/or social group (pair identity). We coupled these analyses with behavioral observations to examine patterns in their scent marking behavior. We isolated 31 bacterial species from Phyla Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria, consistent with the dermal and glandular microbiomes of other primates. Several bacterial taxa we identified produce volatile organic compounds, which may contribute to olfactory communication. These bacterial communities are best predicted by an interaction between sex, rearing environment and pair identity rather than any of these variables alone. Within mated pairs of A. nancymaae, males and females scent mark their nest boxes at similar frequencies. In some pairs, rates of scent marking by males and females fluctuated over time in a similar manner. Pairs that had been together longer tended to exhibit the greatest similarities in their rates of scent marking. Together, these findings suggest that scent marking behavior and close social interactions with pair mates in Aotus may influence bacterial transmission and their glandular microbiomes. Chemical communication, including coordinated scent marking, may play a role in strengthening pair bonds, signaling pair status and/or in mate guarding in this socially monogamous primate. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

ABSTRACT: The silent flight of owls is well known. It has served as role model for the designs of new airplane wings and ventilators. One of the structural features that underlies silent flight is the serrated leading edge of the wing that is mainly formed by the tenth primary flight feather (P10). We examined here how much the wings, the P10 feather and the serrations in different populations of barn owls reflect the intact situation. First, when the P10 feather molts, no or fewer serrations are present. Furthermore, damage to feathers and serrations may occur. Damage may be due to several factors like broken feather tips, lost rami, barbules, or broken tips of serrations. The latter may cause a narrowing of the outer vane of the P10 feather. We quantitatively assessed damage by counting the number of wings with missing or broken primary feathers, the number of wings with a narrowed outer vane of the P10 feather, and the number of serrations with reduced length. Considerable damage occurred on wings and feathers on both the macroscopic and microscopic levels. The observed damage most likely influences flight performance. More damage occurred in Galapagos barn owls than in North American and European barn owls. The Galapagos population may be more vulnerable than the other populations because it may at least temporarily be in a bad nutritional state and, thus, postpone molt. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH

ABSTRACT: Population reinforcement programs using captive-bred individuals are effective tools in species conservation. One of the key aspects contributing to the success of such programs is the selection of a suitable habitat, one that meets a species’ biotic and abiotic needs through space and time. However, securing adequate locations does not always imply that the released individuals remain at the release site. This study provides a record of unusual post-release spatial behaviour and erroneous habitat selection by the little owl (Athene noctua), for which a reinforcement program was launched in the Pilsen region in the Czech Republic due to the constant decline in the size of the local population. During observations, the absence of forest avoidance typical for Central European populations, along with underground roosting, were observed. More specifically, one of the soft-released individuals settled in a patch of dense forest establishing a home range equivalent in size to 3.54 ha. Within its home range, underground cavities were regularly used for diurnal roosting. To determine whether this behaviour was an accidental event or the result of captive breeding, and thus whether its manifestation can be expected in other individuals that originate from captivity in the future, additional observation of the released owls is needed. © 2021 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Background: The intensification of agricultural practices over the twentieth century led to a cascade of detrimental effects on ecosystems. In Europe, agri-environment schemes (AES) have since been adopted to counter the decrease in farmland biodiversity, with the promotion of extensive habitats such as wildflower strips and extensive meadows. Despite having beneficial effects documented for multiple taxa, their profitability for top farmland predators, like raptors, is still debated. Such species with high movement capabilities have large home ranges with fluctuation in habitat use depending on specific needs. Methods: Using GPS devices, we recorded positions for 134 barn owls (Tyto alba) breeding in Swiss farmland and distinguished three main behavioural modes with the Expectation-Maximization binary Clustering (EMbC) method: perching, hunting and commuting. We described barn owl habitat use at different levels during the breeding season by combining step and path selection functions. In particular, we examined the association between behavioural modes and habitat type, with special consideration for AES habitat structures. Results: Despite a preference for the most common habitats at the home range level, behaviour-specific analyses revealed more specific habitat use depending on the behavioural mode. During the day, owls roosted almost exclusively in buildings, while pastures, meadows and forest edges were preferred as nocturnal perching sites. For hunting, barn owls preferentially used AES habitat structures though without neglecting more intensively exploited areas. For commuting, open habitats were preferred over wooded areas. Conclusions: The behaviour-specific approach used here provides a comprehensive breakdown of barn owl habitat selection during the reproductive season and highlights its importance to understand complex animal habitat preferences. Our results highlight the importance of AES in restoring and maintaining functional trophic chains in farmland. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: One third of the worldwide amphibian species are threatened, therefore, efficient monitoring efforts are needed. Amphibians which adopt a hidden lifestyle, such as the common spadefoot toad, are often missed with standard surveying efforts. Spadefoot toads can be identified in regurgitated pellets of the barn owl, which provides an effective way to estimate toad activity. In our study we analyzed frequency of spadefoot toad remains from 2004 to 2016 in a steppe landscape in eastern Austria. Methods: We used an automated model selection procedure together with a GLM analysis using a zero inflated error Poisson distribution, to analyze the presence of Pelobates fuscus in barn owl pellets. All analyses were done in the statistical software R, and the scripts to reproduce our results are available within this publication. Our approach may provide a template for other researchers to use for their own pellet data. Conclusions: Our analysis suggested that activity of the common spadefoot toad is mainly influenced by rainfalls, while time of the year and temperature had small but significant effects. Interestingly, our data confirmed the possibility of a second breeding period in summer, triggered by heavy rainfalls. There were no indications for a population decrease in the observed years and locations. Our study shows that barn owl pellets can be used effectivley to assess pelobatid activity in an area. This might constitute a useful monitoring tool for conservation management for amphibians. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Documenting and interpreting trends in the abundance and distribution of bird populations is critical to monitoring their status and setting conservation priorities. This process requires standardized monitoring and robust analytical techniques, which can resolve trends at spatial scales of management interest while disentangling the influence that various data collection protocols can have on the interpretation of results. We used a 19-year citizen-science-collected dataset (2001–2019), the Nocturnal Owl Survey, to assess abundance trends in Barred Owl (Strix varia), Northern Saw-whet Owl (Aegolius acadicus), and Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus) at both fine and broad-scales. To achieve this, we used a spatially explicit modeling approach that facilitates the borrowing of information across spatial boundaries, allowing for more robust trend estimates at finer spatial scales. Further, we assessed the potential influence of the call-playback protocol on trend estimates. At fine spatial scales, we found that a data collection protocol that includes call playbacks provided more precise results to assess relative changes in abundance (i.e., reduced uncertainty). At broader spatial scales, trend estimates were unaffected by data collection methodology (i.e., silent listening versus call playback). Specifically, at the scale of the region or province, we found that populations of focal owl species in the Maritimes of Canada have remained stable over the past 19 years. However, at finer scales, trends are more variable and may create opportunities to test alternative hypotheses about drivers of population change and the effects of management actions at scales amenable to conservation action. The statistical analyses are anticipated to form a national, publicly accessible framework for status assessments of owls in Canada and will provide resource managers and researchers a base from which to evaluate the influence of land management and conservation practices on owl populations across the nation. © 2022 by the author(s).

ABSTRACT: We report the depredation by a single Eastern Barn Owl Tyto javanica delicatula on prospecting White-faced Storm Petrels Pelagodroma marina during the re-establishment phase of a colony on Big Island, off Port Kembla, New South Wales, Australia in 2018. Storm petrels were likely extirpated from this colony 56 years previously when invasive weeds rendered their habitat inaccessible. Restoration of vegetation together with storm petrel call broadcasting, commencing in 2014, resulted in significant increases in prospecting numbers, culminating in breeding (three pairs) in the 2017/18 austral summer season. A significant depredation event (> 59 adults) occurred between August and September 2018, providing a set-back to colony establishment. Previously, barn owl depredation on Big Island had been limited to Silver Gulls Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae as prey. However, in the 2018/19 season, the gulls commenced nesting later than usual. The delay appeared to cause the owl to switch target prey. Despite the intense depredation pressure, at least two pairs of storm petrels attempted to breed in the 2018/19 season and 10 birds were trapped and banded at the commencement of the 2019/20 season. Discovery of the mainland roost of the owl was attempted between the two seasons, and its potential death by car strike was investigated. Our findings show that even a single individual predator can have significant impacts on seabird colonies establishing or re-establishing in island environments, especially those under restoration. © 2022, Marine Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: The diet composition of Pharaoh Eagle Owl (Bubo ascalaphus) was investigated in a semiarid area of North-western Algeria. A total of 65 pellets regurgitated by the B. ascalaphus were analysed, 288 food items were composed primarily of mammal remains (4 rodents, 1 bat and insectivore, 93.7%), and 1 bird species (passerine, 6.3%). The most frequent prey among the mammals were rodents (83.3%), which included Mus musculus (59.7%), Meriones shawi (11.1%), Meriones libycus (11.1%) and Jaculus jaculus (1.4%). The rodents were the most important prey items in biomass (91.4%), M. shawi made up to 41.9% of the total biomass. We may conclude that the Pharaoh Eagle Owl relies, in its feeding, very broadly on small mammals, completed by other groups. © 2021 BirdLife Hungary. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Owls are important avian predators in forested systems, but little is known about landscape use by most forest-adapted owl species in environments impacted by mixed-severity wildfire. To better understand species-specific patterns of post-wildfire landscape use within an owl guild, we used passive acoustic monitoring using autonomous recording units. The technology is effective for multi-species surveys, especially if some species are rare, nocturnal, or difficult to detect by traditional means. In 2017, we surveyed the interior and adjacent unburned areas of a 10,700-ha mixed-severity wildfire that burned in 2015 in southwest Oregon. We used occupancy modeling to identify patterns of landscape use by five species of forest owls: barred owls (Strix varia), great horned owls (Bubo virginianus), western screech-owls (Megascops kennicottii), northern pygmy-owls (Glaucidium gnoma), and northern saw-whet owls (Aegolius acadicus). Our results showed a positive relationship between increasing fire severity and probability of use by western screech-owls and a similar but somewhat weaker relationship for northern pygmy-owls. Barred owls were rarely detected in severely burned areas and their use decreased with increased fire severity. We observed generally low landscape use for great horned owls, which decreased with increased fire severity and at higher elevations. Thus, four out of the five species appeared to use recently burned forests at different levels, with only northern saw-whet owls showing near-complete avoidance of the burned area. These findings increase our understanding of the basic ecology of each species and highlight the varied use of burned areas within this community. These previously undocumented patterns of landscape use in burned landscapes should provide insights to managers and policymakers in the Pacific Northwest as climate shifts, and fires may increase in size, frequency, and severity. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Aerodynamic functions of the avian tail have been studied previously using observations of bird flight, physical models in wind tunnels, theoretical modelling and flow visualization. However, none of these approaches has provided rigorous, quantitative evidence concerning tail functions because (i) appropriate manipulation and controls cannot be achieved using live animals and (ii) the aerodynamic interplay between the wings and body challenges reductive theoretical or physical modelling approaches. Here, we have developed a comprehensive analytical drag model, calibrated by high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and used it to investigate the aerodynamic action of the tail by virtually manipulating its posture. The bird geometry used for CFD was reconstructed previously using stereo-photogrammetry of a freely gliding barn owl (Tyto alba) and we validated the CFD simulations against wake measurements. Using this CFD-calibrated drag model, we predicted the drag production for 16 gliding flights with a range of tail postures. These observed postures are set in the context of a wider parameter sweep of theoretical postures, where the tail spread and elevation angles were manipulated independently. The observed postures of our gliding bird corresponded to near minimal total drag.  © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: The accumulation of prey remains in the pellets of the great gray owl in the winter and nesting periods was studied over a number of years at the contact of the taiga and northern forested steppe belts in the Trans-Urals. It is shown which of the characteristics of the hunting territory and the population of small mammals have the greatest effect on the composition and ratio of prey species. A comparison with the results of the feeding activity of the eagle owl was also made. Published information concerning four places of long-term nesting on rocks in the river valleys of the western slope of the Middle Urals in similar natural conditions was used as well. Selective accumulation of prey remains of these two owl species was revealed to lie in a small number of the main prey species, those mostly populating open habitats. In both owls, mammal species of closed forest (transitional) habitats served as concomitant (secondary) prey. The eagle owl was characterized by a large size range of prey. Special attention was paid to the indicator roles the concomitant prey play in paleoreconstructions. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Background: Birds are major hosts for many tick species (Acari: Ixodidae, Argasidae), and their role is especially important in transporting ticks over large distances along their seasonal migratory routes. Accordingly, most studies across Europe focus on the importance of avian hosts in tick dispersal, and less emphasis is laid on resident birds and their role in supporting tick life cycles. Eurasian eagle owls (Bubo bubo) exemplify the latter, but all the few studies on their tick infestation were carried out in Western Europe and even those did not involve a large sample size and did not assess infestation prevalence in natural habitats. Methods: In this study, 320 ixodid ticks were collected from nestlings of Eurasian eagle owls during the period 2018–2020 in Bulgaria in south-eastern Europe. These ticks were analysed morphologically, and selected specimens molecularly based on cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (cox1) gene. The effects of environmental and habitat-related conditions and of the species of prey eaten by eagle owls on tick infestation were also evaluated. Results: The majority of ticks were identified as adults of Rhipicephalus turanicus (n = 296). In addition, 15 Hyalomma marginatum (three males, 11 nymphs and a larva), one female of Haemaphysalis erinacei and of Ha. punctata, and a nymph of Ixodes ricinus were found. Among R. turanicus, two distinct morphotypes were observed, but they do not form a monophyletic clade in the phylogenetic tree based on the mitochondrial gene cox1. We found a positive correlation between the total number of ticks on nestlings from a particular nest and the number of medium-sized to large prey mammals brought to the nestling owls. Also, the most important predictor for tick abundance was the effect of the extent of arable land (negative), while forests and grasslands contributed less, with no effect observed in case of urbanized areas and watercourses. Conclusions: The intensity of tick infestation can be high on nestling Eurasian eagle owls (mean intensity 16.59 ticks/nestling). In this study, five different tick species were recorded, among which R. turanicus dominated. Two male morphotypes of this tick species were found, but their morphological differences were not reflected by genetic diversity or phylogenetic clustering. The most important factor determining tick abundance was the land-use structure. Graphic Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: In Europe, agricultural practices have progressively evolved towards high productivity leading either to the intensification of productive and accessible areas or to the abandonment of less profitable sites. Both processes have led to the degradation of semi-natural habitats like extensive grasslands, threatening species such as the Eurasian Scops Owl Otus scops that rely on extensively managed agricultural landscapes. In this work, we aimed to assess the habitat preferences of the Scops Owl using habitat suitability models combined with a multi-scale approach. We generated a set of multi-scale predictors, considering both biotic and abiotic variables, built on two newly developed vegetation management and orthopteran abundance models. To select the variables to incorporate in a ‘best multi-scale model’, we chose the best spatial scale for each variable using univariate models and by calculating their relative importance through multi-model inference. Next, we built ensembles of small models (ESMs) at 10 different scales from 50 to 1000 m, and an additional model with each variable at its best scale (‘best multi-scale model’). The latter performed better than most of the other ESMs and allowed the creation of a high-resolution habitat suitability map for the species. Scops Owls showed a preference for dry sites with extensive and well-structured habitats with 30–40% bush cover, and relied strongly on semi-extensive grasslands covering at least 30% of the surface within 300 m of the territory centre and with high orthopteran availability near the centre (50-m radius), revealing a need for good foraging grounds near the nest. At a larger spatial scale within a radius of 1000 m, the habitat suitability of Scops Owls was negatively related to forest cover. The resulting ESM predictions provide valuable tools for conservation planning, highlighting sites in need of particular conservation efforts together with offering estimates of the percentage of habitat types and necessary prey abundance that could be used as targets in future management plans to ensure the persistence of the population. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: In several animal species, including birds, individuals are known to produce low-frequency vocalizations during aggressive interactions with conspecifics. In this study, I investigated territorial interactions between male Eurasian Scops Owls Otus scops that occupied territories in a densely packed area. The single-note hoot of the Scops Owl is generally thought to be highly repeatable; however, extensive recording of male–male interactions identified previously unrecognized variation in the structure of hoots. Male Scops Owls gave hoots at a frequency lower than usual when engaging in short-distance contests with neighbouring males. Within-subject analysis revealed that the caller’s average hoot frequency was positively correlated with the distance from its rival. During contests, males gradually reduced their hoot frequency as they approached one another, perhaps reflecting changes in the degree of escalation. Furthermore, there is evidence that male Scops Owls have voluntary control of their hoot frequency also on a very short time scale. Males gave deeper hoots immediately after the rival initiated countersinging, and returned to their usual frequency range at the end of the interaction. This study confirms in part the findings of other authors’ experimental work, where male owls adjusted their vocal frequency when challenged by an opponent. However, that study suggested that vocal frequency would encode information about the caller’s bodyweight. In contrast, the results of the present study cannot exclude the hypothesis that the hoot of the Scops Owl is a variable, conventional signal that reflects the willingness to escalate the conflict. The reliability of the signal could be maintained by the risk of retaliation by the opponent, usually located a few metres from the caller. © 2021 British Ornithologists' Union

ABSTRACT: Passive acoustic monitoring is a promising method for monitoring rare and nocturnal species, and for tracking changes in forest wildlife biodiversity. We conducted simulations to compare and evaluate various passive acoustic sampling designs effectiveness for monitoring spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) population trends. We found that each design was effective for detecting a decline (or stability) in spotted own populations within 10 years with even a moderate amount of sampling. There are however, important considerations and tradeoffs among the various design options. Often, estimated changes in use of the landscape were biased with a consistently lower magnitude of change compared to simulated changes in the population. Although this method has challenges, passive acoustic monitoring can be used to effectively monitor northern spotted owls in the Pacific Northwest. © 2021, USDA Forest Service. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Newcastle disease virus (NDV) affects commercial poultry as well as other avian species in the wild and in captivity. Although the diversity of NDV in domestic chickens has been well understood, little light has been shed on NDV outbreaks in other avian species. We provide an annotated sequence of NDV/Owl/Guwahati/01/20, a virulent strain of NDV isolated from barn owls in captivity from Guwahati in Northeast India. The complete genome is 15,192 base pairs long with a fusion protein (F) cleavage site 112 KRQKR↓F117. The isolate showed 97.67% identity with its closest match, another highly virulent strain from Indonesia isolated from vaccinated commercial chickens; however, they differ in the F cleavage site. The NDV isolate from the owl shares 83.02% and 81.88% identity with the vaccine strains R2B and LaSota, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis with F gene as well as whole-genome nucleotide sequence reveals that the NDV isolate from owl belongs to genotype VII, subgenotype VII.2, and differs significantly from all other isolates of NDV from India. © 2021 Houghton Trust Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The author evaluates his own data on the food of the Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo) in Slovakia using material he collected between 1975 and 2020. A total of 105,543 food items were identified in 254 samples taken at 136 localities. Mammals had the highest representation (Mammalia, 65 species, 58.4%), and the species composition of birds was diverse (Aves, minimally 140 species, 8.5%), but the common frog (Rana temporaria, 32.0%), from the lower vertebrates, is represented more abundantly. Invertebrates (Evertebrata, 0.1%) occurred in food residues only occasionally. The bulk of the samples were collected from eagle-owl nests. The samples were divided into three time periods (A-C), which differ in the manner of human land-use management: A up to the 1950s, with a smaller area of field plots and more extensive grazing in the uplands; B from the 1950s to the 1980s, during the Socialist period, with the concentration of agricultural production in large units; C the last 30 years, 1990 to 2020, with the gradual break-up of collective land management. The first period (A) is characterised by a strong dominance of frogs, particularly the European brown frog R. temporaria (44.6%), and a large share of small mammal species of the family Muridae (genera Apodemus and Mus). During the time of Socialism (B), eagle-owls adapted to hunting larger species of mammals and birds, and the share of frogs in their food fell by half (R. temporaria, 23.3%). With the decline in livestock production after 1990 (period C), the species diversity of birds increased: Aquatic species and raptors in particular are on the rise. Successive overgrowth of pastures in the submontane zone is reducing the hunting territories of eagle-owls. The dominance of the common vole (Microtus arvalis) in their diet has gradually increased from period A (26.8%) to period C (37.3%). Data from eleven areas around Slovakia are evaluated separately for the three time periods. In period A, the highest proportion of frogs was in the Liptov region (R. temporaria, 68.2%), when eagle-owls nested deeper in the mountains. The proportion of frogs decreased towards lower areas, and in the Ponitrie (Nitra river basin) it was only 10.8%. At the same time, the share of M. arvalis and larger prey increased. A similar trend of increasing shares of larger prey towards lower locations also applied during the Socialist period (B). In the last 30 years (C), frogs in the higher river basins have given way to European water voles Arvicola amphibius and M. arvalis. In association with the progressive overgrowth of pastures, forest species such as the yellow-necked mouse (Apodemus flavicollis) and bank vole (Myodes glareolus) are increasingly prevalent, as are the white-breasted hedgehog (Erinaceus roumanicus) and various thrushes (Turdus sp.).  © 2021 Ján Obuch, published by Sciendo.

ABSTRACT: Site fidelity after successful nesting and site shift after nest predation (win–stay, lose–shift) is a well-documented adaptation to spatially heterogeneous and temporally auto-correlated predation risk. However, site shift even after a successful nesting (win–shift) may become a better tactic than site fidelity (win–stay), if a successful nest site becomes more risky until the next nesting opportunity, and if new low-risk nest sites regularly appear. Correspondingly, selecting a new non-used nest site may become a better tactic than selecting one previously used successfully by a conspecific. I studied this dynamic by focusing on nest cavities that may be available for many years, and using nest boxes to allow an experimental design. At localities where Boreal Owls (Aegolius funereus) had nested successfully, a dyad of nest boxes was made available each year, one box in the original nest tree and one in a new tree for the season, each containing either old nest material from the successful nesting or new wood shavings. Boreal owls were more likely to select the box in the new tree when more years had elapsed since the successful nesting and since a box was installed in the original nest tree, independent of box content. The pattern of selection differed between young and old individuals for males, but not females. Young males based their selection of nest tree mainly on box content, while old males based it on time elapsed since the successful nesting in the original nest tree and how long a box had been present there. The probability of depredation of Boreal Owl nests by Pine Marten (Martes martes) has previously been found to increase with cavity age and number of nesting seasons elapsed since the previous successful nesting. This pattern of nest predation thus predicted the pattern of nest site selection found. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: As an opportunistic predator, the Common Barn-owl (Tyto alba) proved to be an appropriate model organism to survey the composition of small mammal assemblages. This study analysed barn owls’ pellet samples from 14 localities containing 34 animal taxa and 4,088 prey items in two years (2015–2016). Two groups of samples (7–7 localities) were separated based on the dominance of semi-natural habitats and agricultural lands. Rarefaction analysis proved that the species richness and diversity of barn owls’ diet were significantly higher in semi-natural landscapes. The multiple regression analysis between PCA scores showed that in the agrarian landscape the abundance of generalist species was influenced by the proportion of forests, while the value of the trophic level index was determined by the size of arable fields. In the case of semi-natural landscapes, the abundance of the synantrop guild and generalist species, especially S. araneus and A. agrarius, was influenced by the proportion of urban areas, the number of habitats and the size of arable fields. The results of this study suggested that the small mammal consumption of the Common Barnowl is significantly different in the two landscapes, which reflects the impact of habitat heterogeneity and agricultural activity on prey availability © 2022, Acta Zoologica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae.All Rights Reserved.

ABSTRACT: Top predators are frequently the target of conservation programs. Owls are such predators. However, previous studies of owls are biased to species occurring in temperate regions, whereas most owl species occur in tropical or subtropical regions and are understudied. Furthermore, owls are often endemic to islands and of unknown conservation status. Demographic data for such species are especially scarce although they are essential for initiating and promoting their conservation. As a case study of demographic analysis of owls in a tropical or subtropical area and on islands, we applied an integrated population model to 7-year monitoring data (2012–2018) of the Ryukyu Scops Owl population on Minami-daito Island, Japan. We used survival history data from 903 individuals, reproduction and sex ratio data from 213 broods, and count data of 2,526 individuals in total. Long-term averages of annual survival rates were 0.73 for adult females and 0.74 for adult males, although the sexual difference was not significant. Sex ratio estimates fluctuated annually and long-term averages were slightly skewed to males: 0.51 among fledglings, 0.54 among yearlings, and 0.52 among adults. Long-term averages of population size were estimated to be 273.4 females and 296.8 males. The long-term average of population growth rate was 0.98, suggesting a slightly declining trend. It was fortunate to recognize the declining trend during the early phase. Considering the general lack of fundamental ecological data on owls of tropical or subtropical areas and on islands, it seems likely that many endangered owl populations await conservation efforts. © 2021 The Society of Population Ecology.

ABSTRACT: Parental role division is common among monogamous birds. Among raptors, males typically expend more effort to feed their chicks than do females, yet few studies have focused on how each pair establishes this role division. Therefore, in this study we examined the mechanism of role division in the Ryukyu Scops Owls Otus elegans on Minami-daito Island. Pairs of this species typically remain together and use the same nest over several years, so there is a possibility that their role division improves with experience over time. To clarify this, we studied the feeding frequency and territorial usage of individuals. Males fed their chicks more frequently than females, and experienced individuals using the same nests fed their chicks more than inexperienced individuals. On comparing experienced and inexperienced pairs, we found that experienced individuals hunted closer to the nest than inexperienced individuals. Furthermore, the home ranges of the males and females of experienced pairs, overlapped less than those of inexperienced pairs. Experience of using a nest site in consecutive years may allow such individual behavioural differences to develop and be involved in role division in parental care.  © 2022 The Ornithological Society of Japan.

ABSTRACT: We analyzed the diet of Athene cunicularia cunicularia in order to identify and compare prey items in dune populations in Santa Catarina, Brazil: Interpraias (INT), Praia Brava (BRA), Praia Central (NAV) and Peninsula (BVE). Due to the characteristics of urbanization in these regions, we hypothesized that there would be greater abundance and consumption of urban insect pests in the areas of BRA, NAV, and INT than in BVE. We collect owl pellets monthly in 2017. The non-parametric analysis ANOVA was applied to identify differences in pellet weights and niche amplitude between populations and seasons and PERMANOVA was applied to identify differences between prey items. Were collected 1064 pellets containing 20 prey items, including: invertebrates (Arachnida, Insecta and Crustacea Malacostraca–83%), vertebrates (Osteichthyes, amphibians, Reptilia, birds and Mammalia–8.6%), seeds (6.38%) and miscellaneous materials of anthropic origin (0.19%). There was no difference in the pellet weights, but the diets observed in INT and BRA were significantly different, a result that may be a reflection of the microenvironments in which the burrowing owl lives. This shows that, in addition to a generalist diet, this species has the capacity to adapt to urban changes. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Emergent response properties of sensory neurons depend on circuit connectivity and somatodendritic processing. Neurons of the barn owl's external nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICx) display emergence of spatial selectivity. These neurons use interaural time difference (ITD) as a cue for the horizontal direction of sound sources. ITD is detected by upstream brainstem neurons with narrow frequency tuning, resulting in spatially ambiguous responses. This spatial ambiguity is resolved by ICx neurons integrating inputs over frequency, a relevant processing in sound localization across species. Previous models have predicted that ICx neurons function as point neurons that linearly integrate inputs across frequency. However, the complex dendritic trees and spines of ICx neurons raises the question of whether this prediction is accurate. Data from in vivo intracellular recordings of ICx neurons were used to address this question. Results revealed diverse frequency integration properties, where some ICx neurons showed responses consistent with the point neuron hypothesis and others with nonlinear dendritic integration. Modeling showed that varied connectivity patterns and forms of dendritic processing may underlie observed ICx neurons' frequency integration processing. These results corroborate the ability of neurons with complex dendritic trees to implement diverse linear and nonlinear integration of synaptic inputs, of relevance for adaptive coding and learning, and supporting a fundamental mechanism in sound localization. © 2021 Gorman et al.

ABSTRACT: Damage associated with rodent’s outbreaks is common in the actual intensive agriculture. In order to reduce these economic losses, the placement of nest boxes for raptors could be a useful alternative to the chemical control programs. Barn owl (Tyto alba) and common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) are two of the most commonly used species as rodent biological controls. The increase of the density of these two raptors is able to reduce the rodent’s abundance without the huge negative impact caused by the use of chemical products in surrounding biodiversity. However, other prey species could be affected by these raptors too. In order to evaluate the different impacts of barn owl and common kestrel on non-pest species, we studied the diet in 50 paired nest boxes during 3 consecutive years, based on 1249 pellets. The proportion of small mammals considered pests for agriculture (voles and mice) consumed by barn owl (80%) and common kestrel (75.6%) were quite similar. Based on nutritional requirements, nest-box occupancy probability and productivity, we estimated a consumption of 5.24 rodents per day per common kestrel nest-box placed and of 4.95 rodents per barn owl nest-box placed. However, shrews were significantly more captured by barn owl and birds were significantly more captured by common kestrel. Our results showed that both species of raptors can be effective in controlling rodents that are harmful to agriculture, but the common kestrel seemed to be slightly more efficient and might also prey on insect taxa that could be important agricultural pests. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Capsule: Barn Owls Tyto alba and Red-billed Choughs Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax show differential breeding outputs as a consequence of sharing nest boxes. Aims: To describe for the first time a commensal relationship between the Red-billed Chough and the Barn Owl during the breeding period. Methods: During systematic monitoring of 90 nest boxes installed for Barn Owls in Navarre, northern Spain, it was found that in some boxes, Barn Owls and Red-billed Choughs nested simultaneously (inside and on top of the box, respectively). The clutch size, breeding success, and the number of fledglings of each species were compared when nesting together versus separately during the breeding period of 2015 and 2017. Results: About one-third of the nest boxes observed during the study were simultaneously used by both Barn Owls and Red-billed Choughs. No relationship was found between the composition of the habitat around the boxes and the degree of occupancy for either species. Nest box sharing had no significant effect on the breeding output of Barn Owls, but improved the breeding performance of Red-billed Choughs by increasing the number of fledglings in relation to clutch size. Conclusion: Barn Owls can provide benefits to Red-billed Choughs by controlling the populations of rodents, which could act as nest predators. Given that Barn Owls apparently do not obtain benefits nor incur any costs by the association with Red-billed Choughs, this interaction may be defined as commensalism. To our knowledge, this is the first documented nesting association between a corvid and an owl species. © 2023 British Trust for Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: ‘Jeff Martin explores the Tawny Owl’s natural history in the greatest detail. Where controversy has arisen in the literature, he has put forward all points of view so the reader can make his or her own judgements. There seems nothing concerning the biology of this owl that Jeff has not researched.' - Derek Bunn, author of The Barn Owl The haunting calls of the Tawny Owl can be heard from Scandinavia in the north of its range to North Africa in the south. Most people would consider it to be a common and widespread species throughout Europe, but populations in Britain at least are declining, and we need to understand more about the behaviour and ecology of this magnificent woodland bird if its future is to be secured. Jeff Martin has been studying owls for decades, and in this timely book he combines his personal observations together with those of other ornithologists and a comprehensive review of the literature, resulting in some surprising revelations. It was not long ago, for example, that the Tawny Owl was considered to be one of the most nocturnal of all owl species, but in recent years it has been observed sunbathing, calling and even hunting in broad daylight. The Tawny Owl begins by exploring the research that has been undertaken over the last two centuries, and the gaps that remain in our knowledge. Subsequent chapters detail the evolution and classification of this relatively young species, its status and distribution across Europe, its feeding, breeding and behavioural ecology, why numbers are falling, and what we can do about it. Interestingly, this silent hunter appears to be increasingly preying on passerine birds, as forest degradation and destruction have had a negative impact on small mammal numbers. The book concludes by looking at the role that Tawny Owls have played in British culture, and whether the changes in behaviour and plumage among the British population could mean we have a new subspecies evolving on our island. © Jeff R.

ABSTRACT: Background: In captive colonies, owl monkeys’ mothers sometimes reject their newborns. To prevent, mortality infants are manually raised by veterinarians. Both parental separation and rejection are stressful experiences, associated with elevated stress, physical, and behavioural disorders. The effect of parental deprivation in IVITA’s owl monkeys stress profiles and health is unknown. Methods: We compared stress biomarkers such as hair cortisol (using cortisol ELISA), stereotypic behaviours (with infrared cameras), and infection histories in juveniles separated from parents soon after birth (n = 14, ~17 months) and controls (n = 11, ~17 months). Results: Parentally deprived owl monkeys show higher infection rates than controls (p =.001). However, they display no higher incidence of biomarkers of stress: Neither stereotypic behaviour nor cortisol in hair was different between cohorts. Irrespective of deprivation status, rates of infection, and concentration of cortisol in hair were positively associated (R2 =.29, p =.005). Conclusion: Early parental deprivation and natural high levels of cortisol secretion are associated with elevated infection levels in the IVITA owl monkey juveniles detectable up to 17 months post separation. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

ABSTRACT: Though many of us have constructed our lives (or have had them constructed for us) such that it is easy to ignore or forget, human lives are entangled with other animals in many ways. Some interspecies relations would arguably exist in some form or another even under an ideal model of animal ethics. Others have an inescapably non-ideal character – these relationships exist as they do because things have gone wrong. In such circumstances we have reparative duties to animals we have wronged because we have wronged them. Here I draw upon Christine Korsgaard’s “Fellow Creatures” (2018) and other nonideal approaches to animal ethics to critically assess the United States Fish & Wildlife Service practice of killing barred owls to protect endangered spotted owls in the old growth forest of the Pacific Northwest. This is a difficult case to be sure, but one that can benefit from non-ideal moral assessment in terms of interspecies relational repair. I argue for increased spotted owl habitat preservation and forest restoration as an alternative to barred owl removal that better aligns with both nonideal relational animal ethics and stated US Fish & Wildlife Service values © 2022 Ben Almassi

ABSTRACT: In November and December 2019, wildfires in the lower Richmond River district of north-eastern New South Wales burned large tracts of forest including the territories of three pairs of Barking Owls Ninox connivens where breeding activity and two active nests were being monitored. Fortunately, an inventory of large trees and stags (≥60 cm diameter at breast height (dbh)) had been conducted on site prior to the impact of the fires. The two nests were destroyed and many large trees and stags were lost or severely damaged. In the four months following the fires, two 1ha plots were established at the centre of each of the three owl territories. Assessments of these plots demonstrated that 22.6% of the large trees and stags were lost or severely damaged, with a third of this total being ≥100 cm dbh. Despite wide variation in the pre-fire canopy tree structure and floristics, and fire extent and severity among the three territory centres, the percentage large tree loss or severe damage was not substantially different among the territories. Overall, there was a slightly higher percentage of smooth-barked canopy tree species lost or damaged compared to rough-barked species, but this result was biased by the absence of rough-barked species from one of the territory centres. The factor that appeared to be the major influence on large tree and stag loss or severe damage across the owl territories was the pre-fire presence of medium or large-sized basal fire-scars. A total of 72.7% of trees and stags with medium or large basal fire-scars was lost compared with a total of only 12.9% of trees and stags with small basal fire-scars. The loss of, or severe damage to 22.6% of large trees and stags recorded by this study from one wildfire event is considered unsustainable given the increase in frequent severe fires predicted by current climate change modelling. Pro-active protection measures are required to counter such losses of large trees and stags in these forests, and examples are provided of some specific measures recommended for this purpose. © 2022 Royal Zoological Society of New South Wales.

ABSTRACT: Pesticide use is pervasive and the exposure of non-target wildlife has been well documented over the past half-century. Among pesticides, anticoagulant rodenticides (AR) have emerged as a particularly important threat in forests of the western United States, with exposure and mortality reported for several species of conservation concern. To further quantify this threat, we collected specimens of Barred Owls (Strix varia) and Barred Owl x Spotted Owl hybrids from the Klamath and Cascade Mountains and Sierra Nevada in California, USA to use as indicator species for environmental contamination with AR and to infer exposure of closely related and ecologically similar Northern and California Spotted Owls (S. occidentalis caurina, and S. o. occidentalis, respectively). We tested 115 Barred Owl and 12 Barred Owl x Spotted Owl hybrid livers for 8 AR compounds and found high rates of exposure (62%) across our study area, and greater than previous studies in the Pacific Northwest. In addition, we sampled 7 ovaries from 7 females and 100% tested positive for AR. Female Barred Owls were more likely than males to be exposed (78% and 50%, respectively). Unlike previous studies, we found no clear link between illegal cannabis cultivation and AR exposure. However, Barred Owls sampled in proximity to the wildland-urban interface (WUI) were more likely to be exposed to AR. Though the exact source (e.g., cannabis cultivation or application around human dwellings) and location are unknown, the association of AR exposure with the WUI was supported from GPS data from Barred Owls, Northern and California Spotted Owls, and hybrids using the WUI for foraging. The high rate of AR exposure in Barred Owls and hybrids provides mounting evidence of an additional stressor that ARs may pose to Spotted Owls - including the first evidence for California Spotted Owls - and fauna native to western forest ecosystems.

ABSTRACT: Monitoring the extent to which wildlife is exposed to the broadly used neonicotinoid insecticides (NNIs) is essential to assess their potential negative effects on biodiversity. Birds are good subjects to assess such exposure, because they inhabit various habitats and they feed at different trophic levels. However, so far, most studies have focused on the contamination of granivorous species. In this study, we assess the concentrations of five NNIs (acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid, thiacloprid, thiamethoxam) in the carnivorous Barn owl (Tyto alba), and the insectivorous Alpine swift (Tachymarptis melba). NNIs were measured in the Barn owl in feathers collected from nestlings in 2012 (n = 49 broods) and adults in 2016 (n = 58 individuals), and in the Alpine swift from feathers collected from 50 pooled nestling samples from 50 nests between 2004 and 2017 (nestlings raised in five different nests over ten years; n = 50 broods), plasma samples from adults in 2018 (n = 15), and food boluses collected from nestling provisioning adults in 2018 (n = 12). We found that 69% and 56.9% of Barn owl feathers from nestlings and adults respectively contained at least one NNI at measurable concentration. Mean ± SE and median concentrations (in ppb) of total NNIs were 0.66 ± 1.13 and 0.42 for nestlings, and 0.17 ± 0.57 and 0.04 for adults. In the Alpine swift, although we detected no NNI in nestling feathers, we found that 75% of food boluses and 20% adult plasma samples contained at least one NNI at measurable concentration. Mean ± SE and median concentrations (in ppb) of total NNIs were 0.24 ± 0.20 and 0.24 in food boluses, and 0.06 ± 0.13 and 0 in plasma. In view of these results, further research is warranted to determine the extent of contamination in non-granivorous birds and their potential effects. © 2021

ABSTRACT: Investigating space use of wild birds provides important knowledge of bird behavior and ecology, which is crucial in the management and conservation of threatened species. In the present study, we used GPS satellite telemetry to investigate space use and movements of seven adult Eurasian Eagle-Owls (Bubo bubo) in Norway during breeding and post-breeding seasons. Breeding adults had a mean home range size of 42.9 km2 (SD ± 35.1 km2; 95% kernel density estimation Had hoc), and five individuals performed long (>20 km) excursive movements away from their breeding territories during autumn. Such wide-ranging behavior has not previously been reported for adults of the nominate subspecies B. b. bubo. The study demonstrates the need to investigate seasonal movements of species, populations, and age groups even if they are considered residents, and provides valuable information for management and conservation of the Eurasian Eagle-Owl.  © 2021 Ornithological Societies of North America.

ABSTRACT: Whereas most migratory animals, such as many birds of prey, return to the same breeding area each summer, nomadic breeders search over large distances to locate breeding areas that vary greatly in location from year to year. Nomadic breeders are assumed to extensively sample patch quality before selecting a summer settlement site (e.g. breeding site) with a high abundance of prey. In addition, patch selection during migration might vary, with immature birds sampling the summer environment for the first time. Here, we examined the migratory movements of a nomadic breeder, the Snowy Owl, to determine whether there are differences in phenology among age and sex classes, and where stopovers occur along their migratory journey. Each owl (n = 24) was equipped with a GPS-GSM transmitter during the overwintering period in the USA and Canada from 2014 to 2018. Movement patterns followed a two-process Poisson distribution, allowing us to separate stopovers from directional flights (i.e. migration). Adults completed migration earlier than immatures, with no difference in number of stopovers or time spent at each stopover. Snowy Owls had a higher probability of having a stopover at the beginning of their migration than at the end. Moreover, stopovers occurred primarily on frozen waterbodies more suitable for foraging or roosting outside of the summer range. We conclude that Snowy Owls use stopovers primarily to build up reserves or to rest during migration and they can potentially select appropriate summer settlement sites via short overflights without extensive sampling of patches during lengthy stopovers. © 2021 British Ornithologists' Union

ABSTRACT: Owls have evolved sensitive hearing facilitated by a facial disc, and flight that is quieted in part by a leading-edge comb on their wing. This comb is a series of modified barbs, or serrations, which project up from the outermost primary feathers on the leading edge of the wing. Here we explore the evolution of comb and facial disc morphology. We measured leading-edge comb morphology on museum skins of 147 owl species, and facial disc morphology from photos, as well as ecological traits, on 66 species. The first principal component of comb morphology loaded on serration length, which varied between 0 and ~6 mm long in the species we sampled. Comb size (PC1) was correlated with relative facial disc size, suggesting that owls with good hearing also tend to have quiet flight. Two non-exclusive hypotheses for why quiet flight evolved are for stealth, allowing the owl to approach prey undetected; or to reduce self-masking, enabling the owl to hear prey better midflight. We examined whether ecological variables (prey type, active period and habitat) suggest whether stealth or self-masking better explain the evolution of comb size. Phylogenetic analyses suggested support for both the stealth and the self-masking hypotheses for the evolution of quiet flight. © 2021 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society.

ABSTRACT: Studies show that eveningness preference and depressive symptoms are positively related. However, little is known about possible factors that could reduce this association. In the present study, we examine the moderating effects of religiosity on the relationship between eveningness and depressive symptoms. The main analyses were conducted on a group of 606 individuals (300 women and 306 men) aged 18 to 36 years (M = 29.00, SD = 4.95). The participants completed the Composite Scale of Morningness, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and the Centrality of Religiosity Scale. Our results confirmed earlier findings that eveningness was positively related to depressive symptoms. The magnitude of this association decreased with higher religiosity. This lead to the conclusion that religiosity may act as a protective factor against elevated depressive symptoms among evening-oriented individuals. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

ABSTRACT: The California Spotted Owl is an imperiled species that selects mature conifer forests for nesting and roosting while actively foraging in the “snag forest habitat” created when fire or drought kills most of the trees in patches. Federal agencies believe there are excess surface fuels in both of these habitat conditions in many of California’s forests due to fuel accumulation from decades of fire suppression and recent drought-related tree mortality. Accordingly, agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service are implementing widespread logging in Spotted Owl territories. While they acknowledge habitat degradation from such logging, and risks to the conservation of declining Spotted Owl populations, agencies hypothesize that such active forest management equates to effective fuel reduction that is needed to curb fire severity for the overall benefit of this at-risk species. In an initial investigation, I analyzed this issue in a large 2020 fire, the Creek Fire (153,738 ha), in the southern Sierra Nevada mountains of California. I found that pre-fire snag density was not correlated with burn severity. I also found that more intensive forest management was correlated to higher fire severity. My results suggest the fuel reduction approach is not justified and provide indirect evidence that such management represents a threat to Spotted Owls. © 2021 by the author.

ABSTRACT: The Owl and the Nightingale, one of the earliest literary works in Middle English, is a lively, anonymous comic poem about two birds who embark on a war of words in a wood, with a nearby poet reporting their argument in rhyming couplets, line by line and blow by blow. In this engaging and energetic verse translation, Simon Armitage captures the verve and humor of this dramatic tale with all the cut and thrust of the original. In an agile iambic tetrameter that skillfully amplifies the prosody and rhythm of the original, Armitage’s translation moves entertainingly from the eloquent and philosophical to the ribald and ridiculous. Sounding at times like antagonists in a Twitter feud, the owl and the nightingale quarrel about a host of subjects that still resonate today—including love, marriage, identity, cultural background, class distinctions, and the right to be heard. Adding to the playful, raucous mood of the barb-trading birds is Armitage, who at one point inserts himself into the poem as a “magistrate … to adjudicate”—one who is “skilled with words & worldly wise / & frowns on every form of vice.” Featuring the Middle English text on facing pages and an introduction by Armitage, this volume will delight readers of all ages. © 2022 by Simon Armitage.

ABSTRACT: Current evidence suggests that preventive measures, such as social distancing and wearing face masks, are critical to contain the spread of COVID-19. The recent burgeoning literature has empirically examined how a wide range of facet-level personality and individual-differences variables are associated with people’s adherence to COVID-19 regulations. However, there lacks direct evidence regarding the role of chronotype in compliance with pandemic safety measures. According to the eveningness epidemiological liability hypothesis, people of later chronotype are more likely to breach COVID-19 restrictions. Despite this hypothesis shedding considerable light on the potential role of chronotype in the abidance of the virus-mitigating measures, it has not been rigorously tested using empirical data. To fill this gap, the present research investigated the link between morningness-eveningness and compliance with COVID-19 containment policies in Chinese samples. Two studies using multiple populations (students and community adults) and diverse measures of adherence to public health guidelines (self-report and actual behavior) consistently show that individuals who orient towards morningness display a higher level of compliance with COVID-19 prevention than people who orient towards eveningness. Overall, these findings present the first empirical confirmation of the eveningness epidemiological liability hypothesis, highlighting the role of chronotype in adherence to COVID-19 prevention guidelines. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

ABSTRACT: The use of renewable resources to generate energy is one of the most important policy goals in the energy sector. One method to use renewable resources is to apply integrated systems. In this study, an optimal multi-objective integrated system has been applied to power generation. The proposed system includes wind turbines, hydroelectric power plants, and photovoltaic systems. To achieve maximum power generation with minimum fluctuations, a Developed Owl search algorithm (DOSA) with three pareto front solutions has been used. Also, the efficiency of the integrated system in different climate conditions is evaluated. The results of the pareto front show that the developed owl search algorithm is the closest algorithm to the pareto front. Therefore, it is the most accurate to improve the overall multi-objective integrated system. Among pareto front solutions, the second solution provides acceptable results for increasing power generation and reduction of fluctuations. Also, the results of the evaluation of the efficient integrated system in different climate conditions show that in wet conditions when solar radiation and wind are reduced, hydropower causes current to continue in the system by generating electricity and compensating for wind and PV energy loss. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Environmental policies often draw criticism due to their potential impacts on labor market outcomes. Previous work has studied sector-specific impacts following air quality regulations, or examined overall employment effects of land-use policies. In the case of the protection of the Northern Spotted Owl under the Endangered Species Act in 1990, millions of acres of highly productive federal timberland in the Pacific Northwest and northern California were set aside. Concerns regarding declining employment in the timber industry following the listing are often mentioned as a cautionary tale regarding future listings under the Act. However, disentangling the policy impact from other economic factors affecting employment such as recessions and sector-specific trends is challenging. We use a range of control groups to estimate the impact of the 1990 listing of the Northern Spotted Owl had on labor market outcomes in the Lumber and Wood Products sector. Our set of main results indicate long-run declines in timber industry employment of 13.9% using a regional perspective, 28.1% using a national perspective, and a 9.5% decline in the number of establishments. In the owl habitat range there were 114,600 timber employees in the pre-treatment period; about 1.4% of total employment in those counties. In terms of jobs, the declines represent around 16,000 or 32,000 timber jobs within the Pacific Northwest and northern California. We find heterogeneous effects with areas having larger shares of protected federal timberland experiencing larger declines in employment. Our findings indicate land protection policies may pose significant employment impacts to land-reliant industries. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: A new species of scops-owl (Aves, Strigiformes, Strigidae, Otus) is described from Príncipe Island, São Tomé and Príncipe (Gulf of Guinea, Africa). This species was discovered for science in 2016, although suspicions of its occurrence gained traction from 1998, and testimonies from local people suggesting its existence could be traced back to 1928. Morphometrics, plumage colour and pattern, vocalisations, and molecular evidence all support the species status of the scops-owl from Príncipe, which is described here as Otus bikegila sp. nov. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that this species descended from the first colonisation of the Gulf of Guinea islands, being sister to the clade including the mainland African Scops-Owl O. senegalensis, and the island endemics Sao Tome Scops-Owl O. hartlaubi and Pemba Scops-Owl O. pembaensis. The most diagnostic trait in the field is its unique call which, curiously, is most similar to a distantly related Otus species, the Sokoke Scops-Owl O. ireneae. The new species occurs at low elevations of the old-growth native forest of Príncipe, currently restricted to the south of the island but fully included within Príncipe Obô Natural Park. Otus bikegila sp. nov. takes the number of single-island endemic bird species of Príncipe to eight, further highlighting the unusually high level of bird endemism for an island of only 139 km2.

ABSTRACT: Thanks to recent developments in molecular methods, many new species have been discovered within the genus Circovirus, which comprises viruses of veterinary relevance found in a broad range of hosts. In particular, several circoviruses are known to infect birds, often causing immunosuppression and feathering disorders. Nonetheless, nothing is known about their circulation in birds of prey. In this study, samples from 61 birds of prey representing ten different species, recovered by a wildlife rescue centre in Southern Italy, were taken at necropsy and analysed by PCR with pan-Circovirus primers. Only one sample, collected from a tawny owl (Strix aluco), tested positive. Its genome, sequenced by primer walking, displays the typical features of circoviruses. Based on demarcation criteria, the detected strain qualifies as a novel species, which was named “tawny owl-associated circovirus” (ToCV). Phylogenetically, ToCV clustered with mammalian rather than avian circoviruses, and its closeness to a rodent circovirus suggests that its host may have been a micromammal eaten by the tawny owl. On the other hand, its detection in the spleen fits with the tropism of other avian circoviruses. Little can be therefore said on its biology and pathogenicity, and further efforts are needed to better characterize its epidemiology. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: The effects of weather on an individual can often alter the population dynamics of a species. Knowledge of how weather influences individual behavior is therefore essential in understanding its full impact in the context of population ecology. Snowy Owls (Bubo scandiacus) exhibit expensive long-distance migrations in winters following population irruptions. During irruptive movements, many owls migrate past the southernmost extent of their traditional wintering grounds, the mechanism for which is still debated. We propose and test the "milder climate"hypothesis; Snowy Owls wintering in lower latitudes are better able to meet their metabolic demands due to higher temperatures and lower snow cover. During the Snowy Owl irruption of 2014-2015, we examined this hypothesis by assessing the influence of local weather variables on foraging success, frequency of prey capture attempts, and overall activity budgets in a sample of wintering Snowy Owls in New York, USA. We used eBird, an online citizen science resource, to help locate Snowy Owls, which we observed from an automobile. We found that none of the weather variables tested affected foraging success. However, the lack of effect of snow depth on foraging success may suggest that hearing is more important for hunting in Snowy Owls than previously thought. Hunting frequency decreased with increasing temperatures, suggesting Snowy Owls were better able to meet their metabolic demands in higher temperatures. We thus offer support for the milder climate hypothesis; Snowy Owls wintering in lower latitudes may be able to offset the energetic expenses of long-distance movements.  © 2021 Ornithological Societies of North America.

ABSTRACT: We developed and field-tested an active learning exercise designed to provide biology students with the opportunity to consider key aspects of the nature of science as a method of inquiry, particularly the roles of observation and inference in the development of scientific explanations and how scientists deal with uncertainty. In the activity students assume the role of a wildlife biologist, using available evidence to best explain the cause of the decline of a rabbit population in a state park. Using a guided-inquiry approach, students are provided evidence in a sequential fashion. After each bit of evidence is provided, they form inferences and either retain their initial explanation or reject it. Results of the field testing suggest that the activity may positively impact students’ perceived understanding of important aspects of the nature of science, and their comfort level in dealing with uncertainty. The investigative, observation/inference-based model utilized shows promise in making the nature of science an organizing theme for the course. © 2022, Association of College and Univesity Biology Educators.

ABSTRACT: The climate fluctuations of the Quaternary shaped the movement of species in and out of glacial refugia. In Europe, the majority of species followed one of the described traditional postglacial recolonization routes from the southern peninsulas towards the north. Like most organisms, barn owls are assumed to have colonized the British Isles by crossing over Doggerland, a land bridge that connected Britain to northern Europe. However, while they are dark rufous in northern Europe, barn owls in the British Isles are conspicuously white, a contrast that could suggest selective forces are at play on the islands. Yet, our analysis of known candidate genes involved in coloration found no signature of selection. Instead, using whole genome sequences and species distribution modelling, we found that owls colonised the British Isles soon after the last glaciation, directly from a white coloured refugium in the Iberian Peninsula, before colonising northern Europe. They would have followed a hitherto unknown post-glacial colonization route to the Isles over a westwards path of suitable habitat in now submerged land in the Bay of Biscay, thus not crossing Doggerland. As such, they inherited the white colour of their Iberian founders and maintained it through low gene flow with the mainland that prevents the import of rufous alleles. Thus, we contend that neutral processes probably explain this contrasting white colour compared to continental owls. With the barn owl being a top predator, we expect future research will show this unanticipated route was used by other species from its paleo community. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Indian eagle owl known to rotate their necks up to 270 degrees in either direction without injuring their vessels running below the head thereby without cutting off blood supply to their brains. The vertebral column in birds carry peculiar features like higher number of cervical vertebrae due to long mobile neck, lumbar and sacral vertebrae fused together giving rigidity which aid in flight. The extensive fusion of vertebral column posterior to the neck provides the required rigidity in the trunk region, this inflexibility feature might reduce weight, as it avoids the need for extensive musculature to maintain a streamlined and rigid body posture during flight. The current study aimed to study the vertebral column of Indian eagle owl in order to understand the anatomical adaptations related to this species. Methods: The specimens were procured from three Indian eagle owl brought for post mortem examination during the year 2019 to the Department of Veterinary Pathology, Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Veterinary Education and Research, Puducherry. After completion of the post-mortem examination the carcass was collected and macerated as per the standard technique and various measurements on vertebral column bones were measured using vernier calliper. Result: The study revealed that vertebral column of Indian eagle owl consisted of 14 cervical vertebrae, 7 thoracic vertebrae, 13 to 14 lumbar vertebrae fused with sacral vertebrae forming synsacrum and 7 coccygeal vertebrae. The hypapophyses of the 14th cervical vertebra and first two thoracic vertebrae were trifid in nature specific feature seen in Indian eagle owl. The vertebral column had characteristics features of hypapophyses, transverse process, pneumatic foramen and neural spine which enable the owl to adapt for head rotation and various task involving vertebrae. © 2021 Agricultural Research Communication Centre.

ABSTRACT: Both daily and seasonal year-round vocal activity of Ural owl were recorded in the Middle Volga River Region, Russia with the use of digital dictaphones. Two best-expressed peaks of long-term activity were revealed during the year: one starting in March and the other in September. In the spring, calls were recorded from 19:51 to 04:04. During this period, Ural owl’s total length of calls varied from 1 to 35 min per day, on average 12 min. The second annual peak was restricted to brood dispersal. In this period, the total duration of calls varied from 1 to 32 min per day, on average 9 min. In the spring, Ural owls always started calling from 24 min to 4 h after sunset. Vocalisation began at an average of 2 h 34 min after sunset. Completion of morning vocal activity always ended from 1 h 30 min to 2 h 40 min before sunrise. © 2022 Lesotekhnicheski Universitet (University of Forestry). All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Harvest management quotas for fishers Pekania pennanti in some jurisdictions are estimated from the previous year's harvest, and stem from the hypothesis that age ratios in the harvest are largely influenced by ‘top–down’ trapping pressure. The influence of ‘bottom–up’ food supply on fisher harvest age ratios might be underappreciated, which could result in a misallocation of quotas in management planning. We assessed a variety of data sources to test the influence of bottom–up processes on fisher populations in Ontario, Canada. We found evidence that bottom–up trophic effects influence the harvested fisher age structure in some regions of Ontario. Evidence also suggests that harvest pressure had little top–down influence on age ratios over the course of our study, and that basing management strategies on this assumption may lead to unintentional overharvest in years of low productivity. We suggest several trophic linkages with potential to facilitate fisher management, including connections among berry and seed crops, small mammals and northern saw-whet owls Aegolius acadicus.

ABSTRACT: Although Blakiston's Fish Owl (Bubo blakistoni) is widely treated as a single species, marked differences in the structure of pair duets between continental and insular populations have been documented. However, no study has quantitatively assessed these vocal differences. We obtained 192 duets from 22 pairs of Blakiston's Fish Owl: 15 pairs of B. b. blakistoni from the Japanese island of Hokkaido and the Russian Kuril island of Kunashir, and seven pairs of B. b. doerriesi from Primorye on the Russian mainland. This is a sizeable dataset for such a large, retiring, and rare owl. We conducted bioacoustic examinations of 14 vocal parameters using principal component analysis and the Isler criterion to quantitatively test species boundaries within the B. blakistoni complex. We found that the insular populations on Hokkaido and Kunashir emerged as vocally similar to each other but markedly different from the continental populations of B. blakistoni, corresponding closely with presently accepted subspecies limits. Bioacoustic differences in the duets of the insular and continental groups are greater than the pairwise comparisons of territorial vocalisations between other sympatric owl species. Based on the reproductive importance of vocal duets in owl biology, we propose the taxonomic elevation of the continental subspecies to species level as Northern Fish Owl B. doerriesi. Our study corroborates the importance of bioacoustics in ascertaining species boundaries in owls and has important implications for the management of the two newly delimited species, each likely to be assessed as Endangered. Both species should be managed independently to optimise conservation outcomes. © 2022 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The combined actions of climatic variations and landscape barriers shape the history of natural populations. When organisms follow their shifting niches, obstacles in the landscape can lead to the splitting of populations, on which evolution will then act independently. When two such populations are reunited, secondary contact occurs in a broad range of admixture patterns, from narrow hybrid zones to the complete dissolution of lineages. A previous study suggested that barn owls colonized the Western Palearctic after the last glaciation in a ring-like fashion around the Mediterranean Sea, and conjectured an admixture zone in the Balkans. Here, we take advantage of whole-genome sequences of 94 individuals across the Western Palearctic to reveal the complex history of the species in the region using observational and modeling approaches. Even though our results confirm that two distinct lineages colonized the region, one in Europe and one in the Levant, they suggest that it predates the last glaciation and identify a secondary contact zone between the two in Anatolia. We also show that barn owls recolonized Europe after the glaciation from two distinct glacial refugia: a previously identified western one in Iberia and a new eastern one in Italy. Both glacial lineages now communicate via eastern Europe, in a wide and permeable contact zone. This complex history of populations enlightens the taxonomy of Tyto alba in the region, highlights the key role played by mountain ranges and large water bodies as barriers and illustrates the power of population genomics in uncovering intricate demographic patterns.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

ABSTRACT: Alpha satellite DNA is a major DNA component of primate centromeres. We previously reported that Azara's owl monkey has two types of alpha satellite DNA, OwlAlp1 and OwlAlp2. OwlAlp2 (344 bp) exhibits a sequence similarity throughout its entire length with alpha satellite DNA of closely related species. OwlAlp1 (185 bp) corresponds to the part of OwlAlp2. Based on the observation that the CENP-A protein binds to OwlAlp1, we proposed that OwlAlp1 is a relatively new repetitive DNA that replaced OwlAlp2 as the centromeric satellite DNA. However, a detailed picture of the evolutionary process of this centromere DNA replacement remains largely unknown. Here, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of OwlAlp1 and OwlAlp2 sequences, and also compared our results to alpha satellite DNA sequences of other primate species. We found that: (i) OwlAlp1 exhibits a higher similarity to OwlAlp2 than to alpha satellite DNA of other species, (ii) OwlAlp1 has a single origin, and (iii) sequence variation is lower in OwlAlp1 than in OwlAlp2. We conclude that OwlAlp1 underwent a recent and rapid expansion in the owl monkey lineage. This centromere DNA replacement could have been facilitated by the heterochromatin reorganization that is associated with the adaptation of owl monkeys to a nocturnal lifestyle. © 2021 Molecular Biology Society of Japan and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Background: The “starry sky” (SK) liver is ultrasonographic pattern characterized by multiple hyperechogenic foci in hepatic parenchyma. The study aimed to characterize the microscopic hepatic lesions in captive owl monkeys with SK liver. Methods: Thirty-seven clinically healthy owl monkeys had their liver scanned and 18 of them had liver biopsy. Animals with SK and peliosis hepatis (PH) were subjected to immunohistochemical and molecular screening for Bartonella spp. Results: SK liver occurred in 59.4% (22/37) of the owl monkeys. Biopsied animals showed steatosis, hydropic degeneration, hemosiderosis, PH, and multifocal granulomatous hepatitis. Two monkeys had SK, granulomatous hepatitis, and PH which were negative for Bartonella spp. Conclusions: PH and granulomatous hepatitis associated with hepatocellular degenerative lesions may present as hyperechoic nodular liver lesions consisted of SK liver; therefore, concomitant occurrence of two lesions or more contributed to the hepatic SK pattern among owl monkeys and such cases might be clinically monitored. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

ABSTRACT: Previous studies have shown that shift workers are more prone to non-communicable diseases. The aim of the present crossover study is to investigate whether it is possible to improve the health status of shift workers. Nineteen male shift workers (38.5 years ± 7.4) received every other month a dietary counseling for one year. All subjects kept a seven-day diet diary during a night shift, received bioelectrical impedance analysis, and a laboratory examination was performed at the beginning of the study, after one year and at the end of the study. The laboratory blood test included the main metabolic parameters, melatonin and serotonin. Beside subjects were also motivated to incorporate more physical training into their daily routine. After the intervention period, participants reduced energy intake, mean portion size, table salt, consumption of sugar and saturated fat. C-reactive protein (CRP), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), liver enzymes, triglycerides, and uric acid decreased, while melatonin level increased. Participants lost body weight and reduced waist circumference after the intervention. Lifestyle modification and dietary information could contribute to the health of shift workers. However, further studies are needed to investigate whether this can prevent disease and whether melatonin production can be influenced by diet. ©️ 2022 National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health.

ABSTRACT: The age at first reproduction can significantly impact fitness. We investigated the possible source of variation in the age at first reproduction (‘sexual maturity') and its consequences for lifetime reproductive success in a wild population of barn owls. This raptor is sexually dimorphic for two melanin-based plumage traits shown to covary with sex-specific behaviour and physiology. We observed that females were sexually mature earlier than males, an effect that depended on the colour of their plumage and birth date. Among females born early in the season, dark melanic (i.e. more pheomelanic with large and many black feather spots) yearlings were sexually mature earlier than light melanic females. The relationship was in the opposite direction in those born late in the season. In yearling males, the opposite result, albeit less pronounced, was discovered, i.e. lightly melanic males born early in the season were sexually mature earlier than dark melanic males, an effect that was in the opposite direction in males that were born late in the season. Individuals that matured faster produced a larger number of fledglings per year than individuals that matured slower, an effect that was found only in dark melanic females and in light melanic males. Dark melanic females also achieved a higher lifetime reproductive success (LRS) than light melanic conspecifics. Our results suggest that a light melanic plumage is beneficial in males and a dark melanic plumage in females suggesting sexually antagonist selection. © 2021 Nordic Society Oikos.

ABSTRACT: Birds are a frequent host of a large variety of herpesviruses, and infections in them may go unnoticed or may result in fatal disease. In wild breeding populations of owls, there is very limited information about the presence, impact, and potential transmission of herpesvirus. The herpesvirus partial DNA polymerase gene was detected using polymerase chain reaction in oropharyngeal swabs of 16 out of 170 owls examined that were captured in or near nest boxes. Herpesvirus was detected in Ural owls (Strix uralensis), in both adults and young, but not in tawny owls (Strix aluco). In yellow-necked mice (Apodemus flavicollis), as the main prey of tawny owls and Ural owls in the area, herpesvirus was detected in the organs of 2 out of 40 mice captured at the same locations as the owls. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the herpesvirus sequences detected in the Ural owls differed from the herpesvirus sequences detected in the yellow-necked mice. The results indicate that herpesvirus infection exists in the breeding wild Ural owl population. However, herpesvirus-infected owls did not show any clinical or productivity deviances and, based on a phylogenetic comparison of detected herpesvirus sequences and sequences obtained from Genbank database, it seems that mice and other rodents are not the source of owl infections. The most probable transmission pathway is intraspecific, especially from adults to their chicks, but the origin of herpesvirus in owls remains to be investigated. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: CHD gene polymorphism as a model object for molecular sex determination in Bubo bubo (Eurasian eagle-owl) was studied. Classical PCR methods for amplification of target regions of the CHD gene using P2/P8, 2550F/2718R, and 123L/1272H marker systems and restriction (PCR-RFLP) and heteroduplex methodological approaches were analyzed. It was shown that the use of the P2/P8 marker system within classical PCR is efficient for avian sexing only under electrophoretic separation of the fragments in polyacrylamide gel. The application of 2550F/2718R and 123L/127H markers demonstrated their lack of efficiency both in agarose and polyacrylamide gels because it was not possible to differentiate between genotypes CHDZZ and CHDZW. The presence of a polymorphic restriction site for HaeIII in CHDZ and CHDW fragments amplified with primers P2/P8 was proven. No polymorphic site was detected for DdeI restriction endonuclease. High efficiency of the heteroduplex analysis based on the P2/P8 markers for sexing individuals under electrophoretic separation of the amplified fragments both in agarose and polyacrylamide gels was proven. In case of experimental samples containing CHDZ and CHDW amplicons, additional fragments of heteroduplex DNA were found, the presence of which makes it possible to accurately determine the genotype of an avian. © 2021, Allerton Press, Inc.

ABSTRACT: There is an increasing need in industry for noise reduction in fans. Inspired by owls' silent flight, we propose four owl-inspired blade designs for a mixed-flow fan to examine whether leading-edge (LE) and/or trailing-edge (TE) serrations can resolve the tradeoff between sound suppression and aerodynamic performance. We investigate the blades' aeroacoustic characteristics through various experimental methods and large-eddy simulation (LES)-based numerical analyses. Experimental results suggest that 'slotted', simply-fabricated LE serrations can achieve a lowering of the noise level while sustaining the aerodynamic performance of the fan, whereas TE serrations fail. In addition, the inclination angle can improve LE serration performance in aeroacoustic and aerodynamic performance with a reduction in the specific noise level by around 1.4 dB. LES results and noise spectral analysis indicate that the LE serrations can suppress flow separation, reducing the broadband noise at low-to-middle frequencies (40-4k Hz). This passive-flow-control mechanism, likely due to local higher incidence angles associated with LE serrations, is capable of alleviating the intensive pressure gradient while suppressing wall-pressure fluctuations over the LE region, hence weakening the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The tonal noise also shows a marked reduction at the highest peak frequency associated with fan-vane interaction. Moreover, we find that the high-frequency noise by-product radiates mainly from the LE serrations andsurroundings, due to the small eddies broken up when the vortical flows pass through the LE serrations. Our results demonstrate that the biomimetic design of the LE serrations can facilitate the break-up of LE vortices passively and effectively without negatively impacting aerodynamic performance, which can be utilized as an effective device to improve the aeroacoustic performance of fan blades. © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Dispersal is one of the key elements of species' metapopulation dynamics and, hence, influences global conservation status. Furthermore, determining the geographic variation in magnitude and direction of dispersal throughout a species' distribution may expand our understanding of the causes of population declines in species of conservation concern. For instance, western burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia hypugaea) populations have declined at the northern and eastern edge of their breeding distribution during the 20th century. In the same period, large areas of thornscrub that did not support breeding owls were converted to irrigated agriculture in the southern edge of the subspecies' breeding distribution in northwestern Mexico. These farmlands now support some of the highest breeding densities of owls. We tested the hypothesis that owls that colonized this recently created habitat originated from declining migratory populations from the northern portion of the subspecies' range. We used stable isotopes 2H, 13C, and 15N in owl feathers to infer breeding dispersal patterns throughout the subspecies' breeding range. Populations near the northern edge of the subspecies' breeding range had immigrants that dispersed over larger distances than immigrants at low and mid latitude populations. However, agricultural populations in northwestern Mexico disrupted this latitudinal pattern, attracting owls from more distant locations. We also found immigrants originated from further distances in declining populations than increasing populations. Stable isotopes provided no evidence of contemporaneous breeding dispersal from Canadian populations to northwestern Mexico but suggest that agricultural areas in the southern edge of the subspecies' distribution have altered the continental dispersal pattern.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

ABSTRACT: The capacity of natural selection to generate adaptive changes is (according to the fundamental theorem of natural selection) proportional to the additive genetic variance in fitness. In spite of its importance for development of new adaptations to a changing environment, processes affecting the magnitude of the genetic variance in fitness-related traits are poorly understood. Here, we show that the red-white colour polymorphism in female barn owls is subject to density-dependent selection at the phenotypic and genotypic level. The diallelic melanocortin-1 receptor gene explained a large amount of the phenotypic variance in reddish coloration in the females (R2= 59:8%). Red individuals (RR genotype) were selected for at low densities, while white individuals (WW genotype) were favoured at high densities and were less sensitive to changes in density.We show that this density-dependent selection favours white individuals and predicts fixation of the white allele in this population at longer time scales without immigration or other selective forces. Still, fluctuating population density will cause selection to fluctuate and periodically favour red individuals. These results suggest how balancing selection caused by fluctuations in population density can be a general mechanism affecting the level of additive genetic variance in natural populations. © 2022 Royal Society Publishing.

ABSTRACT: The present study was carried out through analysis of bone remains in 1003 long-eared owl pellets of Asio otus (Strigiformes, Strigidae). The investigated area is in the Southeastern slope of Mount Etna (Sicily) outside the boundary of Etna Park. A total of eight species were found of ten species known for the whole Sicily, such as Microtus nebrodensis (Rodentia, Cricetidae), Apodemus sylvaticus, Mus domesticus, Rattus rattus, Rattus norvegicus (Rodentia, Muridae), Eliomys quercinus (Rodentia, Gliridae), Suncus etruscus and Crocidura sicula (Soricomorpha, Soricidae). The most frequent species among the total specimens found in the long-eared owl pellets was vole M. nebrodensis with a frequency of 75.24% and composed of 57.54% of a biomass in analysed habitats. The second most frequent species was A. sylvaticus with a frequency percentage of 13.23%, but participates third place in the assessed biomass (10.52% of the biomass), thereas the more masses species R. norvegicus composed of 29.29% of the biomass and with a frequency of 7.47% in the owl pellets. The high number of species found (eight species out of ten known for the Sicilian small mammal fauna), and the medium-low diversity values (Gini-Simpson = 0.41; Shannon-Weaver = 0.64) are likely to be attributed to the fragmentation of habitats and consequent ecotone effect. The high value of the Cricetidae/Muridae ratio and the low value of the trophic level index (Soricidae/Rodentia ratio) highlight a type of agricultural anthropization. The composition and structure of the studied small mammal community confirmed a consolidated medium-high level of agricultural anthropization in a landscape characterized by a mosaic of rural and natural environments. However, the importance of these agro-ecosystems depends on the high number of small mammal species present, including some of conservation interest. © RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF THERIOLOGY, 2022

ABSTRACT: The range and population of Burrowing Owls (BOs) are declining in the Canadian Prairies. Multiple anthropogenic sources of degradation (threat) are attributed to this trend. Yet, the cumulative degradation caused by these sources has not been quantified across this landscape. Using the InVEST Habitat Quality (HQ) module and a novel approach to parameterize the relative sensitivity scores in this framework, we quantified, mapped, and evaluated the relative HQ values for these species in the prairies. The results illustrate significant differences in the HQ values between the current range and areas within the historical range of these species that do not spatially intersect with their current spatial extent. However, the variations of HQ values are not statistically significant under the different spatial scenarios considered across the current breeding grounds. Nevertheless, the results within the specific land use/cover categories illustrate meaningful variations in the HQ values across the current range of these species. Our findings suggest that the existing declining trends could only be attributed to the synergistic impact of the considered threats and other factors undermining the essential ecological processes for these birds. The results also highlight the importance of expanding the spatial extent of the existing conservation measures to prevent further loss of these charismatic migratory birds from the prairie landscape. A good starting point is to consider the HQ change index, a measure defined to illustrate the relative habitat degradation under different sources of degradation. Further studies are still required to determine the spatiotemporal impacts of all sources of degradation on the habitat of these endangered species in Canada and across their global range. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: We characterize bacteria of the gastrointestinal tract of 28 Northern Saw-whet Owls (Aegolius acadicus) netted on the Mohonk Preserve near New Paltz, New York, during autumn of 2017. We used selective culture media to determine the presence and assess the point infection level of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp., and Staphylococcus aureus in the buccal, cloaca, feces, and pellets of Northern Saw-whet Owls. We tested for associations between bacteria type, sample point location, and infection levels and then assessed the influence of bacterial infection on the health of owls using multivariate analysis of mass/wing chord body condition index estimates and heterophil to lymphocyte ratios. All Northern Saw-whet Owls tested positive for at least one type of bacteria. We found an inverse relationship between the number of bacteria types detected per individual and the percentage of Northern Saw-whet Owls affected, with 46.43%, 32.14%, and 3.57% of individuals showing presence of 2, 3, and 4 types of bacteria, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed a significantly heightened presence of S. aureus in the buccal cavity, and Spearman's rho analysis revealed positive correlations between site colonization levels and bacterial species levels. We found no significant relationship between bacterial load and mass/wing chord body condition indexes or heterophil to lymphocyte ratios. We did, however, find a positive relationship between heterophil to lymphocyte ratios and Leucocytozoon infections. Providing baseline information of common microflora can help future research recognize potentially harmful gastrointestinal pathogens. Therein, as the first study to characterize bacteria of the Northern Saw-whet Owl, this research adds to the information portfolio of the species and may benefit future research efforts. © 2021 Wilson Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Background: The northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) is an Endangered Species Act-listed subspecies that requires coniferous forests with structurally complex and closed-canopy old-growth characteristics for nesting. With climate change, large wildfires are expected to become more common within the subspecies’ range and an increasing threat to these types of forests. Understanding fire severity patterns related to suitable nesting forest will be important to inform forest management that affects conservation and recovery. We examined the relationship between fire severity and suitable nesting forest in 472 large wildfires (> 200 ha) that occurred in the northern spotted owl range during 1987–2017. We mapped fire severities (unburned-low, moderate, high) within each fire using relative differenced normalized burn ratios and quantified differences in severity between pre-fire suitable nesting forest (edge and interior) and non-nesting forest. We also quantified these relationships within areas of three fire regimes (low severity, very frequent; mixed severity, frequent; high severity, infrequent). Results: Averaged over all fires, the interior nesting forest burned at lower severity than edge or non-nesting forest. These relationships were consistent within the low severity, very frequent, and mixed severity, frequent fire regime areas. All forest types burned at similar severity within the high severity, infrequent fire regime. During two of the most active wildfire years that also had the largest wildfires occurring in rare and extreme weather conditions, we found a bimodal distribution of fire severity in all forest types. In those years, a higher amount—and proportion—of all forest types burned at high severity. Over the 30-year study, we found a strong positive trend in the proportion of wildfires that burned at high severity in the non-nesting forests, but not in the suitable nesting forest types. Conclusions: Under most wildfire conditions, the microclimate of interior patches of suitable nesting forests likely mitigated fire severity and thus functioned as fire refugia (i.e., burning at lower severity than the surrounding landscape). With changing climate, the future of interior forest as fire refugia is unknown, but trends suggest older forests can dampen the effect of increased wildfire activity and be an important component of landscapes with fire resiliency. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Birds of prey, also collectively known as raptors, consist of the Falconiformes (falcons and caracaras), Accipitriformes (eagles, buzzards, hawks, kites, and Old World vultures), Cathartiformes (New World vultures), Cariamiformes (seriemas), and Strigiformes (true owls Strigidae, and barn owls Tytonidae) (del Hoyo et al. 1999; Jarvis et al. 2014; McClure et al. 2019). Although grouped together as key apex predators, raptors are phylogenetically heterogenous assimilation with many morphological and ecological differences. Perhaps a most obvious example is revealed in their activity patterns, where most raptors are considered diurnal, except the owls, which are considered nocturnal, a habit they share with two other avian orders for which we have genome sequences (Caprimulgiformes and Apterygiformes) (Martin 1990; Mikkola 1983; Martin 2017; Zhan et al. 2013). However, the ferruginous pygmy owl Glaucidium brasilianum maintains some activity during the day and the snowy owl Bubo scandiacus hunts during the daytime, the American barn owl Tyto furcate is most active in twilight, the burrowing owl Athene cunicularia is cathemeral, and the stripped owl Asio clamator is crepuscular and nocturnal (del Hoyo et al. 1999; Martins and Egler 1990; Motta-Junior 2006; Motta-Junior et al. 2004; Sarasola and Santillan 2014; Martin 1986). Overall, as a group, owls actually exhibit a broad range of activity patterns and habitats (Bowmaker and Martin 1978; Braga 2006). Additionally, nearly one-third of falconiform species, as well as some accipitriformes species, maintain activity during the crepuscular period (Mitkus et al. 2018). © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

ABSTRACT: Breeding dispersal, the movement from one breeding territory to another, is rare for philopatric species that evolved within relatively stable environments, such as the old-growth coniferous forests of the Pacific Northwest. Although dispersal is not inherently maladaptive, the consequences of increased dispersal on population dynamics in populations whose historical dispersal rates are low could be significant, particularly for a declining species. We examined rates and possible causes of breeding dispersal based on a sample of 4,118 northern spotted owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) monitored in seven study areas over 28 yr, 1990–2017, in Oregon and Washington, USA. Using a multistate mark–resight analysis, we investigated the potential impacts of an emergent congeneric competitor (barred owl Strix varia) and forest alteration (extrinsic factors), and social and individual conditions (intrinsic factors) on 408 successive and 1,372 nonsuccessive dispersal events between years. The annual probability of breeding dispersal increased for individual owls that had also dispersed in the previous year and decreased for owls on territories with historically high levels of reproduction. Intrinsic factors including pair status, prior reproductive success, and experience at a site, were also associated with breeding dispersal movements. The percent of monitored owls dispersing each year increased from ˜7% early in the study to ˜25% at the end of the study, which coincided with a rapid increase in numbers of invasive and competitively dominant barred owls. We suggest that the results presented here can inform spotted owl conservation efforts as we identify factors contributing to changing rates of demographic parameters including site fidelity and breeding dispersal. Our study further shows that increasing rates of breeding dispersal associated with population declines contribute to population instability and vulnerability of northern spotted owls to extinction, and the prognosis is unlikely to change unless active management interventions are undertaken. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) inhabits older coniferous forests in the Pacific Northwest and has been at the center of forest management issues in this region. The immediate threats to this federally listed species include habitat loss and competition with barred owls (Strix varia), which invaded from eastern North America. We conducted a prospective meta-analysis to assess population trends and factors affecting those trends in northern spotted owls using 26 years of survey and capture-recapture data from 11 study areas across the owls' geographic range to analyze demographic traits, rates of population change, and occupancy parameters for spotted owl territories. We found that northern spotted owl populations experienced significant declines of 6–9% annually on 6 study areas and 2–5% annually on 5 other study areas. Annual declines translated to ≤35% of the populations remaining on 7 study areas since 1995. Barred owl presence on spotted owl territories was the primary factor negatively affecting apparent survival, recruitment, and ultimately, rates of population change. Analysis of spotted and barred owl detections in an occupancy framework corroborated the capture-recapture analyses with barred owl presence increasing territorial extinction and decreasing territorial colonization of spotted owls. While landscape habitat components reduced the effect of barred owls on these rates of decline, they did not reverse the negative trend. Our analyses indicated that northern spotted owl populations potentially face extirpation if the negative effects of barred owls are not ameliorated while maintaining northern spotted owl habitat across their range. © 2021

ABSTRACT: The diet of the Common Barn-owl in a forest- and shrub-dominated hunting area in the Strandzha Mountains, southern Bulgaria, was identified from 516 prey specimens. Shrews (52.9% by number, 26.7% by biomass) and rodents (42.1% N, 71.5% B) were prevalent. Among them, White-toothed shrews, Criocidura sp., (45.3% N, 21.4% B) was the most numerous prey genus. Mice, Apodemus sp., (15.7% N, 29% B) contributed with the largest share to the food biomass due to high predation of Striped field mice, A. agrarius, (12.2% B). The proportions of forest species in diet (Apodemus sp, Sorex sp., and dormice Gliridae) increased with the higher proportion of forest habitats (forests and shrublands cover more than 25% of the area) in most Barn Owl hunting territories in southern Bulgaria.

ABSTRACT: Plumage pigmentation is fundamental to a bird's phenotype, with pigment deposition causing relative crypsis or conspicuousness, depending on the environmental context. Geographic variation in plumage melanin tends to be predictable, suggesting that aspects of climate cause local matching of plumage to environment via genetic adaptation. Ecogeographic rules describe this predictability: Gloger's rule predicts that populations in wetter and warmer environments will be more pigmented; Bogert's Rule predicts more pigmentation in cold environments. The Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus) exhibits extensive geographic variation in the degree of melanin-based pigmentation. We examined fine-scale spatial variation in owl plumage melanism along environmental gradients in southwestern North America. We tested whether variation is explained by either of two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses: (1) a history of allopatric divergence between subspecies or (2) in situ local adaptation consistent with ecogeographic rules. The allopatric divergence hypothesis predicts a bimodal distribution of plumage melanism, with a geographic cline across a zone of secondary contact, whereas the local adaptation hypothesis predicts that climate explains variation independently of geography. Using a colorimeter, we measured coloration in 101 museum specimens of breeding-season Great Horned Owls that had been obtained from variable environments and elevations. Specimens previously identified as separate subspecies were distinguishable by colorimetry. Plumage lightness, however, was continuously distributed, rather than bimodal. While accounting for males having reduced pigmentation relative to females, linear models revealed that lighter plumage was associated with low latitude, low elevation, high temperature, and low precipitation. These findings suggest that variation in Great Horned Owl plumage pigmentation is best understood as continuous ecogeographic variation, consistent with ecogeographic predictions, and currently maintained in situ along multiple environmental gradients that characterize the "sky island"topography of the southwestern USA.  © 2021 Ornithological Societies of North America.

ABSTRACT: The growth pattern of an organism is influenced by multiple factors, such as its sex, parental investment, food abundance and sibling competition. For species showing sexual size dimorphism, the sex of siblings is expected to affect the growth of nestlings through differences in competitive hierarchies mediated by an asymmetry in body size. This study describes growth curves of Ryukyu Scops Owl Otus elegans nestlings, based on the analysis of body mass, wing length and tarsus length in 99 individuals. We subsequently tested for effects of sex of the nestlings, having an older male sibling, hatching order and brood size on the growth curves. Overall, we detected significant effects of several predictor variables, although differences between groups were often small. Males and later hatched chicks had lower body mass throughout their growth. The smaller the brood, the heavier the chicks were on days 0-1 and 30-32, although this relationship was reversed on days 8-13. Males and later hatched chicks also had shorter wings. Males had shorter tarsi than females from day 0 to day 4, however, dimorphism in this trait was reversed afterwards. Chicks in a large brood had longer tarsi. Earlier hatched chicks had longer tarsi in the first half of the growth period, but some of this difference had disappeared by the second half. From day 0 to day 3, individuals with an older brother had longer tarsi than those with an older sister. However, halfway through the growth period and thereafter, individuals with an older brother had shorter tarsi than those with an older sister. The fact that older brothers had an effect on the tarsus growth of their siblings was not due to sexual body size asymmetry, as in fact males were smaller than females in wing length and body size. We suggest that sexual differences in aggression mediated by androgens may have played a role. © 2021 Nederlandse Ornithologische Unie. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Natural habitats are being altered and destroyed worldwide due to urbanization, leading to a decrease in species abundance and richness. Nevertheless, some species, including tawny owls, have successfully colonized this novel habitat. Consequences at the population level have not been described; thus, our main objective was to describe the effects that urban structure have on the tawny owl population at local and landscape levels. Data were obtained from 527 survey points over 7 months in a large‐scale owl survey in the Basque Country (northern Spain) in 2018. At the local scale, the interaction between forest and urban cover affected tawny owl abundance, the opti-mum being in medium forested areas. The interaction between urban cover and clumpiness index (urban patch distribution) showed a generally negative effect. At the landscape scale, its abundance decreased in complex‐shaped urban patches and when distance between them was greater. In con-clusion, at the local scale, when a minimal forest structure is present in urbanized areas, the species can exploit it. At the landscape scale, it prefers smaller urban towns to cities. Thinking ahead, the current tendency toward “green capitals” should benefit tawny owl populations. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: Monitoring Mexican Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis lucida) in and near breeding territories during winter has practical value but has not been previously studied by passive techniques, including acoustic recorders. Such information could inform breeding survey strategies as well as identify new breeding pairs. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's standard survey protocol, entailing four nighttime visits to a site and listening for a response to broadcast calls, has limitations in winter, when nonbreeding owls are less likely to respond and multiple visits may not be possible. Instead, I tested the feasibility of using passive sound-recording equipment to detect the owl in winter, deploying audio recorders at two known nesting sites in northern Arizona over 6 months through winter 2014-2015. As a result, I recorded spontaneous calls during each month of the survey. Paired males and females called to each other in winter, and the variation in frequency of calling through the night paralleled the pattern found in previous studies. My data suggest that automated audio detection provides a reliable tool for continuous, high-resolution, long-term, and cost-effective monitoring of the Mexican Spotted Owl, in both winter and summer. © 2022 Western Field Ornithologists.

ABSTRACT: The dietary niche breadth of the Burrowing Owl was determined (Athene cunicularia Molina, 1782) in Llano La Soledad, Galeana, Nuevo Leon in northern Mexico, by considering prey type, numerical percentage, weight, weight percentage, frequency of occurrence percentage, and IRI percentage. The study compared data from three winters (2002-2003, 2003-2004, 2004-2005) by analyzing 358 pellets, identifying 850 prey items. Invertebrates constituted 90% of prey items, which mostly included insects (85%); beetles were the most common insects found in pellets (70%). Vertebrates made up 84% of consumed weight, of which 83% were mammals. Most of the mammals were cricetid rodents (41%). Niche breadth based on the numerical and weight percentage confirmed the Burrowing Owl as a generalist species with mean values per year ranging between 0.65 and 0.82. Additionally, there was a strong association between the weight of rodent species in winter. This association was mainly driven by changes in composition and frequency of these prey species during the second winter, probably caused by high annual rainfall. The second season also showed a statistically significant narrower niche (Ro = 0.96) and the smallest overlap (0.45 vs. 0.76) among the three winters. © 2022 PeerJ Inc.. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Broadcasting conspecific vocalizations is commonly used to survey secretive, inconspicuous, and uncommon species of birds, but information about how response behaviors vary across temporal and broad spatial gradients is limited for most species despite the importance of such data for guiding survey efforts. We assessed response patterns and detection probability of Elf Owls (Micrathene whitneyi) across broad ecological gradients in the Sonoran and Chihuahuan deserts of Arizona that spanned much of their breeding range in the United States. From March to June 2015–2017, we examined response times and distances of an estimated 587 Elf Owls detected during playback surveys at 1488 stations along 121 transects (193 km). Additionally, from April to June 2010–2011 and 2016–2017, we examined detection probability during 255 playback experiments at occupied nests and modeled the influence of spatial, temporal, moon illumination, vegetation, conspecific densities, and weather-related factors on detection probability. During transect surveys, response times were rapid (mean = 2.0 min), with 75% of detections within 3 min. Owls often responded close to broadcast stations (mean = 103 m), with only 25% of responses at distances > 140 m and none > 400 m. Response times were faster and from greater distances in the more arid western portion of our study area. During playback experiments at nests, detection probability averaged 0.65 and declined with increasing time of night, time of season, and noise levels. Detection probability also declined with increasing distance from target owls, but at lower rates in the western than the eastern portion of our study area. Spatial variation in detectability was primarily due to surveyors failing to detect responding owls in areas with higher owl densities in more resource-rich environments in the east, not differences in underlying responsiveness. Our results suggest that 5 or 6 min surveys within ˜4 h of sunset and early in the breeding season will be most effective and that spacing survey stations from 100 to 150 m apart, depending on local densities and study objectives, is adequate for estimating occupancy and abundance with relatively low false absence rates. © 2021 Association of Field Ornithologists

ABSTRACT: Avian predation is a primary cause of mortality for Spilogale putorius (Eastern Spotted Skunk) and is generally attributed to Bubo virginianus (Great Horned Owl). We report the first confirmed avian predation of an Eastern Spotted Skunk by a Strix varia (Barred Owl). The radio-collar of an adult female Eastern Spotted Skunk was recovered alongside an owl pellet containing Eastern Spotted Skunk remains in eastern West Virginia. DNA sampled from the surface of the pellet was amplified, sequenced, and compared to known Barred Owl and Great Horned Owl sequences. Differences in 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms confirmed a Barred Owl produced the pellet. Our findings show Barred Owls are at least occasionally an avian predator of this species in eastern forest ecosystems. © 2021 Humboldt Field Research Institute. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Corticosterone is a steroid hormone integral to a variety of physiological pathways and is strongly associated with the vertebrate stress response. In avian species, circulating corticosterone is sequestered into developing feathers and is used as an indicator of energy allocation during feather growth and widely applied in conservation physiology. The northern spotted owl Strix occidentalis caurina is a federally threatened old-growth forest obligate of conservation concern endemic to the Pacific Northwest of the United States and Canada. The effects of landscape characteristics and individual variation on early development in spotted owls remain unstudied despite long recognition of this knowledge gap and its potential importance to species conservation. We quantified corticosterone concentrations in 4,720 feathers from 1,056 juvenile spotted owls across seven study areas between 2001 and 2017. We used an information-theoretic approach to examine the environmental and individual factors related to feather corticosterone in juvenile spotted owls as an indicator of challenges during early development. Feather corticosterone was positively related to temperature and precipitation, and negatively related to juvenile mass at banding. We found strong support for an interaction between mass and precipitation, with greater amounts of precipitation being associated with higher levels of feather corticosterone in lighter juveniles. The temperature and precipitation metric with the strongest relationship with feather corticosterone occurred during the fledging period, suggesting that this period presents an energetic challenge for juvenile spotted owls. Greater juvenile mass decreased the effect of precipitation, suggesting that greater mass was important for juveniles to maintain homeostasis during fledgling. Feather corticosterone in juvenile spotted owls provided insights to the challenges faced during early development, adding to our understanding of spotted owl life history and potential for population recovery.

ABSTRACT: In snowy winters, the survival of Tawny Owls Strix aluco of the grey colour morph is suggested to be better than that of the brown (or red) morph, partly due to their paler plumage, which is presumed to provide better camouflage against predation. If the difference in the susceptibility to predation between the colour morphs is significant, this should probably be reflected in the relation between the number of snow-covered days (i.e. the length of the winter) and the number and survival of owls of different colour. In a population in southern Finland there were no significant associations between the number of snowy days during winter and the number of breeding Tawny Owls of different colour morphs in the following spring, but the number of owls, in particular red ones, varied inversely with the number of snowy days in the winter of the previous year. The time lag suggests that the number of snow-covered days (or some related factors) primarily influenced the pre-breeding survival of young red owls. However, I found no effect of snow days on the proportion of colour morphs, suggesting only small differences in morph-specific survival under long-lasting winter conditions. © 2021 British Ornithologists' Union

ABSTRACT: The southern Neotropics harbour one of the largest diversity of bats and raptors in the world, however, few records on the predation of bats, especially by owls, are reported in the literature. Here we have expanded our knowledge on the feeding habits of the ferruginous pygmy owl (Glaucidium brasilianum) by describing its attack on a Seba’s short-tailed fruit bat (Carollia perspicillata). Also, we compiled a list of 10 vertebrate species, including now three bat species, which are predated by this wide-ranging Neotropical owl. Thus, we recommend special attention to the monitoring of abundant bat populations and their predators, as much as their role in the ecosystem services, such as seed dispersal. © 2022, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro.

ABSTRACT: Species distributional data from atlas projects collected by volunteers and professionals play an essential role in ecology and biodiversity conservation. Atlas data primarily allow evaluating longitudinal and latitudinal gradients in species distribution. However, the effects of additional factors such as elevation and associated climatic conditions and landscape structure are rarely assessed. We used the original data from the Atlas of birds breeding in the Czech Republic in terms of the presence and absence (0/1) of breeding occurrence of seven owl species in 604 mapping quadrates (each quadrate 12.0 × 11.1 km in size) to assess the effect of elevation (reaching from 100 to 1100 m a.s.l.) and temperature on the distributional patterns of the owls. Using a multivariate spatial analysis with latitude and longitude as space predictors and landscape structure as covariates, we found that elevation and temperature significantly affected owl distribution; the model explained 94.8% of the variability (p = 0.002). Only the boreal owl (Aegolius funereus) showed a clear preference for the highest elevation, and simultaneously, boreal and pygmy (Glaucidium passerinum) owls preferred the coldest environments. Eagle owl (Bubo bubo) and tawny owl (Strix aluco) most often occupied low and middle elevation of moderate temperatures. Barn owl (Tyto alba) and long-eared owl (Asio otus) inhabited the warmest areas in low elevations. Finally, little owl (Athene noctua) most often occurred in the lowest elevations of intermediate temperatures. We have documented that the elevation and associated climate conditions can work as an effective predictor to assess distributional preferences of owl species based on atlas data. The findings can be helpful when the management of owls' habitats is considered and implemented. For example, the results of our case study suggest that the boreal owl can be susceptible to global warming and intensive logging at high elevations. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The trailing-edge serration that imitates the silent owl wing is used as a flow control method to suppress the aerodynamic noise generated from the rotating wind turbine blade. Recent studies have found that the addition of serrations could degrade the overall aerodynamic performance of the airfoil. To this end, an optimal design method for airfoils with the trailing-edge serration is developed. Combined with the modeling methods of aerodynamics for serrations, the fundamental parameters of serrations are integrated into the optimal design of wind turbine airfoils. Specifically, based on the existing multidisciplinary optimization method for airfoils, the aerodynamic prediction and evaluation module for the serrated airfoil was introduced to develop an aerodynamic-structural optimal design platform. In this way, a novel serrated airfoil equipped with high aerodynamic performance can be designed. Compared with the reference airfoil, the maximum lift-to-drag ratio and lift coefficient of the optimal serrated airfoil at the design point have been increased by 1.9% and 32.5%, while the aerodynamic noise could also be reduced. Finally, experiments were conducted in an anechoic chamber to verify the noise-reduction level of the optimal serrated airfoil, which sufficiently demonstrate the capability to improve the comprehensive performance of the airfoil using such a developed optimal scheme. © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Rear-edge populations of montane species are known to be vulnerable to environmental change, which could affect them by habitat reduction and isolation. Habitat requirements of two cold-adapted boreo-alpine owl species — Boreal Owl (Aegolius funereus) and Pygmy Owl (Glaucidium passerinum) — have been studied in refugial montane populations in the western Rhodopes, South Bulgaria. Data on owl presence and forest stand attributes recorded in situ have been used to identify significant predictors for owl occurrence. The results revealed Boreal Owl's preference for comparatively dense forests (high canopy closure values), big trees (diameter at breast height ≥50 ​cm) and large amount of fallen dead wood in penultimate stage of decay. For Pygmy Owl the only significant explanatory variable was the total amount of fallen dead wood. Results suggest preference of both owl species for forests with structural elements typical of old-growth forests (i.e., veteran trees, deadwood), the Pygmy Owl being less prone to inhabit managed forests. Being at the rear edge of their Palearctic breeding range in Europe both Boreal and Pygmy Owls are of high conservation value on the Balkan Peninsula. Hence, additional efforts are needed for their conservation in the light of climate change and resulting alteration of forest structural parameters. Current findings can be used for adjusting forest management practices in order to ensure both, sustainable profit from timber and continuous species survival. © 2022 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Owl diets undergo qualitative changes across the different regions of their area of distribution. During the four winters (from 2014–15 to 2017–18), Long-eared Owls’ pellets were collected at three winterroosts located at the southern part of Pannonian Plain, in the Serbian province of Vojvodina. In 8070 prey items from pellets, we identified 16 mammal and 32 bird species. The Common Vole was the dominant prey species with a proportion in a range from 27.4% to 71.6%. The Muridae family formed a supplementary part of the diet: Mus sp., wood mouse and harvest mouse, during all winters. Birds were also a major supplementary prey during winter 2014–15, comprising 10.6%. A comparison of our results with the diet of Long-eared Owls wintering at the northern Pannonian plain (southwestern Slovakia) indicated an increase the proportion of some species in the southern part. How different land uses in agriculture and environmental conditions may be reflected in the food supply are discussed in relation to the diet composition of Long-eared Owls and an environment whose is richer provides both growing diversity in the diet of these owls and an expansion of their food niche. Our study described the Long-eared Owl as opportunistic predators expanding their food niche in the presence of diversified prey. © The Author(s), 2021.

ABSTRACT: We studied the diet and reproductive success of Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus) at its northern range limit during an apparent high in the Snowshoe Hare (Lepus americanus) population. We performed diet analyses using images from fixed motion sensor cameras and pellet and prey remains collected at active nests, and gathered data on breeding success through camera and visual observations. Pellet data at 14 nests produced 1277 prey records consisting of 65–95% Snowshoe Hare biomass. Great Horned Owls ate 18 different prey types, with overall biomass consisting of 93% mammal, 7% bird, and less than 1% insects, frogs, and fish. The mean prey mass of 714 g (± 34 SE) was 2–25 times the mean prey mass of studies of this species at more southerly latitudes. Camera observations showed that Great Horned Owls delivered an average of 459 g/ chick/d (± 75) throughout nesting. This was significantly (P = 0.005) higher than observations from Alberta, at 328–411 g/ chick/d. Pellet/prey remains data showed that Great Horned Owls delivering a higher proportion of hares to their nestlings successfully raised more chicks (χ21 = 6.3, P = 0.012), highlighting the importance of this prey in the population dynamics of Great Horned Owl. In addition, we observed Snowshoe Hare removing pellets beneath nest sites, revealing an apparently undocumented bias to the use of pellet analysis. © The Ottawa Field-Naturalists’ Club

ABSTRACT: The examination of raptor pellets can be used to evaluate Arctic biodiversity. We found the remains of Meadow Vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus) and Ungava Collared Lemming (Dicrostonyx hudsonius) in pellets from Snowy Owl (Bubo scandiacus) nesting in the northern part of the Ungava Peninsula. We differentiated the two species by visual identification and geometric morphometric analysis of molar shape. The results of our study combined with historical data suggest that most commonly used range maps of Meadow Vole should be revised. © The Ottawa Field-Naturalists’ Club

ABSTRACT: The mite family Syringophilidae (Acariformes: Prostigmata) includes permanent parasites of birds exclusively, occupying their quill feathers where they reproduce and feed on living tissue fluids, piercing the quill-wall with their long and stiletiform chelicerae. The Boreal Owl, Aegolius funereus (L.) (Strigiformes: Strigidae) is parasitised by the Bubophilus aegolius, which is a new species of syringophilid mite described herein. In our study a total of 55 Boreal Owls were examined, including birds from Poland, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Czechia, Slovakia, Sweden, Finland, and Norway. A total of four host specimens from Poland, Switzerland, and Finland were infested by Bubophilus aegolius (index of prevalence IP = 7.3; 95% confidence interval for prevalence (Sterne’s method) CI = 2.5–17.9). In the material consisting of 14 juvenile (in the 1st calendar year) and 41 adults (in the 2nd calendar year or older) birds, only juvenile hosts were infested (IP = 28.6%; CI = 10.4–57.4). Among 3,190 examined feathers (primaries (N = 1,100), secondaries (N = 1,430), rectrices (N = 660), quill mites were found only in four feathers, each feather from a single host specimen: in two small secondaries, S12, S13, and in two middle rectrices R1. This low prevalence may be related to the solitary behaviour of owls and the marginal role of horizontal transfers of parasites between hosts. Hypothetically, the low number of infested feathers on the host indicates low effectiveness (= high mortality) during transmission, where–in each case–only one fertilised female foundress (dispersal stage) was able to transfer from the parent to the offspring and enter a new quill feather. http://www.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:66025B6E-A126-48FF-8B1A-F618265CA34D. © 2021 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Capsule: Territories of the nocturnal Ural Owl Strix uralensis and diurnal Northern Goshawk Accipiter gentilis were spatially associated in fragmented forest but not in extensive forest. Aims: To test the hypotheses that (i) the patterns of distribution of Ural Owl and Northern Goshawk territories are different in extensive and fragmented forests and (ii) the distribution of their territories do not depend on local forest structure and habitat variables. Methods: The territories of Northern Goshawks and Ural Owls were identified in forests in southern Poland. Spatial analysis was used to examine the co-occurrence patterns of the two species, and multivariate analysis to examine the impact of environmental cues on territory selection. Results: Most habitat parameters were not significantly related to the presence of territories of either species. For Northern Goshawk there was a positive association with the occurrence of old-growth patches and a negative association with clear-cut areas and proximity to forest edge in fragmented forests; for Ural Owl there was a significant effect of wood type in extensive forest. None of the habitat parameters distinguished the territories of the two species, suggesting similarity in the habitats used. The territories of the two species were spatially associated in fragmented forests, suggesting some positive interspecific relationship. In contrast, the distributions of the two species were not significantly associated in extensive forest. Conclusions: To explain the spatial co-occurrence between Northern Goshawks and Ural Owls we suggest: (i) Ural Owls can occupy unused Northern Goshawk nests in managed extensive forest where there is a deficiency of large tree cavities; (ii) restricted availability of habitat in fragmented forests forces both species to nest in close proximity, and/or (iii) Ural Owls use social information from Northern Goshawks about habitat quality when selecting territories in some landscapes. © 2022 British Trust for Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: Megascops is the most species-rich owl genus in the New World, with 21 species currently recognized. Phylogenetic relationships within this genus are notoriously difficult to establish due to the considerable plumage similarity among species and polymorphism within species. Previous studies have suggested that the widespread lowland Amazonian M. watsonii might include more than one species, and that the Atlantic Forest endemic M. atricapilla is closely related to the M. watsonii complex, but these relationships are as yet poorly understood. A recently published phylogeny of Megascops demonstrated that M. watsonii is paraphyletic with respect to M. atricapilla and that genetic divergences among some populations of M. watsonii are equal to or surpass the degree of differentiation between some M. watsonii and M. atricapilla. To shed light on the taxonomic status of these species and populations within them, we conducted a multi-character study based on molecular, morphological, and vocal characters. We sequenced three mitochondrial (cytb, CO1 and ND2) and three nuclear genes (BF5, CHD and MUSK) for 49 specimens, covering most of the geographic ranges of M. watsonii and M. atricapilla, and used these sequences to estimate phylogenies under alternative Bayesian, Maximum Likelihood, and multilocus coalescent species tree approaches. We studied 252 specimens and vocal parameters from 83 recordings belonging to 65 individuals, distributed throughout the ranges of M. watsonii and M. atricapilla. We used Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) to analyze both morphometric and vocal data, and a pairwise diagnostic test to evaluate the significance of vocal differences between distinct genetic lineages. Phylogenetic analyses consistently recovered six statistically well-supported clades whose relationships are not entirely in agreement with currently recognized species limits in M. watsonii and M. atricapilla. Morphometric analyses did not detect significant differences among clades. High plumage variation among individuals within clades was usually associated with the presence of two or more color morphs. By contrast, vocal analyses detected significant differentiation among some clades but considerable overlap among others, with some lineages (particularly the most widespread one) exhibiting significant regional variation. The combined results allow for a redefinition of species limits in both M. watsonii and M. atricapilla, with the recognition of four additional species, two of which we describe here as new. We estimated most cladogenesis in the Megascops atricapilla-M. watsonii complex as having taken place during the Plio-Pleistocene, with the development of the modern Amazonian and São Francisco drainages and the expansion and retraction of forest biomes during interglacial and glacial periods as likely events accounting for this relatively recent burst of diversification.

ABSTRACT: Coupling isotope values of feathers and satellite tracking of individuals have the potential to reveal multi-season linkages between wintering habitat, diet and carry-over effects on reproductive parameters in migrating birds. Snowy owls Bubo scandiacus have multiple wintering tactics as they can use both terrestrial and marine resources during the non-breeding season, but their nomadic behaviour complicates their study. We assessed if inter-individual variability in the diet inferred by feather isotopes could be explained by habitat use in winter as determined by satellite telemetry and examined possible carry-over effects on reproduction. Seventeen breeding female snowy owls were equipped with satellite transmitters and sampled for stable isotopes (δ 13C and δ 15N) in feathers. We found a positive relationship between the use of the coastal and marine environments in winter and the contribution of marine resources to the diet of snowy owls in the previous year based on feather analysis. The proportion of marine contribution to the winter diet was variable among individuals and showed a weak negative relationship to summer body mass but not with laying date or clutch size. Our integrated approach shows the usefulness of isotope analyses to infer habitat use and expand the temporal coverage of radio-tracking studies. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Wildland fire is a disturbance that shapes frequent-fire forest ecosystems and the life-histories of wildlife species that inhabit them. The California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) is an iconic old-forest species that evolved under a frequent-fire regime in western North America. While recent studies have focused on owl response to large, severe fire events, relatively little is known about how owls might respond to prescribed fires and wildfires managed for resource benefit. Therefore, understanding how owls use landscapes that are managed using fire may offer insight into how owls respond to fire management. We studied the breeding season nocturnal foraging habitat selection of 22 GPS-tagged California spotted owls in three national parks (Yosemite, Sequoia, and Kings Canyon) in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA where natural fires have largely been allowed to burn during the past 50 years and controlled burning has been used to target additional areas. Consistent with other studies of this species, owls selected forests dominated by medium and large trees and avoided areas with smaller trees within their home ranges based on step selection analysis. Owls neither selected nor avoided forests burned by low- and moderate-severity, or high-severity fires, yet avoided larger patches of severely-burned forest (odds of selection decreased by 20% for every 10 ha increase in severely-burned patch area). These results indicated the importance of patch characteristics, suggesting that larger patches reflected either lower quality foraging habitat or increased predation risk, even in these frequent-fire landscapes where “large” severely-burned patches were small compared to those common after megafires. Additionally, selection strength increased for areas burned recently by lower-severity fire and, to a lesser extent, by older fires (largely of lower severity) as the extent of these burned areas increased within individual home ranges. These results suggested that lower-severity fire benefitted spotted owls and that these benefits declined over time. Thus, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that California spotted owls are adapted to historical frequent-fire regimes of overall lower-severity with small high-severity patches. We hypothesize that fire management, coupled with medium- and large-tree retention, likely maintains high quality spotted owl habitat and may contribute to the observed owl population stability in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, compared to declining populations on three national forests. Finally, our results indicated that fire management, as practiced in these national parks, could benefit owl conservation elsewhere if challenges to the reintroduction of frequent-fire regimes can be overcome. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: In the present study we performed a comparative dietary analysis of two predatory birds, the Long-eared Owl (Asio otus) and the Common Kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) in the district of Lviv city. We found that the Long-eared Owl and the Common Kestrel are typical small mammal specialists within the urban ecosystem. Considering the abundance and biomass of prey, small mammals comprise 98.4% of the Long-eared Owl's diet. The species composition of mammals coincides almost 50% in the food intake comparison of the two birds. It has been established that the main prey of both species is the Common Vole (Microtus arvalis). The diet of the Common Kestrel is more varied, compared to the Long-eared Owl, due to the consumption of different species of insects (families Gryllotalpidae, Tettigoniidae, Carabidae and Scarabaeidae), reptiles and birds. This result suggested that dietary plasticity of the Common Kestrel facilitate successful adaptation to the urban landscape. The Long-eared Owl is more narrowly specialized in feeding on murine rodents, which reduces the trophic competition between the two predatory birds and allows the coexistence of two predators in the urban ecosystem.  © 2021 Ivan Zahorodnyi et al., published by Sciendo 2021.

ABSTRACT: There is no previously reported information on the morphological characteristics of pelvic limb long bones (femur, tibiotarsus and tarsometatarsus) in crested serpent eagle and brown wood owl. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate morphological and biometrical characteristics of pelvic limb long bones in crested serpent eagle and brown wood owl. The femur consisted of a curved shaft and two extremities. The shaft was wider proximally and distally and presented medial, lateral, anterior and lateral surfaces. The anterior, medial and lateral surfaces were smooth and continuous in both the species. An intermuscular line called linea aspera was present on the anterior and posterior surfaces in both the species. The proximal and distal extremities of the femur were almost of equal size. The proximal extremity presented a distinct, hemispherical head which was located in the level of the trochanter major in both the species. The distal extremity furnished a trochlea anteriorly for patella and medial, lateral condyles posteriorly for tibiotarsus bone. The patella was small and triangular and consisted of two surfaces, two borders, a base and an apex in both the species. Tibiotarsus was the longest bone in both the species which was formed by the fusion of distal extremity of the tibia with the proximal row of the tarsal bones. The proximal and distal extremity of the tibiotarsus consisted of medial and lateral condyles. In both the species, the fibula was a rod-shaped bone and reached up to distal third of the lateral border of the tibiotarsus. The tarsometatarsus was a long bone but smaller than tibiotarsus in both the species. Various biometrical parameters of the pelvic limb long bones were more in the crested serpent eagle as compared to the brown wood owl due to species differences. © 2021 Agricultural Research Communication Centre.

ABSTRACT: The historical continental distribution of the Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia) in Argentina included Santa Cruz province. However, for almost a century its presence there was hypothetical, based on a few, sometimes even erroneous, published records. Its precise distribution and status were unknown. In the present study, using a combination of personal observations and surveys, critical literature review, searches in online databases (EcoRegistros and eBird), scrutiny of Facebook pages and group posts focused on Argentine and Patagonian birds and wildlife photography, and information provided by citizen scientists and ornitholo-gists, we confirmed the current Burrowing Owl’s presence in Santa Cruz province. The species appears to be mostly localized to the city of Caleta Olivia and nearby open areas, Deseado Department, northeastern Santa Cruz province, within the Patagonian Steppe and, along the Atlantic coast, in the Mar Argentino ecoregions. Burrowing Owl breeds locally there, and individuals are seen yearlong. Although there are a few recent records of Burrowing Owl at other localities of Santa Cruz, we did not find evidence of a current broader distribution in this province, as most general bird guides and general ornithology books indicated in their distribution maps for the species. The southernmost known population of Burrowing Owls, restricted to northeastern Santa Cruz, provides a unique opportunity to monitor its progress. Furthermore, it could allow us to investigate the limiting factors and dynamics of its population in urban and natural areas of the Patagonian steppe and the Atlantic coast of Santa Cruz province. © 2021, Association Ornitologica del Plata.

ABSTRACT: THE DIETS of the Barn Owl Tyto alba and the Short-eared Owl Asio flammeus have been extensively studied world-wide over the past few years, especially on the Iberian Peninsula. Nevertheless, very few studies have examined the diets and the trophic niche overlap in areas where these two raptor species occur in sympatry. As such, in this study we compared the diets of the Barn Owl and the Short-eared Owl inhabiting agricultural landscapes of the Vega de Granada, south-east Spain, based on pellet analysis. The diets were very similar, as both owls preyed mainly on small mammals, the Algerian Mouse Mus spretus being the prey most commonly found in pellets from both species. Although the diet of the Barn Owl was more diverse than that of the Short-eared Owl, the food niche overlap was very high, thus indicating a low interspecific trophic segregation. Despite the similarities between both diets, the frequency of the Mediterranean Pine Vole Microtus duodecimcostatus was much higher in pellets from the Barn Owl, thus suggesting that the Barn Owl may exert pest control in years when the Mediterranean Pine Vole occurs in high numbers. © 2021 the author(s).

ABSTRACT: Transboundary frontiers often contain wildlife habitats that are fractured by geopolitical borders, which could have adverse effects on the wildlife that inhabit those areas. We examined the movement, breeding, roosting, and diet of 15 GPS-tagged barn owls (Tyto alba) along the Israeli-Jordanian and Israeli-Palestinian Authority borders. Our results showed that 80% of the barn owls hunted across the border. On average, the owls engaged in 5.4 hunting trips per night, 16% of which were cross-border excursions, and they crossed the borders as frequently as expected randomly, highlighting the importance of wildlife protection on all sides. Hunting movement, rather than cross-border activity, had an effect on the annual reproductive success and diet composition. Specifically, female owls that spent more time at the nest and engaged in longer distance hunting trips had higher reproductive success. Eighty percent of the females roosted outside of the nest box at a median distance of 908 m (range = 199–4112 m). Only 13.3% of the owls (2/15 owls) roosted across the border. These results increase our understanding of the movement, breeding, and roosting behavior of a non-migratory avian raptor. However, a serious lack of cooperation and communication between bordering countries hampers our ability to understand the full effects of differing environmental policies on a species that knows no borders. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: We present the first record of Aegolius harrisii (Cassin, 1849) from the state of Maranhão, extending the known distribution of the species 283 km to the west in the Brazilian Northeast. This record also represents the northernmost locality of the species within the Cerrado phytogeographic domain, which coincides with the ecotone between the Cerrado, Caatinga, and Amazon domains. Given the considerable gaps in the data on the occurrence of this owl in the Brazilian Northeast, we would recommend more surveys in specific areas with similar phytophysiognomies. © The authors.

ABSTRACT: Plumage colour has been hypothesized to signal fitness in its component parts survival and reproduction. In the tawny owl Strix aluco, grey individuals have been considered to be more viable and productive than brown ones in cold environmental conditions. The recent increase in the frequency of the brown morph in Finland has been explained by the climate warming. However, in recent decades there have been no trends in the general mildness of winters. Therefore, trends in the abundance of owls due to climate warming per se were unexpected. In a population near the southern coast of Finland, the abundance of grey (not brown) individuals increased significantly during the period 1986–2018, suggesting that natural selection has recently favoured the grey colour morph. During snowy and cold winters grey owls seemed to survive better than brown ones, suggesting that plumage colour signals adaptations to winter weather. The proportion of brown individuals in each year was best explained by the joint effect of snow cover and winter temperature. Extreme peaks in snow fall and cold winters seemed to affect substantially and rather similarly the abundance of both colour morphs. Between population differences in the occurrence of colour morphs were probably due to local and temporal differences in the snow cover. The number of fledglings was significantly related to the colour morph and weather conditions of the preceding winter in males but not in females. This suggests that coloration of males signals fitness in reproduction. © 2021 Nordic Society Oikos. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

ABSTRACT: Nesting in burrows is uncommon among birds, but one example of a burrow-nesting raptor is the Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia). In most areas of North America, where this raptor has been extensively studied, it typically uses burrows of fossorial mammals, but in southern South America this owl digs its own burrows. We studied characteristics of size, lining, and decoration of Burrowing Owl nests located in dunes, rural areas, and urban areas of the Pampas of Argentina, and analyzed whether such characteristics vary according to land cover. We found that Burrowing Owls construct burrows of similar characteristics in the three habitats sampled, although nests in dunes had wider entrances and longer tunnels. Such variation might relate to the soil, which is more compacted in the dunes than at the rural and urban areas. In both rural and urban areas, owls used manure to line the burrow and decorated the nest entrance with visible objects, but the diversity and amount of materials used for decoration was much higher in urban nests. Our results on burrow measurements, burrow-lining, and decoration behavior of Burrowing Owls in the Pampas were consistent with those reported for North American populations, even though burrow construction processes differ at both ranges of the species' distribution. © 2021 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Haemoproteus syrnii is a haemosporidian parasite found in owls. Although morphological and molecular data on the species is available, its exo-erythrocytic development was never researched. In this study, we provide the morphological, morphometric, and molecular characterization of H. syrnii populations found in owl species from Minas Gerais, southeast Brazil. We also characterized the coalescent species delimitation based on the molecular and histopathology data. Samples from 54 owls from six different species were analyzed, generating 11 sequences of the cyt b gene, from which six were new sequences. The overall prevalence of infection was high (72.22%). The H. syrnii sequences were grouped into two well-supported independent clades, which included other Haemoproteus (Parahaemoproteus) species. This was supported by both the coalescent species delimitation analysis and by the genetic divergence between lineages of these distinct clades. There were small morphological and morphometric differences within the population presented in this study. However, when compared with other studies, the molecular analysis demonstrated considerable intraspecific variation and suggests potential cryptic species. The histopathological analysis revealed, for the first time, that lungs and skeletal muscle are exo-erythrocytic stage location of H. syrnii, and that the parasite is linked to the histopathological changes found in owls. This study brings new data from Haemoproteus species biology and host infection, and improves host-parasite relationship understanding under an owl conservation perspective. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The previously reported information on the morphology of crested serpent eagle and brown wood owl skeleton is meager as compared to the fowl, thus, the present study was designed to provide the morphological features of the skull of both species. The specimens were procured from four crested serpent eagle and brown wood owls, brought from the Zoological Park, Aizawl for the post mortem examination conducted at the Department of Veterinary Pathology, College of Veterinary Sciences and Animal Husbandry, Aizawl, Mizoram. After the post-mortem examination, the collected specimens were macerated by the standard maceration technique and radiographs were taken at the Mizoram Health Centre, Aizawl. The skull of both the species consisted of neurocranium and viscerocranium which were separated by two large orbital cavities. The neurocranium was composed of single (occipital, sphenoid, ethmoidal) and paired (temporal, parietal and frontal) bones in both the species. The viscerocranium consisted of single bones (mandible, vomer and hyoid) and paired (quadrate, lacrimal, nasal, premaxilla, maxilla, zygomatic, palatine and pterygoid) bones. The skull of both the species was dolichocephalic as per the cephalic index, which was 52.63±0.04 and 68.56±0.03 in crested serpent eagle and brown wood owl, respectively. The results showed that there were variations in shape and components of crested serpent eagle and brown wood owl skull bones in comparison with other birds. © 2021 Agricultural Research Communication Centre.

ABSTRACT: The long-eared owl (Asio otus) is a Holarctic species. Towns are particularly important for the wintering of the species. We monitored the wintering roost assemblages of the long-eared owls between 2009 and 2018 to find the driving factors for species wintering roost selection. The species’ wintering population remained relatively constant over time. The highest number of birds was registered in December 2016 (n= 361), and the minimum in March 2014 (n= 1). The highest mean number of owls was registered in 2009, whereas the least was recorded in 2018. The monthly distribution of the birds throughout the study was quite prominent. The long-eared owls were most abundant in December and least in March. The most preferred tree species for roosting was the silver birch (Betula pendula), used by 14.7 % of the owls during the study. In our study area, the long-eared owls were predominantly roosting at height of 8-12 m, followed by those roosting at height 3-7 m above ground. The number of roosting birds differed significantly in terms of height selection. The Generalized Linear Models indicated that the duration of the day, the snow cover and the daily mean temperature were the most important determinants for the number of the wintering owls during the study period. © NWJZ, Oradea, Romania, 2021

ABSTRACT: The aim of the present study is to reveal the anatomical structure of lumbosacral plexus of barn owl. Six barn owls were included in the study. Nerves originating from plexus were dissected individually, and findings of innervation areas of nerves were determined. Lumbosacral plexus of barn owl was observed to be formed by ventral rami of ten synsacral spinal nerves. It was found that while the r. cutaneus femoris lateralis, the n. obturatorius, the n. coxalis cranialis, the r. cutaneus femoris medialis, the n. cutaneus femoris cranialis and the n. femoralis originated from the lumbar plexus, the n. isciofemoralis, the n. cutaneus femoris caudalis, the n. coxalis caudalis and the n. ischiadicus originated from the sacral plexus. Consequently, when the results of the study were compared with information of different avian species, it was observed that differences focused on the formation of the lumbar and sacral plexuses and innervation level of digits. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH

ABSTRACT: No species has touched off more controversy in the Pacific Northwest than the Northern Spotted Owl. The owl was federally listed under the US Endangered Species Act in 1990 due to widespread destruction of its old-growth forest habitat and inadequate species and habitat protections. A series of legal decisions shut down logging across millions of hectares of forests until the landmark Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP) was adopted by President Bill Clinton in 1994. The NWFP served as a de facto owl recovery plan that also protected habitat for hundreds of other old-growth associated species until 2005 when a lawsuit by Seattle Audubon Society forced the George W. Bush administration to develop a species-specific owl recovery plan. That recovery plan was drafted by a “multistakeholder” group stacked with industry and government representatives. At the time, a series of lawsuits between the timber industry (sue) and the Bush administration (settle) was designed to get the cut out. Consequently, the 2008 Bush administration recovery plan was designed to weaken forest protections in the NWFP. Independent peer review and the investigative branch of government declared the recovery plan scientifically flawed and politically motivated. Citing this information, President Barack Obama overturned the Bush administration’s recovery plan in 2009, initiating a revised plan developed by the US Fish & Wildlife Service. While there were improvements to this plan, it contained controversial assumptions about logging in owl territories to reduce fire intensity. I document an abuse of scientific integrity spanning presidential administrations and agency decisions as the owl remains perilously close to extirpation. This is a case study in why scientists need to be persistent when speaking truth to power. © 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The eastern barn owl (Tyto delicatula) is a significant native predator of small mammals in Australia. Regurgitated pellets can provide important data on species presence, current or historical changes in mammal fauna over time, or data on cryptic or threatened species. We collected 125 pellets from Cravens Peak reserve, Simpson Desert, Queensland, and examined the contents, including changes in diet over time (using age of pellet as a proxy) and the relative importance of different prey. In total, 642 unique prey items were recorded, 92% of which were mammals. Small rodents were the dominant prey-Mus musculus and Pseudomys hermannsburgensis, and the presence of Notomys cf. fuscus, Pseudantechinus cf. mimulus and Dasycercus blythi were all significant, being range extensions. Such data add to more traditional or novel techniques to record community changes over time. © 2021 CSIRO. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The Cuban bare-legged owl (Margarobyas lawrencii) is a poorly studied bird of uncertain affinities within Strigidae (true owls). Molecular data indicate that M. lawrencii may be one of the earliest diverging lineages of crown group Strigidae, but the evolutionary history of this taxon remains obscure. Here we describe a fossil species of Margarobyas from the Upper Pleistocene of Western Cuba and for the first time address the comparative osteology of this genus. The osteological survey confirms the remarkable morphological distinctiveness of the modern Margarobyas lawrencii. Margarobyas displays a derived similarity to Ninox owls (hawk-owls, subfamily Ieraglaucinae) in the morphology of the quadratum, but in the overall morphology of the skeleton it is also similar to members of the subfamily Striginae and species of Megascops (screech owls) in particular. The mixture of characters of both Striginae and Ieraglaucinae implies an early (no later than Oligocene) divergence of Margarobyas, thus supporting a long evolutionary history of these owls compared with other endemic owl species of the West Indies. The antiquity of Margarobyas makes it, along with Todidae (todies), one of the most archaic components of the modern West Indian avifauna. © 2021, by the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology.

ABSTRACT: - In order to investigate diversity patterns and similarities in the small mammal communities of an agroforestry landscape in western central Italy (Maremma of Lazio), we analyzed, in a multivariate setting (Cluster analysis, DCA-Detrended Correspondence Analysis), the prey content of barn owl Tyto alba pellets collected along one year in five sampling sites. Small mammal communities were composed by guilds typical of habitats included in agroforestry landscapes (croplands and mosaics, forests and ecotones, wet habitats and synanthropic ones). Since landscape matrices were characterized almost everywhere by croplands, typical agro-ecosystem species (Apodemus cfr. sylvaticus, Microtus savii, Mus domesticus and Soricidae) dominated in the majority of the collecting sites. The statistical analyses show how small changes in land use and cover can explain the faunal differences between sites, with the occasional presence of Arvicola italicus in wet habitats, and of Muscardinus avellanarius and Sorex samniticus in sites dominated by forest or agroforestry ecotones. Communities recorded in sites characterized by wet and forest habitats showed a higher distance from the others, dominated by croplands. Communities occurring in landscapes with the lowest habitat diversity showed also the lowest species diversity. © 2021 Vincenzo Ferri, Paolo Crescia, Stefano Celletti, Christiana Soccini, Corrado Battisti

ABSTRACT: After more than a century of persecution and low reproduction rate, the Eagle Owl is extinct, scarce or still declining in many areas. One possible mitigating action is to supply them artificially with food, but earlier experiments with supplementary feeding of other species have produced varying effects. Supplementary feeding has some caveats and controversies and needs to be tested to avoid counterintuitive management outcomes. Here we present an experimental supplementary feeding trial on a wild population of Eagle Owls on two islands in the middle of Norway. An Eagle Owl population of 27 territories was investigated from 1999 to 2019, and supplementary feeding was provided in three territories over two to seven years. Other important factors for Eagle Owl reproduction that have changed during the 21 years were, in addition to supplementary feeding, included in the GLMM analyses. We found significant earlier egg-laying in territories with supplementary feeding, and a delay in egg-laying in periods with a high corvid population. The probability of producing young increased with supplementary feeding, but was negatively affected by an increased number of pedestrians. This experiment shows that supplementary feeding can enhance breeding performance in Eagle Owls, and that food availability is a limiting factor. Despite that, we would not recommend supplementary feeding as a general mitigating method to help Eagle Owls, because it is time-consuming, the fledglings will have problems surviving if there is not enough food available naturally in the surroundings, and predatory mammals can be attracted to the Eagle Owl territories. © 2021 University of Helsinki.

ABSTRACT: Analysis of pellets provides information on the prey distribution, abundance, behavior and trophic relationships between Strigiformes and small mammals. By analyzing the skulls from long-eared owl (Asio otus) pellets, collected from a colony located in the Mercur Park, in Cluj-Napoca, Romania, we aimed to identify the small mammal species and to compare the results with available ones from another study conducted 2 years ago in the same area. During 7 collecting campaigns (November 2018 to March 2019) in 538 pellets a total of 1290 skulls were identified. Over the study period, the colony increased from 10 to 40 birds. Six species of small mammals were identified: the field striped mouse (Apodemus agrarius), the yellow-necked mouse (Apodemus flavicollis), the wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus), the European water vole (Arvicola terrestris), the field vole (Microtus agrestis) and the common vole (Microtus arvalis). Compared with the previously study, a new species was identified: the yellow-necked mouse and another one was missing: the bank vole (Myodes glareolus). ©2021 Studia UBB Biologia.

ABSTRACT: Noting lipidomic changes following the parasitism of migrating birds, the metabolic needs of which are primarily fueled by lipids, can deepen our understanding of host-parasite interactions. We identified lipids of migrating Northern saw-whet owls (Aegolius acadicus) using collision-induced dissociation mass spectrometry, compared the lipidomic signatures of hemoparasite-infected and noninfected individuals, and performed cross-validation analyses to reveal associations between parasite infection and lipid levels. We found significantly lower levels of lipid classes phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and sphingomyelin (SM) in infected Northern saw-whet owls than in the noninfected individuals. Conversely, we found higher levels for certain lysoPS and lysoPE species, and variable lipid level changes for free fatty acid (FFA) species. Reporting lipidomic changes observed between hemosporidian-infected and noninfected Northern saw-whet owls can strengthen our understanding of the mechanisms governing parasite proliferation in this species. Furthermore, our analysis indicated that lipidomic signatures are better predictors of parasite infection than the log-adjusted mass/wing chord body index, a metric commonly used to assess the influence of hemosporidia infection on the health of birds. Establishing a lipidomic profile for Northern saw-whet owls that provides baseline lipid levels during fall migration may assist future studies assessing causes of reductions in breeding brought about from subtle differences in behaviors such as delayed migration. © American Society of Parasitologists 2021.

ABSTRACT: Parasites of the genus Haemoproteus are vector-borne avian haemosporidia commonly found in bird species of the world. Haemoproteus infections are typically considered relatively benign in birds. However, some Haemoproteus species cause severe disease and mortality, especially for captive birds removed from their original habitat. In September 2018, a captive 15-year-old snowy owl (Bubo scandiacus), kept in a zoological garden of Japan, died subacutely after presenting leg dysfunction. This case showed significantly low PCV and elevated AST, ALT, CK, and LDH values. Many megalomeronts with prominent morphological characteristics of Haemoproteus were observed in the left leg muscles. Those megalomeronts exhibited multilocular structures and were internally filled with merozoites. A new lineage of Haemoproteus was detected by subsequent PCR for the cytochrome b (cytb) gene of avian haemosporidia from DNA extracted from several organ tissues. The detected lineage was classified in the subgenus Parahaemoproteus and was similar to those from the wild birds inhabiting the region including the study area, suggesting that this snowy owl likely acquired its infection from wild birds. This is the first report of a fatal case of a captive bird with a locally transmitted Haemoproteus infection in Japan. We considered the pathogenicity of this infection in conjunction with the clinical course and hematology results. We surmise that snowy owls may be particularly susceptible to infection with Haemoproteus parasites, and warming northern temperatures may exacerbate the overall health of these and other high latitude birds. Further research into the prevalence of Haemoproteus in wild birds near zoological gardens and potential biting midge vectors is necessary for the ex situ conservation of introduced birds. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Background: The cardiovascular system of owl monkeys has been studied due to frequent postmortem findings of heart disease in asymptomatic animals. The silent aspect and the difficulty of early diagnosis intensify the importance of studying the cardiovascular system in this species. Methods: Echocardiogram evaluation was carried out on 60 animals, grouped into suspect or non-suspect of having heart diseases, and evaluated through electrocardiogram, hematology, and biochemical tests. Results: Doppler echocardiography indicated two animals with suspicion of left ventricular hypertrophy and eight with dilated cardiomyopathy. Suspect animals had higher cardiac measurements and reduced shortening fraction. Troponin I was detectable in two animals (0.128 ng/mL and 0.584 ng/mL), and serum albumin concentration was significantly higher in non-suspect animals (P <.05). Conclusions: The importance of echocardiographic measurements of IVSd, IVSs, LVIDd, LVIDs, LVPWd, LVPWs, LA, EF, and FS in the cardiac evaluation of captive owl monkeys was evidenced. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

ABSTRACT: In 2020, 1296 raptors and owls (23 species) were ringed in Slovakia. The most abundant was the common kestrel (719 individuals), then the western marsh harrier (126) and saker falcon (92). The proportion of nestlings among all the ringed individuals was 76.7%. In the given period, 145 recoveries of raptors and owls (15 species) were recorded in the Bird Ringing Centre database. This number included 77 recoveries of colour-marked individuals recovered in our territory. There were 43 recoveries of birds ringed in Slovakia and resighted abroad. The last 25 recoveries were of individuals ringed abroad and recovered in Slovakia. In summary, most of the recoveries (of all types) were of red-footed falcon (69 recoveries), then common kestrel (17) and eastern imperial eagle (15). Most of the recovery circumstances were ring reading (almost 76% in total), findings of bird cadavers (6%) and recaptures (5%). Electrocutions and predations by other animals (3% each) were frequent causes of their deaths.  © 2021 Roman Slobodník et al., published by Sciendo.

ABSTRACT: A pair of the Northwest African endemic Maghreb Owl Strix mauritanica (Witherby, 1905) located in a coastal urban environment of the Moroccan capital, Rabat, was monitored for the first time over two consecutive breeding seasons, in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Pellets (n = 434) collected and analysed from their roost contained the remains of synanthropic species of rodents, such as the house mouse (Mus musculus), black rat (Rattus rattus), brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) and a fairly similar proportion of birds. The most interesting finding was the Barbary ground squirrel (Atlantoxerus getulus), because the distribution does not reach the latitude of Rabat and does not usually frequent urban areas. This is the first study of the Maghreb Owl diet in a non-natural environment in Morocco and highlights the predominance of commensal pest rodents and urban birds in their diet. However, because our study involved only one pair of owls, additional research should be carried out to make sound inferences for the species’ diet at the population level. © 2021 NISC (Pty) Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Abstract . Owls can be difficult to detect due to their secretive behavior, typically low calling rate, and low density on the landscape. Low detection probability during surveys can result in an underestimation of the presence and abundance of a species. Thus, optimizing detection probability of surveys targeting owls is necessary to accurately address ecological questions. We used datasets collected in South Carolina, USA, and Alberta, Canada, to investigate how survey detection can be optimized for Barred Owls (Strix varia). We examined seasonal effects on the detection probability of Barred Owls as determined by playback surveys and autonomous recording unit (ARU) surveys, and whether daily patterns of Barred Owl vocal activity could be used to improve the efficiency of ARU surveys. For each survey method, we estimated the number of survey days needed to obtain a seasonal detection probability ≥ 90% of Barred Owls. We found detection probability with playbacks increased as the breeding season progressed. The effect of seasonality on detection probability with ARUs was dependent on the way encounter history was defined. Barred Owl vocal activity peaked twice per night, with one vocalization peak occurring immediately after sunset and another 7-9 hr after sunset. By targeting these vocalization peaks during surveys, we found that we could reduce ARU survey time by 50% and still retain .82% of the original site detections, thereby reducing survey processing time. Although playback surveys were more efficient than ARU surveys at detecting Barred Owls, ARUs have numerous advantages, such as reducing survey effort and disturbance to the target animal. Ultimately, survey designs are dictated by the budget, personnel capacity, study region, and research objectives, but our findings will help researchers plan studies that optimize detection probability and minimize survey cost and effort.  © 2021 Ornithological Societies of North America.

ABSTRACT: Objectives. The Little Owl is the most common owl in the Western Palearctic and its population is declining significantly in Europe. Therefore, conservation and study of this owl is an important issue in most European countries. Analysis of trophic patterns at the local level provides interesting and valuable information about the predator’s eating habits. The owl’s diet investigation allows us to analyze their potential adaptations to habitats with different levels of environmental transformation. Materials and Methods. We studied nutrition of the Little Owl Athene noctua, in agricultural lands of Berehove district of Transcarpathian region in Ukraine. In total, 1446 pellets were collected at 15 pellet stations in 2002-2020 and 2506 prey items were identified. The prey items represented 18 vertebrate species (16 species of small mammals of three orders Rodentia, Soricomorpha, Carnivora, as well as reptiles of the family Lacertidae and birds of the order Passeriformes and arthropods. Results. Vertebrates play a major role in feeding the Little Owl (over 99% of total prey biomass in all of the studied sites). The common vole is the most common prey in the owl’s diet (52.1% of the total prey number and 67.5% of the biomass of the prey caught), as well as a high proportion of mice of the genus Apodemus and Sylvaemus. The contribution of invertebrates to total prey biomass is insignificant (0.3%). A large number of invertebrates were observed in the diet of the Owl in summer and were almost completely absent in winter. Conclusions. According to our data, the Little Owl is a typical predator generalist in Transcarpathia. The 28 taxa found in the pellets show a wide range of food objects in a relatively small area, and high level adaptations to habitats with different levels of environmental transformation (agrosystems and anthropogenic areas). © 2021 I.

ABSTRACT: Owls are outstanding environmental quality bioindicators due to their position at the top of the food chain and susceptibility to pollutant accumulation. Exposure to chemical contaminants is often a risk for these animals. Moreover, studies addressing the bioaccumulation of trace elements and pesticide residues in tropical nocturnal raptor species are scarce. We analyzed the 26 organs (heart, liver, and kidney) of Tyto furcata (n=3), Megascops spp. (n=5), Pulsatrix koeniswaldiana (n=1), and Asio stygius (n=1) carcasses, collected from June 2018 to May 2019 in the Southern region of Brazil. The original vegetation consisted of areas of Araucaria forests and grassy-woody steppes with gallery forests, which were greatly modified by the introduction of agriculture. In four animals and eight organs, the pesticides abamectin, atrazine, chlorpyrifos-ethyl, and diurom were analyzed through high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a mass detector. In six animals and eighteen organs, the trace elements cadmium, lead, chromium, and nickel were identified via atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Chlorpyrifos-ethyl was detected in the livers of the genus Megascops. Chromium was found at high concentrations in all matrices analyzed for this trace element. Moreover, P. koeniswaldiana presented lead levels indicative of high exposure. The bioaccumulation of these toxics in owls described here can impact the population levels of these species, impact on its ecological function, and consequently unbalance the ecosystem. Moreover, owls are considered bioindicators; therefore, the occurrence of bioaccumulation indirectly gives us information about the quality of the environment. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: This work describes a novel mechanism of laminar flow control of straight and backward swept wings with a comb-like leading edge (LE) device. It is inspired by the LE comb on owl feathers and the special design of its barbs, resembling a cascade of complex 3D-curved thin finlets. The details of the geometry of the barbs from an owl feather were used to design a generic model of the comb for experimental and numerical flow studies with the comb attached to the LE of a flat plate. Due to the owls demonstrating a backward sweep of the wing during gliding and flapping from live recordings, our examinations have also been carried out at differing sweep angles. The results demonstrate a flow turning effect in the boundary layer inboards, which extends downstream in the chordwise direction over distances of multiples of the barb lengths. The inboard flow-turning effect described here, counter-acts the outboard directed cross-span flow typically appearing for backward swept wings. This flow turning behaviour is also shown on SD7003 airfoil using precursory LES investigations. From recent theoretical studies on a swept wing, such a way of turning the flow in the boundary layer is known to attenuate crossflow instabilities and delay transition. A comparison of the comb-induced cross-span velocity profiles with those proven to delay laminar to turbulent transition in theory shows excellent agreement, which supports the laminar flow control hypothesis. Thus, the observed effect is expected to delay transition in owl flight, contributing to a more silent flight.  © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Understanding intraspecific phenotypic variation in prey specialisation can help to predict how long-term changes in prey availability affect the viability of these phenotypes and their persistence. Generalists are favoured when the main food resources are unpredictable compared to specialists, which track the availability of the main prey and are more vulnerable to changes in the main food resource. Intraspecific heritable melanin-based colour polymorphism is considered to reflect adaptations to different environments. We studied colour morph-specific diet specialisation in a generalist predator, tawny owl (Strix aluco), during offspring food provisioning in relation to mammal prey density. We hypothesised that the grey morph, with higher fitness than the brown in Northern boreal conditions, is more specialised in mammalian prey than the brown morph, which in turn has higher fitness than the grey in the temperate zone. We found a higher diversity of prey delivered to the nest by brown fathers compared to grey ones, which also depended on the overall mammalian prey availability. Brown fathers provided proportionally fewer mammalian prey than grey in poor, but not in favourable mammal prey years. Our results suggest that the brown morph is more generalistic and reacts more strongly to variations in food supply than the grey morph, which may be a beneficial strategy in an unpredictable environment caused by environmental degradation. Significance statement: Diet choice of a species may vary depending on fluctuations in the abundance of their food resource, but also within a population, there can be adaptations to use different food resources. The tawny owl exhibits a grey and a reddish-brown colour morph and is considered a generalist predator eating both mammal and bird prey. We find that the diet of the reddish-brown morph is more diverse than that of the grey. When the tawny owls’ main prey, small mammals, are abundant both colour morphs prey on mammals, but in years with less small mammals, the reddish-brown morph is more prone of switching to small bird predation than the grey. The generalist strategy of the brown morph is likely to be more favourable than a stricter specialisation in small mammals of the grey under recently reoccurring irregularities in small mammal dynamics. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Effects of anthropogenic pressures on birds of the Andaman Islands have been documented to some extent, however studies on the effect of human activities on the behavioural response of these birds are limited. This study assessed the anti-predatory behaviour (flush response - FR and flight initiation distance - FID) of three owl species (Otus sunia, Otus balli, and Ninox obscura) in response to human stimuli and factors influencing it on the Andaman Islands. In total, 63 % of owls flushed from their roost sites in response to approaching human, and such a response varied between species. Similarly, FID varied widely among the species ranging from 4.23 to 6.73 m. The FR of N. obscura was influenced by the count of climbers, presence of spine, and branch status, while roost height, ambient temperature, and lower count of climbers contributed to a higher FID. For the two Otus species, camouflage and pairing were found to influence their FR while FID of O. balli was influenced by roost height, pairing, and presence of spines. Our results indicated that the anti-predatory behaviour of owls on the Andaman Islands was species- and site-specific and prolonged disturbance to their roost sites may affect the survival and reproductive rate of these owls. © 2021 Sureshmarimuthu et al.

ABSTRACT: As is well-known, endemic island bird species are especially vulnerable to extinction from anthropogenic environmental change and reduced fitness compared with mainland taxa. The Cyprus Scops Owl, Otus cyprius, is a recently recognized island endemic species whose ecology and breeding biology have not been studied. It nests mainly in holes in trees and buildings, so the felling of old trees, modern architectural practices, and the renovation of old houses in villages may reduce nest site availability. Its population trend is also unknown. Therefore, to better determine its ecological requirements and habitat preferences we placed nest boxes in rural areas adjacent to the forest, in the forest, and in the ecotone between them, and used breeding success as our indicator of habitat suitability. We found that breeding parameters like laying date, clutch size, length of the incubation period, hatching day, hatching success, and number of nestlings did not differ between the three habitats. Despite the low level of nest box occupancy rate (5–11%) the endemic Cyprus Scops Owl readily breeds in artificial nests. Therefore, although we are unaware of any current threats to the Cyprus Scops Owl, we recommend that its conservation be prioritized, including studies, monitoring, habitat conservation, and the provision of nest boxes. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: An adult owl was presented with an injury to the right eye that rendered it blind in that eye. The left eye was normal. Removal of the right eye was recommended and a modified eye evisceration was performed. No complications were observed during or after surgery. The objective of this paper is to describe the modified eye evisceration technique that was successfully used in a tropical screech owl (Megascops choliba). Case: An adult owl was presented with an injury to the right eye that rendered it blind in that eye. Two previous surgical treatments have been carried out but have not been successful. Using a portable slit-lamp (Kowa SL-15®), both eyes were examined. The left eye was normal. Upon ophthalmic examination of the right eye, the owl demonstrated blepharospasm and large central corneal ulcer. Removal of the right eye was recommended. The bird received midazolam hydrochloride [Dormire® - 1 mg/kg, IM] and ketamine hydrochloride [Ketamina® - 5 mg/kg IM] as pre-anesthetic medications. Subsequently, the bird was anesthetized with isoflurane (Isoforine®) by facemask for induction, and then maintained with isoflurane vaporized in 100% oxygen through an endotracheal tube. With the aid of a surgical microscope and microsurgery materials, a modified eye evisceration was performed. Post-operatively, the owl received meloxicam [Maxicam® - 0.5 mg/kg, IM] and tramadol hydrochloride [Cronidor® - 15 mg/kg, orally for 4 days]. The day after surgery, the owl was comfortable and its usual appetite was regained. The patient remained hospitalized for 3 weeks and was evaluated daily. The skin sutures were removed 10 days after the surgical procedure and the surgical wound had healed normally. The patient was reintroduced into the wild after 2 months. During the 6 months post-release, the bird was evaluated once a month, and no complications were observed. Discussion: Severe eye trauma and complicated corneal ulcers are common causes of eyeball removal in birds. In birds, there is a high risk of complications during enucleation. The fragility of the orbital bones makes them susceptible to trauma during the surgery. Evisceration involves the removal of the inner contents of the eye while leaving the cornea and the sclera intact. In the current case, evisceration was chosen because the eye was blind, and maintaining a blind eye would be a source of pain and infection. In the modified evisceration technique, the risk of complications is minimal compared to enucleation, mainly because surgical manipulation is minimal. In our case, the total surgery time was 20 min. Another complication reported after enucleation in birds is the possibility of disfiguring the bird because the removal of the globe disturbs the natural head balance. To avoid these complications, the use of an intraocular prosthesis after evisceration in birds has been performed. However, owls have a tubular-shaped globe with scleral ossicles. These factors could hinder or even prevent the accommodation of a cylindrical silicone prosthesis. In the present case, an intraocular prosthesis implant was never considered due to the unavailability of the prosthesis and to avoid the risk of postoperative complications that have been reported from the literature in dogs. In this case, the owl recovered well from anesthesia without complications, and no postoperative hemorrhage was observed. No signs of pain were observed during the postoperative period and the owl had already shown an appetite and fed on the first postoperative day. The previously published reports using the modified evisceration technique also demonstrated an absence of pain signs during the postoperative period. © 2021 Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul.

ABSTRACT: The conservation status of the Barn Owl Tyto alba at continental level is not favourable. A way to assess the success and effectiveness of conservation actions regarding the Strigiformes is to use data collected at recovery centers that host thousands of individuals. Individual Barn Owl's information were collected at their arrival in six recovery-centers in Italy, two in northern Italy, two in central and two in southern Italy. Data were analysed for 1.393 Barn Owls recovered from 1993 to 2016. Four different recovery reasons were used to classify the individuals: I) trauma, ii) intoxication, iii) illegal hunting, iv) other. In three of the six centers we found a significant decrease of hospitalized Barn Owls over the years, possibly because of changes in the local situations. The percentage of chicks recovered is low. Traffic death rate significantly affects young owls during their post-fledging dispersal period and at a local level, this effect could contribute significantly to the demographic collapse of the populations, contributing to a patchy decline of the species in Italy. The collision with motor vehicles proved to be the primary cause of hospitalization, but the recovery due to illegal hunting is significant too, in particular in central and southern Italy. To limit the use of anticoagulant rodenticides, turns out to be a necessary and urgent action to help this species. © 2021 Centro Italiano Studi Ornitologici. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The effectiveness and efficiency of the Natura 2000 network for the Eurasian Eagle-owl conservation in SE Bulgaria was assessed by comparing data collected during a long-term study on number of breeding pairs and fledglings before and after network establishment. The Natura 2000 network and non-protected areas showed similar values of the calculated indices according to the number of occupied localities. However, the pairs in Natura 2000 sites bred significantly less fledglings after the creation of the network than the pairs in non-protected ones. The Special Protection Areas (SPA) system created specifically for the preservation of birds has the lowest efficiency in respect to Eurasian Eagle-owl protection. Proposals were made after 'gap analysis' for real protection and optimization of the protected-area network to increase the stability of the Eurasian Eagle-owl population in the changing environment.  © 2021 Boyan Milchev et al.

ABSTRACT: Encounters between birds of prey and porcupines are rarely documented, and so far only in North America. At least 39% of such encounters lead to death of the attacker. We present first evidence for similar encounters between The Eurasian Eagle Owl and the Indian Crested Porcupine, suggesting that young porcupines may occasionally serve as potential prey for the owl. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2021

ABSTRACT: Tropical owls are one of the most threatened groups of birds. Studying the association between landscape features and owl assemblages is challenging due to the logistical difficulties of nocturnal fieldwork. We analyzed the association of landscape composition and spatial configuration of forest cover with the composition of the owl assemblages in a tropical rainforest in southeastern Mexico. During the 2014 reproductive season (April to June), we estimated owl abundance through auditory detection and playbacks at 60 survey points distributed in 12 landscapes (625 ha each) within a gradient of forest cover. We found that the owl community comprised six out of the 10 expected resident species. The landscape unit with 41% forest cover contained the most diverse assemblage. The owl species most susceptible to local extinction were specialists of interior areas of old-growth forest. The abundances of the Middle American Screech-Owl (Megascops guatemalae), Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus), and Black-and-white Owl (Ciccaba nigrolineata) were positively associated with the proportion of forest cover as well as with the average size of the patches, but negatively associated with environmental temperature. The abundances of the Barn Owl (Tyto alba) and Ferruginous Pygmy-Owl (Glaucidium brasilianum) were positively related to the amount of urban area in the landscape. The only species recorded along the entire gradient was the Mottled Owl (Ciccaba virgata), a species that is a generalist in habitat and diet; its abundance was positively related to the proportion of forest cover and the amount of water surface (lakes and rivers) in the landscape. Four resident species were not recorded: Crested Owl (Lophostrix cristata), Spectacled Owl (Pulsatrix perspicillata), Striped Owl (Pseudoscops clamator), and Central American Pygmy-Owl (Glaucidium griseiceps). © 2021 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The present paper builds on older published studies of diet of the Eurasian Eagle-owl (Bubo bubo) at traditionally used nest sites in the Česká Lípa region (northern Bohemia), which provided an opportunity to analyse changes in the composition of food brought to the nests over a period of approximately 80 years. Substantial changes were recorded predominantly in species that gradually disappeared from the landscape after 1940. Progressively, the proportion of game species (Grey Partridge, Perdix perdix, Common Pheasant, Phasianus colchicus, European Hare, Lepus europaeus) and species dependent on a heterogeneous and extensively grazed farmland (European Hamster, Cricetus cricetus) decreased in the diet. At the same time, the number of species associated with intensive farming (Brown Rat, Rattus norvegicus) increased in the diet. Changes in the composition of food probably reflect the changes in the agricultural, forestry and hunting land use and their consequences in the composition of zoocenoses in which the Eurasian Eagle-owl obtains its food. © 2021 Czech Society for Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: With the advent of state of the art of artificial intelligence technologies like deep learning, several digital healthcare records are yet to be fully explored. Several data processing and analytics methods treat the data as numbers and strings and attempt to make a sense out of it using data mining and machine learning techniques. The current data processing and data analytics methods are not new to handling electronic healthcare records, yet they suffer from a typical problem of missing out the semantic information associated with the healthcare records which humans excel at. Semantic knowledge bases in the form of ontologies and the insightful syntactic patterns in healthcare data, especially clinical text documents, could be of great help for several medical research projects aiming at developing intelligent semantic reasoning methods for supporting healthcare decision support systems. The chapter thoroughly introduces the key concepts and terminologies in syntactic and semantic reasoning using Multi Entity Bayesian Networks (MEBN), Web Ontology Language (OWL), and probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFG) with a special focus on applications to the healthcare domain. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The provision of habitat for natural enemies of agricultural pests is common in integrated pest management approaches but has rarely been examined for vertebrate predators controlling vertebrate pests. To mitigate the economic and environmental costs of removing rodent pests in vineyards in Napa Valley, California, winegrape producers have installed nest boxes to attract American barn owls (Tyto furcata) to their properties. A rigorous estimate of how many rodents barn owls remove from the landscape is a necessary first step to understanding the overall impact of barn owls on rodent pest populations, and this study provides an estimate of rodent removal and prey composition by using remote nest box cameras. In addition, we tested hypotheses for how habitat may influence prey delivery rates and composition. Videography indicated that each barn owl chick received on average of 191 ± 10.01 prey items before fledging the nest box and that the amount of grassland habitat near the nest box and the proportion of deliveries of smaller prey were positive predictors of prey delivery rate. Prey composition was dominated by voles, gophers, and mice, and their relative proportions were associated with the composition of habitats near a nest box. Specifically, oak savannah was positively associated with the proportion of gophers and negatively associated with voles, and grassland was positively associated with voles. Further research on prey delivery should focus on the possible roles of rodent abundance, adult owl quality, and additional metrics of habitat structure. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: During the course of a plague epizootic, decimation of rodent host populations may result in the transfer of fleas to alternate or phoretic hosts, including to sympatric raptors that prey on rodents. We studied flea abundance and flea species assemblages on burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia hypugaea) in southwestern Idaho before (2012-2014), during (2015-2016), and after (2017) an epizootic of plague in Piute ground squirrels (Urocitellis mollis). We examined (1) if a larger proportion of burrowing owl nests contained fleas, (2) the likelihood that owls within a high flea abundance class increased, and (3) if owls harbored ground squirrel fleas during the epizootic. Using a flea abundance index assigned to 1,184 owls from 236 nests, the proportion of nests and the likelihood that owls had high flea abundance decreased rather than increased during epizootic years. Moreover, of 3,538 collected fleas from owls at 143 nests, no fleas were species that Piute ground squirrels typically harbor. Instead, Pulex irritans was the predominant flea collected in all study years (> 99%). Thus, although raptors may play a role in plague, there was no evidence that the die-off of ground squirrels resulted in higher flea intensity in burrowing owls or that they served as frequent accidental or phoretic hosts for ground squirrel fleas that could potentially be infectious with Yersinia pestis. © 2021 John Wiley and Sons Inc..

ABSTRACT: Despite extensive accounts in the literature describing Barred Owls (Strix varia) as obligate forest-interior species, Barred Owls have increasingly been observed in urbanized landscapes. To determine if certain habitat characteristics, such as mature urban trees, facilitate the occurrence of Barred Owls in developed regions, we deployed GPS transmitters on 20 breeding Barred Owls in northwestern South Carolina. We selected territories containing a gradient of development density and habitat types to examine predictors of home range size and habitat selection along an urban-rural gradient. We related nocturnal locations to habitat features using resource selection functions (RSFs). We explored differential use along a development gradient by modeling interactions between habitat parameters and measures of development in the home range. Home range size varied from 0.38 km2 to 3.38 km2; size increased with the percentage of treeless area in the territory such as agricultural fields and power lines. Distance to nest, tree height, and distance to canopy edge were the most important predictors of owl use. Barred Owl selection for roadsides and aquatic features increased with degree of fragmentation in the home range. This is the first resource selection study using GPS data to examine habitat use of Barred Owls in the context of development. Our results highlight the behavioral plasticity of a species previously described as sensitive to anthropogenic impacts. The presence of this large avian predator in urban forests suggests that retaining key habitat features can promote multi-trophic communities even when other aspects of the habitat are highly altered. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Changes in land use affect the life of small mammals and the owls that prey on them. The aim of the present work was to follow changes in the composition of the common barn-owls' prey and the landscape structure of their hunting areas. In 2007 and 2016, we collected owl pellets in the whole area of Baranja region but samples from both periods originated only from 10 sites. The diversity of small mammals in the prey was similar in both years, while common vole (Microtus arvalis) dominated with over 60%. In pellets collected in 2016, we found significantly more bicolored shrews (Crocidura leucodon), lesser white-toothed shrews (Crocidura suaveolens) and yellow-necked mice (Apodemus flavicollis), while the proportions of harvest mouse (Micromys minutus) and eastern house mouse (Mus musculus) were significantly lower than in the previous sampling. The landscape structure of hunting areas has hardly changed over the decade; therefore, the temporal variations in the owls' diet composition may have been caused by changes in farming practices such as the frequent mowing of meadows, the regulation of the use of pesticides, the depopulation of villages and also the effects of extreme weather. © 2021 Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.

ABSTRACT: Owls are considered as dominant predators for control of rats and mice population in agricultural fields and presently their populations are continuously declining in Punjab, Pakistan. The present study was aimed to assess the knowledge and attitude of people of rural and urban areas about the declining trend of owls. During this survey, more than 1600 people were asked to collect information regarding the owl populations from six localities including Faisalabad, Sialkot, Jhang, Lahore and Bahawalnagar. Four parameters were the major part of the questionnaire: familiarity, misconceptions, awareness about owls and their acceptance as a biological controlling agent. The results revealed that about 95% of people were familiar with owls in the agro-ecosystem. Only 15.6% of people thought that owls should be eliminated; 23.0% were of the opinion that owl's presence in a locality leads to ruination; 33.3% agreed that the owls presence was a sign of bad omen; 41.8% considered them as signs of foolishness; 47.0% believed that owl's body parts were used for black magic purposes. In contrast, 50% of people acknowledged that owls are beneficial to humans; 60.3% knew that owls are the enemies of rodents, 67.7% agreed that they are suppressors of rats and mice and 63.8% agreed that artificial nest boxes can serve as their nests and roosts. It was encouraging to know that 74.8% showed their willingness to enhance the owl's population on their farms, and 74.0% were willing to permit the installation of nest boxes in or near the villages. The study of attitudes of respondents towards owl will help to develop an effective conservation strategy and to boost owl's population in croplands for biological control of rats and mice.  © 2021 Ghulam Mustafa Rashid et al., published by Sciendo 2021.

ABSTRACT: · This study quantitively compares the diets of the Stygian Owl (Asio stygius) and the Short-eared Owl (A. flammeus) in the southwest of the Bogotá Savanna, Colombia. We identified 130 prey items from 111 A. stygius pellets and 579 prey items from 149 A. flammeus pellets. In terms of the numbers of preys, the diet of A. stygius consisted of the following: 88.1% birds, mainly pigeons, rails and cuckoos; and a smaller proportion of beetles (11.4%). In the diet of A. flammeus, insects were the most frequent prey item (59.8%), followed by rodents (39.8%), and birds (0.5%). In terms of biomass contribution, the main preys in the diet of A. stygius were Eared Doves (Zenaida auriculata) (54%) and Purple Gallinules (Porphyrio martinica) (19.3%), while the diet of A. flammeus consisted mainly of House Mice (Mus musculus) (65.2%). Diet diversity varied between the owl species: A. flammeus was more selective in its hunting habits, while A. stygius was more of an opportunistic predator. It is important to quantify the ecosystem services these owls provide not only by controlling M. musculus, Z. auriculata, and Shiny Cowbird (Molothrus bonariensis) populations, which can affect human well-being and threatened species populations, but also through secondary seed dispersion and birdwatching opportunities. © 2021 Neotropical Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Capsule: Tawny Owl Strix aluco site occupancy and detectability are influenced by habitat and environmental variables. Aims: To determine factors influencing Tawny Owl occupancy and detectability around British homes and gardens using a large-scale citizen science survey across two main survey periods. Methods: Surveys of 20 min duration were undertaken one evening a week from the homes and gardens of volunteers, for up to 26 weeks between October and March of 2005/2006 and 2018/2019, and analysed primarily using multi-season occupancy modelling. Results: During two survey periods, more than 9000 sites were surveyed across the breeding range of the Tawny Owl within Britain. The main drivers of occupancy were found to be the extent of broadleaf woodland cover and the degree of urbanization. Detection probability was influenced by date, time, weather, and moon phase. Using the current method, a minimum of five to six survey visits per site would be required to have 95% confidence over the presence or absence of Tawny Owls at a given site, but it may be possible to optimize the survey method further to increase efficiency by surveying in the autumn or early spring, early after dusk, and on cloudless dry evenings close to the full moon. Conclusion: The findings indicate that survey methodologies for surveying Tawny Owls can be optimized to increase the efficiency of detection, if present at a site. We highlight the need for further research on the effects of urbanization on Tawny Owls, particularly with regards to artificial light pollution and its effects on behaviour and settlement, along with the need for greater understanding of Tawny Owl activity budgets, which would aid the interpretation of survey results. © 2022 British Trust for Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: When adducing temporal relationship, we can either adopt the perspective of conceiving ourselves as moving toward the future (called Moving Ego perspective), or we can adopt the perspective of the future time coming toward us (called Moving Time perspective). Previous research has shown that the adoption of these two types of temporal perspectives is highly flexible, influenced by a complex of factors. However, it remains largely unknown whether chronotype, characterized by one’s tendency to conduct activities and sleep at a particular time during the day-night cycle, is correlated to metaphorical perspectives of time. Some evidence suggests a possible link between procrastination and the Moving Ego perspective. An additional line of research has shown that the evening chronotype is significantly associated with procrastination. Integrating these various lines of research led us to hypothesize that having a preference for eveningness may predispose a person toward adopting the ego-moving perspective. We tested this hypothesis and found robust support for this association in an online sample of Chinese speakers (N = 284). We found that participants who favor the ego-moving representation exhibited a high level of eveningness. This work suggests that individual differences in circadian preference play a unique role in the resolution of temporal ambiguity. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

ABSTRACT: Studies related to morpho-physiology improve the understanding of biological mechanisms in non-human primates (NHP), contributing to research in several areas, especially those of assisted reproduction and biomedicine. The genera Aotus and Sapajus are important considerations in conducting studies related to reproductive biology and biomedical research, where animals of these genera can serve as models for species with vulnerable conservation status. The reproductive functions of animals of these genera can be used in conducting studies with other NHP species, for which biological material is difficult to access. The aim in conducting the current review was to compile the scientific literature on the biology and reproductive aspects of these two genera, to provide a for a greater understanding of these topics. In addition, a systematic review of literature allows for efficient access relevant information from an extended timeframe collated in a single document. There was, therefore, a systematic search for keywords based on reproductive studies with animals in these genera conducted, and 58 articles, 12 books, and three academic theses were subsequently selected. Even though there have been advances in knowledge of the reproductive biology of animals from these genera that have occurred in recent decades, especially research conducted when these NHP were in captivity, a wide variety of areas remain to be studied so that the understanding of reproduction in these NHP can be enhanced and the knowledge gained from these studies utilized for greater understanding of reproduction of NHP in general. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Aim: Land use change, climate change, and shifts to disturbance regimes make successful wildlife management challenging, particularly when ongoing urbanization constrains habitat and movement. Preserving and maintaining landscape connectivity is a potential strategy to support wildlife responding to these stressors. Using a novel model framework, we determined the population-level benefit of a set of identified potential corridors for spotted owl population viability. Location: Southern California, United States. Methods: Combining habitat suitability and dynamic metapopulation models, we compared the benefit of corridors to the Southern California spotted owl population, measured as the increase in the expected minimum abundance, both now and under a future climate. Our approach considered key corridor characteristics important to conservation decisions, namely corridor irreplaceability and local population network benefit. Results: We identified two corridors likely to increase Southern California spotted owl expected minimum abundance under current climate conditions. At the regional scale, of the 27 corridors evaluated, one corridor was irreplaceable (i.e., no other corridors in the network could provide a similar increase in abundance when the irreplaceable corridor was removed) and one corridor was identified as redundant (i.e., remaining corridors in the network can provide some of the increases in abundance offered by the removed corridor). Both putative corridors connected two large, populous and similarly sized patches. Additionally, we identified two more corridors at the local scale. We found that, under climate change, population declines may limit the benefit of connectivity for a range-restricted species like the spotted owl. Main conclusions: Our analytical approach highlights important criteria for corridor identification and prioritization, namely irreplaceability versus redundancy, local versus regional benefit, and corridor impact in a changing landscape. With the capability of incorporating estimated functional connectivity into population dynamics, our modelling framework advances connectivity decision-making for other species of conservation concern and archetypal taxa within ecological communities. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Bird nests are specialized habitats because of their particular composition including nest detritus and bird droppings. In consequence, they attract a specialized arthropod community considered as nidicolous, which includes species only found in bird nests (strictly nidicolous) or sometimes found in bird nests (facultatively nidicolous). Because the factors influencing the entomofauna in bird nests are poorly understood, in autumn 2019, we collected nest material in 86 Barn Owl (Tyto alba) nest boxes. We investigated whether the invertebrate species richness was related to Barn Owl nest box occupancy, the density of available nest boxes and the landscape structure. We found 3,321 nidicolous beetle specimens belonging to 24 species. Species richness of strictly nidicolous beetles was 2.7 times higher in nest boxes occupied by a family of Barn Owls the previous spring compared to unoccupied nest boxes. It was also higher in sites that were more often occupied by Barn Owls in the five previous years and in areas surrounded by a higher proportion of crop fields. For facultatively nidicolous beetles, the density of Barn Owl nest boxes enhanced the species richness. In conclusion, our study suggests that the strictly nidicolous beetles benefit from occupied nest boxes of Barn Owls, whereas facultatively nidicolous beetles look for nest boxes independently of whether Barn Owls occupy them. Our study highlights the importance of bird nests for a suite of invertebrates. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Landscape composition can strongly affect the delivery of ecosystem services in agroecosystems. Conserving uncultivated habitats can support ecosystem services, but in Mediterranean biomes, these lands can also increase the area susceptible to wildfires. In the world-renowned wine-producing region of Napa Valley, California, wine grape growers install nest boxes to attract American barn owls (Tyto furcata), which may reduce rodent crop damage. Annual monitoring of 273 nest boxes began in 2015, and devastating wildfires burned approximately 60,000 ha in the region in 2017, including homes and businesses, as well as some vineyards and uncultivated land. The goal of this study was to determine whether changes in nest box occupancy were attributed to wildfires, nest box design, land cover type, or some combination of these variables. Occupancy surveys before and after these wildfires revealed changes in habitat selection at the nest scale. Occupancy increased during the study, reaching its highest point after the fires. Owls were found breeding in recently burned areas that were previously unoccupied and modeling results showed that nest box occupancy had a positive relationship with burned areas, particularly with edges of the fire perimeter. Barn owls also consistently showed a strong preference for taller nest boxes that were surrounded by more grassland than other land cover types and a moderate selection for wooden over plastic boxes. These results illustrate an incentive for the conservation of uncultivated habitat, particularly grassland, in vineyard ecosystems, and they provide an example of a mobile pest predator’s response to wildfire disturbance. In this case, results suggest an agroecosystem service made resilient to wildfire by the owls’ selection of burned and uncultivated habitats. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Aim: The eco-geographical Bergmann's rule predicts that animals have smaller body size in warmer regions than in cold environments because of thermoregulatory reasons. Although this rule has been widely investigated, intraspecific analyses on cosmopolitan taxa are rare. We examined whether geographical variation in wing length, a proxy of body size, shows a Bergmannian pattern and can be explained by three mechanisms known to affect animal body size (heat conservation, resource availability and starvation resistance) in seven species of nocturnal raptors of the genus Tyto. Location: World. Taxon: Genus Tyto. Methods: We measured wing length of 9,033 museum specimens covering the entire distributional range of each species and linked it with geographical (absolute latitude, elevation) and climatic predictors associated with heat conservation, resource availability and starvation resistance hypotheses of spatial variation in body size. Results: All the species show a trend of increasing wing length with increasing latitude and/or elevation, and in five of them either or both geographical predictors are statistically significant. In all the species showing a Bergmannian pattern, wing length significantly decreases with temperature, thus supporting the heat conservation hypothesis. Conversely, we found less generalized support for the other hypotheses, although in some species significant trends between wing length and proxies of climatic seasonality and/or primary productivity emerged. Main conclusions: Consistent clines in body shrinking in warm environments are observed in species living in different continents at different latitudinal and temperature ranges, as well as exploiting different habitats. These findings thus support the hypothesis that body size is, at least partly, selected for heat maintenance depending on the thermal environment, even in nocturnal species which are not directly exposed to solar radiation. However, different selective pressures may also have concomitantly acted to promote body size evolution in this bird group. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

ABSTRACT: Sampling bias and autocorrelation can lead to erroneous estimates of habitat selection, model overfitting and elevated omission rates. We developed a multi-scale habitat suitability model of the flammulated owl (Psiloscops flammeolus) in the Northern Rocky Mountains based on extensive but spatially clustered survey data, and then used simulations to evaluate the effects of spatially non-representative and spatially representative sampling strategies on model performance and predictions. Our hypothesis was that models trained with spatially non-representative simulated datasets would suffer from bias in parameter estimates, and would show lower predictive performance. The models trained with the spatially representative simulated datasets greatly outperformed the models trained with the spatially non-representative simulated datasets judged on standard metrics of model performance. However, the spatially non-representative models produced superior predictions based on their ability to identify the correct spatial scales, covariates, signs and magnitudes of the species-environment relationships, when compared to the spatially representative models. Thus, it is likely that representative spatial sampling across a broad range of environmental gradients also resulted in over-dispersion of sampling data, with a higher proportion of samples falling in areas of low probability of presence, leading to lower ability to resolve the relationships between species presence-absence and environmental covariates. In contrast, the spatially non-representative sampling, by concentrating sampling along environmental gradients that are characterized by higher probability of presence of the modelled species, produced predictions that, while seeming to be weaker based on standard measures of model performance (e.g., AUC, Kappa, PCC), greatly outperformed the spatially representative models based on measures of true model prediction (e.g., correctly describing the actual spatial scales, direction and strength of species-environment relationships). Further work using simulation approaches is warranted to more fully evaluate the ability of species distribution modelling techniques to correctly identify scales, driving covariates, signs and magnitudes of relationships between species presence-absence patterns, and environmental covariates. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Adsorption kinetics of myoglobin on silica was investigated using the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and the optical waveguide light-mode spectroscopy (OWLS). Measurements were carried out for the NaCl concentration of 0.01 M and 0.15 M. A quantitative analysis of the kinetic adsorption and desorption runs acquired from QCM enabled the maximum coverage of irreversibly bound myoglobin molecules to be determined. At a pH of 3.5–4 this was equal to 0.60 mg m−2 and 1.3 mg m−2 for a NaCl concentration of 0.01 M and 0.15 M, respectively, which agrees with the OWLS measurements. The latter value corresponds to the closely packed monolayer of molecules predicted from the random sequential adsorption approach. The fraction of reversibly bound protein molecules and their biding energy were also determined. It is observed that at larger pHs, the myoglobin adsorption kinetics was much slower. This behavior was attributed to the vanishing net charge that decreased the binding energy of molecules with the substrate. Beside significance to basic science, these results enabled us to develop a procedure for preparing myoglobin layers at silica substrates of well-controlled coverage that can be used for biosensing purposes. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Large-scale molecular phylogenetic studies of the avian order Strigiformes have been performed, and numerous mitochondrial genomes have been determined. However, their intergeneric relationships are still controversial, and few comprehensive comparative analyses of mitochondrial genomes have been conducted on Strigiformes. In this study, the mitochondrial genome of Otus lettia was determined and compared with other Strigiformes. The O. lettia mitochondrial genome was 16,951 bp in size. For Strigiformes, atp8 can be used as a suitable molecular marker for population genetic diversity, while cox1 is a candidate barcoding marker for species identification. All protein-coding genes may be under strong purifying selection pressure, and one extra cytosine insertion located in nad3 is common to all owls except Tyto longimembris, T. alba, and Athene noctua. Four different mitochondrial gene arrangement types were found among the Strigiformes mitogenomes, and their evolutionary relationship between each other can be perfectly explained by the tandem duplication and random loss model. The phylogenetic topologies using the mitochondrial genomes showed that target species O. lettia had a closer relationship with O. scops + O. sunia than O. bakkamoena, the genus Glaucidium was paraphyletic, and the Ninox clade was located at the basal position of Strigidae lineage. Our phylogenetic trees also supported the previous recommendations that Sceloglaux albifacies, Ciccaba nigrolineata, and Ketupa flavipes should be transferred to Ninox, Strix, and Bubo, respectively. These findings will be helpful in further unraveling the mitochondrial evolution and phylogeny of Strigiformes. © 2021 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Owls play important cultural, ecological, and indicator roles throughout the world. Yet owls’ cryptic behavior has led to uncertainties about their basic ecology, including foraging, communication, and functional roles within the community, and potentially hindered the implementation of effective conservation measures. Here we demonstrate the potential for next-generation GPS tags capable of recording high-precision, minute-by-minute locations paired with other technologies to resolve some of these uncertainties. We combined high-precision GPS tagging data with infrared (IR) video recorded by arboreally-mounted cameras at 5 spotted owl (Strix occidentalis) nest sites in the Sierra Nevada, USA to provide a uniquely detailed examination of owl foraging patterns. Our approach allowed us to identify the precise time and location of 54 predation events and prey identity. We also used high-precision GPS tags with on-board audio recorders to map the vocal activity of 8 individuals by matching the time of vocalizations in the audio data to GPS locations recorded at one-minute intervals. The combined spatial and acoustic data revealed that nonbreeding males had the most widespread territorial vocal activity (i.e., producing 4-note territorial calls), while females provisioning fledglings displayed extensive nonterritorial vocal activity (i.e., producing many contact calls). Thus, the GPS-tag technologies we employed can provide opportunities to better understand owl foraging, communication, territoriality, and population dynamics. The methods we describe are time- and resource-intensive but can be paired with techniques that are more applicable at landscape scales, such as stable isotope analyses, LiDAR-based habitat analyses, and passive acoustic monitoring to link local processes to broad-scale ecological patterns. Therefore, our approach could be applied to many species whose behavior inhibits direct observation. © 2021 The Wildlife Society. © 2021 The Wildlife Society

ABSTRACT: The collared owlet (Glaucidium brodiei), spotted owlet (Athene brama) and eurasian eagle owl (Bubo bubo) are different sized avian predators coexisting in the Wildlife Park Lohi Bher, Rawalpindi district of the Punjab province of Pakistan. These crepuscular and nocturnal owls are the least studied group of birds in northern regions. In this study, we compared seasonal differences in the diet of three owl species in an uncultivated area with rapid urbanization all around to better understand their ecological significance. Regurgitated pellets of three owl species (n = 434) were collected seasonally from the study area. The food of the spotted owlet and eurasian eagle owl was found significantly different (P< 0.05) across seasons whereas no seasonal differences were seen in collared owlet's prey resources. Insects of four orders dominated in the diet of collared owlet (50 %) and spotted owlet (56.62 %) whereas the major portion of the food of eurasian eagle owl was obtained from mammals (75.93 %) in numerical terms. Among mammals, house mouse Mus musculus, Asian house shrew Suncus murinus, short-tailed bandicoot rat Nesokia indica and Indian gerbil Tatera indica were the prominent food sources. Food niche breadth of the eurasian eagle owl was larger as compared to the other two owlet species. Index of relative importance (IRI) values highlighted rodents as staples in the three owls' diets in contrast to conventional proportional representations. An inverse relationship between the body size of owls and preys suggested prey selection might be associated with ecological dynamics in prey populations.  © 2021 Zoological Society of Pakistan.

ABSTRACT: Telomere erosion has been proposed to be tightly associated with senescence, environmental stressors and life history trade-offs. How telomere dynamics vary across life stages and especially in relation to (heritable) phenotypic traits is still unclear. The tawny owl Strix aluco display a highly heritable melanin-based colour polymorphism, a grey and a brown morph, linked to several fitness traits including morph-specific telomere dynamics. As adults, brown tawny owls have shorter relative telomere length (RTL) and exhibit faster telomere shortening rate than grey owls. Here we test if these morph-specific telomere dynamics emerge already during growth, or if they are induced only in adult life through differential physiological costs associated with the life history of the morphs. We analysed RTL from 287 tawny owl offspring and 81 first breeding adults to evaluate at what life stage morph-specific patterns emerge. We found no differences in RTL between the two morphs during the nestling period nor at the first breeding attempt. Sex, brood size or size rank in the nest did not affect offspring RTL. Among first-breeders, females had shorter telomeres than males suggesting a sampling-time dependent difference in reproductive costs between sexes, due to the prominent sex roles in tawny owls in the early nestling period. The probability to return to breed after the first breeding attempt was not affected by RTL, sex or colour morph. The lack of morph-specific difference in RTL among nestlings and first breeders suggests that previously observed morph-specific differences in RTL dynamics in adults emerge at the onset of the breeding career and is likely due to different physiological profiles and life-history strategies adopted by adults. We conclude that different telomere dynamics and senescence patterns among highly heritable phenotypes (colour morphs) are likely to be a result of differential costs of reproduction and self-maintenance. © 2020 Nordic Society Oikos.

ABSTRACT: Rescued wild birds can provide useful information regarding the identity of individuals, as well as the causes of any injuries. We examined one Ural Owl Strix uralensis (Strigidae) rescued in Kusatsu City, Shiga Prefecture, in April 2020. Macroscopic examination of the owl’s beak and claws revealed that the owl had been previously managed. From evidence obtained from mtDNA of three, six and two individuals from Hokkaido, Honshu, and Kyushu, Japan, respectively, and that in databases, the individual was identified as subspecies originating from Honshu or Kyushu. © 2021, Yamashina Institute for Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: Bird vocal activity is affected by endogenous and exogenous factors. Owl surveys are mainly based on the detection of nocturnal calls, and therefore, the impact of exogenous factors on owls’ vocal activity may have consequences in conservation planning and behavioural studies. However, our current knowledge about the impact of climatic factors and the moon phase on owl calling behaviour is very limited, especially in the Neotropics. We used autonomous recording units to evaluate the effect of air temperature, rainfall, relative air humidity, and percent of the moon illuminated on the vocal occurrence (active/inactive) of the Ferruginous pygmy-owl (Glaucidium brasilianum) over three consecutive moon cycles in the Brazilian Pantanal. Vocal activity was positively associated with the percent of the moon illuminated, with 75% of the nights on which the species was vocally active having a moon illumination percentage higher than 77%. The vocal activity of the species was negatively associated with the nocturnal air temperature, with more vocal activity observed on cooler nights. Relative air humidity and daily rainfall were not associated with the vocal activity of the Ferruginous pygmy-owl. Our study improves the knowledge about the impact of exogenous factors on the calling behaviour of Neotropical owls. We conclude that future surveys aiming to detect the Ferruginous pygmy-owl should be carried out on nights with a high percent of moon illumination (>75%) and nights with low average temperature (< 18 °C). © 2020 Dipartimento di Biologia, Università di Firenze, Italia.

ABSTRACT: Synthetic pesticides from agriculture pose threats to biodiversity, and the adoption of alternative pest management is vital to meet rising crop demands while protecting native species. For example, the use of nest boxes for barn owls (Tyto furcata and T. alba) may help control rodent pests and reduce the use of rodenticides. However, the environmental perceptions of farmers and how receptive they are to alternative pest management practices remains uncertain. Traditionally, agricultural policies and programs have focused largely on the economic self-interest of farmers, but these narrow approaches have proven insufficient to describe and predict conservation behaviors, and the study of environmental value orientations (EVOs) may better explain farmers’ adoption of novel wildlife-friendly practices. The study of EVOs can help identify people as “mutualists”, meaning those who value the environment for its own sake, and “utilitarians,” meaning those who value the environment for the services it can provide. We surveyed 71 California winegrape growers in order to better understand how their underlying environmental values relate to the use of barn owl boxes and other sustainable practices. Overall, most winegrape growers had mutualist value orientations (64%). However, there was a disconnect between the use of barn owl boxes and EVOs, with most respondents (80%) reporting the use of owl boxes regardless of underlying values. This opens the door for future research to examine whether this is true of other wildlife-friendly farming practices. © 2021 Dept. of Fish and Game. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: In mixed-conifer forests inhabited by California spotted owls, land managers hypothesize that without human intervention natural conifer regeneration will take many decades or longer to begin within interior areas of large high-severity fire patches, due to long distances from live tree seed sources. As a result, widespread post-fire logging, followed by sprayed application of herbicides and planting of conifer seedlings, are used to create tree plantations. These are activities routinely conducted in spotted owl territories following fires, despite current data that indicate this approach has adverse impacts on spotted owl occupancy. Land managers acknowledge such impacts, but continue these forest management practices, assuming they are a necessary harm, one that is warranted to ensure the later return of mature conifer forests used by spotted owls for nesting and roosting. However, few data have been gathered to test this hypothesis. At 5 years post-fire, we surveyed field plots on a grid within large high-severity fire patches in spotted owl habitat within the Rim fire of 2013 in the Sierra Nevada, California. In our analysis the percentage of plots lacking conifer regeneration decreased significantly with larger plot sizes, a finding contrary to previous studies which assumed vast “deforested” areas in wildland fires, a bias created by small plot size. We found higher conifer regeneration closer to live-tree edges, but we consistently found natural post-fire conifer regeneration at all distances into interior spaces of large high-severity fire patches, including >300 m from the nearest live trees. Distance from live-tree edges did not affect pine dominance in post-fire regeneration. The post-fire natural conifer regeneration reported in our results suggests that the adverse effects of current post-fire management in spotted owl habitat are not necessary practices that can be justified. © Copyright © 2021 Hanson and Chi.

ABSTRACT: Understanding people’s perceptions and knowledge about birds in an endemic bird area is a prerequisite for bird conservation. This is more so in the case of non-charismatic birds such as owls. In this context, we conducted a questionnaire survey about owls in the North Andaman Island between January 2016 and 2018. We interviewed 203 respondents from six market places in North Andaman tehsil, and collected data on their socio-economic status as well as their knowledge on owls. Although all the respondents were familiar with owls, only 9% of them identified all species of owls in the Andaman Islands. Around 98% of respondents were aware of owl diets, either partly or wholly. We found several superstitious beliefs revolving around owls. Two species, Otus sunia and Ninox obscura were associated with negative beliefs while Tyto deroepstorffi was associated with positive beliefs. Generalized linear model with the demographical predictors showed that positive attitudes towards owls is associated with age (older), education (literacy), revenue villages and temporary houses. We conclude that Tyto deroepstorffi had the highest positive values among islanders and hence, may be considered as a focal species to create awareness about owls and to protect other endemic owls of the Andaman Islands. Awareness programmes targeting younger, illiterate people, and land encroachers may help in conservation of cryptic owl species of Andaman. © 2021. Sureshmarimuthu et al.

ABSTRACT: Western Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia hypugaea; hereafter, Burrowing Owls) were once widespread residents of grasslands throughout western North America, but their range has contracted, and abundance has declined in some regions. The causes of declines and geographic variation in population trends of Burrowing Owls are unclear but may be linked to changing land use and urbanization. Burrowing Owls are often found in association with airfields and airports, and their presence at such facilities is sometimes considered to be in conflict with those operations. Documenting the long-term persistence of Burrowing Owls at active airfields can help airfield managers who face decisions regarding compatibility of owls and airfield operations. We report the results of a long-term effort to monitor Burrowing Owls on Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico, USA, including the rapid recovery of Burrowing Owl numbers from near-extirpation and the relationships between abundance and other demographic traits. The number of breeding pairs of Burrowing Owls increased from one pair in 2013 to 28 pairs in 2019 and 2020, and the number of fledglings produced increased from one in 2013 to 84 in 2019 and 61 in 2020. The recovery was not uniform across all areas of Kirtland Air Force Base, and some formerly occupied areas remained unoccupied. We documented dispersal outside the Air Force base boundary and that the number of breeding pairs was more strongly influenced by the number of offspring produced in the prior year than the number of owls returning from prior years, which indicated that the population is part of a larger meta-population. Our results demonstrate that the maintenance of Burrowing Owl populations is not necessarily at odds with safe airfield operations, that Burrowing Owls exhibit complex population dynamics, and can rapidly recolonize previously occupied areas if habitat and nest sites remain suitable. © 2021 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Tynskya eocaena is an early Eocene bird with a raptor-like skull and semi-zygodactyl feet, whose description is based on a skeleton from the North American Green River Formation. In the present study, three-dimensionally preserved bones of a new species of Tynskya, T. waltonensis, are reported from the London Clay of Walton-on-the-Naze (Essex, UK). The fossils belong to a single individual and provide new insights into the skeletal morphology of messelasturids. In particular, they reveal unusual vertebral specializations, with the cervical vertebrae having concave rather than saddle-shaped caudal articulation facets and the caudalmost thoracic vertebra being platycoelous (flat articular surfaces). The very deep mandible and a derived morphology of the ungual phalanges support a sister group relationship between Tynskya and the taxon Messelastur (Messelasturidae). Phylogenetic analyses of an emended data matrix did not conclusively resolve the higher-level affinities of messelasturids and the closely related halcyornithids, with both taxa sharing derived characters with only distantly related extant taxa (Accipitriformes, Strigiformes, Falconiformes, and Psittaciformes). An analysis that was constrained to a molecular scaffold, however, recovered messelasturids as the sister taxon of a clade including psittaciform and passeriform birds. The derived morphologies of the mandible and cervical vertebrae suggest specialized feeding adaptations of Tynskya, and messelasturids may have exploited a feeding niche, which is no longer available to extant birds. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Capsule: Radio-tracking of 19 juvenile Barn Owls Tyto alba alba in England revealed different spatial patterns for males and females, that tree branches were frequent roost sites, and that altitudinal distribution changed after owls acquired home ranges. Aims: To gain new understanding of the natal dispersal of Barn Owls by identifying roost sites and analysing their spatial pattern, site type, altitude, and location in relation to linear features. Methods: Diurnal roost sites of 19 juvenile Barn Owls were located by radio-tracking in southwest England. We evaluated the possibility of sex-bias in natal and between-roost dispersal distances and tested for change in the site types used as natal sites and daytime roosts. We tested for differences in the altitude of roosts used during the dispersal phase and those used once the birds acquired a home range, and we analysed the location of roost sites in relation to major roads, railways, and rivers. Results: Barn Owls commenced dispersal when they were between 63 and 122 days after hatching (median = 94). Roost sites used by females were more widely scattered than those used by males. Owls roosted most frequently in trees, despite most natal sites being in buildings. The altitude of roost sites during dispersal in elevated landscapes was higher than those on their acquired home range. We could find no evidence that owls followed linear features during dispersal, nor that hills were barriers to dispersal. Conclusion: Post-fledging roosting behaviour of female and male Barn Owls differed spatially and was congruent with a wider pattern of sex-bias in avian natal dispersal. Frequent roosting on tree branches had implications for exposure to adverse weather. Some juveniles roosted at altitudes that were higher than subsequent roosts on their acquired home range. We found no evidence to support the proposal that linear landscape features constituted dispersal corridors. © 2022 British Trust for Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: This study reports on findings about the natural history of the Cloud-forest Pygmy-Owl (Glaucidium nubicola). Recently described as a species, the general ecology of the Cloud-forest Pygmy-Owl remains poorly documented. Three banded individuals at a private reserve in the province of Pichincha, Ecuador, are used to describe its habitat use, diet items, and individual longevity. Our observations suggest this local population prefers wet primary cloud forest and appears to have a generalist diet. Multiple recaptures of a banded individual indicate a longevity record of 5 years. Additionally, ectoparasites were found on 2 out of 3 captured individuals. © 2021 Wilson Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: This study reports on a fatal case of a captive great grey owl infected with the West Nile virus (WNV) in the zoological garden Košice, eastern Slovakia (Central Europe). The tissue samples of the dead owl were used for virus isolation and genetic characterization. The novel isolate is genetically closer to Hungarian, Greek, and Bulgarian strains from the central/southern European clade of lineage 2 than to the strains previously isolated in Slovakia. Interestingly, it carries NS3-249P, a molecular virulence determinant associated with higher neurovirulence, which has not previously been observed in Slovakia. Subsequent serological investigation of the captive owls revealed additional seropositive animals, indicating local WNV transmission. Although no WNV-positive mosquitoes were found, the presence of the WNV principal vector Culex pipiens complex together with the described fatal case and further serological findings indicate an endemic focus of bird-neurovirulent WNV variant in the area. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The short-eared owl (Asio flammeus) is essantially a migrant species that overwinters in Turkey in small numbers. A limited number of studies exist investigating the short-eared owls’ diet, because it is difficult to determine their roosting areas and locate their pellets within the field. The pellet analysis of owls is one of the most prominently employed methods used to determine owl feeding strategies, and pellet analysis is important in the conservation studies of the short-eared owl. The present study is the first research investigating the diet of short-eared owl in Thrace. Our team gathered 153 pellets belonging to 308 prey items: 4 genus from Rodentia (Mammalia - Microtus sp, Mus sp, Crecitulus sp, Apodemus sp), 1 genus from Eulipotyphla (Mammalia - Crocidura sp) and 1 bird species from Passeriformes (Aves, Alauda arvensis) were identified within the pellets. Short-eared owls preferred in the majority of cases investigated small mammals (95%) in their diets, in particular Microtus sp (50%) and Mus sp (34%). Our team concluded that the Microtus and Mus genera occurred most commonly as the species in the study area. Various other small mammals identified in the pellets were comprised of Apodemus sp, Mus sp and Crocidura sp (11%), and a marginal number of birds (5%) were in addition found within the short-eared owl's diet. Short-eared owls, which display the characteristic behavior of an opportunistic predator, can shift their food habits with ease. However, our team found that a limited number of mammalian taxa comprised the short-eared owls’ diet, and because the owl’s diet consists mainly of rodents, the short-eared owl remains an important predator for agricultural fields and grasslands.

ABSTRACT: Objective: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of unilateral topical application of rocuronium bromide in scops owls. Animals studied: Ten healthy adult scops owls. Procedures: Birds weighting between 82-111 g were enrolled. Complete physical and ophthalmic examinations were performed. Each animal received a single dose of 0.15 mg of rocuronium bromide (30 µL) in a randomly selected eye. Static pupillometric evaluations were performed before and after drug instillation at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes, in a room with fixed light intensity. Physical and ophthalmic examinations were carried out to evaluate possible adverse effects. Results: Median pupil (95% CI) size at t0 was 7.10 mm (5.51-7.41) for placebo eyes and 7.22 mm (6.93-7.48) for treated eyes, showing no statistical differences (P >.05). When compared to the placebo eye, significant mydriasis was achieved at t30 [8.18 mm (7.22-9.00)] (P =.014) and lasting until t90 [7.35 mm (6.20-9.52)] (P =.004). Maximal mydriasis was obtained at t60 [8.63 mm (7.72-9.81)] (P =.001). During this period, the treated eye no longer responded to direct light stimulation. Complete mydriasis was observed in 5/10 birds (mean weight 97.4 g). Pupil size at t90 and t120 did not differ from baseline (P >.05) in treated eyes. No adverse effects were seen during the study period. Conclusion: Single-dose topical rocuronium bromide (0.15 mg) is a safe and effective medium duration mydriatic agent in scops owls. Further studies are needed to evaluate bilateral topical application and standardize the mydriatic protocol. © 2021 American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists

ABSTRACT: Both daily and seasonal year-round vocalizations of the Long-eared owl (Asio otus) (Linnaeus, 1758) were recorded in the Middle Volga River region, Russia with the use of digital dictophones. Voice recorders were installed in the daytime for up to 5 days. The maximum duration of continuous operation of voice recorders was about 140 hours. By the time the previous recording was finished, we would arrive and move the recorder to a different location. The Long-eared owl can be classified as a moderately vocalizing bird, with calls recorded during 3 spring months. Peak activity is associated with pre-incubation and incubation periods. In the spring months, calls of the Long-eared owl were recorded from 16.37 h to 03.43 h. In the spring, the Long-eared owl began to cry before sunset (from 1 hour 30 minutes to 3 hours 15 minutes) and after sunset (from 56 minutes to 3 hours 39 minutes). Vocalization started after sunset for an average of 50 minutes. Vocalization always ended before dawn (to 1 h 21 min). Statistically significant differences in the duration of vespers and morning vocalizations were obtained with the use Mann-Whitney U test (Z =-3.08; p < 0.05). © 2021, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

ABSTRACT: Strix huhula Daudin, 1800 is widely distributed species of owl in the Neotropical region. However, this species is considered rare in nature due to its dependence on forested habitat and low adaptive capacity to survive in anthropo-genic environments. There are scattered records throughout Brazil. Here, we provide the first record of S. huhula in a savanna–dry forest ecotone in Piauí state. This expands the geographic distribution of S. huhula to northeastern Brazil. © The authors.

ABSTRACT: The Spotted Owl is a rare and declining raptor inhabiting low/middle-elevation forests of the Pacific Northwest, California, and the Southwest in the USA. It is well established that Spotted Owls select dense, mature, or old forests for nesting and roosting. High-severity fire transforms such forests into a unique forest type known as “snag forest habitat”, which the owls select for foraging. This habitat is disproportionately targeted by post-fire logging projects. Numerous recent articles have explored the influence of high-severity fire and post-fire logging on this species. Studies have shown that post-fire logging significantly reduces Spotted Owl occupancy, but efforts have generally not been made to disentangle the effects of such logging from the influence of high-severity fire alone on Spotted Owls. We conducted an assessment of published, peer-reviewed articles reporting adverse impacts of high-severity fire on Spotted Owls, exploring the extent to which there may have been confounding factors, such as post-fire logging. We found that articles reporting adverse impacts of high-severity fire on Spotted Owls were pervasively confounded by post-fire logging, and in some cases by a methodological bias. Our results indicate a need to approach analyses of high-severity fire and Spotted Owls differently in future research. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Nest boxes are commonly used for species that utilize tree cavities, including small owls. Boxes were installed in 2011 to facilitate study of Northern Saw-whet Owls in Pennsylvania. We checked the 11 boxes that remained in 2020 after a hiatus of 8 years and found 3 rodent nests, but no evidence of owl usage. Playbacks revealed owls were present at 8 of 11 boxes checked. Cavity surveys yielded an average of 7.7 large cavities within 50 m of each box; extrapolation of cavity densities to a minimal territory size of 150 ha suggested that suitable cavities are an abundant, non-limiting resource here. Cavity abundance was likely a consequence of beech bark disease complex having recently top-killed most large American Beech trees locally, providing abundant resources for excavating woodpeckers. Assessing cavity abundance should be an essential first step for any management project involving cavity-nesting birds, and nest boxes should be used only in situations where cavities appear to be limited. © 2021 Humboldt Field Research Institute.

ABSTRACT: In this study, a novel parvovirus (gyb-MR02/2015/HUN, MT580795) was detected in barn owls (Tyto alba) and genetically characterized using viral metagenomics and PCR methods. The NS1 and VP1 proteins of gyb-MR02/2015/HUN share only 45.4% and 50.1% amino acid sequence identity, respectively, to the corresponding proteins of peafowl parvovirus 2 (MK988620), the closest relative. Out of 11 faecal specimens from owls (six from little owls, three from barn owls, and two from long-eared owls), two barn owl samples were positive for the novel parvovirus, which is distantly related to members of the recently established genus Chaphamaparvovirus in the subfamily Hamaparvovirinae. Systematic investigation is necessary to explore the diversity of parvoviruses. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Large-scale conversion of uncultivated land to agriculture threatens wildlife and can diminish ecosystem services provided by nature. Understanding how wildlife provision ecosystem services may incentivize wildlife conservation in agricultural landscapes. Attracting Barn Owls (Tyto furcata) to nest on farms for pest management has been implemented worldwide but has not been evaluated in vineyard agroecosystems. Napa Valley, California, is a renowned winegrape growing region, and viticulturists encourage Barn Owl occupancy to help minimize damage from Botta's pocket gophers (Thomomys bottae) and voles (Microtus spp.). This study modeled the use of habitats in space and time by hunting Barn Owls, providing information about their potential to provide the critical ecosystem service of pest consumption. We used global positioning system tags to track hunting owls and used a resource selection function to compare used and available habitats. We constructed the intensity of use and home range-movement maps using a time local convex hull analysis from location data. We found that Barn Owls selected uncultivated habitats when hunting, some of which were relatively rare on the landscape. Approximately, one-third of Barn Owl hunting locations occurred in vineyards, but this use was out of proportion to the availability of vineyards, which comprised 50% of the area around nest boxes. The owls' use of vineyards increased with decreasing amount of selected uncultivated habitat in the landscape. However, as reported by a previous study, the occupancy of nest boxes in vineyards increases with uncultivated habitats nearby. Future research should model landscape composition to determine the amount of preferred habitat necessary to support occupancy as well as hunting in vineyards. A true test of pest management by Barn Owls awaits experimentation coupled with monitoring rodent populations. ©  Copyright © American Ornithological Society 2021. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Hen Harrier Circus cyaneus and Short-eared Owl Asio flammeus are open-country birds of prey with overlapping distributions. Although both species face similar conservation threats across their ranges, work to date has largely been undertaken at a national scale with few attempts to collate and assess factors relevant to their conservation at an international scale. Here we use an expert knowledge approach to evaluate the impact of conservation threats and the effectiveness of conservation strategies for each species across Europe. We report results of responses to a questionnaire from 23 Hen Harrier experts from nine countries and 12 Short-eared Owl experts from six countries. The majority of responses for both species reported declines in breeding numbers. The perceived impact of threats was broadly similar for both species: ecological factors (predation, extreme weather and prey availability), changes in land use (habitat loss and agricultural intensification) and indirect persecution (accidental nest destruction) were considered to be the greatest threats to breeding Hen Harrier and Short-eared Owl. Short-eared Owl experts also highlighted lack of knowledge and difficulties associated with monitoring as a major conservation challenge. Despite broad-scale similarities, geographical variation was also apparent in the perceived importance of conservation threats, with some threats (such as direct persecution, large-scale afforestation or habitat degradation) requiring country-specific actions. Implementation of different conservation strategies also varied between countries, with the designation of protected areas reported as the most widespread conservation strategy adopted, followed by species and habitat management. However, protected areas (including species-specific protected areas) were perceived to be less effective than active management of species and habitats. These findings highlight the overlap between the conservation requirements of these two species, and the need for collaborative international research and conservation approaches that prioritise pro-active conservation strategies subject to continued assessment and with specific conservation goals. © 2021 Cambridge University Press.

ABSTRACT: Audio playback of vocalizations by conspecifics is commonly used to elicit calls when surveying birds of prey. Methods for call surveys vary widely in their use of silent listening periods, and usually range from 3-15 min in length. We aimed to refine this approach for detecting Great Horned Owls (Bubo virginianus) in Arctic Alaska, which is the northernmost limit of their breeding range. We used two playback protocols: protocol 1 entailed uninterrupted playback, whereas protocol 2 interspersed silent listening periods with playback during 12-min surveys. In playback surveys consisting of 166 point counts during the 2017 and 2018 breeding seasons, the probability of detecting a Great Horned Owl was 0.46 (95% CI ¼ 60.09) with protocol 1 and 0.35 (95% CI ¼ 60.12) with protocol 2 (P ¼ 0.18). The probability of detection rose with the length of the playback: of all owls detected during the 12-min surveys, 23% (95% CI ¼ 66.4%) responded within the first 3 min, 52 6 7.6% within the first 6 min, and 80 6 6.1% within 9 min. Including silent listening periods was not necessary for detecting Great Horned Owls during call surveys. We found no correlation between probability of detection and either cloud cover or wind speed (P ¼ 0.60 and P ¼ 0.28, respectively). However, we found a negative correlation between temperature and probability of detection (P ¼ 0.02). From these surveys, we calculated the density of Great Horned Owls in the Middle Fork Koyukuk Valley, Alaska (approximately 67.589°N, 149.789°W) was 4.2 6 2.6 owls/km2 during the winters of 2017 and 2018, which represents the first estimate of density at the northern breeding limit of the species.  © 2021 Ornithological Societies of North America.

ABSTRACT: Spotted owls (SOs, Strix occidentalis) are a flagship species inhabiting old-growth forests in western North America. In recent decades, their populations have declined due to ongoing reductions in suitable habitat caused by logging, wildfires, and competition with the congeneric barred owl (BO, Strix varia). The northern spotted owl (S. o. caurina) has been listed as "threatened"under the Endangered Species Act since 1990. Here, we use an updated SO genome assembly along with 51 high-coverage whole-genome sequences to examine population structure, hybridization, and recent changes in population size in SO and BO. We found that potential hybrids identified from intermediate plumage morphology were a mixture of pure BO, F1 hybrids, and F1 × BO backcrosses. Also, although SO underwent a population bottleneck around the time of the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, their population sizes rebounded and show no evidence of any historical (i.e., 100-10,000 years ago) population decline. This suggests that the current decrease in SO abundance is due to events in the past century. Finally, we estimate that western and eastern BOs have been genetically separated for thousands of years, instead of the previously assumed recent (i.e., <150 years) divergence. Although this result is surprising, it is unclear where the ancestors of western BO lived after the separation. In particular, although BO may have colonized western North America much earlier than the first recorded observations, it is also possible that the estimated divergence time reflects unsampled BO population structure within central or eastern North America. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

ABSTRACT: Reproducing conspecific vocalization has been widely used to detect owls in the field due to the nocturnal habits and cryptic nature of most of them. Surveying and monitoring owl populations using playback and other methods are important given the key roles these birds play in the environment and the ecosystem services they provide, especially Neotropical owls that are still poorly understood. We described Tropical Screech-Owls (Megascops choliba) response to playback and examined playback- and environmental-related variables affecting it, at one of the last lowland Atlantic forest remnants, in southeastern Brazil. Our playback protocol consisted of three repetitions of 2-min broadcasting of one recording of the species’ A-song, interspersed by 5-min silent listening periods. We used nine recordings randomly selected by sampling point to avoid pseudoreplication. The most common response (77%, N = 85) was an undescribed variation of the A-song, followed by other two voices that are possibly undescribed. The response rate to playback was 83.4% (N = 102 samples). Response rate was negatively affected by wind speed (especially wind bursts), and positively affected by greater cloud cover and lower ambient light. Recordings used for playback were more influential than any environmental variable. Recordings with fewer phrases, uneven and longer intervals between phrases, and higher-pitched songs elicited more responses. These characteristics are usually associated with lower quality individuals. We argue that playback protocols, whatever their goals, should be carefully designed and tested to improve their efficiency. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Optimal foraging theory predicts that in situations of high prey abundance, predators will select the largest ones if the cost of capture is similar. This relationship is not clear in species of large owls. We aimed to evaluate the selection by the Eagle Owl (Bubo bubo) of different body sizes of a profitable prey, the European Rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). Evaluations were made in a semi-natural rabbit population with high rabbit availability (Los Melonares), and in two natural populations with different abundances of rabbit (low to high). In Los Melonares, we compared the size distribution of rabbits in the owl diet with the body size distribution of the rabbit population. In the natural populations, we compared the size of the rabbits in the owl diet with the abundance of rabbits. Results from Los Melonares showed that the Eagle Owl positively selected smaller rabbits (< 300 g) regardless of rabbits size distribution within the population throughout the year but such selection was only significant when the abundance of rabbits reached the highest levels. On the contrary, owls avoided rabbits belonging to the largest size class (> 900 g) throughout the year, being not significant in winter with low abundance of rabbits. In natural populations, smaller rabbits were included in the owl diet more frequently when rabbit abundance increased. Thus, Eagle Owl seemed to select the smallest rabbits, probably due to their higher vulnerability, ease of capture, their predictable location in areas surrounding warrens, and the lesser effort required to handle, consume and deliver to nestlings. © 2021, Deutsche Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.

ABSTRACT: Ecologically based rodent management strategies are arising as a sustainable approach to rodent control, allowing us to preserve biodiversity while safeguarding human economic activities. Despite predator signals being known to generally repel rodents, few field-based studies have compared the behavioral effects of several predators on different prey species, especially in Neotropical ecosystems. Here, we used camera traps to study the behavior of rodent species native to the Chilean temperate forest (Abrothrix spp., long-tailed pygmy rice rat Oligoryzomys longicaudatus) and an introduced rodent (black rat Rattus rattus). Using playbacks of raptor calls, we experimentally exposed rodents to three predation risk treatments: austral pygmy owl calls (Glaucidium nana), rufous-legged owl calls (Strix rufipes) and a control treatment (absence of owl calls). We evaluated the effects of the treatments on the time allocated to three behaviors: feeding time, locomotor activity and vigilance. Moonlight and vegetation cover were also considered in the analyses, as they can modify perceived predation risk. Results showed that predator calls and environmental factors modified prey behavior depending not only on the predator species, but also on the rodent species. Consequently, owl playbacks could be regarded as a promising rodent control tool, knowing that future studies would be critical to deeply understand differences between species in order to select the most effective predator cues. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Migrating animals occur along a continuum from species that spend the nonbreeding season at a fixed location to species that are nomadic during the nonbreeding season, essentially continuously moving. Such variation is likely driven by the economics of territoriality or heterogeneity in the environment. The Snowy Owl (Bubo scandiacus) is known for its complex seasonal movements, and thus an excellent model to test these ideas, as many individuals travel unpredictably along irregular routes during both the breeding and nonbreeding seasons. Two possible explanations for this large variation in the propensity to move are (1) dominance hierarchies in which dominant individuals (adult females in this case) monopolize some key, consistent resources, and move less than subdominants; and (2) habitat heterogeneity in which individuals foraging in rich and less heterogenic environments are less mobile. We analyzed fine-scale telemetry data (global positioning system [GPS]/global system for mobile communication [GSM]) from 50 Snowy Owls tagged in eastern and central North America from 2013 to 2019, comparing space use during the winter period according to sex and age, and to land cover attributes. We used variograms to classify individuals as nomadic (58%) or range-resident (42%), and found that nomadic owls had ten times larger wintering areas than range-resident owls. The frequency of nomadism was similar in socially-dominant adult females, immatures, and males. However, nomadism increased from west to east, and north to south, and was positively associated with the use of water and negatively associated with croplands. We conclude that many individual Snowy Owls in Eastern North America are nomadic during the nonbreeding season and that movement patterns during this time are driven primarily by extrinsic factors, specifically heterogeneity in habitat and prey availability, as opposed to intrinsic factors associated with spacing behavior, such as age and sex.

ABSTRACT: The Magellanic Great Horned Owl,or tucúquere (Bubo virginianus magellanicus), is a bird of prey of agroecological and environmental importance in Chile. However, there is a gap in what we know about its diet in mountainous regions of central Chile, where its interaction with the human populations is large and anthropic-derived habitat changes are increasing. We collected 91 pellets from two individuals to assess their diet. Analysis of pellet weight, length and width, prey identification to species, as well as absolute and relative abundance, were obtained. From these values, we calculated trophic niche (Levin, Shannon-Wiener, and Smith indexes). The mean weight, length, and width of pellets were 9.84 g, 56.7 mm, and 32.6 mm, respectively. The consumption of 12 different prey species was evidenced, being the most consumed the introduced hare Lepus capensis (23.53%), followed by the chinchilla rat Abrocoma bennetti (20.59%), and thereafter other species of small rodents, an undetermined bird, and insects. The trophic niche amplitude for normal and standardised Levin, normal and standardised Shannon-Wiener, and Smith (TF) indexes were 6.72, 0.52, 2.11, 0.85, and 0.90, respectively. This is the first evidence of a diet based predominantly on L. capensis in central Chile for B. v. magellanicus, which seems to be a more generalist predator than previous studies report. Out study contributes to the understanding of food habits and conservation efforts for this raptor species in Chile and the rest of South America. © 2021 Neotropical Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: One of the consequences of selections acting on body size is the difference in body size between the sexes or sexual size dimorphism. Although many hypotheses have been proposed for reversed sexual size dimorphism (RSD) in raptors, ornithologists have rarely paid attention to temporal aspects of RSD when testing their hypotheses. Because selection pressures may vary temporally, describing temporal variation in RSD is a first step towards understanding evolutionary mechanism which shape and maintain the dimorphism. Here, we describe RSD in the population of Ryukyu Scops Owls Otus elegans on Minami-daito Island using a dataset of the external measurements of 770 individuals obtained during a 17-year long-term population monitoring project. Females were larger than males in body mass, culmen length, bill depth, bill width, tail length and flattened wing length, whereas males were larger than females in tarsus and head lengths. Among these traits, the degree and direction of RSD of body mass, tarsus length, bill depth and flattened wing length varied across years. There were neither increasing nor decreasing trends in RSD. This is a rare study which addressed temporal variation in RSD in a raptor species. © 2021 The Ornithological Society of Japan.

ABSTRACT: Top predators shape the communities of sympatric predators by killing and displacing smaller predators. Predation risk pushes smaller predators to select enemy-free spaces irrespective of food availability, which results in changes in their behaviour, space use, distribution, and abundance. Although the landscape of fear dynamics are known for top predators such as the eagle owl and its impact on smaller raptors, the effect of the presence and abundance of the eagle owl on the space use of mesopredator carnivores remains poorly understood. Here, we studied this effect on the space use of the stone marten in a Mediterranean ecosystem where it shares rabbits as main prey with the eagle owl. We also accounted for the presence of another sympatric carnivore, the red fox. Using a multi-model inference, we found stone martens avoided areas with a higher abundance of eagle owls and rabbits, which suggested a hyperpredation process and a cognitive association by stone martens between rabbit hotspots and owl presence. We found a positive relationship between the space use of the red fox and the stone marten, which suggested foxes behaved as competitors and not predators of martens.

ABSTRACT: A model of sleep-wake regulatory process was applied to examine several common believes associated with the so-called “social jetlag”, e.g. 1) sleep lost on weekdays due to the scheduled early wakeups might be partly recouped by getting extra sleep on weekends and 2) the weekday sleep loss is greater in evening- than in morning-oriented individuals. Weekday-weekend sleep times reported in 19 previously published papers for 20 samples of morning- and evening-oriented individuals were utilized as an input to the model. The results of statistical analyses and simulations of these times suggested that 1) sleep cannot be caught up on weekends and 2) evening- and morning-oriented individuals are not, in general, dissimilar on the amount of weekday sleep. We concluded that chronobiologial mechanisms underlying “social jetlag” require rethinking and that studying mathematical models of sleep-wake regulatory process allow the quantitative predictions about weekday sleep loss in different ages and diurnal types. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: The Tawny Owl (Strix aluco) is the most abundant nocturnal raptor in Europe. It has been thoroughly studied in various regions, but its habitat preferences in Mediterranean environments remain poorly understood. With the aim to present novel information about this aspect of the ecology of the Tawny Owl, we established 115 survey stations in the Special Conservancy Area "Sierras de Talayuelas y Aliaguilla"(Castilla-La Mancha region, eastern Spain) and carried out nocturnal surveys by recording spontaneous calls and vocal responses to call playbacks. We then assessed environmental characteristics (vegetation types, soil type, altitude, potential competitors, and anthropic disturbance) in areas where owls were detected or not detected during the breeding season. Overall, we detected 60 responding owls at 49 survey stations during breeding season in the study area (i.e., density 1.22 owls/km2). We found that Tawny Owls preferred lower altitudes and patchy heterogeneous areas. Owls seemed to avoid natural grasslands and areas characterized by limestone soils and associated vegetation, and preferred areas characterized by clay soils and associated vegetation. Interestingly, we did not detect owls close to wind farms, which seem to create a buffer effect on owls' occurrence. The noise generated by the turbines might be a limiting factor that could account for this avoidance. Our multivariate results showed that Tawny Owls preferred heterogeneous patchy habitat but avoided non-irrigated arable land. Tawny Owls inhabit Mediterranean landscapes where conditions are favorable, but human activities such as wind farms may limit their distribution. Additional research is needed to determine the drivers of this avoidance and whether Tawny Owls also avoid wind farms in other regions of their range. ©

ABSTRACT: Species' distributions are often discontinuous near the edge of the range where the environment may be more variable than the core of the range. Range discontinuity can reduce or cut off gene flow to small peripheral populations and lead to genetic drift and subsequent loss of genetic diversity. The southern extent of the Great Gray Owl (Strix nebulosa) range in North America is discontinuous, unlike their northern core range across the boreal forests. We sampled owls from five different locations on the periphery of the range across the western US (Wyoming, Idaho, California, northern Oregon, and southern Oregon) to investigate genetic population structure and genetic diversity. Using a reduced-representation genomic sequencing approach to genotype 123 individuals at 4817 single nucleotide polymorphic loci, we identified four genetically differentiated populations: California, southern Oregon, northern Oregon, and Wyoming and Idaho grouped together as a single Rocky Mountain population. The four genetically differentiated populations of Great Gray Owls identified in this study display high differentiation and low genetic variation, which is suggestive of long-term isolation and lack of connectivity, potentially caused by range discontinuity. The populations that lack habitat connectivity to the rest of the breeding range (i.e. those in California and Oregon) had lower genetic diversity than the Rocky Mountain population that is connected to the core of the range. These factors and other risks (such as disease and human-caused mortality) heighten susceptibility of these range-edge populations to future habitat and climate changes, genetic diversity erosion, and potential extinction vortex. For these reasons, protecting and monitoring this species on the southern edge of their range is vital. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

ABSTRACT: We describe a partial skeleton of a large-sized owl from Wasatchian strata of the Willwood Formation (Wyoming, U.S.A.). The holotype of Primoptynx poliotauros, gen. et sp. nov., includes all major postcranial bones and is one of the most substantial Paleogene records of the Strigiformes. The fossil shows that owls exhibited a considerable morphological diversity in the early Eocene of North America and occupied disparate ecological niches. As in the protostrigid taxon Minerva from the late early to early middle Eocene of North America, but unlike in extant owls, the ungual phalanges of the hallux and the second toe of the new species are distinctly larger than those of the other toes. Primoptynx poliotauros gen. et sp. nov., however, does not exhibit the derived tibiotarsus morphology of the Protostrigidae. Even though the new species may well be a stem group representative of protostrigid owls, current data do not allow an unambiguous phylogenetic placement. Concerning the size of the ungual phalanges, the feet of P. poliotauros correspond to those of extant hawks and allies (Accipitridae). We therefore hypothesize that it used its feet to dispatch prey items in a hawk-like manner, whereas extant owls kill prey with their beak. Primoptynx and protostrigid owls were possibly specialized in foraging on prey items that required an accipitrid-like killing strategy, such as larger-sized or more defensive mammals. The extinction of these peculiar owls may have been related to the radiation of accipitrid diurnal birds of prey, which appear to have diversified in the late Eocene and early Oligocene. © 2020, by the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology.

ABSTRACT: The mechanisms behind expansions of the distribution of a bird species and the ensuing establishment of new populations are poorly known. The distribution of Great Grey Owl (Strix nebulosa) in the western Palearctic has generally expanded towards southwest during the past fifty years, and particularly so in Fennoscandia. In the past decade, the recorded breeding population in Norway, confined to Hedmark county bordering Sweden, increased from 1 pair in 2009 to > 100 pairs in 2017–2018, extending the southwestern border of the distribution > 100 km. We studied the age structure of this expanding population based on the molting pattern of the wing feathers of birds captured at the nest site for banding and of non-captured birds photographed in flight. In Fennoscandia the Great Grey Owl relies on shrews and microtine rodents, which usually fluctuate in 3–4 years cycles. The proportion of 1-year old birds among the nesting Great Grey Owls was higher in peak year two of each small mammal population cycle (2011, 2014 and 2018) than in peak year one (2010, 2013 and 2017), and was particularly high (77%) in 2011 when the owl population was far lower (22 nestings recorded) than in later corresponding years (64 nestings in 2014 and 103 in 2018). Thus, this population seems to have been founded to a large extent by birds nesting as 1 year olds, and most likely having dispersed from Sweden. The ability to determine the age of Great Grey Owls without having to capture them extended our data set, in particular for males, which are more reluctant to attack intruders at the nest site and, therefore, less likely to be captured for banding. Being able to age a bird without having to capture it is important, because trapping does not sample a bird population randomly. © 2020, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Foragers make decisions based on cues, information collected from their environment, processed into strategic behaviours. This information, processed in multiple regions of the brain, ultimately result in the production of stress hormones and visible changes in behaviour of animals – both reflexively to avoid depredation and strategically to avoid an encounter with the predator. In a common-garden experiment we tested how imperfect information from visual cues of a predator impacts foraging and apprehension of a desert rodent, the Egyptian gerbil (Gerbillus pyramidum). The gerbils were exposed to predation by barn owls (Tyto alba), one camouflaged on dark nights using black dye. Gerbils’ response to the owls was measured using patch-use measured in giving-up densities (GUDs) and time spent in vigilance activity. Owl lethality was extrapolated from mean times spent in attacks and number of attempted strikes. Dyed owls attack-rate was lower and attack duration greater than those of the white owls. During the full moon, when dyed owls were visible, gerbils responded with extreme vigilance and minimal foraging (high GUDs). During the new moon when the owls were most stealthy, the gerbils showed low vigilance coupled with a similar high GUD. The inconsistency between gerbils’ foraging and vigilance behaviours, suggest a likely mismatch between perceived risk and actual measurement of predator lethality gathered by the gerbils’ observations in real time. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Background: There is scarce information detailing clinical and physiological effects of reversible injectable protocols of chemical restraint on Neotropical primates. Methods: Nineteen captive Spix´s Owl monkeys (Aotus vociferans) were assessed in a double-blind randomized crossover study using the following: ketamine/xylazine [KX], ketamine/midazolam [KM] and ketamine/xylazine/midazolam [KXM]. During immobilization, respiratory and pulse rates, rectal temperature, haemoglobin oxygen saturation and arterial blood pressure were recorded at 5-minute intervals during a 20-minute period; afterwards, antagonist drugs (yohimbine for xylazine and flumazenil for midazolam) were, respectively, administered. Quality and duration of induction, immobilization and recovery periods were recorded. Results: Ketamine/xylazine increased manipulation sensitivity and produced poor muscle relaxation. KM maintained all assessed parameters within physiological ranges. KXM produced depressant cardiorespiratory effects and hypotension. All protocols produced hypothermia. Conclusions: Based on its adequate anaesthetic depth and minimum effects on physiological parameters, KM is suitable for immobilizing A vociferans and performing short-term procedures lasting around 20 minutes. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

ABSTRACT: The ability to distinguish (in the field) the sex of wildlife that show limited sexual dimorphism is, at best, challenging but is nonetheless essential to ensure appropriate conservation strategies are implemented. We developed a technique using highly varied images, similar to those taken by amateur photographers, to accurately sex individual powerful owls (Ninox strenua) through the measurement of facial features. Powerful owls show extremely limited sexual dimorphism and have been almost impossible to sex without genetic analysis, however, we report a process that results in the unambiguous assignment of sex. Image selection was extremely important; images where the owl's head and body faced towards the camera, in an alert posture, were selected. We derived five facial features (inter-nostril distance, inter-eye distance, head width, forehead height and facemask), all measured in pixels to account for variation in the resolution and the size of images. Ratios were then produced from these facial features enabling standardised metrics, which we tested with regard to the assignment of sex. Logistic regression analysis indicated that the ratio of head width to the inter-nostril distance was the key sexually diagnostic relationship, giving 100% accuracy in sex determination (assessed against known-sex birds). We also identified a sex-specific plumage character; where facemask feathers protrude beyond the profile of the contour feathers of the head, the bird was a female, whereas when these feathers did not protrude beyond the profile, the bird was a male. For powerful owls, simple image analysis reliably determines the sex of individuals and has potential as an extremely cost efficient approach, that can provide essential information on species dynamics such as sex ratios, social organization and behaviour. The use of photographic images is especially beneficial for species that are cryptic or are extremely difficult to capture. The quantification and analysis of images captured by amateurs enables a greater contribution of citizen scientists to conservation research. © 2020 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Aggressive logging of public old-growth forests in the Pacific Northwest came to an abrupt halt in 1992 due to litigation involving the federally threatened northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis). Much has been written about the ensuing crisis, but not about how Forest Service officials resolved it in ensuing years. The effort to create a new forestry model relied on applying important holistic concepts to restore biological function to Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests. The crisis also necessitated reengineering inclusive social processes to restore hope to disenfranchised parties. A successful new social contract emerged for managing public lands stuck in gridlock that has proven effective, durable, hopeful, and resilient. © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The Barn Owl Tyto alba is commonly reported as a non-selective predator of small mammals, and its diet has been thoroughly analyzed also to assess the small mammal assembly composition in many study areas. The aim of this work was to analyze the diet of the Barn Owl in the Elba island through the analysis of 161 pellets collected in September 2020. Undigested fragments were isolated and compared with reference collections. We confirmed that the Barn Owl is a typical predator of field mice (62% of relative frequency), with synanthropic murid rodents as the second category of prey. The frequency of consumption of shrews increased by 9% with respect to the previous work, suggesting that the natural environment of Elba island is still in a good health status. Moreover, fragments of two newborn hares were detected, increasing the knowledge on the local trophic spectrum of the Barn Owl. Finally, the skull of a Geoffroy’s Myotis Myotis emarginatus confirmed the presence of this species in Elba island after over 60 years from the first unconfirmed record. Repeated studies conducted in the same study site may provide useful information on prey population trends and local environmental status. © 2020 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Some metals and metalloids (e.g. Pb, Hg, Cd and As) are well-known for their bioaccumulation capacity and their toxic effects on birds, but concerns on other minor elements and rare earth elements (ME and REE) are growing due to their intensive use in modern technology and potential toxicity. Vitamins and carotenoids play essential roles in nestling growth and proper development, and are known to be affected by the metals classically considered as toxic. However, we are unaware of any attempts to evaluate the exposure to 50 elements and related effects in plasma vitamins and carotenoids in raptor species. The main goals of this study are: (i) to assess the exposure to 50 elements (i.e. classic toxic elements, trace elements, REE and ME) in nestling Eagle owls (Bubo bubo) inhabiting three differently polluted environments (mining, industrial and control areas) in southeastern Spain, and (ii) to evaluate how element exposure affects plasma vitamin and carotenoid levels, hematocrit and body measurements (mass and wing length) of the individuals. Our results show that local contamination in the mining area contributes to increased blood concentrations of Pb, As and Tl in nestlings, while diet differences between control and mining/industrial areas may account for the different levels of Mn, Zn, and Sr in blood, and lutein in plasma. Plasma tocopherol levels were increased in the mining-impacted environment, which may be a mechanism of protection to prevent toxic element-related oxidative stress. Plasma α-tocopherol was enhanced by 20% at blood Pb concentrations ≥8 ng/ml, and nestlings exhibited up to 56% increase in α-tocopherol levels when blood Pb concentrations reached 170 ng/ml. Tocopherol seems to be a sensitive biomarker under an exposure to certain toxic elements (e.g. Pb, As, Tl). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Owls play crucial roles in the environment and provide ecosystem services making them important to monitor and study. However, standardized methods for most species do not exist, and we lack understanding of the effects of many environmental variables and call-broadcast on detection of owls during surveys. We performed a multispecies occupancy analysis of owl monitoring data collected from 2004 to 2013 across the state of Maine to examine the effects of environmental variables, conspecific and heterospecific call-broadcast, and general survey protocols on detection of 3 forest owls: Northern Saw-whet Owl (Aegolius acadicus), Barred Owl (Strix varia), and Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus). We found that environmental variables such as cloud cover, precipitation, temperature, time of night, and wind had species-specific effects on detection probability, and ambient noise decreased detection probability for all species. Snow cover did not affect detection of any species. We also found that conspecific call-broadcast increased detection of each species, while heterospecific call-broadcast had variable effects. Specifically, we found that Long-eared and Barred owl broadcast increased the detection of Northern Saw-whet Owl, and our results suggest additional heterospecific effects may exist. Our study showed that, compared to the protocol of the Maine Owl Monitoring Program, surveys simultaneously examining all 3 of our focal species can increase efficiency and lower disturbance by only broadcasting Long-eared and Barred owl calls during a 10-min survey. We recommend that future owl surveys take into account species-specific effects of conspecific and heterospecific call-broadcast, and use our results when designing survey protocols that include one or more of our focal species.  © American Ornithological Society 2020.

ABSTRACT: New advances in molecular approaches for DNA analysis have enhanced our understanding of the phylogenetic relationship of birds. The Little Owl (Athene noctua) is of great significance for the integrated management of forest diseases and control of regional pests. Here, we sequenced and annotated the 17,772 bp complete mitogenome of A. noctua. The mitogenome encoded 37 typical mitochondrial genes: 13 protein-coding genes, two ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA, and one non-coding control region (D-loop). The organization and location of genes in the A. noctua mitogenome were consistent with those reported for other Strigidae birds. Phylogenetic relationships based on Bayesian inference and Maximum likelihood methods showed that A. noctua has close relationships with Athene brama and Glaucidium cuculoides, confirming that A. noctua belongs to the Strigidae family. The phylogenetic relationships among seven genera of the Strigidae family used in this study were: Ninox and the other six genera were far apart, Otus and the clade ((Bubo + Strix) + Asio) were clustered into one branch, and Athene and Glaucidium were clustered into one branch. This phylogenetic classification is consistent with prior taxonomic studies on the Strigidae family. Our results provide new mitogenomic data to support further phylogenetic and taxonomic studies of Strigidae. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Between 2012 and 2019, 6523 raptors and owls (30 species) were ringed in Slovakia. The most abundant was the common kestrel (2811 individuals), then the western marsh harrier (664) and saker falcon (517). The proportion of nestlings among all the ringed individuals was 84.4%. In the given period, 340 recoveries of raptors and owls (23 species) were recorded in the ringing station database. This number included 160 recoveries of individuals colour-marked and also recovered in our territory. There were 83 recoveries of birds ringed in Slovakia and resighted abroad. The last 97 recoveries were of individuals ringed abroad and recovered in Slovakia. In summary, most of the recoveries (of all types) were of Eastern imperial eagle (62 recoveries), then red-footed falcon (51) and common kestrel (43). Most of the recovery circumstances were ring reading (44% in total), recaptures (15%) and findings of bird cadavers. Regarding raptors or owls, collisions with vehicles (5%) and electrocutions (5%) were frequent causes of their deaths.  © 2020 Roman Slobodník et al., published by Sciendo 2020.

ABSTRACT: Global climate change presents a growing conservation threat, but our understanding of the effects of climate change remains limited for most species. We evaluated the annual climate cycle for threatened Mexican Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis lucida) in high-elevation mixed-conifer forests in the Sacramento Mountains of New Mexico from 2005 to 2010. We used data from a network of weather stations in Mexican Spotted Owl habitat to describe annual temperature cycles, and precipitation data from a National Weather Service weather station to describe the annual precipitation cycle. We coupled these data with equations from the literature to estimate annual cycles in resting metabolic rate and evaporative water loss, and evaluated the potential effects of a warming climate on these parameters. Annual weather was characterized by cold, dry winters, warmer and dry springs, warm and wet summers, and cool and relatively wet falls. Ambient temperature never exceeded the upper critical temperature for Mexican Spotted Owls (35.2°C), but > 90% of 663,422 hourly temperature observations were below the lower critical temperature (18.2°C). Thus, heat stress was not predicted to occur, but owls likely expended energy on thermoregulation at low temperatures. Resting energy use peaked during winter (December–February) and was lowest when owls would be feeding young (May–August). In contrast, evaporative water loss peaked from June to August, when precipitation also peaked. Mexican Spotted Owls generally appeared well-adapted to the current climate cycle in our montane study area, but late winter (February–March) may be a critical period in terms of energy requirements, and late spring (April–May) may be critical in terms of water relationships. Predicted changes in temperature through 2099 would result in reductions in predicted energy use by Mexican Spotted Owls, but increases in predicted water use. Water relationships may become increasingly important for Mexican Spotted Owls in the face of climate change, especially in warmer and drier areas. In forested areas, retaining patches of older forest with high canopy cover in cool, mesic sites may provide continued benefits to Mexican Spotted Owls under climate change. Published 2020.

ABSTRACT: The occurrence of heavy metals into the environment through various natural and anthropogenic sources is inevitable due to their persistent nature. This study investigated the concentration of heavy metals lead (Pb), zinc (Zn) and chromium (Cr) in liver, kidney, muscle and bones of three different species of owls namely Indian Eagle Owl (Bubo bengalensis), Barn Owl (Tyto alba) and Spotted Owlet (Athene brama) from Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, India. Given their sentinel role, birds can be used as suitable and reliable indicators in monitoring the quality of the environment. From the study, it was observed that Bubo bengalensis accumulated the highest concentration of metals followed by Athene brama and Tyto alba. On an average, the concentration of Zn (1.67±1.40 μg/g) was higher than Pb (0.079±0.05 μg/g) and Cr (0.99±1.11 μg/g). Among all the species, Spotted Owlet (Athene brama) recorded the highest concentration of Zn in bone (3.98 μg/g) whereas in the bone of Indian Eagle Owl (Bubo bengalensis) 2.44 μg/g of chromium (Cr) was reported. Pearson’s correlation of the data showed significant positive correlations in the absorption of metals by the tissues. Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA was applied to validate the results and check whether the groups originated from the same population. Additionally, Principle Component Analysis (PCA) revealed that Pb showed a strong relationship with both Zn and Cr and might be due to the differences of sources of these elements in the environment. © 2020 Technoscience Publications.

ABSTRACT: The aim of our study was to examine the cases of Common Buzzards (Buteo buteo) and Long-eared Owls (Asio otus) treated at the Wildlife Rescue Center at the Budapest Zoo and Botanical Garden in Hungary over the course of a three-year period. These species were chosen as part of this study as they are the most abundant diurnal and nocturnal raptors at the rescue facility and the causes, which warranted rescue in their cases could be extrapolated to other species and raptor-related conservation problems in a broader sense. Emphasis was placed on determining the cause of admittance of these individuals and whether or not rehabilitation was possible with various ailments. We found that in Common Buzzards (n=42), rehabilitation and release was achieved in 31.0% of the cases (n=13), with orphaned juvenile birds having the highest rate of success, 31.0% (n=13) were humanely euthanized, 28.6% (n=12) died at the rescue center and 9.5% (n=4) were placed in captive facilities for breeding and education purposes. Of the Long-eared Owls (n=35) brought into the rescue center during this timeframe, altogether 37.1% (n=13) were released back into the wild with juvenile individuals being the most highly represented, 22.8% (n=8) were humanely euthanized, 20.0% (n=7) died and 20.0% (n=7) were placed in a captive setting. We were thus able to see, that raptor and owl patients which were orphaned had highest rate of rehabilitation compared to the other categories in our study. Traumatic injuries were presented in the greatest number in both the Common Buzzard and the Long-eared Owl. © Biharean Biologist, Oradea, Romania, 2020

ABSTRACT: The fossil record of owls of the families Strigidae and Tytonidae in South America is poor. The aim of the present contribution is to report for the first time fossil Strigiformes from Riobamba Canton, at Chimborazo province, in Ecuador. The specimens come from a large owl burrow from Late Pleistocene beds of the Cangagua Formation. We report the finding of fossil record of Athene cunicularia and Tyto aff. T. furcata and the first fossil record of Glaucidium from Ecuador. Further, a giant species of the genus Asio is described. The specimen constitutes the largest known asionine owl, being approximately of the size of a big female of Bubo virginianus. Based on prey content at the fossil burrow, it is possible that the new Asio species predated on the other owls. If this inference is correct, it may represent the first evidence indicating intra-ordinal predation in the fossil record. © 2020, Deutsche Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.

ABSTRACT: The easternmost extent of the Pharaoh Eagle-Owl Bubo ascalaphus (Savigny, 1809) distribution has remained enigmatic due to identification problems and lack of owl research. In Iraq, B. ascalaphus has been reported from only few localities in western Iraqi deserts; while its occurrence in Iran has not been reported before this study. In 2017-2020, several new records of B. ascalaphus in western through southeastern Iraq were made and a new distribution range in western Iran was confirmed. Furthermore, field identification, interspecific relationships and conservation status of B. ascalaphus in Iraq and Iran were comprehensively discussed. © 2020 University of Baghdad - Iraq Natural History Reseach Center and Museum.

ABSTRACT: Previous studies have shown an association between morning and evening types and creative thinking. Musicians are creative individuals and the purpose of the current research was to examine whether musicians are significantly more evening types than non-musicians. The total sample included 835 participants (n women = 353; n men = 482), with a mean age of 28.0 years (SD = 10.4). The group of musicians consisted of 600 participants (n women = 168; n men = 432) with a mean age of 29.1 years (SD = 11.2). The group of non-musicians consisted of 233 participants (n women = 184; n men = 49) with a mean age of 25.3 years (SD = 7.4). Participants were recruited via an online forum, and chronotypes were assessed using the self-report Horne & Ostberg's Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ). We found that performance musicians had significantly lower MEQ scores compared to non-performance musicians, and musicians who composed had the lowest MEQ scores across the whole sample. This indicates that musicians, particularly composing musicians had a tendency towards eveningness. These findings are discussed in relation to theories on chronobiology, creativity, and cognitive psychology. © 2019 Ubiquity Press. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Recent excavations from late Pleistocene to Historical period sites on the islands of Guadeloupe and Saint Martin yielded bones of the Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia). The osteological description of the remains combined with the location of fossil-bearing sites and historical accounts show this owl to have been present across the Guadeloupe islands in historical periods. This species has been identified in multiple archaeological sites, including those reported here, attesting to the near continuous distribution of this owl throughout the pre-Columbian period in the north of Lesser Antilles. Taken together, these results challenge the previous hypothesis of a relict distribution of the Burrowing Owl as a consequence of climatically induced modifications of the Caribbean environment since the last glaciation. © 2020 Wilson Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: The human 22q11.2 chromosomal deletion is one of the strongest identified genetic risk factors for schizophrenia. Although the deletion spans a number of known genes, the contribution of each of these to the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (DS) is not known. To investigate the effect of individual genes within this interval on the pathophysiology associated with the deletion, we analyzed their role in sleep, a behavior affected in virtually all psychiatric disorders, including the 22q11.2 DS. We identified the gene LZTR1 (night owl, nowl) as a regulator of night-time sleep in Drosophila. In humans, LZTR1 has been associated with Rasdependent neurological diseases also caused by Neurofibromin-1 (Nf1) deficiency. We show that Nf1 loss leads to a night-time sleep phenotype nearly identical to that of nowl loss and that nowl negatively regulates Ras and interacts with Nf1 in sleep regulation. Furthermore, nowl is required for metabolic homeostasis, suggesting that LZTR1 may contribute to the genetic susceptibility to obesity associated with the 22q11.2 DS. Knockdown of nowl or Nf1 in GABA-responsive sleep-promoting neurons elicits the sleep phenotype, and this defect can be rescued by increased GABAA receptor signaling, indicating that Nowl regulates sleep through modulation of GABA signaling. Our results suggest that nowl/LZTR1 may be a conserved regulator of GABA signaling important for normal sleep that contributes to the 22q11.2 DS. © 2020 Maurer et al.

ABSTRACT: This study investigated the home range and habitat characteristics in tawny owls (Strix aluco), a grade II endangered wildlife species from South Korea. We tracked a breeding pair in Gyeongbuk during their brooding period using an attached radio transmitter through a satellite tracking system (WT-300: GPS-Mobile phone based Telemetry). The subjects had consecutively reproduced in a same nest for two years (2016–2017). The female's location data (six coordinates) were collected in 2016, whereas the male's (12 coordinates) were collected in 2017. Kernel density estimates were used to determine the pair's core habitats; the male had a greater movement range (2,133,971 m2) at 95% kernel density estimate than the female (19,572 m2). The male's core habitat was mostly mixed forest (50.6%), followed by coniferous forest (13.4%), nonirrigated land (10.9%), natural grassland (10.1%), and inland bodies of water (8.2%). The female's core habitat was dominated by mixed forest (36.8%), followed by non-natural barren land (21.7%), nonirrigated land (14.4%), residential areas (10%), and transportation areas (7.9%). This study is the first to track a breeding tawny owl pair on the Korean peninsula through direct satellite. Our results provide fundamental data as a case study regarding home range behavior of an owl breeding pair for developing conservation and management plan. © 2020 National Science Museum of Korea (NSMK) and Korea National Arboretum (KNA)

ABSTRACT: The article deals with trends in the Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo) population in Czechia and the interplay between legal regulation of hunting and nature protection. In the early 20th century, the eagle-owl population in Bohemia decreased to an estimated 20 nesting pairs, and the population in Moravia and Silesia was subsequently estimated to be similarly low. In previous centuries, eagle-owls had been persecuted as pest animals; additionally, their chicks were picked from nests to be kept by hunters for the eagle-owl lure hunting method ("výrovka"in Czech), where they were used as live bait to attract corvids and birds of prey, which were subsequently killed by shooting. As soon as the state of the eagle-owl population was established in the 1900s, the effort to save the autochthonous eagle-owl population commenced. Nevertheless, when eagle-owls became legally protected from killing in the 1930s, the eagle-owl lure hunting method was not prohibited. The intensified use of this hunting method in the 1950s was accompanied by serious decline in the populations of birds of prey in the Czech countryside, when tens of thousands of Eurasian sparrowhawks (Accipiter nisus), northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis), common buzzards (Buteo buteo) and rough-legged buzzards (B. lagopus) were killed on a yearly basis. The usage of eagle-owl chicks in lure hunting was criticised by ornithologists concerned with the conservation of birds of prey. The eagle-owl thus became a subject of more general debate on the role of predators in nature, and this debate (albeit regarding other predator species) has continued to the present-day. As the eagle-owl population has been growing steadily following the prohibition of its killing in the 1930s, its story may serve as an example of the need for effective legal protection of predators to ensure their survival in the intensively exploited central-European environment. The article examines the successful preserving of the eagle-owl in the Czech countryside, from its low point in the early 20th century towards today's stable and ever-increasing population, focusing on environmental, conservationist, legal and societal aspects of the issue. © 2020 Jan Andreska et al., published by Sciendo 2020.

ABSTRACT: Context: Climate and land-use change have led to disturbance regimes in many ecosystems without a historical analog, leading to uncertainty about how species adapted to past conditions will respond to novel post-disturbance landscapes. Objectives: We examined habitat selection by spotted owls in a post-fire landscape. We tested whether selection or avoidance of severely burned areas could be explained by patch size or configuration, and whether variation in selection among individuals could be explained by differences in habitat availability. Methods: We applied mixed-effects models to GPS data from 20 spotted owls in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA, with individual owls occupying home ranges spanning a broad range of post-fire conditions after the 2014 King Fire. Results: Individual spotted owls whose home ranges experienced less severe fire (< 5% of home range severely burned) tended to select severely burned forest, but owls avoided severely burned forest when more of their home range was affected (~ 5–40%). Owls also tended to select severe fire patches that were smaller in size and more complex in shape, and rarely traveled > 100-m into severe fire patches. Spotted owls avoided areas that had experienced post-fire salvage logging but the interpretation of this effect was nuanced. Owls also avoided areas that were classified as open and/or young forest prior to the fire. Conclusions: Our results support the hypothesis that spotted owls are adapted to historical fire regimes characterized by small severe fire patches in this region. Shifts in disturbance regimes that produce novel landscape patterns characterized by large, homogeneous patches of high-severity fire may negatively affect this species. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

ABSTRACT: The relatively extensive fossil record of owls (Aves, Strigiformes) in North America and Europe stands in stark contrast to the paucity of fossil strigiformes from Africa. The first occurrence of a fossil owl from the Paleogene of Africa extends the fossil record of this clade on that continent by as much as 25 million years, and confirms the presence of large-sized owls in Oligocene continental faunas. The new fossil is tentatively referred to the Selenornithinae, a clade of large owls previously restricted to Europe. This new fossil owl was likely similar in size to the extant Eagle Owls of the genus Bubo, and suggests that the niche of large, volant, terrestrial avian predator, although relatively rare throughout avian evolutionary history, may be an ecological role that was more common among extinct owls than previously recognized. © 2020 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: After reviewing the systematics and distribution of the living and fossil small West Indian taxa of Tytonidae (Tyto), we reached the following conclusions: (1) Strix tuidara J. E. Gray, 1827, type locality of Brazil, is the earliest available and correct name to be used in a binomen for New World mainland barn owls; (2) the North American mainland subspecies Tyto tuidara pratincola (Bonaparte, 1838), new combination, is resident in the Bahamas (“Tyto perlatus lucayanus” Riley, 1913, is a synonym), where it probably did not colonize until after the European introduction of Rattus Fischer, in Hispaniola (Dominican Republic and Haiti) where it became established in the 20th century, and subsequently in Puerto Rico; (3) Tyto furcata (Temminck, 1827) of Cuba, Jamaica and the Cayman Islands is a different species restricted to its insular distribution, with “T. alba niveicauda” Parkes & Phillips, 1978, of the Isle of Pines (now Isla de la Juventud) as a synonym; (4) the distinct species Tyto glaucops (Kaup, 1852), now endemic to Hispaniola, once occurred in Puerto Rico, as the fossil species “T. cavatica” Wetmore, 1920, is here shown to be a synonym; (5) the smallest taxon Tyto insularis (Pelzeln, 1872) of the southern Lesser Antilles is treated as a separate species, in which the nominate subspecies T. i. insularis (St. Vincent, Grenada, and the Grenadines) differs slightly but consistently in coloration from T. i. nigrescens (Lawrence, 1878) of Dominica; (6) another barn owl, Tyto maniola, new species, of this group of small tytonids from the West Indies inhabited Cuba during part of the Quaternary, and is here named and described.

ABSTRACT: Little is known about the foraging ecology and breeding biology of the Stygian Owl (Asio stygius robustus) across Central America. We located one Stygian Owl roost site in the Mountain Pine Ridge Forest Reserve in the Cayo District of Belize, where we collected pellets over a one-year period (n = 145; Mar 2009-Feb 2010). All identified prey items (n = 194) were passerines (69%), bats (19%), or beetles (12%). We used a proportions test and found seasonal variation in diet, with increased passerine prey consumed in the dry season (Jan-May) and increased beetle prey consumed in the wet season (Jun-Dec). This shift in diet may be influenced by temporal variation of passerine abundance and the emergence of beetles at the start of the wet season. In December 2010, we affixed an adult male Stygian Owl with a VHF transmitter, recorded regular movements using triangulation, and located an occupied nest with a single nestling in sub-montane pine forest habitat. The tagged male had a home range of 36 km2and was documented regularly flying up to 16 km from the nest site through broad-leaved forest to hunt in agricultural habitat, while roosting and nesting only in sub-montane pine forest. The use of human-created habitats, such as agriculture, could unveil threats not previously of concern for this species (e.g., pesticide use). Our findings further our knowledge on seasonal diet for Stygian Owls and highlight distinct habitat usage for both roosting and foraging, which has important conservation implications for an understudied Neotropical owl. © 2020 Wilson Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: The habitat selection of Scops Owl Otus scops has not been studied in Hungary so far. The population in the Carpathian Basin can be considered as a range edge population. Yet, studying and conserving breeding population at the edge of the species' range is important for the evolutionary potential of the species. In the present study, we examined Scops Owl populations situated on both sides of the Hungarian-Slovenian border. Although breeding density is significantly higher in Slovenia than in Hungary, we found no difference in the ecological diversity of the Goričko Nature Park (GNP), Slovenia and Vas County, Hungary. We found that both the proportion and total edge length of dry grasslands and intensively managed mesic grasslands were lower in Hungary. Similarly, market gardens were present in a larger proportion in GNP. These landscape features all indicate that the complex cultivation is still pronounced in GNP, favouring the Sops Owl as less intensive cultivation modes, like rural market gardens and grasslands play a key role in its habitat selection. Points with Scops Owl observations appeared to be closer to settlements than randomly generated points. They also were observed farther from primary roads than from secondary roads. This is in accordance with other studies revealing that these nocturnal birds avoid noisy roads. We briefly discuss why conserving range edge populations is important, and how time and effort optimised species conservation measures should accompany landscape protection at the political level. © 2020 Ákos Klein et al., published by Sciendo 2020.

ABSTRACT: Interaural time and level differences are important cues for sound localization. We wondered whether the broadband information contained in these two cues could fully explain the behavior of barn owls and responses of midbrain neurons in these birds. To tackle this problem, we developed a novel approach based on head-related transfer functions. These filters contain the complete information present at the eardrum. We selected positions in space characterized by equal broadband interaural time and level differences. Stimulation from such positions provides reduced information to the owl. We show that barn owls are able to discriminate between such positions. In many cases, but not all, the owls may have used spectral components of interaural level differences that exceeded the known behavioral resolution and variability for discrimination. Alternatively, the birds may have used template matching. Likewise, neurons in the optic tectum of the barn owl, a nucleus involved in sensorimotor integration, contained more information than is available in the broadband interaural time and level differences. Thus, these data show that more information is available and used by barn owls for sound localization than carried by broadband interaural time and level differences. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Rodent and shrew populations are key components of many animal communities around the world. However, their population dynamics and the factors influencing their abundance are still not well understood. We analyzed rodent and shrew community composition and abundance at a UNESCO world heritage site, the Neusiedler See in Eastern Austria, using barn owl pellets. We identified temperature (mean and minimal monthly temperature) as well as maximum precipitation per day as significant drivers of the rodent and shrew presence. Our analyses showed that increased temperatures and dry summers will challenge most of the analyzed species and most likely lead to decreased abundances, which will also affect the already threatened Pannonic root vole (Microtus oeconomus mehelyi). Increased drainage efforts in this area would also lead to less ground water and dryer soil and therefore damage the local rodent and shrew populations. We show that barn owl pellets are a highly efficient way of monitoring rodent and shrew populations over a large area and enable researchers to decipher the factors influencing population and community dynamics. The use of pellet data, therefore, may still be one of the most efficient methods of assessing small mammal populations and their change over time. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS

ABSTRACT: New genomic tools open doors to study ecology, evolution, and population genomics of wild animals. For the Barn owl species complex, a cosmopolitan nocturnal raptor, a very fragmented draft genome was assembled for the American species (Tyto furcata pratincola) (Jarvis et al. 2014). To improve the genome, we assembled de novo Illumina and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) long reads sequences of its European counterpart (Tyto alba alba). This genome assembly of 1.219 Gbp comprises 21,509 scaffolds and results in a N50 of 4,615,526 bp. BUSCO (Universal Single-Copy Orthologs) analysis revealed an assembly completeness of 94.8% with only 1.8% of the genes missing out of 4,915 avian orthologs searched, a proportion similar to that found in the genomes of the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) or the collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis). By mapping the reads of the female American barn owl to the male European barn owl reads, we detected several structural variants and identified 70 Mbp of the Z chromosome. The barn owl scaffolds were further mapped to the chromosomes of the zebra finch. In addition, the completeness of the European barn owl genome is demonstrated with 94 of 128 proteins missing in the chicken genome retrieved in the European barn owl transcripts. This improved genome will help future barn owl population genomic investigations. © 2020 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Centrorhynchus Lühe, 1911 is a large genus of acanthocephalans mainly parasitic in various strigiform and falconiform birds. Some species of Centrorhynchus have not been adequately described. Here, the detailed morphology of C. clitorideus (Meyer, 1931) was studied using light and, for the first time, scanning electron microscopy, based on newly collected specimens from the little owl Athene noctua (Scopoli) (Strigiformes: Strigidae) in Pakistan. Partial sequences of the 18S and 28S nuclear ribosomal RNA genes and the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) of C. clitorideus were generated for the first time. No nucleotide variation was detected for the partial 18S and 28S regions, but 3.30% of intraspecific nucleotide divergence was found for the cox1 gene. Phylogenetic analyses based on 28S and 18S sequence data showed that C. clitorideus formed a sister relationship with Centrorhynchus sp. MGV-2005 or Centrorhynchus sp. MGV-2005 + C. microcephalus (Bravo-Hollis, 1947), respectively. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

ABSTRACT: As part of a project to introduce avian predators for biological pest control, we used hard and soft release methods to introduce Barn Owls (Tyto alba) in the urban area of Universiti Sains Malaysia in Penang, Malaysia. We tested five methods: (1) hard release of non-acclimated adults, (2) hard release of non-acclimated juveniles, (3) soft release of hand-reared fledglings, (4) soft release of acclimated juveniles, and (5) soft release of acclimated adults. We employed radio-tracking to analyze the success of all methods, and the movement and survival of some of the released birds. We analyzed regurgitated pellets to study the diet of the successfully introduced owls. All hard-released non-acclimated adults and non-acclimated juveniles left the study area within a few days after their release. Soft release of hand-reared fledglings was also unsuccessful, as we could only detect the radio-tracked owls for ≤10 d after their release. Of the nine acclimated juveniles that were soft released, one stayed within the study area for 25 d but eventually dispersed. The soft release using acclimated adults was the most successful release method, as 60% (3 of 5 birds) of the released owls were tracked for.30 d and became established as resident birds in the study area. We observed these adults roosting and hunting prey within the study area. Analysis of regurgitated pellets showed the resident Barn Owls preyed primarily on small mammals. Our results suggest that the most suitable method to introduce and establish Barn Owl populations in an urban area was by using soft release of acclimated adults. © 2020 Ornithological Societies of North America.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Predator odors are natural stressors that induce anti-predator defensive responses, which have developed under evolutionary pressures to maximize the fitness of an individual to avoid dangerous confrontations. In this study, we analyzed the defensive responses of a subterranean rodent species, the plateau zokor (Eospalax baileyi), to predation threat, and examined the trade-offs between defensive responses and foraging. Plateau zokors were exposed to 1, 3, and 6 g of eagle owl (Bubo bubo) feces, and the anti-predator behavioral, hormonal, and hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing factor and c-fos mRNA expression responses were analyzed and compared with the control (distilled water). Exposure of the animals to owl feces led to significant reductions in both duration of feeding and amount of food consumed, while some defensive behavioral responses (e.g., freezing and rearing) were more significant in the exposed animals than in the control. Serum levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone in plateau zokors exposed to owl feces were significantly higher compared with the control. The hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing factor and c-fos mRNA expression levels of plateau zokors exposed to 1, 3, and 6 g owl feces increased significantly, concomitant with the amount of eagle owl feces presented. Owl feces induced various behavioral, hormonal, and hypothalamic gene expression changes in plateau zokors exposed to them. Some behavioral and gene expression (but not hormonal) responses appeared to be threshold dependent. Significance statement: Predator odors supersede other signals and can provide comprehensive information to prey during life-threatening events. The plateau zokor is a typical subterranean rodent living in dark and enclosed subterranean habitats. Owing to this special habitat, zokors may be able to recognize ground predator odors and respond defensively. We investigated changes in behavior, hormones, and the hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing factor and c-fos mRNA expression levels of the plateau zokor when exposed to different amounts of eagle owl feces. We believe that our study makes a significant contribution to the literature because our results support the predation risk allocation hypothesis, showing that eagle owl feces inhibit foraging and induce various anti-predatory behavioral and neuroendocrine responses in plateau zokors. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Variation of habitats and resources important for farmland birds seems to be only partly captured by ordinary statistics on land-use and agricultural production. For instance, densities of rodents being prey for owls and raptors or structures of rural architecture providing nesting sites for many species are central for bird diversity but are not reported in any official statistics. Thus, modelling species distributions, population abundance and trends of farmland birds may miss important predictive habitat elements. Here, we involve local socio-economy factors as a source of additional information on rural habitat to test whether it improves predictions of barn owl occurrence in 2768 churches across Poland. Barn owls occurred in 778 churches and seemed to prefer old churches made of brick located in regions with a milder climate, higher share of arable land and pastures, low road density and low levels of light pollution. Including data on local unemployment, the proportion of elder citizens, commune income per citizen, the share of citizens with high education and share of farmers among working population improved the model substantially and some of these variables predicted barn owl occurrence better than several land-use and climate data. Barn owls were more likely to occur in areas with high unemployment, a higher proportion of older citizens in a local population and higher share of farmers among working population. Importantly, the socio-economy variables were correlated with the barn owl occurrence despite all climatic, infrastructure and land-use data were present in the model. We conclude that the socio-economy of local societies may add important but overlooked information that links to spatial variation in farmland biodiversity. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Natural cavities are a critical resource for non-excavating hole-nesting birds, many of which are declining in northern Europe. In the heavily managed boreal forests in Finland, cavities may be a scarce resource, but their availability to different hole-nesters has been examined in only a few studies. We studied the abundance of suitable cavities in two managed forest landscapes 300 km apart for a forest-dwelling predator, the Eurasian Pygmy Owl Glaucidium passerinum, which requires tree cavities for both nesting and food hoarding. We further examined the preferences of the owls for different cavity characteristics in two experiments and several years of monitoring data with nest boxes resembling natural cavities. We found that natural cavities were scarce in the landscape (6.5/km2). However, natural cavity abundance per se does not seem to limit the breeding density of this predator, as suggested by a low occupancy rate in natural cavities and nest boxes. Owls cleaned the cavities that were filled with nest material of other birds, which provides a greater number of possible cavities to choose from. Cavities whose characteristics prevent the nest from being reached by predators were clearly preferred, as the owls select cavities with more than 5 cm width of the front wall and 15–30 cm of entrance-bottom distance within the cavity. The entrance hole orientation or the height of the cavity from the ground did not affect cavity occupancy by pygmy owls for nesting. In addition, none of the characteristics of the cavities that we surveyed affected their use for food hoarding. While the number of cavities per se may not limit the nesting of the owls, they may be limited by suitable habitat with abundant food supply around available cavities, or by lack of cavities in suitable habitats. They also need more cavities in the winter than in the summer, as each individual needs one to six cavities for hoarding food to survive over winter. Effective conservation strategies for this forest specialist should therefore include the maintenance of high-quality habitat that contains suitable cavities, supporting the need for protection of mature and old-growth forests as a whole, and not just of cavity bearing trees alone. © 2019

ABSTRACT: During winter, Long-eared Owls (Asio otus) usually roost in groups in urban areas, but their nocturnal movement patterns are less known. The aim of our study is to provide insight into the local-scale urban movement habits of Long-eared Owls. Our study was carried out between 2015 and 2019 in the autumn and winter period, by observations in the early evening and by ringing and recapture of owls in the town of Sombor (NE Serbia). We observed owls when leaving the roosting site located in the town centre following the greenery of the larger avenues towards the outskirts. Owls were sporadically observed in densely built areas of the town, narrow streets with less greenery. Ringing and recapture data suggest that owls were closely linked to the green corridors. They probably used these corridors for easier orientation and to prey on birds roosting in trees in the town, such as sparrows (Passer domesticus, P. montanus), Common Blackbirds (Turdus merula) or Fieldfares (T. pilaris) appearing in harsh winters, and sometimes also pigeons. © 2020 Thomas Oliver Méro et al., published by Sciendo 2020.

ABSTRACT: Kin selection and reciprocation of biological services are distinct theories invoked to explain the origin and evolutionary maintenance of altruistic and cooperative behaviors. Although these behaviors are not considered to be mutually exclusive, the costbenefit balance of behaving altruistically or cooperating reciprocally and the conditions promoting a switch between such different strategies have rarely been tested. Here, we examine the association between allofeeding, allopreening, and vocal solicitations in wild barn owl (Tyto alba) broods under different food abundance conditions: natural food provisioning and after an experimental food supplementation. Allofeeding was performed mainly by elder nestlings (hatching is asynchronous) in prime condition, especially when the cost of forgoing a prey was small (when parents allocated more prey to the food donor and after food supplementation). Nestlings preferentially shared food with the siblings that emitted very intense calls, thus potentially increasing indirect fitness benefits, or with the siblings that provided extensive allopreening to the donor, thus possibly promoting direct benefits from reciprocation. Finally, allopreening was mainly directed toward older siblings, perhaps to maximize the probability of being fed in return. Helping behavior among relatives can therefore be driven by both kin selection and direct cooperation, although it is dependent on the contingent environmental conditions. © 2020 by The University of Chicago.

ABSTRACT: The Bornean subspecies of Rajah Scops-Owl (Otus brookii brookii) has not been documented alive in the wild since its discovery in 1892 and there are no photographs of the bird in life. We report the rediscovery of this subspecies in the montane forests of Mount Kinabalu (Sabah, Malaysia) at an elevation of 1,650 m and provide the first photographs of this subspecies in the wild. Almost all basic elements of this species' ecology remain unknown, including vocalizations, distribution, breeding biology, and population size. Additionally, phylogeographic patterns of montane birds in Borneo and Sumatra, as well as plumage characters, suggest that O. b. brookii may be deserving of species classification. However, the rarity of O. b. brookii has made quantitative phylogenetic analysis impossible. Properly resolving the ecology, distribution, and taxonomic standing of O. b. brookii could have important conservation implications. © 2020 Wilson Ornithological Society. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Ascertaining the risks and benefits of different behaviors is a central goal of research on territoriality. Although most territorial behavior is ritualized, with concomitant reduced risks for both residents and intruders, this ritualization is generally found to be underpinned by rare, highly consequential, interactions. The agonistic behavior of the intertidal owl limpet, Lottia gigantea, involves defense of a feeding territory, and includes a relatively explosive thrusting response by territory holders against intruding conspecifics. We here ask whether this thrusting behavior is capable of entirely dislodging intruders from their rocky wave-swept substratum, thereby ridding the resident of future challenges by that intruder. Our field measurements of the strength of territorial thrusts, as well as thrust resistance, indicate that territorial limpets are strong enough to overcome the resistance of small to medium sized (<40 mm) conspecifics encountered on their territories. Interestingly, at least 44% of the limpets dislodged from the rock substratum during a retreat or territorial response survived in a new location. Growth of these survivors was at least as rapid as that of undisturbed limpets in the old location. We conclude that shell thrusting during the territorial response of Lottia gigantea can reduce the cost of territorial defense by dislodging smaller conspecifics, thereby eliminating them from all future interactions. Conversely, the risk incurred by these smaller conspecifics while intruding onto territories of larger individuals is likely mitigated by the surprisingly high survival rate, and subsequent normal growth, of dislodged limpets. © 2020, © 2020 Dipartimento di Biologia, Università di Firenze, Italia.

ABSTRACT: Background: Cities differ from non-urban environments by the intensity, scale, and extent of anthropogenic pressures, which can drive the occurrence, physiology, and behavior of the organisms thriving in these settings. Traits as green cover often predict the occurrence patterns of bird species in urban areas. Yet, anthropogenic noise and artificial light at night (ALAN) could also limit the presence and disrupt the behavior of birds. However, there is still a dearth of knowledge about the influence of urbanization through noise and light pollution on nocturnal bird species ecology. In this study, we assessed the role of green cover, noise, and light pollution on the occurrence and vocal activity of the Mottled Owl (Ciccaba virgata) in the city of Xalapa (Mexico). Methods: We obtained soundscape recordings in 61 independent sites scattered across the city of Xalapa using autonomous recording units. We performed a semi-automated acoustic analysis of the recordings, corroborating all Mottled Owl vocalizations. We calculated two measures of anthropogenic noise at each study site: daily noise (during 24 h) and masking noise (mean noise amplitude at night per site that could mask the owl's vocalizations). We further performed generalized linear models to relate green cover, ALAN, daily noise, and masking noise in relation to the owl's occurrence (i.e., detected, undetected). We also ran linear models to assess relationships among the beginning and ending of vocal activity with ALAN, and with the anthropogenic and masking noise levels at the moment of which vocalizations were emitted. Finally, we explored variations of the vocal activity of the Mottled Owl measured as vocalization rate across time. Results: The presence of Mottled Owls increased with the size of green cover and decreased with increases in both artificial light at night and noise levels. At the temporal scale, green cover was positively related with the ending of the owl's vocal activity, while daily noise and ALAN levels were not related to the timing and vocal output (i.e., number of vocalizations). Furthermore, the Mottled Owl showed a marked peak of vocal activity before dawn than after dusk. Although anthropogenic noise levels varied significantly across the assessed time, we did not find an association between high vocal output during time periods with lower noise levels. Conclusions: Spatially, green cover area was positively related with the presence of the Mottled Owl in Xalapa, while high noise and light pollution were related to its absence. At a temporal scale, daily noise and ALAN levels were not related with the timing and vocal output. This suggests that instead of environmental factors, behavioral contexts such as territoriality and mate interactions could drive the vocal activity of the Mottled Owl. Further studies need to incorporate a wider seasonal scale in order to explore the variation of different vocalizations of this species in relation to environmental and biological factors. © 2020 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The behavioural ecology of host species is likely to affect their microbial communities, because host sex, diet, physiology, and movement behaviour could all potentially influence their microbiota. We studied a wild population of barn owls (Tyto alba) and collected data on their microbiota, movement, diet, size, coloration, and reproduction. The composition of bacterial species differed by the sex of the host and female owls had more diverse bacterial communities than their male counterparts. The abundance of two families of bacteria, Actinomycetaceae and Lactobacillaceae, also varied between the sexes, potentially as a result of sex differences in hormones and immunological function, as has previously been found with Lactobacillaceae in the microbiota of mice. Male and female owls did not differ in the prey they brought to the nest, which suggests that dietary differences are unlikely to underlie the differences in their microbiota. The movement behaviour of the owls was associated with the host microbiota in both males and females because owls that moved further from their nest each day had more diverse bacterial communities than owls that stayed closer to their nests. This novel result suggests that the movement ecology of hosts can impact their microbiota, potentially on the basis of their differential encounters with new bacterial species as the hosts move and forage across the landscape. Overall, we found that many aspects of the microbial community are correlated with the behavioural ecology of the host and that data on the microbiota can aid in generating new hypotheses about host behaviour. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

ABSTRACT: Biodiversity is declining across Europe. Modern agricultural practices, habitat fragmentation, land abandonment and climate change are key factors causing current trends in environmental change. Mobile organisms such as raptors, positioned high in the food chain, are good indicators of negative or positive landscape dynamics, since their response is fast. This assumption was tested by investigating the Scops Owl (Otus scops) population in a traditional Central European cultural landscape (Goričko Nature Park [GNP]) in Slovenia. The negative trend in male calling Scops Owls was correlated with static and dynamic environmental change variables derived from remotely sensed or field-based, multi-temporal data sources. Key geospatial predictors were identified and used for bird calling and breeding (C&B) suitability modelling. All geospatial models developed predicted a decline in C&B suitability (even by 33%) in almost all areas where the bird is currently active. However, the NE part of the GNP could achieve better C&B conditions for theScops Owl in the coming years (a potential 36% increase in suitability). Predictions indicate that more effort and action, to conserve the Scops Owl in the study area should be implemented in the N, NE and E part of the hilly GNP. Our results are thus highly applicable not just for decision makers in this protected area but rather in all areas across the Scops Owl's continental population, since the methodology is easily replicable and transferable. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: In the present study, we analysed the variation of breeding parameters and the diet composition of the Common Barn-owl (Tyto alba) in three different demographic phases of the Common Vole (Microtus arvalis) in a complete population cycle between two outbreaks. The study was conducted in the south-eastern part of the Transdanubian region in South Hungary. For the analysis, we used data of 81 randomly selected first clutches from 2015 to 2019, a time period which represented a full demographic cycle of the Common Vole after the 2014 outbreak with an exceptionally high peak. We tested the impact of prey abundance and diversity of diet composition as continuous predictors as well as the demographic phase of Common Vole and the mesoregion as categorical explanatory variables on the measured reproductive outputs as response variables using Generalized Linear Models (GLM). Considering the breeding parameters, the number of fledglings, and fledging and reproductive success were significantly higher in the increase phase than during the vole crash phase. Based on GLM models, our results demonstrated that the clutch size of the Common Barn-owl is determined ultimately by the availability and consumption rate of the Common Vole as main prey, while other small mammal prey categories did not affect the clutch size. These results support the finding that the clutch size of vole-eating raptors and owls, which begin breeding periods in early spring predicts the vole abundance in this early spring period. Considering the other investigated small mammal prey groups, the alternative prey role was confirmed only in case of the Murid rodent prey categories (Apodemus spp., Muridae). © 2020 Adrienn Horváth et al., published by Sciendo 2020.

ABSTRACT: Tularemia is a widely spread zoonotic disease in the northern hemisphere, caused by the bacterium Francisella tularensis. In humans, tularemia is an acute febrile illness with incidence peaks in late summer to early autumn of outbreak years, but there is no early warning system in place that can reduce the impact of disease by providing timely risk information. In this study, we revisit previously unpublished data on F. tularensis in water, sediment, soil, and small mammals from 1984 in northern Sweden. In addition, we used human case data from the national surveillance system for tularemia in the same year. In the environmental and small mammal material, bank vole (Myodes glareolus) samples from urine and bladder were the only samples that tested positive for F. tularensis. The prevalence of F. tularensis among trapped bank voles was 13.5%, although all six bank voles that were retrieved from owl nest boxes in early May tested positive. Forty-two human tularemia cases were reported from August to December in 1984. Based on these results, we encourage investigating the potential role of tularemia-infected bank voles retrieved from owl nest boxes in spring as an early warning for outbreaks of tularemia among humans in summer and autumn of the same year. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.

ABSTRACT: I report on the nesting ecology of the Northern Pygmy-Owl (Glaucidium gnoma) in northwestern Oregon based on 71 breeding attempts, including observations at 66 nest cavities during 12 years of study (2007-2013, 2016-2020). I focus on the annual shift in the start of laying and in productivity (clutch size) in relation to prey composition. For all years combined, the start of laying spanned 2 months (27 Mar-30 May). The mean annual start of laying varied across consecutive years by nearly 3 weeks (19.0 ± 6.5 d); mean productivity at nests varied annually by 23% (1.2 ± 0.5 eggs). Observed clutch size was most frequently 5 or 6 eggs (5.6 ± 0.9, range 4-8 eggs, n = 47), but most clutches in early-nesting years were 6 or 7 eggs, and 4 or 5 eggs in late-nesting years. The mean incubation and nestling periods were 29.4 ± 1.1 d and 26.4 ± 1.2 d, respectively. Pygmy-owls fledged a mean of 5.1 ± 1.1 young at 58 successful nests and 4.2 ± 2.2 for all breeding attempts. Vertebrate prey composition varied annually and seasonally. Pygmy-owls took mammalian prey more often early in the breeding season (66% of vertebrate prey) and in early-nesting years (65%); avian prey were more frequently taken late in the breeding season (66%) and in late-nesting years (66%). Pygmy-owls nested disproportionately in coniferous trees (χ2= 67.48, P < 0.001, df = 1, n = 66); nests in western redcedars (Thuja plicata) fledged 1.5 more owlets and failed less often (5% failed) than nests in other tree species (22% failed). Observations at this largest ever collection of Northern Pygmy-Owl nests reveal a commitment by these small owls (1) to produce young annually, even when they had to overcome obstacles such as mate procurement, mate loss, and nest depredation, and (2) to use mammalian prey to increase productivity in some years. © 2020 Wilson Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Passive acoustic monitoring using autonomous recording units (ARUs) is a fast-growing area of wildlife research especially for rare, cryptic species that vocalize. Northern Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) populations have been monitored since the mid-1980s using mark-recapture methods. To evaluate an alternative survey method, we used ARUs to detect calls of Northern Spotted Owls and Barred Owls (S. varia), a congener that has expanded its range into the Pacific Northwest and threatens Northern Spotted Owl persistence. We set ARUs at 30 500-ha hexagons (150 ARU stations) with recent Northern Spotted Owl activity and high Barred Owl density within Northern Spotted Owl demographic study areas in Oregon and Washington, and set ARUs to record continuously each night from March to July, 2017. We reviewed spectrograms (visual representations of sound) and tagged target vocalizations to extract calls from ∼160,000 hr of recordings. Even in a study area with low occupancy rates on historical territories (Washington's Olympic Peninsula), the probability of detecting a Northern Spotted Owl when it was present in a hexagon exceeded 0.95 after 3 weeks of recording. Environmental noise, mainly from rain, wind, and streams, decreased detection probabilities for both species over all study areas. Using demographic information about known Northern Spotted Owls, we found that weekly detection probabilities of Northern Spotted Owls were higher when ARUs were closer to known nests and activity centers and when owls were paired, suggesting passive acoustic data alone could help locate Northern Spotted Owl pairs on the landscape. These results demonstrate that ARUs can effectively detect Northern Spotted Owls when they are present, even in a landscape with high Barred Owl density, thereby facilitating the use of passive, occupancy-based study designs to monitor Northern Spotted Owl populations.  © American Ornithological Society 2020.

ABSTRACT: The shoulder girdle gives strength and range of motion to the wings of birds and plays a functional role in flight mechanism of birds. The present study was designed to compare the morphological features of shoulder girdle bones in crested serpent eagle and brown wood owl. The shoulder girdle comprised of the scapula, coracoid and fused clavicle i.e. furculum in both species. The proximal extremities of bones of shoulder girdle formed a foramen triosseum in both the species for tendon of supracoracoideus muscle. The proximal end of the scapula of crested serpent eagle presents a pneumatic foramen which was absent in the brown wood owl. The coracoid of crested serpent eagle presents a large pneumatic foramen at the medial surface of the acrocoracoid process. A piercing type of foramen was characteristic in the coracoid of both species. Procoracoid process was triangular in shape with a broad base in both the species with pointed apex in brown wood owl and short apex in crested serpent eagle. The clavicle was thin, slender and highly curved in crested serpent eagle, whereas it was slender and rod-like in brown wood owl. Numerous pneumatic foramina were present in the proximal extremity of the clavicle of the crested serpent eagle, which were few in brown wood owl. The distal extremity of both clavicle fused to form a hypocleideum in crested serpent eagle, which was absent in brown wood owl. © 2020 Agricultural Research Communication Centre.

ABSTRACT: The Northern Saw-whet Owl (Aegolius acadicus) is a highly migratory owl that occurs throughout North America. Banding stations have studied the migratory habits of this species, but these studies rarely collect significant data regarding the origin of migrant birds captured in the midwestern United States. In the last 20 years Northern Saw-whet Owl ecology has been studied broadly; however, little is known how different populations may interact with one another. Many avian species with large geographic ranges often have populations that breed and winter in separate areas. Little has been documented to establish if this pattern exists in Northern Saw-whet Owls, a species where individuals are migratory, sedentary, and nomadic. Stable isotope ratios using deuterium δ2H in feathers have been successfully used to estimate the breeding origin of birds. We used stable isotope analysis of δ2H in conjunction with an isoscape map to determine breeding origins for Indiana Northern Saw-whet Owls. We collected 41 feather samples from migrating owls at 6 different banding sites across Indiana from October to November 2017. Because higher enrichment values in adult owl feathers complicate analysis, we only analyzed samples from young (hatching-year) individuals. After analysis and exclusion of birds identified as outliers, the model suggested that the birds originated along 44°N around the Great Lakes Region and as far east as Nova Scotia, Canada. When including outliers, the model suggested that individuals originated along 40°N between Iowa and New York. The outliers-excluded model remained more consistent with the known breeding range of this species than the outliers-included model. We successfully used this technique and our data suggests that the majority of Northern Saw-whet Owls originated from the Great Lakes Region. We recommend further investigation on the physiology and behavior of owls on the breeding grounds, which could aid in the ability to better understand differences in Î´2H enrichment of this species. Better understanding of this would allow these models to be plotted more precisely onto the landscape. © 2020 Wilson Ornithological Society. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Birds show huge variation in color displays evolved for communication. However, among colored phenotypic traits, eyes remain largely overlooked, with only a few studies suggesting a potential signaling function or a role in mate recognition and crypsis. Iris color is a remarkably striking feature in the wholly cryptic pattern of many owls, and may potentially play a signaling function, a possibility so far neglected. Here, we studied variation and potential signaling of iris yellowness as an indicator of quality in parent-offspring communication and other social contexts in the Little Owl (Athene noctua) and Eurasian Scops-Owl (Otus scops). Yellowness did not differ between the sexes; however, adults of the two species had more intensely yellow irises than owlets. Most of variation in iris yellowness of owlets occurred between rather than within nests and seemed to be linked to parental qualities of Little Owls, but was unrelated to condition among Eurasian Scops-Owl owlets. In adults, however, we found that iris yellowness of females was positively associated with nest success (an index of female fitness) in Little Owls, but not in Eurasian Scops-Owls. This study suggests that iris color variation is unlikely to play a role in parent-offspring communication for these two owl species, but that iris yellowness of female Little Owls may potentially play a signaling role in social contexts, a possibility that should be studied in the future. © 2020 Ornithological Societies of North America.

ABSTRACT: The quality and quantity of yield in palm plantations are reduced due to inevitable factors such as pests, diseases, and weeds. Furthermore, owls (Tytonidae) play a role as potential predators to control rats, the major pest. Therefore, this study aims to observe the reproduction patterns, predation, and nesting behavior of Tyto rosenbergii. To achieve this, direct observation and the installation of a camera trap in the nest box was adopted. Furthermore, a predation test was carried out by feeding the owls with rats daily in a cage measuring 4m x 8m x 6m. The results showed that the number of eggs produced ranged from 2 to 6, with an average of 3.85. Also, the Percentage of hatching ranges between 0-100% with an average of 80.77%, and that of chicks that survive to the fully feathered is 51%. In addition, T. rosenbergii was able to prey on 1-4 rats per night, and its activity mostly occurs outside the cage than inside, except when they had a reproductive season. © 2020, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

ABSTRACT: Migratory birds are demonstrating changes in phenology linked to climate change. Understanding these changes requires connecting events that occur over the multiple regions occupied during their annual cycle. The Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia) is a species of concern in North America, with pronounced declines in regions of the Great Plains. Using a dataset that spanned 10 breeding sites from South Dakota to northern Mexico in various years during 1989-2017, we observed both advances and delays in nesting along with increasing variation in nest initiation dates. We examined the effects of a large-scale climate system (El Niño Southern Oscillation), drought, and local weather patterns throughout the annual cycle as potential predictors of early and late nesting. Moisture conditions during the winter and spring migratory period had the greatest influence on nest phenology. Years with more intense drought on winter and migratory grounds increased the probability of nests initiating late relative to early. Correspondingly, wet conditions were associated with an increased probability of early nest initiation. Drought likely has cascading ecological effects that negatively influence food abundance for Burrowing Owls, resulting in delays in the ability of individuals to meet energetic demands required for migration. How climate change will impact Burrowing Owl phenology is important considering a projected increase in the magnitude and frequency of drought and declining owl population trends.

ABSTRACT: During the 2016 breeding season we monitored 169 nest boxes suitable for Boreal Owl (Aegolius funereus) and Northern Saw-whet Owl (Aegolius acadicus) in high-latitude (>55°N) boreal forests of northwestern Alberta affected by partial logging. Despite the large number of boxes deployed, the number of boxes used by Boreal and Northern Saw-whet Owls was small. Boreal Owls used nest boxes (n = 4) in conifer-dominated stands with three being in uncut blocks and the other in a 50% green tree retention cut-block. In contrast, Northern Saw-whet Owls used boxes (n = 4) in a broader range of cover types, breeding in boxes placed in stands with at least 20% post-harvest tree retention. Although both species successfully bred in the same landscape, Boreal Owls produced fewer eggs (mean = 2.5) and raised fewer young (mean = 0.5) than Northern Saw-whet Owls (5 and 2.25, respectively). Furthermore, our observed Boreal Owl egg production was lower than has been found for the same species nesting in nest boxes in different regions or forest types. In contrast, breeding parameters of Northern Saw-whet Owls were similar to that found in nest boxes in the eastern boreal region of Canada and in the southern part of its range. © 2020 Canadian Field-Naturalists' Club.

ABSTRACT: Rises in abundance of a population in response to increased resources is often followed by a rise in predator abundance. The non-threatened eastern barn owl (Tyto alba delicatula) and the threatened eastern grass owl (Tyto longimembris) are predators that may have occupancy patterns linked with prey abundance. It is important to identify the resources that cause increases in primary prey items to further understanding of the ecology of these species. Here I test the hypothesis that grass seeds cause increased abundances of wetland-dwelling house mice (Mus musculus) in austral summer, and identify a wetland monocot that provides a food recourse to achieve this effect, as well as report eastern grass owl and barn owl observations. A 2.6 ha wetland area (on Kooragang Island, New South Wales) was surveyed almost weekly to quantify abundance of prey items from September to April for three years (2016-2019). Typha sp. (a monocot) had flowering periods that coincided with increases in house mouse observations (n = 90 in flowering, n = 2 in non-flowering), where 22% were detected feeding on Typha flowers/seeds or fleeing from flower stalks. Eastern grass owls were only observed during a Typha flowering period (n = 3). These observations confirmed the original hypothesis and led to the formulation of another hypothesis: wetland occupancy by eastern grass owls is influenced by Typha flowering. Future studies should aim to test this hypothesis and identify other wetland plants that provide an important food source for wetland-dwelling rodents.  © 2019 CSIRO.

ABSTRACT: Long-eared owls (Asio otus) are common avian predators in Turkey. Their diet consists primarily of small mammals, but they also feed on bats, birds, amphibians, reptiles, insects, and fish. Limited research has been conducted on long-eared owl diets and pellet characteristics in Turkey, yet this knowledge would improve our understanding of their ecological role in the environment. We investigated prey items in pellets at winter sites of Asio otus in Edirne, Kirklareli, Tekirdag, and Istanbul. We collected 2143 pellets from winter sites and counted 3458 prey items. We identified 30 taxa including 16 mammals, 12 birds and 2 insects. Asio otus primarily consumed small mammal species (97.9%) which consisted mainly of rodents (89.6%, including Cricetidae 45.95%, Muridae 43.7%), Eulipotyphla (1.2%), and unidentified mammals (7.1%). A small proportion of birds (1.9%) and insects (0.2%) also were consumed. Asio otus inhabited small coniferous woodlands at edge of farmlands during winter, but their diet varied with location. Muridae were primarily consumed in Istanbul and Tekirdag, whereas Cricetidae were mostly consumed in Klrklareli and Edirne. Our study shows that Asio otus feeding habits shift depending on prey abundance and that they are not specialists for Microtus species only. © 2020 Polish Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The diet composition of a resident pair of the Long-eared Owl (Asio otus) was investigated from a pine stand in southern Jordan. 111 intact and 40 fragmented pellets yielded a total of 181 individual prey items representing at least 3 rodents and 4 urban birds. Prey items were dominated by house sparrows (43.65%), greenfinches (18.78%) and rodents (15.5%) which were found in 40, 16 and 26 pellets, respectively. The results suggest that the Long-eared Owl is an opportunistic feeder preying on a wide spectrum of small vertebrates. Contrary to several reports elsewhere -including the Mediterranean region-where small mammals dominated the diet of the Long-eared Owl, birds were the most frequent prey item found in this study. The fact that the Long-eared Owl roosting in a pine plantation in Jordan depends so heavily on House Sparrows indicates the importance of forest fragments and urban avifauna for survival of this raptor at the southern edge of its distribution range. © 2020.

ABSTRACT: A large assemblage of small mammal and other small vertebrate bones was excavated within a relatively small area of a single room in a Roman villa close to the River Thames in South Oxfordshire. It is argued that these bones are the remains of barn owl pellets and that their presence shows that the roof on this room at least had remained intact for some time after either the entire building or this particular part of it had been abandoned as human habitation. The remains of several juvenile black rats were contained within the assemblage, making this the first record of black rats from a rural Romano-British setting in Oxfordshire and adding to the extremely small corpus of records of this species from a non-urban location anywhere in the country. Radiocarbon dates place the presence of rats and the abandonment of the villa during the second half of the fourth century. © Association for Environmental Archaeology 2019.

ABSTRACT: Owls are top predators poorly studied in the Neotropics. Their occurrences can be affected by forest structure and landscape features. We report Tropical Screech-Owl (Megascops choliba) and Ferruginous Pygmy- Owl (Glaucidium brasilianum) detections in relation to habitat characteristics in central Argentina. During the spring of 2019, we surveyed 250 ha of mountain forest, measured habitat characteristics in presences/absences sites, and estimated owls’ densities. M. choliba (0.16 individuals/ha) was positively associated with snag whereas G. brasilianum (0.05 individuals/ha) was positively associated with proportions of small trees. Our results suggest that these habitat characteristics might be important covariates when studying these two species. © 2020, Association Ornitologica del Plata. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Glucocorticoid hormones, such as corticosterone, are crucial in regulating daily life metabolism and energy expenditure, as well as promoting short-term physiological and behavioural responses to unpredictable environmental challenges. Therefore, glucocorticoids are considered to mediate trade-offs between survival and reproduction. Relatively little is known about how selection has shaped glucocorticoid levels. We used 15 years of capture–recapture and dead recovery data combined with 13 years of corticosterone and breeding success data taken on breeding barn owls (Tyto alba) to investigate such trade-offs. We found that survival was positively correlated with stress-induced corticosterone levels in both sexes, whereas annual and lifetime reproductive success (i.e. the sum of young successfully fledged during the entire reproductive career) was positively correlated with both baseline and stress-induced corticosterone levels in females only. Our results suggest that, in the barn owl, the stress-induced corticosterone response is a good proxy for adult survival and lifetime reproductive success. However, selection pressure appears to act differently on corticosterone levels of males and females. © 2020 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

ABSTRACT: The avian family of barn owls (Tytonidae, Strigiformes) is the most geographically widespread group of owls in the world and one of the most common accumulators of small mammal bone and tooth remains recovered from archaeological and palaeontological sites. The present study analyses the taphonomic characteristics of modern barn owl pellet-derived small mammal bone and tooth accumulations at three roosting sites from the central Monte Desert, one of the most arid regions of South America. In order to identify the taphonomic signature of this predator in the formation of zooarchaeological and palaeontological accumulations, taxonomic structure, relative abundance of skeletal elements, bone and teeth breakage patterns, and digestion were evaluated. Taphonomic results locate the barn owl in modification category 1 (light modifier). Although the general taphonomic results obtained in the present study were similar to a common barn owl pattern, the three samples showed variability both among them and with other samples previously reported in different regions of the world. Very light digestion was detected on incisors, whereas the proportion of digestion on incisors was close to 20%. Cricetid and murid rodents as well as marsupials were detected. Salinomys delicatus, a scarcely known and endangered cricetid species, was recovered. Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The Barn Owl, Tyto alba (Scopoli, 1769), is a nocturnal raptor species. Their diet includes small vertebrates, mainly rodents, and birds. To study their feeding in the desert area of Touggourt, we collected 153 pellets at the Ranou palm grove. We found 468 specimens belonging to 62 species. In terms of abundance, the item more consumed was Rodents (35.9%) followed by Insects (35.2%) and Birds (10.7%). In terms of absolute abundance, the prey more consumed was Brachytrypes megacephalus (21.4 %), followed by an undetermined Lacertidae species (9.2%) and Gerbillus nanus (8.8%). In terms of biomass, rodents contributed more to the diet of Tyto alba (44.66%) than birds (34.3%) and reptiles (12.06%). The highest value of biomass corresponded to Streptopelia sp. (15.7%), followed by Rattus rattus (14.1%) and an undetermined Lacertidae species (11.8%). To our knowledge, this is the first assessment of the diet composition of Tyto alba in the Saharan Touggourt area. © 2020 Fundacion Miguel Lillo. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Owls are predators that perform important ecological functions. There are several threats to owl conservation such as the bioaccumulation of chemicals through environmental contamination. The high probability of bioaccumulation in these animals is related to their role as predators and high trophic positions. The objective of this study was to quantify four elements (cadmium, chromium, nickel, and lead) as the biomarkers of environmental exposure in owls. To this end, we analyzed pellets and feathers of different owl species. These matrices were contaminated with all four elements, with chromium most commonly detected. Chromium and nickel were found in the pellets in all 10 months of the study, and May was the month with the highest concentrations of all the elements. Tyto furcata appears to bioaccumulate more elements in its feathers than Megascops spp. and Athene cunicularia. Our findings showed bioaccumulation of these four elements in owls and their environment. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: This report presents considerations of potential hazards and mitigation measures associated with conducting field research in the context of a pathogenic epidemic or pandemic situation. We use an example of a specific risk assessment developed for advising decisions on initiating or continuing field activities (in this case, mark-resight and passive acoustic monitoring) associated with ongoing research of northern spotted owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States under conditions imposed by the COVID-19 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2) global pandemic. We review the structure of a risk assessment procedure that follows USDA Forest Service policy in general and has specifically been applied to owl research during the current pandemic. The risk assessment framework we used included listing job objectives, job tasks, and potential hazards associated with each task. For each task, we evaluated the severity of the hazard (negligible, moderate, critical, or catastrophic) and the probability of a mishap if the hazard was present (rare, unlikely, possible, likely, or almost certain) and assigned a risk assessment code that identified risks as low, moderate, high, or extremely high. We then described mitigation and abatement measures that we posited would reduce the risk severity or probability, and then scored the residual (decreased) severity, probability, and risk level. We briefly review other potential considerations for a job hazard risk assessment under conditions of pathogenic outbreaks, including considerations for additional costs and administrative duties, working in proximity and unexpected encounters in field situations, and changes in behavior of wildlife. © 2020, USDA Forest Service.

ABSTRACT: Human activities are altering ecosystems and threatening the well-being of wildlife. The study of the stressful effects of human disturbances on animal distribution, physiology and behaviour can provide fundamental insights for wildlife conservation. Here, we assess how two declining birds, the European Roller Coracias garrulus and the European Scops Owl Otus scops, cope with alteration by human activities in farming habitats of the south of Spain. We studied nest distribution, quantified nestling physiology (corticosterone levels in plasma and feathers and body weight close to fledgling) and parental behaviour (feeding rates) of both species along a human alteration gradient. Rollers and Scops Owls used the same type of habitat and their spatial distribution was not determined by individual quality. In Rollers, nestlings raised in scrubland areas had high stress-induced corticosterone levels, possibly due to high predation risk in this habitat. In addition, Rollers and Scops Owls showed opposite relationships with farming activity and human disturbance. Nestling Rollers showed the highest corticosterone levels in feathers, weight and parental feeding rates in areas with intense farming activity. These results suggest that despite the disturbance produced by farming activities, inducing a higher stress in these areas, cultivated areas may, simultaneously, provide parents with a higher abundance of prey which would trigger increased feeding rates and, hence, higher nestling weights. Furthermore, nestling Scops Owls showed the highest stress-induced corticosterone levels in areas close to roads, suggesting that they would be affected by human disturbance due to infrastructures that disturb also at night when Scops Owls are active. Therefore, susceptibility to human disturbance may vary between species, probably due to variation in the daily pattern of human activities and the species' activity rhythm, buffering or exacerbating the effects, which should be considered in future studies on human alterations and birds. © BirdLife International, 2019.

ABSTRACT: Ear asymmetry is an adaptive characteristic present in the order of owls (Strigiformes). It developed independently up to seven times in this taxon and is accompanied by morphological adaptations in bones or soft tissues around or at the ear openings. Within all strigiform species, the Boreal or Tengmalm's owl (Aegolius funereus) possesses a particularly complex bilateral ear asymmetry that results from modifications of the neurocranium and some cartilaginous elements. While the ear asymmetry in adult birds has been described in detail, data on its development is scarce. Here we describe the development of the asymmetric squamoso-occipital wing of A. funereus from its embryonic origin up to adulthood. The asymmetry of the squamoso-occipital wing develops in two phases. Firstly, it originates as a cartilaginous structure in the last ten days before hatching. Its frontal margin shows a bilateral asymmetry from the beginning of its development while the rostro-ventral process stays symmetrical up to post-hatching day 35. Secondly, when the fledglings have already left the nest, the squamoso-occipital wing ossifies. Moreover, the rostro-ventral process on the right side grows towards the eyeball, while there is no relative displacement on the left side. Thus, the developmental process in A. funereus differs from that in the barn owl that develops its soft tissue asymmetry in one phase and completes the asymmetry before hatching. The new data presented here extend our knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the asymmetric skull development in owls. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH

ABSTRACT: The conservation of the Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis) has been the center of a 40-yr conflict between those who wish to conserve owls and old growth forests and those who wish to log trees as commodities. Although the Spotted Owl conflict seems unique because it has lasted so long, it is no different than many other conservation conflicts in which many scientists-and raptor biologists specifically-might find themselves engaged. Therefore, I explore the commonality among conflicts, including specific details of the Spotted Owl case, to illustrate the problems inherent in conservation conflicts and why these disputes last so long. I suggest two general motivations that I believe capture the reasons behind people's willingness to engage in conflict: money and passion. Yet the specific motivations (e.g., economic well-being and ideology) nested within these general motivations are complex and interconnected. This complexity can lead to intractable situations, such as Spotted Owl conservation, which have been defined as "wicked problems"that cannot be resolved to the satisfaction of most. But understanding these broad motivations and identifying the wide variety of specific motivations nested within them may yield opportunities to manage-rather than resolve-a conservation conflict. Accordingly, I present a conceptual overview of the owl situation as a case study, along with some guidelines for raptor biologists working in conflict environments. ©

ABSTRACT: Due to the low detectability of Northern Saw-whet Owls (Aegolius acadicus; hereafter, NSWO) throughout their annual cycle, standardized monitoring during migration allows for population assessments over time. We assessed age-class population trends in NSWO throughout eastern North America using banding data from 7 sites over a 25 year period. Using a mixed linear model, we did not detect any significant trends over time for the total owl count, adult owl count, and juvenile owl count from 1992 to 2017. During the period when all 7 sites were active from 2001 to 2017, trend estimates remained nonsignificant despite showing negative slopes. We confirmed this nonsignificant, negative trend through a similar mixed linear model of NSWO data from Christmas Bird Counts. Our results suggest that NSWO populations across eastern North America have been relatively stable since 1992 throughout their migration and winter ranges and demonstrate the value of standardized banding data for monitoring the regional population status of NSWO. © 2020 Wilson Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Reductions in genetic diversity and genetic connectivity have been documented in some predatory bird species in response to anthropogenic habitat fragmentation. The Southern Boobook (Ninox boobook) is the most common and widely-distributed owl in Australia but declines in abundance have been observed across its range. We used polymorphic microsatellite loci to investigate landscape-scale patterns of genetic variation and spatial genetic structure in boobooks from a variety of fragmented landscape types and relatively undisturbed landscape types across Western Australia. The maximum distance between collection locations of genetic samples was 1391 km. Indirect estimates of connectivity inferred from these genetic data were complemented by direct estimates of post-breeding dispersal of juvenile boobooks gathered from banding data resulting from this and other studies across Australia. We found high genetic diversity in microsatellite markers, weak spatial genetic structuring and no evidence of genetic erosion associated with inbreeding in heavily fragmented landscapes. Bayesian modelling, spatial autocorrelation analysis and principal coordinates analysis suggested a single large panmictic population across all areas sampled. Within the heavily fragmented landscape of an extensive urban area, band re-sightings and recoveries substantiate the considerable capacity of juvenile boobooks to disperse across areas far greater than the distance between patches. We hypothesise that the genetic homogeneity observed in this species is a consequence of long-distance dispersal capacity in addition to their ability as habitat and dietary generalists to make use of highly altered habitats. © 2020 BirdLife Australia.

ABSTRACT: The possible consequences of top predators for the success of restoration actions for animals is still poorly understood. Our main objective was to analyze whether there could be a risk of creating habitats with an excess of predation by top predators when carrying out actions to improve cliff habitats for cliff-nesting birds at mining sites. We surveyed 28 mining sites in Spain to obtain information regarding the Eagle Owl's (Bubo bubo) presence and diet, and analyzed its relationship with the density of cliff-nesting birds and rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus, its main prey) at the mining sites. We detected Eagle Owls in 18 mining sites (64%) and collected enough prey remains in 11 mining sites. A total of 732 minimum number of prey were identified. The diet of the Eagle Owl consisted mainly of mammals (83%) and the proportion of birds in the diet was low (13%). There was no relationship between the presence of Eagle Owls and the density of rabbits in the mining sites, but there was a positive relationship with the density of cliff-nesting birds. We conclude that the Eagle Owl does not seem to exert significant pressure on the cliff-nesting birds, even on wild pigeons, the most abundant cliff-nesting birds in its diet. Restoration projects which promote cliff-nesting birds would not entail a significant risk of generating ecological traps by excess of predation by the Eagle Owl. Furthermore, this species could be favored in restoration plans, as it is a threatened species in some areas in Europe. © 2020 Society for Ecological Restoration

ABSTRACT: The Little Owl is a species with a wide range in the Palearctic. Thirteen subspecies have been described based on small coloration or size differences. Recently, genetic studies in the western portion of the European range have shown the presence of some well distinct clades. We examined the variation in structural size and coloration of Western Palearctic birds, with particular attention to the pattern of light and dark pigmentation on the tail, and we checked for the presence of UV reflection through reflectance spectroscopy. We did not find clear-cut differences in size or plumage between the currently accepted subspecies, nor between individuals pertaining to the different genetic clade areas. There is a trend for individuals from the western genetic clade (Iberia, France, England and central Europe) to have longer tarsus with smaller wings, while individuals from the eastern generic clade (Balkans) have an opposite pattern. Italian birds are intermediate. The tail of Balkan birds has a wider dark pigmentation, with reduced light spots. Little owl feathers do not show reflectance in the UV part of the spectrum. We found a very large variation of morphological and color patterns between individuals collected in the same geographical area. Currently, the arrangement of individuals to any Little owls' subspecies on morphological data appears to be a very difficult task. © 2020, Deutsche Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.

ABSTRACT: We investigated the composition of small mammals at nine locations in the southwestern suburban zone of Warsaw (central Poland) through the analysis of the pellets of the Tawny owl Strix aluco. In total, we recorded 611 individuals of 15 species of small mammal communities in the diet. Rodents constituted the most numerous mammalian order. Among the most abundant prey we recorded were Myodes glareolus (63 individuals = 10.3% of all mammals), Apodemus agrarius (56 individuals = 9.2%) (173), Apodemus flavicollis (54 individuals = 8.8%), Mus musculus (48 individuals = 7.9%) and Microtus arvalis (44 individuals = 7.2%). We recorded also some species rarely captured by the tawny owl: Nyctalus noctula and Mustela nivalis. Species composition of small mammals of the study area resembled city parks, with several species typical for anthropogenic landscape. © 2020, Scientific Publishing House of the Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University.

ABSTRACT: Over the last decades, the European Hamster (Cricetus cricetus) has been declining in many parts of its European range. Due to the lack of recent information on the occurrence and status of the European Hamster in the south-western Carpathian Basin west of the Danube, we used information gathered from prey remains in Common Barn-owl (Tyto alba) pellets. In spite of considerable sampling effort, we retrieved only few hamster remnants. Two skulls were found in Podolje (Croatia) in 2007 and 2016, respectively. Further five hamsters were retrieved from pellets collected in 2017, 11 km to the northwest in Udvar (Hungary). In Sátorhely, 5 km north from Udvar, one roadkill male was found on 27.07.2019. Testimonies from local inhabitants confirmed the current presence of the European Hamster in the area. Our results suggest the presence of a small isolated population in the border area of Croatia (UTM 10 km grid square CR27) and Hungary (CR18, CR19). This small isolated population is on the south-western limit of the range of the species. We presume that the population requires conservation attention because of its isolated position at the edge of the species' range, its small size and low abundance. We call for a transboundary action by nature conservation authorities in Croatia and Hungary. © 2020 Jeno J. Purger et al., published by Sciendo 2020.

ABSTRACT: Barn Owl Tyto alba pellets and loose bones on a cave floor from Amorgos (Cyclades, Greece) were examined and the birds found to have caught at least 39 species of bird, mostly identified from humeri, plus shrews Crocidura suaveolens, a few lizards and dung beetles, in addition to their principal diet of rodents (rats Rattus rattus, mice Apodemus spp. & Mus musculus). Amongst the birds, migrants appeared most vulnerable to owl predation, with some notable exceptions, while resident species were under-represented. The range of bird species found appears to be the largest recorded for any Barn Owl study of a single site. Considerable differences were found in species proportions of taxa in fresh pellets and in loose bones, probably due to differential rates of degradation. Photographs of all humeri are included to aid identification in other studies.  © 2020 Anthony S. Cheke et al., published by Sciendo.

ABSTRACT: As fires in the western United States have become larger and more severe over recent decades, understanding how the changing fire regime affects wildlife has become a key issue for conservation. Spotted owls (Strix occidentalis) associate with late-successional forest characteristics and therefore may be particularly sensitive to structural changes in habitat that result from fire. Previous studies have found varying responses of the owls to forest fire. We investigated the effects of the 2013 Rim Fire on territory selection by California spotted owls within Yosemite National Park, which, unlike the surrounding landscape, has been managed with no commercial logging since the early 1900s and minimal fire suppression since the 1970s. We examined specific habitat characteristics associated with spotted owl presence before and after the fire to understand how fire-induced changes in habitat structure may influence spotted owl territory selection. Spotted owls persisted and nested within the fire perimeter throughout the four post-fire years of our study at rates similar to what we observed in areas of Yosemite that were unaffected by the fire. However, within the fire perimeter, spotted owls avoided areas characterized by >30% percent high severity fire. Prior to the fire, spotted owls selected for areas of high canopy cover relative to the rest of the landscape; after the fire, even though territory centers shifted substantially from pre-fire locations, pre-fire canopy cover remained a stronger predictor of spotted owl presence than post-fire canopy cover, or any other pre- or post-fire habitat variables we assessed. The importance of pre-fire forest structure in predicting owl presence after fire suggests that reported variation in spotted owl population response to different fires across the Sierra Nevada may in part reflect variation in pre-fire forest characteristics, and perhaps different forest management regimes that shaped those characteristics. Pre-fire forest characteristics may impart a legacy of post-fire habitat conditions important to owls that commonly used forest and fire metrics do not effectively describe. Further study of owl response to fire in forests with a broader spectrum of pre-fire forest structure and management regimes is needed to better predict and manage effects of the changing fire regime on spotted owls. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Rodent agricultural pests cause significant food loss every year. Attempts at mitigation via chemical pest control may cause secondary poisoning and harm non-target species. Biological pest control by bolstering barn owl Tyto alba populations through the provision of artificial nest boxes is in use in several countries. The national biological pest control project of Israel began in the early 1980s in the Mediterranean zone and was subsequently expanded to the northwestern Negev desert, including areas adjacent to nature reserves and natural sand dunes, a threatened habitat in Israel. We analyzed prey of barn owls in the northwestern Negev to determine whether owls preyed on non-target endemic, threatened rodents. A total of 14 632 prey items were collected from 95 nesting boxes between 2013 and 2016. We found that barn owls feed on protected and locally endangered species such as Gerbillus andersoni allenbyi (vulnerable − VU), Gerbillus pyramidum (VU), the endemic Meriones sacramenti (endangered) and Gerbillus gerbillus (critically endangered). These species constitute a significant proportion of barn owl diets (sometimes more than half of the prey items in a single nest box), especially in areas under 5 km from sand dunes, suggesting that bolstering the barn owl population may threaten locally endangered species. It could be hypothesized that agricultural crops serve as a resource for endangered species, allowing their numbers to increase, in which case their conservation status should be reassessed. However, extensive rodent trappings in agricultural fields in the region revealed <1% Gerbillus individuals, while in nearby dunes only gerbils were trapped. Insufficient data are available to assess whether or not M. sacramenti could have become a local pest. Our study highlights the risks that may be associated with the use of barn owls as rodent control agents in areas where natural open landscapes and nature reserves are interspersed with agricultural landscapes. © 2020 The Zoological Society of London

ABSTRACT: During routine surveys of owl distributions on St. Catherines Island, we observed naturalized ring-tailed lemurs displaying antipredator responses to owl auditory cues. In the 32 y since the introduction of ring-tailed lemurs to the island, two successful depredation events by two different owl species have been documented. We investigated the behavioral response of ring-tailed lemurs to determine if they responded consistently to social calls from all three owl species present on St. Catherines Island despite size differences among the owl species that could affect the likelihood of them serving as predators on ring-tailed lemurs. We observed while ring-tailed lemurs responded to all the auditory owl calls, they exhibited more intense, longer and more consistent responses to the two larger owl species - the barred owl and great horned owl - relative to the small Eastern screech owl. These data suggest naturalized species are capable of learning threat-sensitive antipredator behaviors to novel predator communities. © 2020 University of Notre Dame. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Ecological studies have been focused on large, rare or endangered species but species which are adapted to traditional agroecosystems or rural environments received less attention. For example, Little owl is a typical inhabitant of agricultural lands and its population had greatly reduced due to the mechanized agriculture. In this paper, we built the first country level habitat suitability map for the little owl and identified the most influential environmental predictor of its distribution in Iran. We used species presence data (177 distribution points) and eight uncorrelated environmental variables to model the species suitable habitats using the maximum entropy approach (Maxent). Results showed that suitable habitats for this species are located in the northwest, parts of north east and southwest of Iran. Distance to forests, distance to human settlements and distance to agricultural lands are the most important determinants of the little owl distribution in Iran. Human migrations from rural areas to the cities and availability of many vacant human settlements surrounded by traditional and semi-modern agricultural landscapes produce suitable habitats for little owl in Iran. © 2020 Ecological Society of China.

ABSTRACT: Animal communication carries the risk of signal exploitation by predators, and thus many prey species will adjust their signals into more discreet messages to conspecifics, or conspicuous antipredator cues. Although rails (Family Rallidae) use the visual display of tail flicking as a warning of vigilance toward predators, how these birds alter their vocal behavior based on perceived predation risk remains little studied. The calls of owls, predatory birds that consume a variety of rallid species and can home in on acoustic cues of their prey, can reduce singing in numerous bird species. We applied remotely activated broadcasts and autonomous recording units to study whether rails in the wetlands of the Lake Calumet region near Chicago, Illinois, would decrease their vocal activity rate following the broadcast of a rallid predator, the Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus). Contrary to predictions, Soras (Porzana carolina) significantly increased vocal activity when exposed to owl vocalizations and decreased vocal activity when exposed to a harmless control. Our results indicate that rails appear to increase their vocal activity as a potential alarm mechanism, likely to reduce predation risk by warning conspecifics. © 2020 Wilson Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: The diet composition of the Desert or Pharaoh Eagle Owl Bubo ascalaphus, was investigated in Eastern Saudi Arabia. 112 regurgitated pellets yielded 203 individual prey items representing at least eleven rodent species, unidentified bird(s), at least one scorpion, and other unidentified insects. Prey items were dominated by rodents (91%) which were found in 96.4% of the pellets. Birds, scorpions, and other insects constituted 2.46, 5.91, and 2.96% of the diet, respectively. Rodents contributed the most in terms of biomass, with the black rat, Rattus rattus, and desert jirds dominating the remains. The results suggested that the Desert Eagle Owl in the arid ecosystem in eastern Saudi Arabia is a highly selective feeder, hunting 1-5 prey items per day (mean±SD 1.77±0.96) mostly from ground-dwelling native and invasive rodents. Prey selection within this human-influenced area likely influenced by the availability and abundance of species and shifting to urban rodents. © 2020 University of Punjab (new Campus).

ABSTRACT: Neotoma magister (Allegheny Woodrat) is a Tier IV species of conservation concern in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Threats across its range include habitat fragmentation, parasites, and predation. Until now, predators have been suggested, but not confidently documented. Here, we use wildlife camera footage to document a predation event of an adult female Allegheny Woodrat by Strix varia (Barred Owl). This is the first documented predation event for this species. Our finding contributes to the growing knowledge of threats to Allegheny Woodrats within their range. © 2020 Humboldt Field Research Institute. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Animals produce vibrations or noises by means of body movements, which can play a role in communication. These behaviors enhance signal transmission or receiver attention and could be specifically used during turn-taking phases of a reciprocal exchange of signals. In the barn owl Tyto alba, nestlings vocalize one after the other to negotiate which individual will have priority access to the impending prey item to be delivered by the parents. Owlets adjust their vocalization to their own hunger level and to their siblings’ vocalization, withdrawing from the contest in front of highly vocal, and hence hungry, motivated nestmates. As sibling negotiation is a multicomponent display, we examined whether body movements could also be part of the negotiation process. To this end, we analyzed whether the vocalizations of one nestling affected its nestmate’s movements in three separate experiments: in natural nests, in the lab, and using a playback procedure. Nestling barn owls move in a variety of ways, such as repeated tapping of the floor with a foot, scratching the floor with claws, or flapping wings. Body movements were more frequent during the turn-taking phases of vocal interactions, when siblings emitted longer calls and at a greater rate. Once an individual monopolized vocal activity, siblings became less vocal and less active. Moreover, owlets produced more noisy body movements during the phases of vocal interactions which are crucial to prevail in negotiation. Non-vocal physical activities might reinforce vocal signals during sibling to sibling (sib–sib) interactions, or reflect owlets’ arousal, in the critical period during which they vocally settle which individual will dominate the competition. © 2020 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Aim: Following the classical MacArthur-Wilson island equilibrium model of species richness, we hypothesize that island size and isolation affect prey composition and diet diversity of predators on islands. We used the barn owl as a model predatory organism that is known for feeding and habitat flexibility and explored the patterns of its diet on Mediterranean islands in relation to the island biogeography and human population density. Location: Mediterranean Islands. Taxon: Barn owl (Tyto alba) and its prey. Methods: Data on taxonomic composition of the barn owl diet were obtained from pellets (Adriatic island of Korčula) and from published studies performed on 18 Mediterranean islands. For each island, diet diversity indices were calculated and correlated with island area, linear distance from the mainland, human population size and density, and geospatial trends. Results: Murinae mice and rats were the dominant prey. The proportion of birds and reptiles consumed was 5 and 18 times higher, respectively, than in Europe in general. Diet diversity correlated with island size, but not island isolation. Island size was also a good predicator of the proportions of the vertebrate prey. Human population density and longitude had no effect on diet diversity. Main conclusions: Diet diversity of the barn owl on Mediterranean islands only partly followed the island biogeography theory. Diet diversity was greater on the larger Mediterranean islands. However, a more diverse diet did not mean a higher number of taxa, but a wider range of abundant and evenly represented taxa. The smaller the islands, the more birds and reptiles were consumed, compared to higher proportions of mammals on the larger islands. These findings support the idea of barn owls’ feeding flexibility and opportunistic predator behaviour. Despite the barn owl being a synanthropic bird, urbanization had no influence on its diet diversity. Also island isolation had no significant effect. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

ABSTRACT: The Long-eared Owl (Asio otus) was chosen as the bird of the year in Hungary by BirdLife Hungary in 2020 to pay more attention to this species. In the present study, we analysed the data collected on the food, changes in the population and the use of the roosting sites of the owls wintering Southeast-Hungary. A total of 4,683 pellets were collected in four winter seasons between 2016 and 2020, of which 5,265 prey animals were identified. We counted the individuals roosting in the winter roosting sites, and from their maximum number we estimated the local population change of the species as well as the success of the breeding. For this, we also used roadkill data from the nearby town, Battonya. The diet of Long-eared Owls in the study area was similar to that observed in other parts of the Carpathian Basin. The smaller differences were mainly due to the different geographical distribution of different prey species. We also identified some species previously having no or very few data, thus we confirmed their stable presence in the area. Different weather factors within the season did not effect owls' diet. The most varied diet was found in the warmest, least snowy winter. Comparing the feeding data with the data from the 1960s and 1970s, it can be seen that the proportion of preys changed significantly. The proportion of House/Steppe Mice decreased by an order of magnitude, while that of rats increased by the same amount over time. The most likely reasons for this may be changes in agricultural cultivation or local demographic conditions (depopulation). In the 2018/19 season, the proportion of Common Vole in the pellets was much higher than in any other years, suggesting this year's gradation of the species. The pellets collected in different roosting sites close to each other typically had the same proportions of prey animals. The maximum number of birds observed at the roosting sites did not correlate with the weather of the given season, but was probably related to the effectiveness of the previous breeding season. The population of the species decreased compared to the early 2000's based on the number of roosting individuals. This may be due to a decline in crow populations. It should be noted, however, that according to both the roadkills in Battonya and the maximum number of the roosting individuals in Kevermes, this drastic decline came to a halt in 2010s. © 2020 László Bozó et al., published by Sciendo 2020.

ABSTRACT: The development of the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has led to massive amounts of VCF (Variant Call Format) files, which have been the standard formats developed with 1000 Genomes Project. At the same time, with the widespread use of biomedical ontologies in the biomedical community, more and more applications have accepted the Web Ontology Language (OWL) as the dominant data format for the specifications of biomedical ontology descriptions, leading to the rapid growth of OWL-based biomedical ontology scale. In this paper, we seek to explore an effective method for the management of VCF-based genetic variants and OWL-based biological ontologies using the MongoDB database. Considering many current applications (such as the short genetic variations database dbSNP, etc.) are transitioning to the new design by using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) to support future massive data expansion and interchanges. We firstly propose a series of rules for the mapping from VCF and OWL files to JSON files, and then present rule-based algorithms for transforming VCF-based genetic variants and OWL-based biological ontologies into JSON objects. On this basis, we introduce effective approaches of integrating the mapped JSON files in MongoDB. Finally, we complement this work with a set of experiments to show the performance of our proposed approaches.

ABSTRACT: A revision of large extinct members of Strigidae described from Quaternary cave deposits in Cuba here reduces the number of valid taxa from five to three. Ornimegalonyx oteroiArredondo, 1958a, is the only valid species of the four previously described in the genus. The type series of Bubo osvaldoiArredondo & Olson, 1994, is revealed to be a composite, comprising two different species in the genera Bubo Duméril, 1805, and OrnimegalonyxArredondo, 1958a, with the latter described herein as a new, diminutive species. © 2020 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Population structure across a species distribution primarily reflects historical, ecological, and evolutionary processes. However, large-scale contemporaneous changes in land use have the potential to create changes in habitat quality and thereby cause changes in gene flow, population structure, and distributions. As such, land-use changes in one portion of a species range may explain declines in other portions of their range. For example, many burrowing owl populations have declined or become extirpated near the northern edge of the species' breeding distribution during the second half of the 20th century. In the same period, large extensions of thornscrub were converted to irrigated agriculture in northwestern Mexico. These irrigated areas may now support the highest densities of burrowing owls in North America. We tested the hypothesis that burrowing owls that colonized this recently created owl habitat in northwestern Mexico originated from declining migratory populations from the northern portion of the species' range (migration-driven breeding dispersal whereby long-distance migrants from Canada and the United States became year-round residents in the newly created irrigated agriculture areas in Mexico). We used 10 novel microsatellite markers to genotype 1,560 owls from 36 study locations in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. We found that burrowing owl populations are practically panmictic throughout the entire North American breeding range. However, an analysis of molecular variance provided some evidence that burrowing owl populations in northwestern Mexico and Canada together are more genetically differentiated from the rest of the populations in the breeding range, lending some support to our migration-driven breeding dispersal hypothesis. We found evidence of subtle genetic differentiation associated with irrigated agricultural areas in southern Sonora and Sinaloa in northwestern Mexico. Our results suggest that land use can produce location-specific population dynamics leading to subtle genetic structure even in the absence of dispersal barriers. © 2020 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: How mate preferences evolve in the first place has been a major conundrum for sexual selection. Some hypotheses explaining this assume fitness benefit derived from subsequent generations. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-based mate choice is a representative example of the mate choice that is associated with such trans-generational mechanisms. To provide evidences for fitness benefit of MHC-based mate choice, previous studies assessed the association between own MHC genotype and own fitness components. However, the association between MHC-based mate choice in the parental generation and fitness components in the resultant offspring generation has only rarely been measured in wild populations. Focusing on the isolated population of the monogamous Ryukyu Scops Owl (Otus elegans interpositus) on Minami-daito Island, Japan, we found evidence of MHC-based mate choice. However, we found no evidence of MHC-based mate choice increasing own reproductive success or offspring survival. This is a rare case study that directly examines the existence of the trans-generational indirect benefit of MHC-based mate choice for genetic compatibility from trans-generational data in a wild bird population. By investigating the fitness benefits of mate choice, this study serves to facilitate our understanding of the evolution of MHC-based mate choice. © 2020 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

ABSTRACT: Knowledge about spatial distribution of owl species is important for inferring species coexistence mechanisms. In the present study, we explore spatial patterns of distribution and habitat selection of four owl species u Eurasian pygmy owl (Glaucidium passerinum), boreal owl (Aegolius funereus), tawny owl (Strix aluco) and Ural owl (Strix uralensis) u ranging in body mass from 50 g to 1300 g, with sympatric occurrence in temperate continuous montane forests in the Veľká Fatra Mts., Western Carpathians, central Slovakia. Locations of hooting owl males were surveyed between 2009-2015 in an area of 317 km2. Spatial point pattern analysis was used for analysis of owl distribution. Random patterns of owls' spatial arrangement dominate at both intra- and interspecific levels within the studied area. Only intraspecific distribution of pygmy owls and interspecific distribution of Ural owls toward tawny owls exhibited positive associations. This discrepancy with other studies can be explained in terms of pygmy owlsy preference for high-quality nest sites and/or spatial clustering in their prey distribution, and due to aggressive behaviour of dominant Ural owls toward subdominant tawny owls, respectively. Moreover, we found considerable overlap in habitat preferences between owl species, considering stand age, stand height, tree species richness, distance to open area, elevation, slope, percentage of coniferous tree species and position on hillslope, although pygmy owls were not registered in pure broadleaved stands, Ural owls were not registered in pure coniferous stands, and boreal and Ural owls were more common on slope summits and shoulders than tawny and pygmy owls. The observed patterns of spatial arrangement might suggest developed coexistence mechanisms in these owl species; differences between studies may indicate complex interactions between intra- and interspecific associations and habitat quality and quantity, food availability and owl species involved in those interactions on a landscape scale.  © 2020 Karol Potnár et al., published by Sciendo 2020.

ABSTRACT: Although the effects of shifting fire regimes on bird populations have been recognized as important to ecology and conservation, the consequences of fire for trophic interactions of avian species – and raptors in particular – remain relatively unknown. Here, we found that within national parks with long-standing (40+ years) fire management programmes, California Spotted Owls Strix occidentalis occidentalis consumed predominantly Woodrats Neotoma spp. and Pocket Gophers Thomomys spp.; however, in contrast to our predictions, when their territories experienced more extensive and frequent fire, Spotted Owls consumed proportionally more Flying Squirrels Glaucomys oregonensis. We hypothesize this finding could have been driven by either changes to prey abundance following fires (e.g. increases in flying squirrels) or changes to prey availability (e.g. shifts in forest structure or flying squirrel spatial distribution that increased predation upon them by owls). Our work thus demonstrates that fire may have unexpected consequences for the trophic interactions of raptor species and provides valuable information for the conservation of Spotted Owls in fire-prone forest landscapes. © 2020 British Ornithologists' Union

ABSTRACT: The study of small prey has been the focus of interest during the past few decades, especially due to its implications for the subsistence and cultural behaviours of human populations. In this regard, a growing body of evidence has shed light on the human exploitation of small prey, including birds. Nevertheless, small animal accumulations are not always a result of anthropogenic inputs, as they are important prey for many other predators (e.g. mammalian carnivores and birds of prey). As a consequence, establishing the taphonomic pattern of each predator is a basic step towards determining the origin of faunal accumulations, and actualistic studies provide essential information in that respect. The present work aims to characterise the avian accumulations generated by the Eurasian eagle-owl for its subsequent application to the archaeological record. To this end, a modern avian accumulation from the small cave of Cau del Duc (Lleida, Spain) was analysed following a taphonomic approach. Our results show specific characteristics fitting with the previous studies carried out on Eurasian-eagle-owl-made bone accumulations, as well as some inputs of mammalian carnivores indicating secondary actions in the faunal assemblage. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: I report on the strength of reversed sexual size dimorphism (RSD) in a local sub-population of Northern Pygmy-Owls (Glaucidium gnoma) in northwestern Oregon (2007-2012) in comparison to range-wide museum specimens examined by Earhart and Johnson (1970). Using Storer's Dimorphism Index (DI), RSD was higher among local breeding pairs (DImass = 6.64, DIwing = 4.90, n = 20 pairs) and among all local specimens (DImass = 6.20, DIwing = 4.39, n = 31 females, n= 23 males) than for specimens range-wide (DImass = 5.45, DIwing = 4.30, n= 10 females, n= 42 males). RSD was also more distinct locally, because mass alone was diagnostic of the sexes at a threshold of 69 g and wing chord was nearly diagnostic, whereas range-wide there was greater intrasexual variation and intersexual overlap in both metrics. Locally, females weighed 75.3 ± 5.6 g (range 69.0-94.2 g), and males weighed 62.5 ± 2.5 g (range 58.5-68.5 g); all local males had wing chords <92 mm (89.2 ± 2.0 mm; range 85.0-91.5 mm), whereas for 90% of females wing chord was ≥92 mm (93.2 ± 1.3 mm; range 89.0-96.0 mm). Clutch size (F1,4 = 1.822, P= 0.248, n= 20) and the number of fledged young (F1,8 = 0.00, P= 0.619, n= 19) were independent of RSD among local breeding pairs. Vertebrate prey composition shifted seasonally and was similar at the 2 scales, with agile avian prey taken most frequently during the breeding season, when the evolutionary consequences of diet on RSD matter most. I found intersexual variation in prey composition at the local scale where males took avian prey more frequently than females. I concluded that RSD in pygmy-owls was stronger at the local scale and that intersexual differences in prey composition may be related to RSD in this species. This study highlights the value of examining multiple scales and seasonal variation in prey composition when evaluating the merits of RSD hypotheses. It also contributes to our understanding of one of the least studied owls in North America. © 2020 Wilson Ornithological Society. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The effect of urbanization on birds typically has been evaluated through comparison of species composition between natural and urbanized habitats. However, few studies have examined the changes in species abundance as an urban area grows. During a 5-year period, we monitored two populations of burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia) nesting in separate urban areas with contrasting development and evaluated the tolerance of this species to increasing urbanization. The study was carried out in two small touristic coastal villages: Mar Chiquita and Camet Norte (Buenos Aires Province, Argentina). We digitalized satellite images and evaluated the interannual advance of the urbanized area at each village while simultaneously recording the changes in the number and location of burrowing owl nests. During the study period, the area occupied by buildings showed a slight change in Mar Chiquita (+ 17%) and a great expansion in Camet Norte (+ 269%). However, the number of owl nests increased in similar proportion in Mar Chiquita (+ 25%) and Camet Norte (+ 26%), and the maximum nest density was also similar for both villages (~ 0.14 nests/ha). Our results indicate that, unlike many raptors that are negatively affected by urbanization, burrowing owls may not be adversely impacted by nesting in areas with moderate levels of urban development. © 2020, © 2020 Dipartimento di Biologia, Università di Firenze, Italia.

ABSTRACT: Small mammals have been seldom used as indicators of biodiversity responses to environmental changes, probably because their long-term population trend in a given area is not easy to monitor. To assess the impact of agricultural intensification in a protected area of northern Italy, we compared the composition of its small mammal communities, as assessed in 1994–1995 and 2015–2016 by the analysis of owl pellets (N = 265 and 302, respectively), which provides an effective and affordable method for assessing changes in the diversity and structure of small mammal assemblages over time. We recorded a sharp reduction in the frequency of occurrence of shrews (Sorex spp. and Crocidura spp.), which were replaced by generalist/anthropophilic rats (Rattus norvegicus) and house mice (Mus domesticus). Overall richness and diversity of the community varied only slightly, while trophic level and functional diversity indices clearly reflected the decline of the predator-level fraction of the community. We could reliably exclude both broad-scale land use- and climate changes as drivers of variation in the composition of small mammal communities and ascribe the decline of insectivores to changes in agricultural practices, namely the increase in cover of maize fields and spread of both herbicides and insecticides. Our results are consistent with the general opinion that crop specialization and increasing chemical inputs reduce the diversity and abundance of invertebrate prey, with bottom-up effects on higher trophic levels. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

ABSTRACT: Eleven of the 12 species of owls (Aves: Strigidae, Tytonidae) known to occur in Manitoba, Canada, were examined for chewing lice (Phthiraptera: Amblycera, Ischnocera) from 1976 to 2015: barn owl (Tyto alba (Scopoli); Aves: Tytonidae) (n = 2), snowy owl (Bubo scandiacus (Linnaeus); Aves: Strigidae) (n = 77), great horned owl (Bubo virginianus (Gmelin); Aves: Strigidae) (n = 262), great grey owl (Strix nebulosa Förster; Aves: Strigidae) (n = 142), barred owl (Strix varia Barton; Aves: Strigidae) (n = 10), northern hawk owl (Surnia ulula (Linnaeus); Aves: Strigidae) (n = 18), short-eared owl (Asio flammeus (Pontoppidan); Aves: Strigidae) (n = 74), long-eared owl (Asio otus (Linnaeus); Aves: Strigidae) (n = 67), eastern screech owl (Megascops aslo (Linnaeus); Aves: Strigidae) (n = 59), boreal owl (Aegolius funereus (Linnaeus); Aves: Strigidae) (n = 47), and northern saw-whet owl (Aegolius acadicus (Gmelin); Aves: Strigidae) (n = 44), a total of 802 owls. No lice were found infesting barn owl (Tyto alba (Scopoli); Aves: Tytonidae) or eastern screech owl (Megascops asio (Linnaeus); Aves: Strigidae). We collected a total of 113 810 lice of 12 species: Kurodaia Uchida (Phthiraptera: Menoponidae) - three species; and Strigiphilus Mjöberg (Phthiraptera: Philopteridae) - nine species. Overall prevalence of infestation ranged from 10.0% to 88.9%. Mean intensity for total lice ranged from 22.4 to 506.5. Infestation parameters for each louse-host combination are provided; prevalence and mean intensity were not related for louse-host species combinations. Distribution of louse infestations was highly aggregated. In all louse-host combinations but one, either females were more prevalent than males or there was no significant deviation from 50:50. Male Strigiphilus ceblebrachys Denny significantly outnumbered females in snowy owls. There was a tendency for louse species to co-occur on the same host specimen. Where sample sizes for owls were large enough, no seasonal patterns in abundance of lice were detected. © Entomological Society of Canada 2019.

ABSTRACT: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a well-documented phenomenon in bacteria from many natural ecosystems, including wild animals. However, the specific determinants and spatial distribution of resistant bacteria and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment remain incompletely understood. In particular, information regarding the importance of anthropogenic sources of AMR relative to that of other biological and ecological influences is lacking. We conducted a cross-sectional study of AMR in great horned owls (Bubo virginianus) and barred owls (Strix varia) admitted to a rehabilitation center in the midwestern United States. A combination of selective culture enrichment and shotgun metagenomic sequencing was used to identify ARGs from Enterobacteriaceae. Overall, the prevalence of AMR was comparable to that in past studies of resistant Enterobacteriaceae in raptors, with acquired ARGs being identified in 23% of samples. Multimodel regression analyses identified seasonality and owl age to be important predictors of the likelihood of the presence of ARGs, with birds sampled during warmer months being more likely to harbor ARGs than those sampled during cooler months and with birds in their hatch year being more likely to harbor β-lactam ARGs than adults. Beyond host-specific determinants, ARG-positive owls were also more likely to be recovered from areas of high agricultural land cover. Spatial clustering analyses identified a significant high-risk cluster of tetracycline resistance gene-positive owls in the southern sampling range, but this could not be explained by any predictor variables. Taken together, these results highlight the complex distribution of AMR in natural environments and suggest that both biological and anthropogenic factors play important roles in determining the emergence and persistence of AMR in wildlife. © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.

ABSTRACT: In 2016, tropical screech owl (Megascops choliba) (Tso) chicks were suddenly found dead in a Japanese breeding facility. We autopsied a 9-day-old Tso and discovered white spots scattered on the liver surface. Multifocal necrosis was diffused, and macrophages had infiltrated the necrotic hepatic lesions. Hepatocytes contained numerous intranuclear inclusion bodies. Immunohistochemical staining detected Adenovirus antigen only in the liver. Next, PCR and sequencing (LC536616) identified Tso Adenovirus (TsoAd). Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) and phylogenic analyzes suggested TsoAd is an owl Aviadenovirus. Our study contributes to an improved understanding of infectious disease among captive raptors. © 2020 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: We studied the diet of two wintering groups of long-eared owls (Asio otus L.) from the town of Silistra. During the winter months of 2013/2014, significant differences in the species composition and proportions of the main small mammals in owls' diet were recorded, due to differences in living conditions. A total of 1538 specimens were established, of which 1500 (97,5%) skeletal parts of small mammals, 36 bird specimens (2,3%) and two Coleoptera specimens. We collected 511 whole pellets in which 1183 specimens were identified; the other specimens were found in scattered pellets' parts. A total of 23 species of small mammals were identified: 5 species of Eulipotyphla, 3 species of Chiroptera and 15 species of Rodentia. Twelve of them were common for the two groups of wintering birds. Significant for the owls' diet were 8 species from the genera Microtus (3 species), Apodemus (3 species) and Mus (2 species). In the first territory (Danube Park), with primary importance were the openly living species - voles (N(number of species) = 54%, B(biomass) = 59%), and in the second (Forest Park Medzhidi Tabia) - forest, field and domestic species of mice (N = 56%, B = 48%). The recorded differences in the small mammal species composition and their percentage share were resulting from the features in landscape structure of the two regions studied, which showed a determining role for the diet of long-eared owls. © 2020 Ecologia Balkanica.

ABSTRACT: Dispersal among breeding sites in territorial animals (i.e. breeding dispersal) is driven by numerous selection pressures, including competition and spatiotemporal variation in habitat quality. The scale and trend of dispersal movements over time may signal changing conditions within the population or on the landscape. We examined 2,158 breeding dispersal events from 694 male and 608 female individually marked Northern Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) monitored over 28 yr on 7 study areas to assess the relative importance of individual (sex, experience), reproductive (annual productivity, mate availability), and environmental (forest alteration, presence of competitor) sources of variation in breeding dispersal distance. Median breeding dispersal distance was 3.17 km, with 99% of all breeding dispersal events <37 km. Mean annual dispersal distances increased by 2.43 km in Oregon and 9.40 km in Washington between 1990 and 2017, which coincided with increases in annual detections of nonnative Barred Owl (S. varia). Frequency of breeding dispersal events, both among and within individuals, also increased over time. Female owls moved farther than males (median of 3.26 and 3.10 km, respectively), and birds with less experience (territory tenure) moved farther than those with more experience. Owls that were single in the year prior to dispersal moved 13-31% farther than those paired prior to dispersal. The greatest environmental change occurring over the course of our study was the expansion of Barred Owl populations. Breeding dispersal distance was positively related to Barred Owls in the study area and disturbance within the originating territory. While it appears that social factors continue to be important drivers of breeding dispersal distance in Spotted Owls, increased competition from Barred Owls and habitat alteration have a contributing effect. Increased breeding dispersal distances should be of concern for conservation efforts and considered in population monitoring because changing dispersal behavior may lead to higher rates of mortality and/or emigration from historical study areas. © 2019 Published by Oxford University Press for the American Ornithological Society 2019.

ABSTRACT: Long-term monitoring of the Masked Owl Tyto novaehollandiae in a semi-urban landscape before, during and after large-scale habitat removal identified a positive response in breeding activity in the short-term and a change in prey selectivity. Over the longer term, the loss in habitat had a negative impact on site fidelity.A pair of Masked Owls exhibited high fidelity to a particular breeding territory before and during the removal of large areas of habitat within this territory. Breeding success occurred over two consecutive seasons during the removal of known habitat and other disturbance events at which time the pair and their offspring were observed to exploit disturbed habitat and newly created forest edges in search of prey. Breeding activity was supported by an increased dietary focus on introduced rodents and other mammals displaced during habitat clearing. Fidelity to the breeding territory became more irregular post-disturbance and after two years the territory appeared to be abandoned.This response may suggest that the cumulative loss of habitat for established pairs as a result of urban expansion is likely to adversely affect reproductive success and site fidelity in the longer term. © 2020 Royal Zoological Society of New South Wales.

ABSTRACT: With heart-shaped face, buff back and wings, and pure white underparts, the barn owl is a distinctive and much-loved bird which has fascinated people from many cultures throughout history. How did the barn owl colonise the world? What adaptations have made this bird so successful? How is the increasing impact of human disturbance affecting these animals? Answering these questions and more, Roulin brings together the main global perspectives on the evolution, ecology and behaviour of the barn owl and its relatives, discussing topics such as the high reproductive potential, physiology, social and family interaction, pronounced colour variation and global distribution. Accessible and beautifully illustrated, this definitive volume on the barn owl is for researchers, professionals and graduate students in ornithology, animal behaviour, ecology, conservation biology and evolutionary biology, and will also appeal to amateur ornithologists and nature lovers. © Cambridge University Press 2020.

ABSTRACT: We quantified the effects of barred owls (Strix varia) on fine-scale (~2 ha), spatially explicit selection of putative foraging habitat by 175 radio-tagged northern spotted owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) from 1998 to 2012 in western Oregon and northern California, USA. We constructed annual nighttime discrete-choice resource selection functions (RSFs) for northern spotted owls in 8 study areas. We compared RSFs from pooled data from 4 study areas where barred owls were absent or rare (≤14% of spotted owl territories potentially influenced by barred owls) with RSFs from 4 study areas where barred owls were abundant (≥89% of spotted owl territories potentially influenced by barred owls), and we conducted a meta-analysis of all 8 study areas. Top-ranked RSFs for individual study areas indicated that the relative probability a forest patch was selected by northern spotted owls for foraging was most strongly associated with basal area of large coniferous trees (≥66 cm diameter at breast height [dbh]) or quadratic mean diameter (QMD, the diameter of trees of average basal area) of all coniferous trees. The influence of such trees was non-linear, usually quadratic, in 7 study areas, suggesting that an optimal basal area of large-diameter trees or QMD may be associated with selection of foraging patches. The relative probability of selection of such trees decreased nonlinearly with increasing distance from nest sites in ≥4 study areas. Basal area of all or specific hardwood tree species was linearly associated with increases in the relative probability of a patch being used for foraging in 7 of 8 study areas. The relative probability of selection was also positively associated with densities of large snags (>50 cm dbh), coarse woody debris, and undergrowth shrubs in most study areas where we estimated those covariates. The relative probability that a patch was selected decreased nonlinearly with increasing distance from streams (7 study areas), increasing elevation (5 study areas), and decreasing slope (5 study areas). Barred owls exerted strong effects on habitat selection by spotted owls, which may have attempted to minimize interference competition via spatial segregation. Spotted owls occupying study areas where barred owls were abundant used foraging patches at greater distances from streams, at greater distances from nest sites, and on steeper and warmer slopes than those occupying areas with few or no barred owls. In addition, northern spotted owls in areas where barred owls were abundant exhibited reduced selection for large-diameter trees close to nest sites but may have compensated by increasing use of large trees in home-range locations distant from nest sites. Programs that seek to improve the link between spotted owl demographic performance or occupancy rate and habitat conditions should account for the influences of fine-scale variation in vegetation composition and structure and physiographic conditions. Forest managers may contribute to spotted owl conservation via silvicultural prescriptions that retain coarse woody debris and large snags, promote undergrowth shrubs, and retain intermediate to high densities of large, old shade-intolerant early-seral trees and riparian hardwoods within and beyond core areas surrounding nest sites. © 2019 The Wildlife Society. © 2019 The Wildlife Society

ABSTRACT: Primates use different types of vocalizations in a variety of contexts. Some of the most studied types have been the long distance or loud calls. These vocalizations have been associated with mate defense, mate attraction, and resource defense, and it is plausible that sexual selection has played an important role in their evolution. Focusing on identified individuals of known sex and age, we evaluated the sexual dimorphism in a type of loud calls (hoots) in a population of wild owl monkeys (Aotus azarae) in Argentina. We found evidence of sexual dimorphism in call structure, with females and males only emitting one type of call, each differing in dominant frequency and Shannon entropy. In addition, both age-related and sex-specific differences in call usage were also apparent in response to the removal of one group member. Future acoustic data will allow us to assess if there are individual characteristics and if the structure of hoot calls presents differences in relation to the social condition of owl monkeys or specific sex responses to variants of hoot calls’ traits. This will provide deeper insights into the evolution of vocal mechanisms regulating pair bonding and mate choice strategies in this and other primate species. © 2019, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Luque-Fernández CR. 2019. Diet and behavior of the burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia) in Atiquipa, an ecosystem of Lomas in the south of Peru. Biodiversitas 20: 137-143. The study of trophic and behavioral habits is a fundamental aspect in the knowledge of the natural history of species, especially for those that present a wide range of distribution and that have to adapt to the habitats and available resources that can find to survive. The diet and behavior of Athene cunicularia were studied in a peculiar ecosystem such as the lomas formation, on the arid coast of southern Peru. The analysis of regurgitated pellets from a family group of Athene cunicularia was used and complemented with the monitoring of behavior through the use of trap cameras and direct observati ons. The results show that the diet during the months of study was based on a high proportion of invertebrate beetles (Tenebrionidae) and scorpions, also finding remains of vertebrates, including rodents, birds and highlighting the presence of a species of marsupial mouse. On the study of behavior, marked and recurrent activities are established during the day for this species, where grooming sessions are frequently reported, as well as interaction with a possible predator of this owl species. These results contribute to the understanding of the trophic relationship and its role in the studied lomas ecosystem, which is added to the importance of this species in the conservation of diversity in desert ecosystems. © 2020, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

ABSTRACT: Isoflurane anesthesia is commonly used for owls when they are being rehabilitated to minimize stress during treatments and procedures, as well as to ensure caretaker safety. However, the effects of isoflurane anesthesia on the hematologic response of owls are not known. To investigate the effects of isoflurane anesthesia on the hematology of owls, 3 phases of investigation were performed on the subject animals: 1) single, short manual- versus single, short isoflurane-restraint episodes (n = 12; 38%); 2) a single, prolonged isoflurane episode (n = 10; 31%); and 3) serial, short isoflurane episodes (n = 10; 31%). All owls were classified as adult, and the sex for most individuals was unknown. Twelve owls (38%) were included in phase 1: 5 great horned owls (Bubo virginianus; 42%), 2 eastern screech owls (Megascops asio; 17%), and 5 barred owls (Strix varia; 42%). A separate cohort of 10 novel owls (31%) were selected for inclusion in both phases 2 and 3: 4 great horned owls (40%), 2 eastern screech owls (20%), 2 barred owls (20%), 1 barn owl (Tyto alba; 10%), and 1 snowy owl (Bubo scandiacus; 10%). For each anesthetic episode, blood was collected within 3 minutes of capture and in 15-minute intervals according to the duration of the procedure. Phase 2 had additional blood collections with the patient awake at 2 and 24 hours after time 0 blood collection, whereas phase 3 had an additional blood collection at 24 hours after time 0 blood collection. Hematologic analyses included packed cell volume, total solids, total white blood cell count, heterophil to lymphocyte ratio, and absolute heterophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, eosinophil, and basophil counts. Total white blood cell count decreased significantly during phase 1; packed cell volume decreased significantly during phases 2 and 3; total solids decreased significantly in phase 2; phase 2 demonstrated a lymphopenia with a concurrent decrease in the heterophil to lymphocyte ratio; and phase 3 demonstrated a heteropenia and significant changes in the eosinophil count. All hematologic changes noted in the study were within appropriate reference intervals for the owls but do suggest that there are physiologic consequences of restraining and anesthetizing these avian patients. © 2019 by the Association of Avian Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Aerodynamics of an owl-like wing model at low Reynolds numbers (Re = O(104-5)) are investigated using large-eddy simulations with high-resolution computational schemes. The airfoil shape of the owl-like wing model is constructed based on a cross-sectional geometry of the owl wing at 40% wingspan from the root. The chord-based Re ranges from 1.0 © 104 to 5.0 © 104 and the angle of attack (¡) varies from 0 to 14 deg. The time-averaged lift (Cl) and drag coefficients computed are in reasonable agreement with the results of force measurement. The results computed clarify a nonlinear change in the Cl curve slope, which is due to an increase in the suction peaks in conjunction with the change in type of separation, the formation of a laminar separation bubble (LSB), and pressure recovery on the pressure side. The generation of the LSB on the suction and/or pressure sides at the Re of 2.3 © 104 and 4.6 © 104 are seen, while reattachments are observed only on the pressure side at the Re of 1.0 © 104 due to the camber of the wing. Furthermore, the owl-like wing model demonstrates favorable aerodynamic performance in terms of a maximum lift-to-drag ratio in comparison with several airfoils at the Re range considered. This is due to the strong suction peaks and distribution of surface pressure on the pressure side. It is emphasized that the concave lower surface enhances the time-averaged aerodynamic performance at all of the ¡ even though the LSB is generated and fluctuation in lift history is induced at low ¡. © 2020 The Japan Society for Aeronautical and Space Sciences

ABSTRACT: The object of the study is the diet of two wintering groups of long-eared owls (Asio otus L.) from the town of Silistra. During the winter of 2013/2014, 511 pellets and other skeletal residues are collected. A total of 1538 specimens are established, of which 1500 skeletal parts of small mammals. A total of 23 species are identified: 5 species of Eulipotyphla, 3 species of Chiroptera and 15 species of Rodentia. Five species are recorded for the first time as prey of the long-eared owl in Bulgaria: Sorex minutus L., Neomys anomalus Cabr., Barbastella barbastellus Schr., Nyctalus noctula Schr. and Apodemus uralensis Pall. Six of the species are protected, two are included in the Red Data Book of Bulgaria and three are very rare. All identified small mammals, except synanthropic mice and rats, can be considered new to the research area. For the first time after almost 50 years, information about A. uralensis is given. All new species have very low abundance in owl’s diet (0.07–0.3% of all preys), which could be resulting from their naturally low density or the randomness of catches as an atypical prey. These conservationally significant species show the exceptional possibilities of this method to establish rare species that are difficult to prove with other methods of research. © Ecologia Balkanica

ABSTRACT: This paper develops a new perspective on human-owl relations in the Pavlovian, a regional group of the early Gravettian of East-Central Europe. It argues that the regular representation of owls in figurative art and ornamentation in this context must be understood as a result of unique conditions of encounter and interaction emerging at the intersection of Southern Moravian early MIS 2-environments, Pavlovian sociocultural practice, and owl presence and behaviour. It is shown that the diverse and tree-rich environments of East-Central Europe, and the Pavlovian Hill region in particular, provided highly favourable living conditions for a rich owl community. In conjunction with Pavlovian settlement behaviour which produced large-scale aggregation sites and seems to have been associated with a more sedentary mode of life, humans were thus particularly exposed to owls that likely dominated the nightly soundscapes of the region. This coincides with the fact that many of the present owl species are resident birds and aligns with compelling evidence for a pronounced ‘sense of place’ in the region's early Gravettian. The paper therefore suggests considering the saliency of negotiating the owl theme in the Pavlovian as an expression of the general eco-cultural entanglement of humans and owls in this setting.

ABSTRACT: The Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo) is distributed throughout Asia and Europe and contains approximately twelve subspecies. Three subspecies, B. b. kiautschensis, B. b. ussuriensis, and B. b. tibetanus, are separately distributed in the refugia and plateau habitats of China. However, the genetics of these subspecies and populations have not been studied. Genetic differences were investigated among 32 individuals from six populations of these three B. bubo subspecies based on the mitochondrial genome. Low genetic diversity but high haplotype diversity was observed in these subspecies. The phylogenetic relationship of three B. bubo subspecies distributed in China was proven to be coordinated with geographic and environmental gradients. This study provides the first detailed insights into the mitochondrial genetic diversity of three Eurasian eagle-owl subspecies distributed in China and demonstrates the utility of the mitochondrial genome in intraspecific genetic population analyses of these eagle-owls. © 2020 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Nest predation is a major factor affecting fitness in birds. Individuals are expected to respond to nest predation by selecting safe nesting sites and by moving away from risky sites. Thereby, perceived risk or experience of predation should lead to shifts in nest site selection. Experimental studies on behavioural and life-history consequences of nest predation have traditionally manipulated the risk of predation and studied the immediate consequences thereof. Fewer studies have however analysed the behavioural consequences of perceived predation risk to future breeding events and we know little about how sedentary territorial species respond to nest predation. We experimentally manipulated tawny owl (Strix aluco) breeding nest site choice by providing an additional alternative nest box within the territory, nearby the original nesting sites. The new nest box was provided either after a successful reproductive event (control group), or following a failed reproductive event caused by a nest predator (i.e. pine marten Martes martes, predated group). We show that tawny owls generally switched to the alternative nest site in the current breeding season when the nest was predated in the previous year, whereas they used the same nest after a successful breeding. We found no effects of previous predation experience on the probability to breed nor on clutch size. We conclude that small scale movement within the territory are used by tawny owls to minimize predation risk and that the owls use information on past predation events and nest failure to optimize their breeding decision in the following season. © 2020 University of Helsinki.

ABSTRACT: The typical owl family (Strigidae) comprises 194 species in 28 genera, 14 of which are monotypic. Relationships within and among genera in the typical owls have been challenging to discern because mitochondrial data have produced equivocal results and because many monotypic genera have been omitted from previous molecular analyses. Here, we collected and analyzed DNA sequences of ultraconserved elements (UCEs) from 43 species of typical owls to produce concatenated and multispecies coalescent-based phylogenetic hypotheses for all but one genus in the typical owl family. Our results reveal extensive paraphyly of taxonomic groups across phylogenies inferred using different analytical approaches and suggest the genera Athene, Otus, Asio, Megascops, Bubo, and Strix are paraphyletic, whereas Ninox and Glaucidium are polyphyletic. Secondary analyses of protein-coding mitochondrial genes harvested from off-target sequencing reads and mitochondrial genomes downloaded from GenBank generally support the extent of paraphyly we observe, although some disagreements exist at higher taxonomic levels between our nuclear and mitochondrial phylogenetic hypotheses. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of taxon sampling for understanding and describing evolutionary relationships in this group, as well as the need for additional sampling, study, and taxonomic revision of typical owl species. Additionally, our findings highlight how both divergence and convergence in morphological characters have obscured our understanding of the evolutionary history of typical owls, particularly those with insular distributions. © 2019 American Ornithological Society 2019.

ABSTRACT: To identify individual birds based on vocalizations, it is necessary to first confirm that individuals produce distinct vocalizations that are stable over time. Using vocal features, I was able to estimate the Ryukyu Scops Owls population on Minami-daito Island in 2003–2012 and confirmed that it is possible to identify individuals over time. I analysed 20 hoots per individual male in 2005–2007. Using 11 hoot parameters, the discriminant function analyses (DFAs) achieved a 97.4% probability of correct classification. Using 31 marked males, I examined the vocal features of 118 series of hoots over 1–6 years. Each male’s vocal features remained essentially stable over time and the calls of 14.9% (13/87) males were wrongly identified as those of other males. Individual misidentifications were the result of subtle differences in spectral features, or imperceptible differences in frequency and duration. The typological features (to visually classify variation in spectrograms according to the shape of syllables in the owl species) of the sound spectrograms of the misclassified males were found to be consistent over several years. When considering the efficacy of the DFA as a tool for identifying individuals, we rely on their vocal features, but should examine the visible typological features. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Anthropogenic development may influence the choices animals make and their resulting reproductive success and survival. If such choices are maladaptive, the impact of anthropogenic change can be catastrophic to small or declining populations. Over the past century, Canada's prairie landscapes have been altered dramatically, with over two-thirds of its native grasslands now having been converted to cropland. The decline of the endangered Burrowing Owl Athene cunicularia population is assumed to have resulted from this landscape change, yet no causal link has been demonstrated. One hypothesis to explain this population decline is that owls get caught in an ecological trap, whereby they prefer to establish nests at the start of each breeding season in landscapes that later confer lower reproductive success. Agricultural landscapes represent a plausible potential ecological trap because the short and sparse vegetation in annual crops (seeded each spring) is predicted to be attractive nesting/foraging habitat for Burrowing Owls when they arrive from northward migration, yet crops become substantially taller and denser over the growing season so prey are predicted to become less accessible by the time broods have hatched. We tested this ecological trap hypothesis in a 3-year study, involving 379 Burrowing Owl pairs, across the agricultural landscapes of southern Alberta and Saskatchewan. In support of the hypothesis, Burrowing Owls did prefer to settle in breeding home-ranges that contained a higher proportion of cropland, and their prey-delivery rates during brood-rearing were lower at nests with a higher proportion of cropland growing in the surrounding landscape. However, in contradiction to a key prediction, the number of fledglings produced (range = 0–9) was higher, not lower, for pairs with more actively growing cropland in their landscapes. Therefore, the decline of the Burrowing Owl in Canada does not appear to result from cropland forming an ecological trap during the breeding season. We also found a significant positive relationship between the amount of summer fallow within Burrowing Owl home-ranges and the quantity of vertebrate prey delivered to the nest and the number of juveniles fledged, highlighting the importance of this declining land use in raptor conservation. © 2019 The Authors Ibis published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British Ornithologists’ Union.

ABSTRACT: Melanin-based colorations in birds constitute a paradigm for the study of the molecular basis of phenotypic variation. Variation in the melanocortin-1 receptor (MCR1) gene, a key regulator of melanin synthesis in feather melanocytes, can lead to changes in the production of melanin and hence in feather colour. Here we investigate the proximate mechanisms behind colour plumage polymorphism in the Eurasian Scops-owl Otus scops, a species showing pronounced variation in the degree of redness. Although eumelanin pigment was three times more abundant than pheomelanin pigments, the degree of plumage redness was more strongly associated with the amount of pheomelanin than eumelanin pigments. We detected only one synonymous substitution and one non-synonymous substitution in MC1R which were, however, not associated with variation in plumage coloration. Redness variation in Eurasian Scops-Owls is primarily due to variation in pheomelanin, and to genes or regulatory elements other than MCR1. - Avilés, J.M., Cruz-Miralles, A., Ducrest, A.-L., Simon, C., Roulin, A., Wakamatsu, K. & Parejo, D.

ABSTRACT: The Cinereous Owl (Strix sartorii), a Mexican pine forest endemic, has long been considered a subspecies of the Barred Owl (S. varia). In this study, we provide the first description and analysis of its vocalizations, which differ markedly from those of the Barred Owl and support the recognition of the Cinereous Owl as a full species. Its rhythmic song consists of seven primary notes and three secondary notes, whereas the analogous song of the Barred Owl consists of six primary notes and two secondary notes, arranged in a different pattern. The rhythmic song of the closely related Fulvous Owl (S.fulvescens) has only five or six primary notes, versus seven in that of the Cinereous Owl. The Cinereous Owl's song is much lower in pitch than the Fulvous Owl's. Unlike the Fulvous Owl but like the Barred Owl, the Cinereous Owl also has a distinctive and frequently deployed series song. © 2020 Western Field Ornithologists. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Animal wings produce an acoustic signature in flight. Many owls are able to suppress this noise to fly quietly relative to other birds. Instead of silent flight, certain birds have conversely evolved to produce extra sound with their wings for communication. The papers in this symposium synthesize ongoing research in "animal aeroacoustics": The study of how animal flight produces an acoustic signature, its biological context, and possible bio-inspired engineering applications. Three papers present research on flycatchers and doves, highlighting work that continues to uncover new physical mechanisms by which bird wings can make communication sounds. Quiet flight evolves in the context of a predator-prey interaction, either to help predators such as owls hear its prey better, or to prevent the prey from hearing the approaching predator. Two papers present work on hearing in owls and insect prey. Additional papers focus on the sounds produced by wings during flight, and on the fluid mechanics of force production by flapping wings. For instance, there is evidence that birds such as nightbirds, hawks, or falcons may also have quiet flight. Bat flight appears to be quieter than bird flight, for reasons that are not fully explored. Several research avenues remain open, including the role of flapping versus gliding flight or the physical acoustic mechanisms by which flight sounds are reduced. The convergent interest of the biology and engineering communities on quiet owl flight comes at a time of nascent developments in the energy and transportation sectors, where noise and its perception are formidable obstacles. © The Author(s) 2020.

ABSTRACT: We explored the influence of film and media on the exotic pet trade using the context of the ‘Harry Potter effect‘ and the owl trade in Thailand as a case study. We compared the owl trade between market surveys dating from 1966 to 2019 in Bangkok's Chatuchak market, to online surveys from 2017 to 2019. Using generalised linear models, we examined whether prices offered for owls could be explained by variables linked to whether the species are featured in the Harry Potter franchise, body size, tameness and temporal/seasonal harvesting. We also tested for an anthropogenic Allee effect by examining the relationship between the availability of owls and asking price. Owls never exceeded 1.3% of the total number of birds for sale in Chatuchak animal market, and we did not observe any owls during our visits in 2011, 2018 and 2019. In contrast, we re corded 311 individuals of 17 species from 206 posts on the online marketplace on Facebook. Owls are offered for sale during all months of each year surveyed but more so from February to April; availability did influence price. We found that price was significantly explained by body mass, but not by association with the Harry Potter franchise or by tameness. We found that owls have become more popular as pets, and as they are potentially sourced from the wild, this inevitably causes conservation concerns. Owls are just one of many taxa suffering from the unregulated and accessible marketplace that social media sites offer to vendors.

ABSTRACT: The ability of a species to successfully adapt to urban areas is controlled by certain ecological limiting factors. Many owl species have a negative response to urbanization, while there are others that seem to tolerate, or even thrive, in urban environments. Here, we report a nest of the Magellanic Horned Owl (Bubo magellanicus) in a building balcony in a suburban area in the commune of Lo Barnechea, Santiago, Chile. The nest was found in the first week of August 2018, at first bearing a single egg. After 92 days of monitoring, two nestlings successfully abandoned the nest. The use of human-made structures by the Magellanic Horned Owl had not been previously recorded; consequently, this record evidences new nesting opportunities for this owl in urban areas, revealing a change in its reproductive behavior. © Neotropical Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Specimens (n = 508) of eight species of owl (Aves: Strigiformes) collected from 1994 to 2017 in Manitoba, Canada, were weighed and examined for chewing lice (Phthiraptera: Amblycera, Ischnocera). The relationship between host body mass and infestation by 12 species of lice was examined. Host body mass explained 52% (P = 0.03) of the variation in mean intensity of louse infestation among hosts, due primarily to a high abundance of lice on the heaviest owl species. The relationship was due to the mean intensity of lice, and neither species richness nor the prevalence of lice was related to host body mass. For individual louse species, the relationship was due primarily to Kurodaia acadicae Price and Beer, Kurodaia magna Emerson, and an undetermined species of Kurodaia Uchida (Phthiraptera: Menoponidae) (R2 = 0.997), but not the nine Strigiphilus Mjöberg (Phthiraptera: Philopteridae) species (R2 = 0.27). Louse intensity did not increase with body size for individual birds of any of the owl species. Mean intensity is expected to increase in proportion with the size, specifically the surface area, of the host. Why that relationship holds only for one louse genus, and not for the most abundant genus of lice on owls, and weakly compared with other families of birds, has yet to be determined. © Entomological Society of Canada 2019.

ABSTRACT: Exploration and neophobia are hypothesized to have a reciprocal relationship, each behavior influencing the expression of the other. Specifically, the possibility of exploration influencing the increase or decrease of neophobia is of concern for wildlife rehabilitators. Captivity has the potential to artificially alter the need for exploration due to the decrease in environmental variability, which may artificially change the expression of neophobia in captive patients. Changes in neophobic tendencies may impede survival rates of wildlife after release. I examined how functional neophobia changed within barred owls (Strix varia) during rehabilitation. Data suggests that as time spent in captivity increases, inhibition displayed towards novelty and during food retrieval decreases. This data potentially reflects a decrease in neophobic tendencies during traditional rehabilitation. However, auditory enrichment over the course of five days appears to prevent neophobia levels from drastically decreasing. If stable neophobia levels are of value and aid in survival after release, the inclusion of auditory enrichment during captivity might be a practical rehabilitation technique.  © 2020 International Wildlife Rehabilitation Council.

ABSTRACT: Owl Search Algorithm (OSA) is a recently proposed nature-inspired meta-heuristic algorithm which is easily implementable and exhibits great potential for solving continuous optimization problems. In our earlier work, a binary version of owl search algorithm (BOSA), with transfer functions for mapping the continuous solution space into a binary one, has been developed and applied in optimal feature subset selection problem. In our preliminary simulation experiments, it was found that the performance of the solution depends on the type of transfer function used. In this work, an extensive analysis of various types of transfer functions and their respective effects on the selection of optimal feature subset has been studied by simulation experiments with multiple benchmark datasets. Transfer functions of three different families, S-shaped, V-shaped and quadratic, are used for designing eleven BOSA models, each of which is made by combining individual transfer function. The performances of the proposed wrapper based feature subset selection algorithm based on several BOSA models have been evaluated by simulation experiments with twenty datasets for finding out the best model. The best observed BOSA model has also been compared with other similar meta-heuristics algorithms for feature subset selection. Experimental results show that the feature subset selected by BOSA with quadratic transfer function produces the highest classification accuracy with the minimum number of selected features compared to other algorithms.

ABSTRACT: In winter 2013/2014 a roost of longeared owls in Bojnice Spa (central Slovakia) was formed by two subgroups situated 12 meters apart from each other. The diets of both subgroups and the direction of the owls' departure from the roost were studied at monthly intervals. Owls of the Pinussubgroup left the roost in a significantly different direction compared with the owls in the Piceasubgroup. The common vole was the most hunted prey in both subgroups. However, comparing the alternative prey of the two subgroups, the wood mouse and other mammals were found significantly more often in pellets of the Piceasubgroup, whereas birds were more frequent in pellets of the Pinussubgroup. Our results suggest that the different prey hunted by the two subgroups may be a consequence of diverging hunting areas with different availability of alternative prey species. © 2020 Raptor Journal.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: An electron microscopic study of the microstructure of the primary remiges in owls (Strigiformes) was conducted using 13 species: Nyctea scandiaca, Bubo bubo, Asio otus, Otus scops, O. sunia, Aegolius funereus, Athene noctua, Glaucidium passerinum, Surnia ulula, Strux aluco, S. uralensis, S. nebulosa, and Tyto alba. Owls have a number of species-specific microstructural primary remex characteristics that are taxonomically important. First of all, these are the structural features of the pennaceous barb, which differ markedly not only at the ordinal, but also at the species level: cross-section configuration, pith architectonics in cross- and longitudinal sections, and cuticular barb structures. This work emphasizes that the identified elements are of taxonomic significance only when comparing the specific, strictly analogous sections of the barbs in different bird species. Based on the present study, we conclude that along with the typical elements of feather architectonics characteristic of representatives of other bird orders, the owls show a number of peculiar microstructural features. Thus, as the result of an analysis of the microstructure of the owls primary remex pennaceous barb vanule, the unique features of the distal barbules and the structure of the apical section of the barb with tightly adjacent and elongate proximal and distal barbules could be distinguished. These characteristics are revealed to cause a dense fleecy structure of the vane dorsal surface and the presence of a complex of peculiar “bunches” that form the cleft edge, i.e., the purely specific traits of the owls feather that are not found in representatives of any other bird orders we have investigated. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Abstract—Tengmalm’s Owl (Aegolius funereus caucasicus But.) inhabits dark coniferous, pine, and deciduous forests in the mountains of the North Caucasus in the range from the city of Tuapse in the west to Inner Dagestan in the east, rising to pine forests to a height of 1900–2000 m above sea level. During its winter wanderings, it occasionally occurs in the foothills, but almost does not go out to the piedmont plains. Winter records in the steppe regions of Ciscaucasia may refer to nomadic specimens of a nominate subspecies (A. f. funereus L.), which is common in Voronezh oblast and in northern Rostov oblast. The bird finds the most optimal conditions in old dark coniferous and mixed forests of the Western Caucasus, and its maximum abundance is noted in the Teberda Nature Reserve (1 pair/10 km2). In the Central and Eastern Caucasus, it lives in old deciduous forests (mountains with a low elevation) and in pine forests (mountains of average height). The population of Tengmalm’s Owl in the North Caucasus is considered relatively stable, and its total number is now estimated at 1000–2000 pairs, including 200–400 pairs living in Karachaevo-Cherkessia and 20–30 pairs living in Adygea. Tengmalm’s Owl is ecologically closely connected with the Black Woodpecker (Dryocopus martius), whose old hollows it usually nests in. The birds display from January to May, but most actively in mid-April. In late April, they lay eggs and fledglings appear in June–July. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Owls (Strigiformes) evolved specific adaptations to their nocturnal predatory lifestyle, such as asymmetrical ears, a facial disk, and a feather structure allowing silent flight. Owls also share some traits with diurnal raptors and other nocturnal birds, such as cryptic plumage patterns, reversed sexual size dimorphism, and acute vision and hearing. The genetic basis of some of these adaptations to a nocturnal predatory lifestyle has been studied by candidate gene approaches but rarely with genome-wide scans. Here, we used a genome-wide comparative analysis to test for selection in the early history of the owls. We estimated the substitution rates in the coding regions of 20 bird genomes, including 11 owls of which five were newly sequenced. Then, we tested for functional overrepresentation across the genes that showed signals of selection. In the ancestral branch of the owls, we found traces of positive selection in the evolution of genes functionally related to visual perception, especially to phototransduction, and to chromosome packaging. Several genes that have been previously linked to acoustic perception, circadian rhythm, and feather structure also showed signals of an accelerated evolution in the origin of the owls. We discuss the functions of the genes under positive selection and their putative association with the adaptation to the nocturnal predatory lifestyle of the owls. © The Author(s) 2020.

ABSTRACT: Background. The Eurasian Pygmy-owl Glaucidium passerinum (Linnaeus, 1758) is a rare and poorly studied species in Ukraine. It is listed in the Red Data book of Ukraine [2]. Its breeding locations can be found in the Carpathians, Roztochia and Polissia. There are insufficient data the on distribution and current state of abundance of Eurasian Pygmy-owl as well as breeding biology of the species on the territory of Polissia. Materials and Methods. The published data, internet sources, and unpublished materials of colleagues were used in addition to our own observations. Special studies were conducted on permanent study sites in Polissia Nature Reserve (Olevsk and Ovruch districts, Zhytomyr region) and Desniansko-Starohutskyi National Nature Park (Seredyno-Buda district, Sumy region). Small expeditions were organized to other locations within Polissia. Studies of this species were conducted in conjunction with the study of other owl species. They included surveys, behavioral observations, and ecology studies. During the surveys, the registrations on the routes of natural vocalization of adult owls were made at twilight and at night; in cases when natural vocaliƵaŧion was absent, the recordings of mating calls of males and females were played [1]. The maximum distance of species registration by calling (500 m) was used for breeding density estimation. Results. During the breeding period, the Eurasian Pygmy-owl was found in all regions of Polissia. The southern boundary of that area lies near the villages Perebrody, Dubrovytsia district [12] Karasyn, Sarny district [12] Kochychyne, Yemilchyn district -Lypnyky, Luhyny district Velyki Klishchi, Narodychi district Stavrovka, Ivankiv district. The second site of regular breeding is the territory of Desniansko-Starohutskyi National Nature Park, where the species has been detected since 1996 [13]. For the first time, on the territory of Polissia, two nests in Zhytomyr and Sumy regions were found. For the first time in Ukraine, the clutch was measured. Behavioral observations of owls in breeding sites were conducted. Food remains were collected and identified. Conclusions. The Eurasian Pygmy-owl is a breeding species in Ukrainian Polissia. The average breeding density in Polissia is 5.8 pairs/100 sq. km. The permanent breeding range was identified; it covers the northeastern part of Rivne region, the northern part of Zhytomyr and Kyiv regions, the northeastern part of Chernihiv region and the northern part of Sumy region, on the area of 18.1 thousand sq. km. The estimated breeding population of this species is 330 pairs. During the mating season, there are two peaks of natural 24-hour vocalization activity: in the evening and morning twilight. In the evening, males often begin to call 30 min after sunset, in the morning 30 min before sunrise. In the autumn-winter period, birds either stay within their breeding areas or migrate, flying outside the breeding habitats. The increase in the number of registrations is due to special surveys taking into account the narrow interval of 24-hour natural vocalization activity in the twilight period and the use of phonogram reproduction techniques. © 2020 Yu.

ABSTRACT: The early archaeological record of Beringia is complicated by the occurrence of several lithic industries. Site assemblages, dating from 14,000 to 12,800 years ago and located from the Yana-Indigirka Lowlands of Siberia to the upper Tanana River basin, contain artifacts characteristic of the Nenana technological complex. After 12,800 years ago, site assemblages contain artifacts diagnostic of the Denali technocomplex. To explain the variation in lithic industries, we first and foremost need well-stratified and well-dated sites with multiple components so we securely know their ages and depositional relationships. We present excavation results of one such site located in interior Alaska, Owl Ridge, with the goal of assessing site stratigraphy, radiocarbon chronology, and natural site formation processes. Owl Ridge was visited three times during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition with a Nenana-complex occupation at 13,380–12,800 years ago followed by two Denali-complex occupations at 12,540–11,430 years ago and 11,270–11,200 years ago. Assemblage change at Owl Ridge was diachronically patterned, as at the nearby Dry Creek archaeological site, and separated by two climatic events, a brief extremely windy Younger Dryas (lasting 300–250 years) and a very brief wetter period (lasting ~160 years). Our results indicate these climate and environmental conditions played a role in settlement of eastern Beringia. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Embryonic development is a fascinating subject for scientists from different biological disciplines, since it is determined by genetics, is linked to evolution, and involves morphological changes over a relatively short time period. Staging tables have been established to facilitate comparison between different clades of birds. However, embryological data for endangered and protected non-model birds are rare. Here we provide reference data for the embryonic development of the Little Owl (Athene noctua) and Tengmalm’s Owl (Aegolius funereus). We found differences in the development of these species compared with that of the American Barn Owl (Tyto furcata) with respect to the cere, beak and claws. Little Owls hatch at the most advanced state amongst these species with respect to plumage, size and weight; they incubate their eggs for just a week and can breed under more adverse conditions than the other two species. © 2019, Deutsche Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.

ABSTRACT: For most of southern South America, the food habits of Magellanic Horned owls (Bubo magellanicus) are well known. In Chile, several researchers have reported the owl’s diet in northern xerophytic environments, as well as subpolar forests; however, other than a short note on the owls’ summer diet in Punta Dungeness (Martínez 2018), no major studies have documented the food habits of Magellanic Horned owls in the Chilean Patagonian steppe. Based on 278 fresh pellets, we reported the food habits of owls inhabiting two sites located at > 52°S in the southernmost Patagonian steppe in continental Chile, and compared our findings with those reported for owls inhabiting eight localities from 39 to 52°S in the Argentinean Patagonian steppe. Our results indicate that in Patagonian steppe environments of both Argentina and Chile, the Magellanic Horned Owl is a generalist predator, which consumes whatever prey available, ranging in size from invertebrates to introduced juvenile lagomorphs. Because all five major vertebrate prey here reported (Abrothrix olivacea, Loxodontomys micropus, Microcavia australis, Reithrodon auritus, Lepus europaeus) are broadly distributed in the Argentinean Patagonian steppe and occur abundantly from 36°S southwards to the Strait of Magellan and Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego, their generalized occurrence as prey does not allow for expression of latitudinal trends in species composition in the owl’s diet. © Neotropical Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Changes in land use practices such as livestock rearing and crop farming are crucially important for conserving biodiversity in the modern world. This study characterizes the shifts in the diet of the Eagle Owl Bubo bubo population in SE Bulgaria mainly as a result of agro-economic changes and depopulation of settlements. The share of predominant prey species in preferred weight classes from urban and open (mainly gallinaceous birds) habitats decreased significantly after the collapse of traditional livestock husbandry and local abandonment of agricultural land. These species were replaced by wetland ones when available and small rodents especially during population eruptions. The Northern white-breasted hedgehog Erinaceus roumanicus and the European hare Lepus europaeus contributed more as prey for Eagle Owls. Other significantly increased replacement prey species in the Eagle owl diet consisted of predatory mammals and birds as well as many smaller species typical of open and wood-shrubby habitats. High proportions of the latter prey groups characterized the annual diets of the studied population after resumption of farming operations and indicated at least temporary food shortages for Eagle Owls. The characteristic direction of diet shifts at the subpopulation level in the particular breeding clusters responded to the agro-economic changes and the landscapes of hunting territories. Despite diet changes, the average prey weight and the food niche breadth of successfully breeding Eagle Owl pairs differed insignificantly at a population level over the time series, except during two years with vole outbreaks. © 2020 Lesotekhnicheski Universitet (University of Forestry).

ABSTRACT: Longeared owls' winter roosts located within forest, compared to their winter roosts in human settlements, often escape human attention. Only minimum information has been published about winter roosts located deep in the forest. During the years 2005 to 2016, we collected longeared owl pellets at irregularly occupied forest winter roosts. Compared to the diet at winter roosts in human settlements, the longeared owls roosting in the forest surprisingly significantly more frequently hunted the common vole. Moreover, we did not record higher consumption of forest mammal species in the diet of owls at forest winter roosts. Longeared owls roosting in human settlements hunted significantly more birds. The results show that, despite the location of deep forest winter roosts, longeared owls preferred hunting the common vole, i.e. hunting in open agricultural land. The study also points out the lack of knowledge about winter roosts located deep in the forest. © 2020 Raptor Journal. All right reserved.

ABSTRACT: The annual abundance of chewing lice (Phthiraptera) was recorded on great horned owls (Bubo virginianus (Gmelin), Aves: Strigidae) from 1994 to 2015 in Manitoba, Canada. Kurodaia magna Emerson (Amblycera: Menoponidae) had a mean annual abundance about half that for Strigiphilus oculatus (Rudow) (Ischnocera: Philopteridae). Mean intensity, rather than prevalence, explained the variation in annual abundance. Temporal variation (measured as population variability) in abundance and mean intensity were high and similar (0.62-0.67), but lower for nymph to female ratio (0.36-0.38). Temporal variation of prevalence and sex ratio were higher for K. magna (0.34-0.35) than for S. oculatus (0.21-0.22), and typical for other louse species. The high temporal variability for abundance and mean intensity suggest lower year-to-year stability than exhibited by other chewing lice, but over 80% of this variability was due to sampling error resulting from small sample sizes in some years and extreme intensities in the aggregated distributions of intensity. The remaining variation, < 20%, revealed no significant differences in annual abundance or mean intensity among years, and therefore stable populations over 22 years. Populations of 12 species of chewing lice show lower temporal variability and therefore greater stability than three other insect taxa. © Entomological Society of Canada 2019.

ABSTRACT: Over a two-year period (2013–2015), we trapped and radio-tracked 20 Tawny Owls at two study sites in northern Spain. We obtained 4257 radio-tracking locations, 328 of which were associated with vocal activity. Home ranges were significantly different between the two study sites (95% minimum convex polygon (MCP) = 125.79 ha vs. 95% MCP = 50.96 ha). Territory size was significantly less than 95% MCP home ranges and not significantly different from 70% MCP home ranges at both study sites, but was significantly larger than 50% MCP home ranges in the second site. Locations with vocal activity tended to be significantly closer to the home range border than random non-vocal locations. However, Tawny Owls focused vocal activity over the 50% MCP and close to the border of 70% MCP at both study sites. Home ranges were not significantly different between sexes for any of the three spatial scales, but male territories were significantly larger than female territories. The vocal behaviours of some owls, mainly females, were negligible or anecdotal (less than five vocalizations detected during the study period), and female territories were significantly smaller than male territories. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: We used molar measurements from 136 known-age red tree voles (Arborimus longicaudus) to develop regression models that could estimate tree vole age from skeletonized remains. The best regression included a quadratic structure of the ratio between two measurements, crown height and anterior height, and natural log-transformed age in days. The regression predicted that molar roots begin to develop at 40 days of age and that molar crowns are worn completely away at 1,177 days of age. We used the regression to estimate the age distribution of 1,703 red tree voles found in northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) pellets collected in western Oregon during 1970-2009. The age distribution of red tree voles in pellets was dominated by young individuals, with 81% younger than one year and only 0.5% older than two years. The proportion of individuals 61-120 days old was particularly high relative to other age classes. The proportion of subadult (52-120 days old) individuals exhibited regional variation between the Oregon Cascades and the Coast Range. Localized annual variation in age distribution was low, exhibited no evidence of cyclic variation, and was positively associated with local precipitation rates during the spotted owl nesting season (March-June). We hypothesize that the age distribution of tree voles in owl pellets may be similar to the age structure of tree vole populations in the wild, but acknowledge that this is virtually impossible to test because tree voles cannot be adequately sampled using conventional small mammal capture methods. © 2019 by the Northwest Scientific Association.

ABSTRACT: Predator-prey interactions often define the coexistence of species in space and time. In this research, we are filling a regional gap in knowledge of diet composition of the barn owl (Tyto alba) and the long-eared owl (Asio otus). The study was conducted at the Lewisville Lake Environmental Learning Area (LLELA), a patch of tallgrass prairie and post oak forest surrounded by areas with large anthropogenic modifications in north-central Texas. We examined the remains found in owl pellets collected September 2016 to March 2017. Small mammals, mainly rodents, constituted 100% of the T. alba and 98.5% of the A. otus diet. The hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) was the most common prey detected (68.2% for T. alba and 89.0% for A. otus). Diet niche breadth of T. alba was broader than that of A. otus (0.47 and 0.06, respectively), whereas mean prey size was smaller in the T. alba diet. Diet overlap between these owls was high (0.96), likely because they hunt similarly at night, on the wing, and the prey species have limited diversity. Most rodents eaten were juveniles and the sex ratio of prey was even in both owls' diets. We highlight the value of conducting studies in such a unique and relatively pristine environment in the face of multiple threats. Additionally, although the occurrence of A. otus is rare and infrequent in the study area, we were still able to detect a difference in diet between the ubiquitous T. alba and A. otus. © Common Ground Research Networks, Steven Faerm, All Rights Reserved.

ABSTRACT: Species-life history patterns provide insights into the adaptative strategies and importance of social behaviours. The cathemeral activity pattern of Aotus azarae allowed researchers from the Owl Monkey Project of Formosa, Argentina, to witness remarkable life changing events over the complete lifespan of several individuals. Here we summarize the life of Fabian, a male owl monkey we followed from the moment he started searching for a mate until he died. Although still not consistently considered in models of social evolution of mammals, our discovery of a subpopulation of solitary owl monkey floaters forced us to rethink some aspects of their characteristic social organization and mating system. Through the life of Fabian we present some representative examples of the intrasexual competition regulating the social system of the members of this genus during the different stages in the life of individuals, while reporting the first case of extra-pair copulation in wild owl monkeys.  © 2020 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.

ABSTRACT: In Australia, Toxoplasma gondii is an introduced parasite with a wide host range. House cats (Felis catus) are one of its definitive hosts. Little is known about T. gondii infection rates in Australian wildlife. Since cat abundance varies with landscape composition, we hypothesised that T. gondii infection would be more prevalent in urban and agricultural landscapes than intact bushland and sought to use samples from the Southern Boobook (Ninox boobook) as an indicator of ecosystem-wide T. gondii contamination. We used modified agglutination tests to determine T. gondii seropositivity in serum and meat juice samples taken from boobooks. Moderately low levels of seropositivity were detected and non-significant landscape-related patterns of seroprevalence were observed. We also examined correlations and interactions with owl age, season, injury status and exposure to an anticoagulant rodenticide. Only season showed significant correlations with observed seropositivity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published detection of T. gondii seropositivity in a wild predatory bird in Australia. © 2020 Western Australia Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions.

ABSTRACT: Capsule: Tawny Owls Strix aluco used a wide variety of tree holes for roosting, but only a minority were used for nesting, which comprised those holes at greater heights in larger trees and with a flat base. Aims: We aimed to determine the type and dimensions of tree holes used by Tawny Owls for roosting and nesting, including which tree species were the most important hole providers, and the density of tree holes available for Tawny Owls in forests of different age classes. Methods: We conducted visual searches for all large tree holes within study plots, recorded their measurements and signs of use, comparing the features of used and unused holes. Data were collected in medium-aged and old-growth forests (Ukraine, Homilsha Forest, 750 ha, 10 seasons) and in primeval forest (Poland, Białowieża Forest, 150 ha, 2 seasons). Results: Roosting holes came in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, frequently being very deep and with an uneven base. Hole entrances needed to be over 10 cm wide and the hollows more than 20 cm deep, presumably to enable owls to enter and evade predators. All nesting holes had a flat base and were located in larger trees, at greater heights than roosting holes. Old trees of low commercial timber value (European Hornbeam Carpinus betulus, Small-leaved Lime Tilia cordata, European Pear Pyrus communis) were the most important hole providers. Suitable holes were found in trees of at least 80 years old, and their abundance increased with tree age, exceeding 50 holes/km2 in the primeval forest. Conclusion: Despite the abundance of suitable roosting holes, nesting holes remained a rare resource associated with larger, older trees. As tree species of low economic value were the main hole providers, these should be retained in forestry operations. © 2021 British Trust for Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: Report of a 3-month old girl child who died due to multi-systemic infection of cytomegalovirus (CMV) involving the lungs, liver and kidneys along with pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP). The mother of the child tested positive for CMV IgG and HIV with a very low CD4 count (160/ µl). Co-infection of cytomegalovirus and pneumocystis jiroveci always occurs in the setting of immunocompromise. Congenital CMV infection is transmitted through the placenta, especially during the first trimester and causes severe multi-systemic disease whereas perinatal infection is acquired during childbirth/ breastfeeding where the babies have maternal protective antibodies leading to much milder or asymptomatic infection. PJP is more common in infancy and presents as hypoxic pneumonia. CMV causes cyto-nucleomegaly and classic “owl’s eye” inclusions on histology while PJP presents with characteristic fluffy “cotton ball” alveolar exudates. © 2020, Malaysian Society of Pathologists.

ABSTRACT: Introduction. Many rodent species are important pests for agriculture and for urban areas. The long-eared owl is a predator that exerts constant pressure on rodent density. Material and methods. The studies were performed in winters of 2011-2013 in the cities of Chisinau and Bacau, where 599 and 82 pellets of Asio otus were collected, respectively. The prey items were identified from cranial bones extracted from pellets. Results. Long-eared owl’s diet in both sites consists of mammals and birds, with rodents being the dominant trophic component. The Microtus species were the main prey with the abundance ≥70% in both sites. In Chisinau a high proportion of Mus species was registered in the diet. The total biomass of prey constituted 43 953 g in Chisinau and 7 038 in Bacau. The highest biomass belongs to Microtus species, with 31 710 g and 5 220 g, respectively. The trophic niche width in Chisinau constituted 0.089 and varied monthly from 0.058 to 0.28. In Bacau the WTNs was of 0.134 and varied slightly among the study months. Conclusions. The rodents were the main trophic source and constituted ≥96% in both sites. The prey diversity was higher in Chisinau, that was due to a larger city territory and to a higher number of wintering long-eared owls. The close values of trophic niche width in Chisinau and Bacau confirmed the high hunting specialization of the long-eared owl. © 2020, Moldavian Biosafety and Biosecurity Association (MDBBA).

ABSTRACT: Synopsis We raise and explore possible answers to three questions about the evolution and ecology of silent flight of owls: (1) do owls fly silently for stealth, or is it to reduce self-masking? Current evidence slightly favors the self-masking hypothesis, but this question remains unsettled. (2) Two of the derived wing features that apparently evolved to suppress flight sound are the vane fringes and dorsal velvet of owl wing feathers. Do these two features suppress aerodynamic noise (sounds generated by airflow), or do they instead reduce structural noise, such as frictional sounds of feathers rubbing during flight? The aerodynamic noise hypothesis lacks empirical support. Several lines of evidence instead support the hypothesis that the velvet and fringe reduce frictional sound, including: The anatomical location of the fringe and velvet, which is best developed in wing and tail regions prone to rubbing, rather than in areas exposed to airflow; the acoustic signature of rubbing, which is broadband and includes ultrasound, is present in the flight of other birds but not owls; and the apparent relationship between the velvet and friction barbules found on the remiges of other birds. (3) Have other animals also evolved silent flight? Wing features in nightbirds (nocturnal members of Caprimulgiformes) suggest that they may have independently evolved to fly in relative silence, as have more than one diurnal hawk (Accipitriformes). We hypothesize that bird flight is noisy because wing feathers are intrinsically predisposed to rub and make frictional noise. This hypothesis suggests a new perspective: rather than regarding owls as silent, perhaps it is bird flight that is loud. This implies that bats may be an overlooked model for silent flight. Owl flight may not be the best (and certainly, not the only) model for "bio-inspiration" of silent flight. © 2020 OUP. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Aggressive logging of public old-growth forests in the Pacific Northwest came to an abrupt halt in 1992 due to litigation involving the federally threatened northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis). Much has been written about the ensuing crisis, but not about how Forest Service officials resolved it in ensuing years. The effort to create a new forestry model relied on applying important holistic concepts to restore biological function to Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests. The crisis also necessitated reengineering inclusive social processes to restore hope to disenfranchised parties. A successful new social contract emerged for managing public lands stuck in gridlock that has proven effective, durable, hopeful, and resilient. © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: This study explores the phenological aspects and distribution of long-eared owl (Asio otus) colonies in Botoșani county, N-E Romania. The anthropogenic impact was also evaluated and analyzed and the microhabitat where the colonies are located. Data was collected between November 2018 and February 2019. 9 settlements in Botoșani county, including the municipality of Botoșani, were investigated. Data about temperature, the size of the colony, the tree species where the colony is located and anthropogenic impact, were collected. 9 colonies were identified with a total of 340 individuals. Two short-eared owl (Asio flammeus) were identified in one of the colonies. The maximum number (51) of specimens is reached in the months of January and February, and the minimum number (30) in the months of November and December. It has been observed that when the temperatures tend to fall, the size of the colonies register significant growth. The preferred species of trees are gymnosperms (69%), the owls were found on angiosperms as well (31%). The preference for the coniferous species increases along with the drop in temperatures and the increase in rainfall or snowfall, as these types of trees offer better protection against the weather conditions. We noticed that the anthropogenic factor has a significant influence on the colonies of Asio otus, so we wanted to grade it with the help of a scale from 1 to 7. Grade 1 was given in only one locality (Știubieni), grade 2 was registered in 4 points (Dorohoi, Avrămeni, Botoșani, and Roma), grade 3 is found only in Bucecea, Corlăteni registers a grade of 4, while in Dobârceni the registered value is 5, grade 6 is met only in Săveni. Grade 7 represented the stage in which there is a decrease in the population of Asio otus, or the death of individuals for various reasons, a situation that has not been encountered. © 2020, Studia Universitatis Babes-Bolyai and Cluj University Press.

ABSTRACT: Multiple brooding, reproducing twice or more per year, is an important component of life-history strategies. However, what proximate factors drive the frequency of multiple brooding and its fitness consequences for parents and offspring remains poorly known. Using long-term longitudinal data, we investigated double brooding in a barn owl population in France. We assessed the effects of both extrinsic and intrinsic factors and the consequences of double brooding on fledgling recruitment and female lifetime reproductive success. The occurrence of double brooding in the population, ranging from 0 to 87%, was positively related to the number of rodent prey stored at the nest. Females laying early in the season were more likely to breed twice and the probability of double brooding increased with smaller initial brood size, female age and the storage of wood mice at the nest early in the season. Fledglings from first broods recruited more often (8.2%) than those from single broods (3.8%) or second broods (3.3%), but this was primarily the consequence of laying dates, not brood type per se. Females producing two broods within a year, at least once in their lifetime, had higher lifetime reproductive success and produced more local recruits than females that did not (15.6 ± 8.1 vs. 6.1 ± 3.8 fledglings, 0.96 ± 1.2 vs. 0.24 ± 0.6 recruits). Our results suggests that the fitness benefits of double brooding exceed costs and that within-year variability in double brooding may be related to heterogeneity in individual/territory quality. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: We report detailed information about relatedness and parental investment in a communal nest in the Barn Owl Tyto alba. Two unrelated females laid their eggs in a single nest cup and successfully raised 4 nestlings out of 11 laid eggs. Apparently, the yearling female did not incubate the eggs and only occasionally hunted for the brood, in contrast to the older female which invested more effort in parental care. © 2020, © 2020 British Trust for Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: Urbanization and its inherent road network are one of the major movements that impulse landscape and biodiversity change, and its effects have yet to be fully understood. Few works focus on the effect of this urbanization on abundance and population trend of a certain species, as this study does, using the tawny owl (Strix aluco) as our case study. Although the tawny owl is not threatened at European or global scale, it is often found roadkilled. We studied the effects of different road types on tawny owl abundance in southern Portugal, from 2005 to 2016. In woodlands far from roads, we found high tawny owl abundance, a stable population trend, and low variation in site occupancy. On the contrary, main roads disrupted habitat quality for tawny owls—limiting their abundance and site occupancy and leading to a negative population trend due to disturbance and/or mortality. Secondary roads did not severely disrupt habitat quality, allowing initial occupation and relatively high densities, yet they may act as ecological traps, revealing instability in occupation along the breeding season and a negative population trend. Tawny owl individuals may settle near secondary roads while waiting for a vacant space in woodlands far from roads (the prime high-quality habitats). To avoid the negative effects of roads on tawny owl populations, mitigation efforts should be applied to both main and secondary roads. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: In the article the research’s results of phylogeography, genetic diversity, genetic structure and demographic characteristics of the Boreal Owl population in Eurasia are given. The first domain of control region of mtDNA is used as a genetic marker. The sample size was 59 specimens. The population of Boreal Owl is characteristic of high genetic diversity and it has signs of rapid expansion in the past as revealed by analysis of CR1 mtDNA polymorphism. Genetic differentiation between birds from the west and the east part of the species range is shown. The level of found population genetic differentiation isn’t high that can be explained by gene flow in the past and possible at the present time. We didn’t reveal any signs of genetic differentiation for Boreal Owl population according to subspecies (between A. f. funereus and A. f. pallens) which are distinguished for the studying area. © 2020, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine.

ABSTRACT: An unusually coloured Little Owl found in the Vallès area, Catalonia, had a much lighter appearance than the typical form and lacked black colouration in some of its tissues, thereby suggesting that this was a case of partial leucism. Some feathers were unusual since they had dark rachises and white distal feather barbs, indicating abnormalities at cellular level within the papillae. © 2020 Institut Catala d'Ornitologia.

ABSTRACT: This study investigated the diet of introduced barn owls (Tyto alba javanica, Gmelin) in the urban area of the Main Campus of Universiti Sains Malaysia, Penang, Malaysia, based on collected regurgitated pellets. We also compared the diet of the introduced barn owls with the diet of barn owls from two agricultural areas, i.e. oil palm plantations and rice fields. Pellet analysis of introduced barn owls showed that commensal Norway rats, Rattus norvegicus, made up the highest proportion of the diet (65.37% prey biomass) while common shrews, Suncus murinus were the second highest consumed prey (30.12% prey biomass). Common plantain squirrel, Callosciurus notatus, made up 4.45% of the diet while insects were taken in a relatively small amount (0.046% prey biomass). Introduced barn owls showed a preference for medium-sized prey, i.e. 40-120 g (52.96% biomass and 38.71% total). In agricultural areas, rice field rats, Rattus argentiventer predominated the diet of barn owls (98.24% prey biomass) in rice fields while Malayan wood rats, Rattus tiomanicus, were the most consumed prey in oil palm plantations (99.5% prey biomass). Food niche breadth value was highest for barn owls introduced in an urban area with a value of 2.90, and 1.06 in rice fields and 1.22 in oil palm plantations. Our analysis reiterates the prey preference of barn owls in various landscapes for small mammals. Our results also indicate the suitability of utilizing barn owls as a biological control not only in agricultural areas, but also as a biological control agent for commensal rodent pests in urban areas. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

ABSTRACT: The aim of the research was to determine the number and distribution of the Rufous-banded Owls Ciccaba albitarsis in a cloud forest on the northern slopes of the Andes. The study was performed using the territory mapping technique and a GPS device in an area of 7 km2. The number of territories was es-timated at 40, resulting in a density of 5.7 territories/km2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published data on density of the Rufous-banded Owl in a cloud forest. The population density of the species in our study area corresponds with the densities of the other similar owl species in the Tropics. © 2020, Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos.

ABSTRACT: We describe the remigial and rectricial molt sequences of a Ryukyu Scops-Owl (Otus elegans) held in captivity on Minami-daito Island, Nansei Islands, southern Japan. The owl completely shed its remiges and rectrices during its preformative molt as well as during its definitive prebasic molts in 3 consecutive years. In the preformative molt, the primaries were all shed during October, November, and December, in distal order from P1. Although all 4 groups of secondaries were shed in proximal order, the sequence may have been caused by adventitious shedding under captive conditions. During definitive prebasic molt, the primaries were shed in distal order during the period from June to September. The secondaries were shed from 3 nodes in 4 feather groups; 3 groups were shed in proximal order, but the remaining group was shed in distal order. The primary coverts were shed in exact sequence with their corresponding primaries during the definitive prebasic molt, but in a different sequence during the preformative molt. Whereas the greater coverts were shed irregularly during the early part of the primary covert molt, the median coverts were shed during the first half of the primary covert molt. The alula feathers were shed distally over a period of weeks. The right rectrices were shed in irregular order over a short period (12 days) and the left rectrices were shed over a long period (at least 82 days). The shedding sequence of the captive Ryukyu Scops-Owl basically followed the known pattern previously observed in Strigidae species. The captive individual underwent a complete molt when it was a juvenile as a result of being provided with sufficient food, and presumably because of the lower energy demands of being in a cage. © Wilson Journal of Ornithology.All right reserved.

ABSTRACT: Scavenging is an important ecological function that increases individual fitness and transfers energy between trophic levels. Scavenging by owls has been documented opportunistically through direct observations, camera trapping, and pellet analyses, but it is unknown how frequent or widespread the behavior is. We documented three new scavenging events from North America and Europe, and also performed a systematic literature review of the reports documenting scavenging by owls. The number of such reports was similar in each decade from the 1970s to the 2000s, but the decade of the 2010s had more reports than all previous decades combined. Owls scavenged primarily on mammals (81%), followed by birds (16%) and reptiles (3%); almost half (47%) of carrion scavenged were Artiodactyla (hoofed mammals) and most of the species scavenged were larger than the feeding owl. Most reports documenting scavenging by owls were from either Europe (n=14) or North America (n=11), with few reports from Asia (n=2), South America (n =2), or Australia (n=1), and none from Africa. The most frequent type of report was direct observations (n= 14), followed by camera trapping (n=9) and pellet analyses (n=6). Our review indicates that scavenging is a widespread behavior among owl species, but most observations were opportunistic, suggesting that additional incidents of scavenging by owls are likely unobserved. Further research is needed to establish the frequency of scavenging by owls and the effects that scavenging may have on owl populations and scavenging communities. © 2019 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Monopis jussii Kaila, Mutanen, Huemer, Karsholt & Autto, sp. nov. (Lepidoptera, Tineidae) is described as a new species. It is closely related to the widespread and common M. laevigella ([Denis & Schiffermül-ler], 1775), but differs in its distinct COI DNA barcode sequences, four examined nuclear loci as well as details in forewing coloration and pattern. Most reared specimens of M. jussii have emerged from the nest remnants of the Boreal owl (Aegolius funereus (Linnaeus, 1758)), but also nests of the Ural owl (Strix uralensis Pallas, 1771) and the Great tit (Parus major Linnaeus, 1758) have been observed as suit-able habitats. Based on the present knowledge, the new species has a boreo-montane distribution as it is recorded only from northern Europe and the Alps. Several extensive rearing experiments from Strix spp. nest remnants from southern Finland did not produce any M. jussii, but thousands of M. laevigella, sug-gesting that the species is lacking in the area or, more unlikely, that the nest of these owl species do not serve as good habitat for the new species. This unexpected species discovery highlights, once again, the usefulness of DNA barcoding in revealing the cryptic layers of biodiversity. To serve stability we select a neotype for Tinea laevigella [Denis & Schiffermüller], 1775, and discuss the complicated synonymy and nomenclature of this species. © Marko Mutanen et al.

ABSTRACT: Synopsis The fluid dynamics of owls in flapping flight is studied by coordinated experiments and computations. The great horned owl was selected, which is nocturnal, stealthy, and relatively large sized raptor. On the experimental side, perch-to-perch flight was considered in an open wind tunnel. The owl kinematics was captured with multiple cameras from different view angles. The kinematic extraction was central in driving the computations, which were designed to resolve all significant spatio-temporal scales in the flow with an unprecedented level of resolution. The wing geometry was extracted from the planform image of the owl wing and a three-dimensional model, the reference configuration, was reconstructed. This configuration was then deformed in time to best match the kinematics recorded during flights utilizing an image-registration technique based on the large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping framework. All simulations were conducted using an eddy-resolving, high-fidelity, solver, where the large displacements/deformations of the flapping owl model were introduced with an immersed boundary formulation. We report detailed information on the spatio-temporal flow dynamics in the near wake including variables that are challenging to measure with sufficient accuracy, such as aerodynamic forces. At the same time, our results indicate that high-fidelity computations over smooth wings may have limitations in capturing the full range of flow phenomena in owl flight. The growth and subsequent separation of the laminar boundary layers developing over the wings in this Reynolds number regime is sensitive to the surface micro-features that are unique to each species. © The Author(s) 2020.

ABSTRACT: The hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal/interrenal (HPA) axis of vertebrates integrates external information and orchestrates responses to cope with energy-demanding and stressful events through changes in circulating glucocorticoid levels. Urbanization exposes animals to a wide variety of ever-changing stimuli caused by human activities that may affect local wildlife populations. Here, we empirically tested the hypothesis that urban and rural owls (Athene cunicularia) show different adrenocortical responses to stress, with urban individuals showing a reduced HPA-axis response compared to rural counterparts to cope with the high levels of human disturbance typical of urban areas. We applied a standard capture-restraint protocol to measure baseline levels and stress-induced corticosterone (CORT) responses. Urban and rural owls showed similar circulating baseline CORT levels. However, maximum CORT levels were attained earlier and were of lower magnitude in urban compared to rural owls, which showed a more pronounced and long-lasting response. Variability in CORT responses was also greater in rural owls and contained the narrower variability displayed by urban ones. These results suggest that only individuals expressing low-HPA-axis responses can thrive in cities, a pattern potentially mediated by three alternative and non-exclusive hypotheses: phenotypic plasticity, natural selection and matching habitat choice. Due to their different conservation implications, we recommend further research to properly understand wildlife responses to humans in an increasingly urbanized world.  © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

ABSTRACT: Understanding what factors influence the occurrence and distribution across the landscape is necessary for species conservation and management. Distribution data for many owl species are inadequate because of their nocturnal behavior and cryptic nature. We examined the role of climate, land cover, and human disturbance in shaping spatial distribution of the Boreal Owl (Aegolius funereus) and Northern Saw-whet Owl (Aegolius acadicus) in northern Alberta. Using autonomous recording units, we conducted passive acoustic surveys to detect owls of both species throughout Alberta’s boreal forest. We compiled data on environmental variables at each sample site corresponding to a local scale and at landscape scale. A boosted regression tree analysis identified average minimum winter temperature as the most important predictor of Boreal Owl distribution. Boreal Owls were more likely to be present in cool environments with cold winters, and a low percentage of grassland cover at the landscape scale. Cropland cover at the local scale was the most influential factor in the final distribution model for the Northern Saw-whet Owl, and they were more likely to be present in areas where cropland was interspersed with deciduous-dominated forests. Furthermore, these areas generally had cool summer temperatures and received less precipitation as snow. Linear features at the landscape scale negatively influenced distribution of Boreal Owls, but edges created by linear features at local scale positively influenced Northern Saw-whet Owl distribution. Our study provides new information about habitat use that can be applied in management and conservation of these two poorly studied species of owls. © 2019 by the author(s).

ABSTRACT: We recorded molt patterns of migrant Northern Saw-whet Owls (Aegolius acadicus) at three locations in the Great Lakes region: Stevens Point, Wisconsin; Whitefish Point, Michigan; and Duluth, Minnesota. We then analyzed the molt patterns of recaptured birds that were banded in a previous season and originally classified as hatch-year birds (i.e., they had no remigial molt). Of these 286 known-age birds included in our analysis, 155 (54%) were second-year (SY), 72 (25%) were third-year (TY), 39 (14%) were fourth-year (4Y), 16 (6%) were fifth-year (5Y), three (1%) were sixth-year (6Y), and one (0.30%) was eighth-year (8Y). Using these known-age birds, we were able to identify definitive molt patterns for the SY and TY age classes. All 155 (100%) SY birds and 52 (72%) of the TY birds matched our ageing criteria. The remaining 28% of TY birds did not match our ageing criteria and were classified as after-second-year (ASY). Of the entire sample (n = 286), only three birds (1%) matched an incorrect age class, including one 4Y that matched the SY age class and two 5Y that matched the TY age class. © 2019 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Effective individual identification is important in many aspects of animal studies. Leg bands and wing tags are commonly used to mark individual birds in the field; however, for nocturnal or cryptic birds it is difficult to directly observe individual tags due to darkness or dense vegetation. Alternatively, some studies suggest that many birds have individually distinctive vocalizations, and these differences could be used to identify individuals. Here we assessed the possibility of identifying individual Ural Owls (Strix uralensis) based on their defensive territorial hooting calls. During breeding season, we recorded hooting calls of 15 males in 2018 and of 16 males in 2019 respectively at the Dagangzi national forest in northeastern China. We measured 19 variables for each call. Using forward stepwise discriminant function analysis, we correctly classified 92.8% of the calls of individuals in 2018 and 93.9% in 2019, based on leave-one-out cross validation. The most important discriminating variables included duration of the interval between the first and second notes, duration of the interval between the second and third notes, the third note duration, and the number of "humps" (upward projections in a note in the sound spectrogram) in the first note. The calls of individuals remained stable both within a breeding season and between years. Our results suggest that territorial calls are effective for identifying male Ural Owl individuals, and this technique could contribute to population surveys and long-term monitoring. © 2020 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: A total of 783 dietary items from a Sooty Owl Tyto tenebricosa tenebricosa with suspected partial xanthochromism (yellow plumage colouration) was identified from Yarrangobilly Caves, NSW. Observations of the owl at the cave and collection of feathers suggest that prey items accumulated between 2011 and 2018. A total of 12 mammal species was detected in the diet, with the Bush Rat Rattus fuscipes, Agile Antechinus Antechinus agilis, Sugar Glider Petaurus breviceps and Rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus dominating. The diet also included three threatened species, the Eastern Pygmy Possum Cercartetus nanus, Smoky Mouse Pseudomys fumeus and Broad-toothed Rat Mastacomys fuscus. The diversity of prey identified in the diet contrasts markedly with that found in studies of subfossil deposits from the area, supporting evidence of extensive mammal declines since European settlement. © 2020 Royal Zoological Society of New South Wales.

ABSTRACT: As urbanization continues to transform landscapes, it is imperative to find ways to conserve biodiversity within fragmented habitats. Forest interior dwelling birds are particularly vulnerable to development pressures because they require large tracts of forest to support their life cycles. Although Barred Owls (Strix varia) are frequently described as an obligate mature forest species, they have been found in urbanized landscapes. To determine if certain habitat characteristics, such as mature trees, facilitate the presence of Barred Owls in developed regions, we modeled Barred Owl occupancy probability along a development gradient in the Piedmont region of the southeastern United States. We surveyed for owls by broadcasting conspecific calls to solicit response and by passively recording at survey sites using autonomous recording units. Detection/nondetection data were collected during the breeding season and analyzed within an occupancy framework to investigate patterns of habitat association in our region, while allowing for imperfect detection of owls. Average tree height was the best predictor of Barred Owl occupancy across a development gradient, regardless of forest coverage. We did not find Barred Owl occupancy to decline with increasing impervious surface density. Our research implies that developed landscapes containing mature urban trees can support breeding populations of Barred Owls. © 2019 by the author(s).

ABSTRACT: Species delimitation in sternaspid polychaetes is currently based on the morphology of a limited suite of characters, namely characters of the ventro-caudal shield—a unique feature of the family. Sternaspid species description has increased rapidly in recent years; however, the validity of the shield as a diagnostic character has not been assessed through molecular means. This study performs the largest molecular taxonomy of Sternaspidae to date, using the nuclear gene 18S, and the mitochondrial genes 16S and cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) to assess phylogenetic relationships within the family, to reassess the placement of Sternaspidae within the wider polychaete tree and to investigate the effectiveness of the shield as a diagnostic morphological character. This study includes many new records and reports Sternaspis affinis Stimpson, 1864 from USA Pacific coastline and genetic connectivity between specimens identified as Sternaspis cf. annenkovae Salazar-Vallejo & Buzhinskaja, 2013 from off southeastern Australia and specimens identified as Sternaspis cf. williamsae Salazar-Vallejo & Buzhinskaja, 2013 from the northwestern Pacific. In addition, we investigate material identified as Sternaspis cf. scutata (Ranzani, 1817) in the English Channel and compare with S. scutata through both molecular and morphological means. We further perform a detailed morphological and molecular investigation of new sternaspid material collected from the Southern Ocean and Antarctic Peninsula and regard Sternaspis monroi Salazar-Vallejo, 2014 syn. n. as a junior synonym of Sternaspis sendalli Salazar-Vallejo, 2014, two species recently described from the region, raising questions concerning the validity of current morphological delimitation. © 2019, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Centrorynchus nahuelhuapensis n. Sp. Is described from the intestine of Strix rufipes, the rufous-legged owl, in Patagonia, Argentina. This species is characterized by the presence of 31-33 hook rows with 16-17 hooks per row, distributed as follows: 5 true hooks, 4 transitional hooks with 4 alate processes, more evident in the first three, 7-8 spiniform hooks, and three cement glands. It differs from most members of the genus by having a filiform body, the arrangement and size of the hooks, the number of cement glands, and egg size. Part of the SSU and LSU genes were sequenced and compared to those in GenBank. Sequences are most similar to other species of Centrorhynchus, supporting their placement within this genus. We present the first molecular study for a species of Centrorhynchus from South America. Additionally, it is the second species of the genus described in Argentina, and the first species of a terrestrial acanthocephalan from a bird in Patagonia.

ABSTRACT: Glucocorticoid hormones are important intermediates between an organism and its environment. They enable an organism to adjust its behavioural and physiological processes in response to environmental changes by binding to mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) and glucocorticoid receptors (GR) expressed in many tissues, including the integument. The regulation of glucocorticoids co-varies with melanin-based colouration in numerous species, an association that might result from pleiotropic effects of genes in the melanocortin system and evolve within a signalling context. Most studies have focused on the circulating levels of glucocorticoids disregarding the receptors that mediate their action, and that might partly account for the covariation between the regulation of stress and melanin-based colouration. We investigated the association of the expression levels of GR and MR genes with melanin-based colouration in the growing feathers of nestling barn owls (Tyto alba). We also explored the association between GR and MR expression levels and the expression of genes related to the melanocortin system and melanogenesis to better understand the origin of the link between the expression of receptors to which corticosterone binds and melanin-based colouration. Nestling barn owls displaying larger eumelanic black feather spots expressed GR and MR at lower levels than smaller-spotted individuals. However, we found that the expression of the GR and MR genes was positively rather than negatively correlated with the expression of genes involved in the deposition of melanin pigments at the time we sampled the nestlings. This provides mixed evidence of the association between melanin-based traits and MR and GR gene expression. The finding that the expression of GR and MR was positively associated with the expression of the PCSK2 gene (encoding one of the protein convertase responsible for the production of hormone peptide ACTH and α-MSH) suggests that the melanocortin system may be implicated in the establishment of the covariation between melanin-based colour and the expression of receptors to which glucocorticoids bind. However, further studies investigating the expression of melanin-based traits with stress-related endpoints at different time points of feather development will be necessary to understand better the proximate mechanism linking melanin-based traits with stress. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia) population declines have led to the owl's designation as a species of conservation concern in South Dakota. Burrowing Owls nest primarily in black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) colonies, but a significant proportion of colonies in South Dakota are not occupied by owls. We studied the influence of landscape-level habitat variables on colony selection by Burrowing Owls. We used call-playback surveys to document presence or absence of Burrowing Owls at 613 prairie dog colonies throughout western and central South Dakota. We used a geographic information system to calculate the percent cover of prairie dog colonies, grassland, cropland, and tree canopy in the surrounding landscape at four buffer sizes. We modeled Burrowing Owl occupancy of prairie dog colonies using logistic regression, and ranked models using Akaike's Information Criterion. All competitive models contained a tree-canopy-cover variable. Increasing tree canopy cover within 800 m and 1200 m of colony centers was associated with decreasing likelihood of occupancy by Burrowing Owls. Grassland, cropland, and prairie dog colony cover variables did not influence occupancy by Burrowing Owls, and these variables did not improve model fit or discrimination. In landscapes where the presence of nesting burrows is not a limiting factor, as in central and western South Dakota, Burrowing Owls occupied colonies based on the absence of trees. Trees provide habitat for avian and mammalian predators and reduce the available foraging area for Burrowing Owls around prairie dog colonies. Management for Burrowing Owls should include conserving prairie dog colonies in landscapes with few trees and preventing the establishment of trees near occupied colonies. © 2019 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Once widespread and apparently common in the mountains of mainland Mexico, to which it is endemic, the Cinereous Owl (Strix sartorii) seems to have declined precipitously. In 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2019 we searched for the Cinereous Owl in eight Mexican states where it had been reported previously. We detected it at only a single site, Rancho La Noria on Cerro San Juan, Nayarit. Our results suggest that the Cinereous Owl may have disappeared from much of its former range, and that the Fulvous Owl (Strix fulvescens) may now inhabit areas in Oaxaca formerly occupied by the Cinereous Owl, perhaps as a result of habitat alteration. The Cinereous Owl may qualify for recognition as vulnerable or endangered. Comprehensive surveys are urgently needed to establish its current status and distribution. Such surveys should also be used to determine the current distribution of the Fulvous Owl, and to investigate the reasons why it now occurs in areas formerly occupied by the Cinereous Owl. © 2020 Western Field Ornithologists.

ABSTRACT: Predation pressure by native species may limit the spread of alien invasive species, thus playing a pivotal role in the impact and implementation of management strategies. The ring–necked parakeet Psittacula krameri is one of the most widespread alien bird species in Europe, with nearly 70 established populations. Predators of this species include diurnal raptors, synanthropic corvids, and rodents. Here we report for the first time that long–eared owls Asio otus might have preyed upon parakeets in their night roosts. Analysis of 167 owl pellets showed that ring–necked parakeets made up over 10% of the total volume of the diet of these owls in winter (32.93% of absolute frequency), representing the most important prey species after murid rodents and passerine birds. Further studies are needed to investigate whether parakeet consumption by long–eared owls is only a local occurrence or whether it is widespread in European cities. If so, predation by long–eared owl may eventually lead to a form of parakeet control and may limit the impact of this introduced parakeet on native biodiversity. © 2020 Museu de Ciències Naturals de Barcelona.

ABSTRACT: Parents can enhance their fitness by favouring that sex whose reproductive value is expected to be highest. In species in which females are the larger sex with potentially greater fitness returns, one can assume that parents should bias their investment toward daughters to increase their daughters’ reproductive value (i.e. age-specific expectation of all present and future offspring) and, thereby, indirectly increase their own inclusive fitness. In the study reported here, we investigated sex allocation in Tengmalm’s Owl (Aegolius funereus), a bird species with a pronounced female-biased sexual size dimorphism in which females are larger than the males. Assuming that parental investment would have the greatest effect on the fitness of larger daughters, we hypothesized that daughters should be favoured in good conditions and sons in poor conditions. Our study was conducted in the Czech Republic over seven breeding seasons (2006–2012). In total, 205 nestlings from 52 nests were sexed. The mean nestling sex ratio, 48.5 ± 4.6% (± standard error), did not depart from parity, and we did not identify any variable to be related to it. However, we did find that at fledging (1) the body mass of female offspring was approximately 8% heavier than that of male offspring, and (2) surprisingly, the body mass of female offspring tended to increase with decreasing prey abundance in the autumn, i.e. prior to breeding. One possible explanation of this “carry-over effect” is that parents increased their investment toward daughters to maximize their daughters’ survival and reproductive value in a poor environment. This explanation could be supported by the sex-specific effect of the adult’s condition on reproductive success. Whereas the number of fledglings tended to increase with increasing age of the mother, it also increased with decreasing wing length of the father. These results indicate that in the Tengmalm’s Owl large body size may be mainly important for female reproduction, while male reproductive success is independent of body size or is even associated with small body size. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to have found such a positive, relatively long-lasting, sex-specific carry-over effect of pre-breeding prey abundance on the condition of female offspring in a bird of prey species. © 2019, Deutsche Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.

ABSTRACT: We analysed the diet of the Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia) and the American Kestrel (Falco sparverius) in a fragmented habitat and natural surroundings in the arid ecosystem of the Baja California peninsula, Mexico. Both small-sized raptors are considered in the same trophic guild, and as keystone species, interactions between them could be of interest for wildlife management in fragmented landscapes for agricultural activities. The diet analysis of these top predators could be a good monitor of prey abundance, some of which may be considered detrimental for agricultural activities. Prey frequencies in owl pellets were higher for arthropods (53.1%) and rodents (32.4%), but rodents were the most abundant item in terms of biomass (34.5%). Arthropods also showed higher relative frequencies in kestrel pellets (36.4%), but reptiles were the second in order of importance (28.4%) and contributed the most (64.7%) to the total prey biomass. The biomass contribution (66.1%) of vertebrates in the diet of the Burrowing Owl was lower than for the American Kestrel (95.6%) in a fragmented habitat area. Most prey types were present in the diet of both raptors, but we found significant differences in the biomass contributions of each category. Reptiles and rodents were the prey items that contributed most to the differences in the raptors’ diets, in terms of biomass (33% and 20.3%, respectively). Close nesting surroundings (0.5 km and 1 km radius) evidenced a higher proportion of natural vegetation in the kestrel’s (50.6% and 38.9%, respectively) than in owl’s potential home range (25.8% and 16.4%). The differences in diet suggest some degree of niche partitioning of these species likely due to the more flexible owl’s nesting habitat requirements and to the extended nocturnal activity of the species. These results reflect the capability of being complementary species, both exploiting some pests that are harmful for agriculture, and evidencing the importance of both species as regulators of agro-ecosystems in the peninsula of Baja California. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Biological invasions are most practical to manage when invasive species population densities are low. Despite a potentially narrow window of opportunity for efficient management, managers tend to delay intervention because the cost of prompt action is often high and resources are limited. The Barred Owl (Strix varia) invaded and colonized the entire range of the Northern Spotted Owl (S. occidentalis caurina), but insufficient population data contributed to delays in action until the Barred Owl posed an existential threat to the Spotted Owl. The leading edge of the Barred Owl expansion has since reached the Sierra Nevada, the core range of the California Spotted Owl (S. o. occidentalis). We conducted passive acoustic surveys within 400-ha grid cells across ~6,200 km2 in the northern Sierra Nevada and detected a 2.6-fold increase in Barred Owl site occupancy between 2017 and 2018, from 0.082 (85% confidence interval: 0.045-0.12) to 0.21 (0.14-0.28). The probability of Barred Owl site colonization increased with the amount of older forest, suggesting that Barred Owls are first occupying the preferred habitat of Spotted Owls. GPS-tagged Barred Owls (n = 10) generally displayed seasonal and interannual site fidelity over territories averaging 411 ha (range: 150-513 ha), suggesting that our occupancy estimates were not substantially upwardly biased by "double counting" individuals whose territories spanned multiple grid cells. Given the Barred Owl's demonstrated threat to the Northern Spotted Owl, we believe our findings advise the Precautionary Principle, which posits that management actions such as invasive species removal should be taken despite uncertainties about, for example, true rates of population growth if the cost of inaction is high. In this case, initiating Barred Owl removals in the Sierra Nevada before the population grows further will likely make such action more cost-effective and more humane than if it is delayed. It could also prevent the extirpation of the California Spotted Owl from its core range. Copyright © American Ornithological Society 2020. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: WE DESCRIBE the event of Long-eared Owls Asio otus nesting on an island within a colony of Caspian Gulls Larus cachinnans at the Mietków Reservoir (SW Poland). The owls nested in an old (possible corvid) nest in a willow and raised two owlets. They probably did not hunt gulls, neither adults nor chicks. We suggest that, in this case, the Long-eared Owls benefitted from breeding within a gull colony because of the added security against predators that the gulls provided. © 2020 the author(s).

ABSTRACT: Birdwatching is a very popular and increasing leisure activity, and the study and observation of birds is more popular in the morning due to the greater activity among birds at that time of day. The aim of our study was to find out whether there was a relationship between the circadian preference of observers and their favourite bird species and whether it was influenced by such factors as professional status, age and gender. In an e-mail survey we asked a total of 433 Polish ornithologists (professionals) or birdwatchers (non-professionals) for their morningness- eveningness preferences (four categories) and favourite (open choice) bird species and received 143 responses. The temporal (circadian) preferences of respondents declined from early morning (35.7%) to evening/nighttime (11.4%). Circadian preference categories differed significantly by age, with early morning respondents significantly older. These preference categories did not differ significantly in terms of response time to the survey invitation or in the percentage of their favourite birds that were categorised as daytime birds. A total of 204 species were identified as favourite birds of which 34 species were mentioned by five or more respondents, with only two, the common crane Grus grus and the Eurasian pygmy owl Glaucidium passerinum mentioned by more than 10% of respondents. The white stork Ciconia ciconia was more popular with professionals than non-professionals and the swift Apus apus less popular. A significant gender × circadian preference interaction was detected for the percentage of favourite birds categorised as daytime birds, with fewer daytime birds among early morning female recorders. The presented results are obviously of a correlative nature, but open the door for further, more advanced study and suggest there may be a need to investigate temporal biases when analysing citizen-based data.

ABSTRACT: Noise reduction is an important development direction for aircrafts and wind turbines. Owl wings have three unique morphological characteristics (leading-edge serrations, trailing-edge serrations and velvet-like surfaces) that effectively suppress aerodynamic noise in low Reynolds numbers. Among them, trailing-edge serrations are widely considered the most effective noise-reduction method. Although different serrations have been studied, the quantitative relationship and influence mechanism between the serration shape, wavelength and amplitude are poorly understood. The acoustic characteristics of asymmetrical aerofoils with different trailing-edge serrations have not been fully studied. This work investigates the flow characteristics and acoustic scattering mechanisms of novel owl-based aerofoils with different trailing-edge serrations. A sensitivity analysis is utilized to quantitatively investigate the influence and interaction mechanisms of the shape, wavelength and amplitude in trailing-edge noise reduction. Numerical simulations of the transient flow over the aerofoil are performed via the large eddy simulation method, and the acoustic far-field is obtained by solving the Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings equation. The results indicate that the sawtooth and sinusoidal serrations provide the most significant noise reduction effects; the maximum noise reduction is 8.74 dB. The wavelength and amplitude play similar roles, but the amplitude has relatively greater influence. For the sawtooth and sinusoidal serrations, the large-scale vortex structures are broken into many small-scale spiral vortex structures due to the presence of the sharp serration tip. The serrations can effectively reduce the coherence of the turbulent fluctuations due to spanwise variations in the edge and may be the main reason for noise suppression. The original owl-based aerofoil generates more low-frequency noise and less high-frequency noise than aerofoils with trailing-edge serrations. The peak noise frequencies of all aerofoils are approximately 400 Hz; hence, low-frequency noise is a dominant influence in noise generation. Furthermore, the acoustic sources generated by transient pressure fluctuations are mainly located on the serration root. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The Pampa biogeographic province covers a mere 2% of the Brazilian territory (176,496 km2). However, it stands out as a complex and diverse ecosystem, although its mammal communities are still scarcely understood. Human activities are transforming the territory into a mosaic of agroecosystems, native and exotic forest fragments, and grasslands. Here we conducted the first investigation to determine the richness of small mammal assemblages in the region based on extensive analyses of owl pellets (Tyto furcata). Craniodental remains were studied from samples collected from 12 Semi-deciduous Seasonal Forest sites in the municipality of São Lourenço do Sul, State of Rio Grande do Sul, Southern Brazil. A total of 2,617 individuals belonging to 19  taxa were recorded, including 2 marsupials (Didelphidae; 0.42%), 2 chiropterans (Molossidae, Phyllostomidae; 0.12%), and 15 rodents (Cricetidae, Muridae, Caviidae; 99.46%). The rodent genera Oligoryzomys, Mus, Calomys, and Akodon were the most common taxa. Large samples also included poorly known taxa, such as the cricetids Bibimys, Juliomys (recording here its southernmost occurrence), Lundomys, and Wilfredomys. From a biogeographical point of view, the recorded assemblage embraces a mixture of Platan, Pampean, and Atlantic Forest elements, highlighting the role of the southernmost Brazilian hills as a wedge favoring the penetration of forest micromammals to higher latitudes. Our findings testify to the great diversity of the Pampa, but also point to a growing homogeneity and dominance of rodent species that are widespread in agroecosystems. Rapid inventories based on owl pellets emerge as a suitable, economic, non-invasive tool to document these community changes. © 2020, Universidade de Sao Paulo. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Birds providing prey with a clumped distribution often return to the previous capture site after having delivered a prey item at the nest. However, details of this foraging tactic are still poorly known, in particular for birds of prey, which often travel far from their nest. We radio-tracked four provisioning male Boreal Owls (Aegolius funereus) during the nighttime and simultaneously recorded their prey deliveries by a video camera positioned at the nest in an increase year of the vole cycle. The camera allowed prey identification and made it possible to assign prey deliveries to fixes of the foraging owls, i.e. the last recorded fix before the owl returned to the nest for a prey delivery. Within a single night, the owls returned more often than randomly expected to the area where they had captured the previous prey item. A prey item delivered was more likely than randomly expected to be of the same species as the previous prey item delivered. However, the probability of a prey item delivered being of the same species as the previous prey item delivered was independent of whether the owl had returned to the area where it captured the previous prey and did not decrease with longer time elapsed since the previous delivery. The owls did not shift hunting area from one night to the next to a larger extent than they did over a longer time span, and overall tended to shift their hunting area gradually over more nights. Our study should be replicated in a peak vole year with higher prey abundance as well as in a low vole year, which should improve the study results by enabling a higher spatial and temporal resolution of the data on the owls’ movements. © 2019, Deutsche Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.

ABSTRACT: Conventional evolutionary biology highlights examples like the Galápagos finches, which show rapid responses to climatic change. Previous studies of many common birds of La Brea, including Teratornis merriami, La Brea Condors (Gymno-gyps amplus), Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos), Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucoceph-alus), Californian Turkeys (Meleagris californica), Caracaras (Caracara plancus prelutosus), and Black Vultures (Coragyps occidentalis), as well as the two larger owls, the Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus) and the Barn Owl (Tyto alba), showed complete stasis in size and shape through the last glacial-interglacial cycle. Are the smaller birds, especially the small owls, as unresponsive to climate change as the larger birds, or are they more like the Galápagos finches? We measured the large samples of the crow-sized Long-Eared Owl (Asio otus) and the robin-sized Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia) from the collections of the La Brea Tar Pits Museum to determine if they showed size or shape changes in response to the climate changes of the last 35,000 years. Even though living Burrowing Owls exhibit a weak Bergmann’s rule effect, with larger subspecies in colder climates, neither species of small owls from Rancho La Brea showed statistically significant changes in size or robustness even during the peak glacial interval at 20,000-18,000 years ago, when the climate at Rancho La Brea was dominated by coniferous forests and snowy winters. Apparently, most birds do not respond to long-term changes in climate in a simple fashion, but are ecologically flexible and live in a wide range of habitats and climates without change in size or limb robustness.

ABSTRACT: The striped owl (Asio clamator) is unique with its brownish white facial disc and they are found in the north eastern part of Nigeria. Little is known in the literature on the basic neuroanatomy of this species. This study focuses on the histology and glial expression of some brain regions of the striped owl. Five owls were obtained in the wild, and their brains were routinely prepared for Haematoxylin and Eosin, and Cresyl violet staining. Immunostaining was done with anti-Calbindin, anti MBP, anti-GFAP, and anti-Iba-1 antibodies; for the expression of cerebellar Purkinje cells and white matter, cerebral astrocytes and microglia cells respectively. These were qualitatively described. We found that the hippocampal formation of the striped owl, though unique, is very similar to what is seen in mammals. The cerebellar cortex is convoluted, has a single layer of Purkinje cells with profuse dendritic arborization, a distinct external granular cell layer, and a prominent stem of white matter were seen in this study. The astrocytic population in cerebral gray is similar, though lacking in many processes as is typical in protoplasmic astrocytes, while the microglia were not strongly stained. The few stained microglia cells did not, however, show any features of activation. The striped owl’s brain reveals some conserved aspects of cellular neuroanatomy in both the avian and mammals that are typical in these species. More work is however needed particularly in age related differences in these structures. This is perhaps the first report of Calbindin immunostaining in the brain of the striped owl. © Physiological Society of Nigeria

ABSTRACT: Summary . Owls, like other secretive species, are difficult to detect. During the last few decades, protocols used for surveying owls have revealed the best methods to acquire accurate data about their distribution and abundance. However, these protocols were established by testing the response of owls to playback of broadcast calls, using wild, unknown individuals that were only noticeable when vocalisations were given/detected. Therefore, there is no clear consensus on the best method to survey owls. We tested a protocol to survey Tawny Owls Strix aluco using 20 radio-tracked individuals in two study areas with contrasting owl density. We conducted 58 survey tests during winter 2014-2015. In the two study areas respectively, 61.3% and 70.4% of the target individuals responded, on average, within the first six minutes after the start of call playback. Naïve occupancy estimates were 67.7% and 85.2%, respectively, considering the combined responses of the target individual and its mate. We detected a movement of the target owls from their original position towards the playback source on 72.4% of the sampling occasions in both areas. Tawny Owls approached within 50m of the playback point on only 56.9% of occasions. Mates or neighbours responded to broadcast calls more often in the high-density area than in the low density one. The detection probability of target owls increased more than fourfold when their mates joined in defence of the territory, and also increased fourfold when the target individuals approached the broadcast point and when we increased the playback period from five to fifteen minutes. We recommend two 15-minute periods of call playback per point and year, on dry and calm winter nights, at survey points one kilometre apart. - Zuberogoitia, I., Burgos, G., González-Oreja, J.A., Martínez, J.E., Morant, J. & Zabala, J.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE To assess the effect of rocuronium bromide-induced mydriasis on the intraocular pressure (IOP) of kestrels (Falco tinnunculus) and little owls (Athene noctuae). ANIMALS 13 adult kestrels and 13 adult little owls. PROCEDURES All birds were ophthalmologically normal. During the first of 2 treatment periods, a 1% rocuronium bromide solution was topically instilled in both eyes of all birds at a dose of 0.12 mg (12 µL) for kestrels and 0.20 mg (20 µL) for little owls. No ophthalmic treatments were administered during the second (control) treatment period, which was conducted 1 week after the first. During both treatment periods, rebound tonometry was used to measure IOP before rocuronium bromide instillation or at the beginning of the control period (baseline) and at predetermined times after baseline or until the pupillary light reflex returned to normal. All IOP measurements were obtained between 8 am and 5 pm. RESULTS The mean IOP did not differ significantly from baseline for either species during the control treatment period. During the rocuronium bromide treatment period, complete mydriasis was achieved in all birds. The mean IOP was significantly decreased from baseline and from the corresponding mean IOP for the control period beginning 60 and 30 minutes after drug instillation for kestrels and owls, respectively, and reached its nadir at 60 minutes after drug instillation for both species. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results indicated that topical instillation of rocuronium bromide in the eyes successfully induced mydriasis and decreased the IOP of common kestrels and little owls. © 2019 American Veterinary Medical Association.

ABSTRACT: Capsule: Voles predated by Long-eared Owls Asio otus were more likely to be female and smaller than the voles in the available population. Aims: Our study aimed to estimate the size and sex of prey in the diet of Long-eared Owls and compare them with the size and sex of prey in the field. Methods: The study was carried out in 2016 and 2017 at Moscow Region, Russia. Prey remains were extracted from pellets produced by Long-eared Owls. The sex of prey was identifiable due to sexual dimorphism of pelvic bones, and bone dimensions were used to estimate the body mass of prey. Small mammals were also trapped in the study area to compare the sex and size of animals taken as prey with those in the general population. Results: Long-eared Owls did not capture small mammals randomly with respect to size and sex. In general, individuals of the two main prey species in the pellets of Long-eared Owls were significantly smaller than the trapped animals. Long-eared Owls more often caught the females of both species of voles. However, the percentages of females in the diet varied between years. Conclusions: Long-eared Owls more often catch individual voles of a certain size and sex. We suggest that this selective predation could influence not only the number of prey species, but could also impact the structure of their local populations. © 2020, © 2020 British Trust for Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: The geographic distribution of Great Horned Owl, Bubo virginianus (Gmelin, 1788), in Rio de Janeiro state, southeastern Brazil, is revised and expanded. Two individuals were recorded in an Atlantic Forest fragment surrounded by rural and industrial areas in Macaé municipality, on the northern coast of Rio de Janeiro state. This is the twentieth time that B. virginianus is documented in this state in the last two centuries and highlights the importance of bird surveys in regions with ornithological knowledge gaps. © Patiu et al.

ABSTRACT: Ethics reviews are not part of environmental policy or wildlife management in the United States. This changed when, for the first time, the US Fish and Wildlife Service conducted such a review with respect to the barred and northern spotted owls. Spotted owls are endangered throughout their range by a variety of anthropogenic and natural forces. The interspecific competition between barred and spotted owls is a key factor second only to habitat destruction. A proposed lethal experiment to remove barred owls raised ethical concerns among wildlife agencies, citizens, and advocacy groups. Seeking to better understand these concerns, the Service created the Barred Owl Stakeholder Group. Using an innovative method and instrument in the form of an ethics-based policy dialogue and an ethics brief, the stakeholder group explored the ethical dimensions of the removal experiment. This process holds lessons for how public policy can bring ethics to bear on wild lives. Keywords © 2018 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.

ABSTRACT: Oil palm is the most important plantation commodities in Indonesia due to planting area and productivity. There are some constrains faced by oil palm management, one of them is plant pest including insects and rats. Insects and rats have a high reproduction capability and severely damage to oil palm plantation. An effective and environmentally control of these pests using natural enemies, one of them owl. The sunda scops-owl (Otus lempiji Horsfield) was tested in the Laboratory of Vertebrate Pest, IPB University using different types of feed, to calculate the level of bait preference. Method used was bi-choice test, comparing the feeding of preference bait between: (a) rat and larvae of beetle, (b) rat and lizard, (c) rat and fish, (d) rat and cricket. Before and after treatment, all baits were weighed to determine the amount consumption and preference to feed. The data showed that the sunda scops-owl consumed rat higher than larvae of beetle, lizard, fish, and cricket, and significantly different. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Although nine nominal species of Eimeria Schneider, 1875 have been reported from owls (Strigiformes Wagler), molecular data are available for only one, Eimeria megabubonis Upton, Campbell, Weigel & McKown, 1990. This species has been reported from the great horned owl, Bubo virginianus (Gmelin) at the type-locality of Kansas, USA, and the additional localities of Oklahoma and Mississippi, USA. Eimeria bubonis Cawthorn & Stockdale, 1981, also from B. virginianus, is represented in the literature only by its original description from Saskatchewan, Canada. The present work reports a novel host locality of E. bubonis from B. virginianus in Arkansas, USA. Additionally, novel molecular data from the 18S ribosomal RNA gene and the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 mitochondrial gene is provided for E. bubonis. Phylogenetic analysis using the newly generated and previously published sequence data for Eimeria spp. is also presented. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

ABSTRACT: Bulk sampling and extensive, systematic surface collecting of the Coon Creek Member of the Ripley Formation (early Maastrichtian) at the Blue Springs locality and primarily bulk sampling of the Owl Creek Formation (late Maastrichtian) at the Owl Creek type locality, both in northeast Mississippi, USA, have produced the largest and most highly diversified actinopterygian otolith (ear stone) assemblage described from the Mesozoic of North America. The 3,802 otoliths represent 30 taxa of bony fishes representing at least 22 families. In addition, there were two different morphological types of lapilli, which were not identifiable to species level. The large number of otolith specimens as well as the preservation contributed to the recognition of 4 new genera and 13 new species. The otoliths supplied information regarding the presence of bony fishes not available solely on the basis of osteological remains, and the Late Cretaceous bony fish assemblage at the sites would be underestimated and misinterpreted without an examination of the otoliths. The otoliths also contributed evidence on the evolutionary development of teleosts in North America, especially the diversity of the beryciforms in the Late Cretaceous, and provided indications of the paleoecology during the Maastrichtian. The Ripley Formation (Coon Creek Member) otolith assemblage, which accounted for 3,718 of the specimens, is compared to other Cretaceous otolith assemblages in North America that meet certain criteria (employed bulk-sampling techniques, had well-preserved specimens, and possessed a substantial number of specimens and taxa for analysis). These sites were in Alabama, Maryland, Mississippi (two localities), New Jersey, North Carolina, North Dakota, Tennessee, and Texas. Systematic surface collecting at the Blue Springs locality proved to be very beneficial in supplying otoliths specimens from maturer fishes. Many of the surface-collected otoliths represent older adult fishes that assist with the identification of several forms with greater specificity. © 2020 Universita degli Studi di Milano.

ABSTRACT: We quantify the expected demographic benefit to a seabird of conservation concern, the ashy storm-petrel Oceanodroma homochroa, from the proposed eradication of introduced house mice Mus musculus on the South Farallon Islands, California. A key objective of the eradication is to reduce storm petrel predation by burrowing owls Athene cunicularia, which stopover on the island during their fall migration. Mouse trapping and field surveys of both owls and depredated storm petrel carcasses conducted during 2000–2012 reveal a strongly seasonal, inter-related pattern among the three species: When owls arrive during the fall, mice are super-abundant and the overwhelming choice of prey for those owls that remain. In the winter, the mouse population crashes just as storm petrels begin to arrive in large numbers; owls that remain on the island switch to preying upon storm petrels until May, when they depart to breed. Capture–recapture analyses of storm petrels showed (1) annual adult survival was inversely related to owl abundance, especially during January–April, and (2) storm petrels demonstrated a declining trend in abundance 2006–2012. The latter was associated with low rates of adult survival, high abundance of overwintering burrowing owls, and high incidence of depredated storm petrels. To evaluate projected impacts to storm petrels of a change in owl predation, we developed a Leslie matrix model, incorporating environmental stochasticity. We modeled future storm petrel population trajectories, allowing for different levels of owl-mediated predation. Our results suggest that a reduction in owl abundance, a projected consequence of the elimination of mice, has the potential to substantially reduce overall storm petrel mortality, thereby reducing storm petrel declines and increasing the likelihood of stable trends in the future. While long-term benefits to storm petrels of mouse eradication are apparent, the risk of increased predation due to prey-switching by owls also needs to be addressed. This study highlights uncertainty of outcomes, which must be considered in evaluating management impacts. This study demonstrates the value of concurrent, continuous, long-term datasets in providing a quantitative basis for management to aid the conservation of species of concern. © 2019 Point Blue Conservation Science.

ABSTRACT: The definitive work on Europe’s largest and most spectacular owl. The Eagle Owl is one of the largest owls in the world, and is considered the most eclectic in terms of habitat, nest site and diet. An undisputed top predator, it can prey on a range of mammals up to the size of a fox, and almost every species of bird, reptile, amphibian and fish, as well as a wide spectrum of invertebrates. Surprisingly, this owl can breed almost anywhere, the female laying her eggs on a variety of natural and artificial structures over an array of altitudes. Despite being so adaptable, however, it is still a vulnerable species, and has suffered widely from persecution as well as other threats including electrocution on power lines, decreasing prey availability, the effects of pesticides and pollutants, and habitat alteration. Vincenzo Penteriani and María del Mar Delgado have studied this fascinating bird extensively across its vast Eurasian range. In this book, they detail its intriguing ecology, covering distribution, foraging and breeding behaviour, interspecific interactions, dispersal and conservation issues. The final two chapters provide a remarkable insight into vocal and visual communication. Scientists have long believed that owls and other crepuscular and nocturnal birds forgo the visual signals found in other avian species, but recent research on the Eagle Owl has suggested otherwise. Bringing together more than 30 years of research, The Eagle Owl tells a story rich in detail of one of the most thrilling and magnificent birds in the world. © Vincenzo Penteriani and María del Mar Delgado, 2019.

ABSTRACT: Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia) have a large geographic range spanning both North and South America and resident populations occur on many islands in the eastern Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. Many owl populations are isolated and disjunct from other populations, but studies on genetic variation within and among populations are limited. We characterized DNA microsatellite variation in populations varying in size and geographic isolation in the Florida (A. c. floridana), the Western (A. c. hypugaea), and the Clarion (A. c. rostrata) subspecies of the Burrowing Owl. We also characterized genetic variation in a geographically isolated population of the western subspecies in central Mexico (near Texcoco Lake). Clarion Burrowing Owls had no intrapopulation variation (i.e., fixation) at 5 out of 11 microsatellite loci, a likely outcome of genetic drift in an isolated and small population. The Florida subspecies had only polymorphic loci but had reduced levels of genetic variation compared with the more-widespread western subspecies that occurs throughout western North America. Despite the extensive geographic distribution of the Western Burrowing Owl, we found genetic differentiation between the panmictic population north of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and the resident Texcoco Lake population in central Mexico. © 2019 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Anthropogenic mortality has a considerable impact on populations of long-lived species, such as raptors, which increasingly inhabit human-dominated landscapes. Here, we analyzed long-term mortality data for two rapidly declining owls, Little Owl Athene noctua and Barn Owl Tyto alba, in the Czech Republic. We evaluated relative mortality rates with respect to owl age, month of carcass recovery, and two time periods (before and after year 2000). We examined 961 mortality records (199 Little Owls and 762 Barn Owls) derived from six distinct database sources totally spanning the period of years 1934–2017 and the entire Czech Republic. Natural causes, entrapment in vertical hollow objects and drowning in liquid reservoirs (entrapment), and collision with vehicles accounted for the highest proportion of mortality cases in Little Owl, while collision with vehicles and entrapment represented the most important mortality sources in Barn Owl. Relative mortality rates in Little Owl caused by entrapment, non-vehicle collision, electrocution at power lines and confinement in buildings increased after the year 2000. In turn, the relative mortality rate due to collision with vehicles increased after 2000 in Barn Owl. Persecution, collision with vehicles, and entrapment accounted for higher relative mortality rates in first-year than adult Little Owls. In Barn Owls, higher relative mortality rates due to collision with vehicles and entrapment were detected in adult compared to first-year birds. Finally, relative mortality rates differed between age classes according to the month of carcass recovery for both species. For Little Owl, the highest relative mortality rates in first-year individuals were detected during July and September, whereas adult Little Owls suffered the highest relative mortality rates during March, November and December. In Barn Owls, the relative mortality rates of first-year individuals peaked in November and December, whereas adult birds suffered the highest relative mortality rate during July, January and February. This study strongly suggests that reducing the risk of anthropogenic mortality may be crucial to halt the decline of Little Owl and Barn Owl populations. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: We report the case of a Whiskered Screech-Owl (Megascops trichopsis) chick injured by a Northern Flicker (Colaptes auratus) during the breeding season of 2013 in the La Malinche National Park in Mexico. On 17 May, a pair of owls was nesting in a mature Pinus montezumae with one owlet between 14 and 21 d old. On 21 May a flicker began to use the same cavity, apparently preparing the interior for nesting; on 27 May the owlet showed injuries that might have caused its death later, in early June. © 2019 Wilson Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: A new coccidian species (Chromista: Sporozoa: Eimeriidae) collected from the northern saw-whet owl Aegolius acadicus (Gmelin) is reported from Mexico. Eimeria aegoliusia n. sp. has subspherical oöcysts, with smooth, bi-layered wall. Micropyle and oöcyst residuum are both absent and a polar granule is present. To date, eight species of Eimeria Schneider, 1875 have been described from strigiform birds. Mean dimensions of sporulated oöcysts (23.7 × 22.4 µm) and sporocysts (12.8 × 8.3 µm) appear to be considerably smaller than those from other Eimeria spp. with owl definitive hosts: E. atheni Chauhan & Jain, 1979; E. megabubonis Upton, Campbell, Weigel & McKown, 1990; E. spenotytoi Carini, 1939; E. strigis Kutzer, 1963; and E. varia Upton, Campbell, Weigel & McKown. Dimensions of these sporulated oöcysts appear to be larger than those in E. bemricki Averbeck, Cooney, Guarnera, Redig & Stromberg, 1998. The presence of polar granules and their number allowed differentiation from E. bubonis Cawthorn & Stockdale, 1981 and E. nycteae Volf, Koudela & Modry, 1999. This is the first description of an eimeriid coccidian infecting A. acadicus. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

ABSTRACT: In northern California, USA, western Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia) use burrows in active California ground squirrel (Otospermophilus beecheyi) colonies for nesting and protection. Ground squirrels have well-developed, anti-predator alarm-calling behavior, but the potential benefits of such alarm calling to Burrowing Owls have not been examined. The objective of this study was to assess the rate and types of predator interactions experienced by Burrowing Owls and the extent to which they may benefit from alarm calls given by California ground squirrels. We studied interactions of California ground squirrels and Burrowing Owls at Moffett Federal Airfield in urban Santa Clara County, California, during two Burrowing Owl breeding seasons, in 2012 and 2013, using cameras and direct observations. We detected 177 approaches by predators, four of which resulted in predation events on owls. The rate of predator approach during diurnal periods, as determined by direct observation, was 0.93/hr. Ground squirrels called in response to predator approaches before owls did 66% of the time, which was approximately proportional to the abundance of ground squirrels and Burrowing Owls. When squirrels called first, an estimated 75% of owls exhibited alert responses, including alarm calling, running to the burrow, and scanning, indicating that owls benefited from ground squirrel alarm calls in response to approaching predators. Our research suggests that healthy ground squirrel populations may provide important predator alert services to Burrowing Owls, especially in the context of increasing populations of urban predator species. © 2019 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The action of predators, such as diurnal raptors, owls, mammals or humans, influence the nature of small vertebrate fossil assemblages but currently their taphonomic features are still poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the taphonomic signature of the snowy owl (Bubo scandiacus) based on an analysis of pellets collected at breeding sites located in Greenland and the Canadian Arctic. This taxon is widely distributed through the North Hemisphere and was an important predator in Pleistocene times. Taphonomic parameters suggest that, contrary to previous assumptions, B. scandiacus produces, on average, moderate digestion of incisors, molars and post-cranial elements, and should be classed as a Category 3 or Category 3/4 predator according to the terminology established by Andrews. Significant inter-site variability was observed for some of the damage considered (in particular, digestion on incisors), and a key finding is that variability and the associated statistical confidence intervals are crucial notions that should be taken into account when assessing taphonomical features, in order to reliably identify the potential predator(s) responsible for small vertebrate fossil accumulations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Although biased offspring sex ratios are common in species with sexual size dimorphism, the proximate causes are often unresolved. This is because two general mechanisms operating in different ways and in various periods of reproduction can lead to the bias: sex-biased survival or parental sex-allocation. We examined nestling sex ratio patterns between hatching and fledging, sexual size dimorphism, and factors affecting nestling survival using growth and survival data of 846 individual little owl Athene noctua nestlings with known sex from 307 broods from Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark. Nestling sex ratio was female-biased, mainly due to a significant female bias in the first-hatched chicks. Females showed a higher body weight than male nestlings at ringing and body weight of nestlings decreased with hatching sequence. Nestling survival was higher in females (Φ = 0.91) than in males (Φ = 0.85), and survival rates were positively related to body mass and negatively to brood size. Although the observed lower survival of males can cause an overall female-biased sex ratio, the sex dimorphism and survival patterns found here are unlikely to explain the conspicuous sex ratio pattern with a female bias in the first-hatched nestlings and the increase in female bias across the season. Thus, these results point towards interacting mechanisms of parental sex allocation strategies and sex-specific survival. As the female bias was allocated to the first rank that is most likely to survive, the female bias will increase under suboptimal breeding conditions. We therefore suggest that under suboptimal ecological conditions, higher investment into females is adaptive in little owls. Significance statement: Biased sex ratios can have severe effects on the social behaviour and population dynamics of endangered species. However, the existence of subtle sex ratio bias is often unknown and its proximate mechanisms and ultimate consequences often remain unclear. Small sample sizes make the detection of subtle effects unlikely and often fail to disentangle diverging mechanisms such as sex-biased survival and parental sex allocation. We used a large dataset of 846 little owl nestlings from 307 broods from three countries to investigate offspring sex ratio patterns, sexual size dimorphism and nestling survival simultaneously. Our findings suggest interacting mechanisms of parental sex allocation strategies and sex-specific survival to drive biased offspring sex ratios in little owls. The context dependence of the sex ratio bias indicates that offspring sex ratio bias in little owls is both, a consequence of—and an adaptation to—suboptimal breeding conditions. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: A 1.5-year-old male Eastern screech owl (Megascops asio) was presented for evaluation of a progressive decrease in weight-bearing on a previously injured right leg. Neurologic deficits were noted and progressed despite therapy. A neuroma was diagnosed on necropsy adjacent to the historical femoral malunion. This report describes a presumptive traumatic neuroma of nonartificial origin in a bird with clinical evidence of nerve dysfunction. A symptomatic traumatic neuroma should be considered as a differential in birds with evidence of peripheral neuropathy and a history of injury. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: A databank on the pellets of a widespread owl species (the Barn Owl, Tyto alba) was used in order to evaluate the differences in taxonomical composition and community metrics of small mammals (Rodentia and Soricomorpha) along an altitude gradient in Italy. The databank consisted of data from 292 sites, with altitudes ranging between −6 and 1292 m a.s.l. GLM models showed that the number of Rodentia species decreased significantly with elevation gradient, but increased significantly in Soricomorpha. Although there was no overall effect of the altitude on the number of species of Rodentia + Soricomorpha pooled, when we focused only on the central Apennine sites, there was a marginally significant negative correlation between number of species and altitude. There was also a significant increase in abundance with elevation in Soricinae and a significant decrease of abundance with elevation in Crocidurinae. Concerning the smallest sized Soricomorpha, there was a gradual substitution effect of one species (Suncus etruscus) with another (Sorex minutus) with elevation increases, and a logistic regression model revealed that elevation negatively affected the probability of presence of S. etruscus whereas it affected positively that of S. minutus. We think that the decrease in number of species of Rodentia with altitude may depend on the higher rate of agricultural land existing at lower elevations in Italy. The overall pattern of Soricomorpha would depend on the dominance of Soricinae species over the Crocidurinae (in terms of both number of species and relative abundance per site), with the Soricinae being more linked to temperate bioclimates than the Mediterranean-bioclimate-linked Crocidurinae. © 2019

ABSTRACT: Trichomonosis is an important cause of mortality in multiple avian species; however, there have been relatively few reports of this disease in owls. Two barn owls (Tyto alba) and four barred owls (Strix varia) submitted for diagnostic examination had lesions consistent with trichomonosis including caseous necrosis and inflammation in the oropharynx. Microscopically, these lesions were often associated with trichomonads and molecular testing, if obtainable, confirmed the presence of Trichomonas gallinae, the species most commonly associated with trichomonosis in birds. The T. gallinae genotype in one barn owl and two barred owls was identified as ITS-OBT-Tg-1 by sequence analysis. Columbids are the primary hosts for T. gallinae, and columbid remains found within the nest box of the barn owls were the likely source of infection. This study is the first to formally describe the strains and genetic variation of T. gallinae samples from clinical cases of trichomonosis in barn and barred owls in the eastern USA. © 2019

ABSTRACT: Vocal individuality has been used as a monitoring tool, and two criteria are a prerequisite: high variation among individuals and low variation within individuals, and vocal consistency within and across seasons. We examined individual variation in the territorial hoot calls of the tawny owl (Strix aluco) to discriminate between males and to assess a possible conservation technique that would allow for monitoring individuals within a study area. The territorial calls were recorded from five males in the Naejang Mountain National Park in South Korea during the breeding season in 2015 and 2016 and analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively to determine the amount of variation within and between individuals. Our results showed that the territorial calls were specific to individuals within a population and that the acoustic distances between males living in the same territory during the two years were the smallest for the four nesting sites. Our results suggest that territorial calls of the tawny owls are individually identifiable over two years and that this acoustic technique can be useful for monitoring individual site fidelity. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Host-parasite relationships between Western Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia hypugaea) and the fleas (Pulex irritans, Siphonaptera:Pulicidae) they harbor were studied to understand the extent to which migratory Burrowing Owls translocated fleas from wintering grounds to breeding grounds. This has implications for host-parasite relationships in Burrowing Owls and also potentially for the dynamics of plague, as Burrowing Owl distributions overlap plague foci, owls inhabit fossorial mammal colonies where epizootic outbreaks of plague occur, and owls may harbor species of flea that are competent plague vectors. We used hydrogen stable isotope analysis to help elucidate geographic origins of fleas collected from adults and nestlings in 2 migratory populations of Burrowing Owls in Idaho and Oregon, USA. For adults, we posited that bird-mediated dispersal would impart flea isotopic compositions representative of southern latitudes and be similar to owl toenail tissue recently grown on wintering grounds, but they would differ from contour feathers presumably grown on breeding grounds the previous year. We assumed nestling feathers and toenails would have isotopic compositions representative of the breeding grounds. We analyzed contour feathers and toenails from adults collected shortly after they arrived in breeding grounds following spring migration and from nestlings later in the breeding season, to which we compared isotopic compositions in fleas collected from individuals of both age classes. Fleas on nestlings in both populations had isotopic compositions that did not differ from nestling feathers and toenails, suggesting that nestling fleas had breeding ground origins. Fleas on adults in one population (Oregon) had breeding ground isotopic signatures, as flea compositions did not differ from nestling feathers or toenails. Adult owls in Idaho had fleas that similarly did not express a wintering ground signature, but they were enriched in the heavy isotope (deuterium) relative to nestling feathers and toenails. Therefore, we discuss the possibility that adult owls in Idaho acquired fleas at migratory stopover sites. While the latter indicates that Burrowing Owls have the potential to disperse fleas, there was no evidence of continent-wide movement of fleas by owls from wintering grounds to breeding grounds.

ABSTRACT: The Optical Wide-field patroL-Network (OWL-Net) is a global optical network for Space Situational Awareness in Korea. The primary operational goal of the OWL-Net is to track Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites operated by Korea and to monitor the Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) region near the Korean peninsula. To obtain dense measurements on LEO tracking, the chopper system was adopted in the OWL-Net's back-end system. Dozens of angle-only measurements can be obtained for a single shot with the observation mode for LEO tracking. In previous work, the reduction process of the LEO tracking data was presented, along with the mechanical specification of the back-end system of the OWL-Net. In this research, we describe an integrity assessment method of time-position matching and verification of results from real observations of LEO satellites. The change rate of the angle of each streak in the shot was checked to assess the results of the matching process. The time error due to the chopper rotation motion was corrected after re-matching of time and position. The corrected measurements were compared with the simulated observation data, which were taken from the Consolidated Prediction File from the International Laser Ranging Service. The comparison results are presented in the In-track and Cross-track frame. © 2019.

ABSTRACT: The hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis is responsible for the regulation of corticosterone, a hormone that is essential in the mediation of energy allocation and physiological stress. As a continuous source of challenge and stress for organisms, the environment has promoted the evolution of physiological adaptations and led to a great variation in corticosterone profiles within or among individuals, populations and species. In order to evolve via natural selection, corticosterone levels do not only depend on the strength of selection exerted on them, but also on the extent to which the regulation of corticosterone is heritable. Nevertheless, the heritability of corticosterone profiles in wild populations is still poorly understood. In this study, we estimated the heritability of baseline and stress-induced corticosterone levels in barn owl (Tyto alba) nestlings from 8 years of data, using a multivariate animal model based on a behavioural pedigree. We found that baseline and stress-induced corticosterone levels are strongly genetically correlated (r = 0.68–0.80) and that the heritability of stress-induced corticosterone levels (h2 = 0.24–0.33) was moderate and similar to the heritability of baseline corticosterone levels (h2 = 0.19–0.30). These findings suggest that the regulation of stress-induced corticosterone and baseline levels evolves at a similar pace when selection acts with the same intensity on both traits and that contrary to previous studies, the evolution of baseline and stress-induced level is interdependent in barn owls, as they may be strongly genetically correlated. © 2019, The Genetics Society.

ABSTRACT: Emerging bioacoustic technology allows researchers to passively record animal vocalizations to study population dynamics at relatively broad spatial scales. Spatiotemporal patterns in vocalization behavior free from direct human influence, which occurs during traditional vocal-lure surveys, may also yield novel behavioral insights. We used passively recorded audio data to examine such patterns in the California Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) across the northern Sierra Nevada. We assessed temporal patterns in the initiation of bouts of four-note calls and the number of such calls, and we used generalized linear mixed models to test whether environmental factors influenced bout-initiation time, bout duration, and the number of calls per unit time. We found that (1) Spotted Owls were most vocally active within three hours of sunset, (2) bouts of calling were longer with fewer calls per unit time in open and young forest, (3) those bouts were concentrated in the middle of the night, and (4) the frequency of occurrence and duration of bouts of territorial vocal activity was reduced in montane riparian forest. These patterns suggest that Spotted Owls may engage in territorial defense in marginal habitat (open and young forest) and minimize their vocal activity in key foraging habitat (montane riparian forest). This application of acoustic monitoring data to behavioral ecology illustrates the broad applicability of the underlying audio data and its potential to yield novel ecological insights. © 2019 Western Field Ornithologists.

ABSTRACT: The Barn Owl (Tyto alba) is a nocturnal raptor, with an ample distribution worldwide; however, knowledge about its diet in the north of South America is still scarce. In this study, we analyzed 361 pellets and 664 g of pellet debris of T. alba from two localities in the dry forest of the interandean valley of Ecuador. We identified a total of 1118 prey items representing 27 taxa grouped into four classes: Insecta, Reptilia, Aves and Mammalia. The most frequent prey item was the rodent Reithrodontomys soederstroemi (Cricetidae). A comparative analysis with other studies conducted in northern South America showed a 70.1% similarity between prey groups consumed by this raptor. © 2019, Asociacion Colombiana de Ornitologia.

ABSTRACT: Mosquito-borne diseases can have disastrous effects on avian populations; therefore, most studies of bird and mosquito interactions have focused on the mortality and morbidity associated with the diseases. However, the effect of mosquitoes feeding on birds, independent of disease, has not been well studied. We studied Barn Owls (Tyto alba) nesting in artificial nest boxes in sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) fields in Florida, US. To reduce mosquito effects on nestlings, we used an insecticide spray in half of the nest boxes. Mosquito suction traps were fixed to the outside of eight nest boxes (four treated and four untreated) to collect mosquitoes over a 24-h period (one trap night) once weekly, from incubation until all nestlings fledged. Collected mosquitoes were counted, sorted into blood-fed and unfed females, and identified to species when possible. The dominant mosquito species captured were Culex nigripalpus, Mansonia dyari, and Mansonia titillans. The highest total number of mosquitoes and blood-fed mosquitoes captured in a suction trap in one trap night was 3,193 and 379, respectively. Overall, significantly fewer mosquitoes were captured from treated nest boxes compared to untreated boxes. Nestling age influenced the total number of mosquitoes captured, with the highest numbers associated with fledglings 22-42 d old. The highest numbers of blood-fed mosquitoes were captured when nestlings were 22-28 d old. Nestlings in insecticide-treated boxes had higher survival rates compared to those in untreated boxes during months with high mosquito numbers. Mosquitoes can impose energetic costs on nestlings by causing stress from irritation, dehydration, and the constant regeneration of blood cells. These costs, in addition to factors such as food shortage, temperature, and overall health of the nestling, can contribute to higher mortality rates during nesting periods with high mosquito numbers. © Wildlife Disease Association 2019.

ABSTRACT: While nine nominal species of Eimeria Schneider, 1875 have been described from strigiform birds, molecular sequence data are not available for any of these species. In the present study, oöcysts of a coccidian were isolated by faecal flotation from the lower intestinal contents of an opportunistically collected, recently deceased great horned owl Bubo virginianus (Gmelin), sporulated in potassium dichromate, and subjected to morphological and molecular characterisation. Comparisons of morphological data with previous accounts of Eimeria spp. from owls were consistent with Eimeria megabubonis Upton, Campbell, Weigel & McKown, 1990. Novel molecular data for the 18S ribosomal RNA gene region and the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene are provided. The results of phylogenetic analysis based on concatenated sequence data from these regions are presented and implications for the evolutionary history of Eimeria are discussed. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

ABSTRACT: Sexing of birds is important for ecology and evolutionary biology studies, as well as breeding and conservation programs especially for sexually monomorphic birds. As for barn owls, Tyto alba, confirmation of sex is important for conservation as well as introduction programs to control rodent pest populations. Molecular sexing of Southeast Asian subspecies, Tyto alba javanica was carried out using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification followed by 3% agarose gel electrophoresis. Primers P2/P8 and 2550F/2718R for the amplification of CHD gene (Chromo Helicase DNA-binding gene) were tested and both gave successful results. 2550F/2718R primer set gave better results as the gap between double bands was larger. DNA extracted from blood, whole diluted blood, and DNA extracted from feathers was used to molecularly sex owls. DNA extracted from feather gave the least effective results owing to contamination and low DNA concentration, while sexing owls using direct whole diluted blood provided a cost and time effective method. Sequencing of CHD gene from Tyto alba javanica showed 98% to 99% similarity in identity when compared to CHD gene of Tyto alba alba. © Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2019.

ABSTRACT: Our current understanding of the relationship between imperiled species and forest management can benefit from global positioning system (GPS) technologies. Fauna of lateseral stage forests have historically been difficult to detect and track in rugged terrain, leading to challenges in movement characterization and conservation. We investigated movement of California Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) using automated GPS loggers affixed to 15 owls in the northern Sierra Nevada, California. We used >17,000 locations from individual owls to characterize homerange size, movement distances, and roosting and foraging habitat selection at four spatio-temporal scales (landscape, home range, foray, nightly) during the breeding season (April–August). Additionally, we assessed owl use of Protected Activity Centers (PACs), which are designated by the U.S.D.A. Forest Service to protect nesting and roosting habitat. Our results corroborated some previous findings about habitat requirements of California Spotted Owls, while also revealing new nuances in space use and habitat selection. Roosting and foraging owls selected stands with high canopy cover and large trees at multiple spatio-temporal scales, with foraging owls showing strongest selection at the largest (landscape) scale investigated. Although owls selected for PACs while foraging and roosting, PACs protected less than one quarter of foraging space use (volume of use) and fewer than half of observed roosts during the breeding season. Female owl home ranges were double the size of male home ranges, and distances travelled from the nest by females were 1.3 times greater than distances travelled by males, with non-breeding females travelling farthest and visiting up to six PACs during a single breeding season. Foraying behavior of this sort has not been documented previously in California Spotted Owls. Our findings support protection of later seral stage forest attributes for roosting and foraging California Spotted Owls. Given their selection for later seral forest attributes, strongest evidence of foraging habitat selection at the landscape scale, long distances travelled by owls and limited habitat protection afforded by PACs, habitat connectivity across the landscape is likely an important component for owl conservation, and distribution of current protected areas may be inadequate for this wide-ranging species. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: We examined the diet of the Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus) through the analysis of pellets and prey remains collected during the breeding seasons of 2014 and 2015 at a nest found in an grassy páramo at an elevation of 4,020 m, municipality of Murillo, Tolima, in the Central Andes of Colombia. We identified 78 food items recovered from 58 pellets and 80 g of other prey remains. Our results suggest that at least during the breeding season, B. virginianus is preying mainly on the rabbit Sylvilagus brasiliensis, with a frequency of occurrence of 82% in 2014 and 88% in 2015. This rabbit is a large enough prey to give an optimum amount of biomass for reproduction (biomass contribution: 99.92% in 2014 and 99.74% in 2015) compared to other prey species at these elevations. In paramos of the Central Andes, S. brasiliensis is an apparently abundant prey that occurs in pastures and grasslands, generating a greater frequency of predation by B. virginianus, which generally hunts from perches in open or semi-open areas or by gliding slowly above the ground. © 2019, Asociacion Colombiana de Ornitologia.

ABSTRACT: Biological pest control is gaining greater acceptance as an important part of integrated pest management for sustainable agriculture. However, knowledge regarding biological control of rodent pests is limited, and its effectiveness in temperate areas has not been quantified. In traditional Japanese apple orchards, the Ural owl Strix uralensis breeds in tree hollows and preys on the Japanese field vole Microtus montebelli, a native pest species that can harm fruit production. In this study, we hypothesised that the Ural owl, a generalist predator, can act as a biological control agent by reducing vole densities in temperate orchards. To quantify the pest control effects of breeding Ural owls, we first analysed the diet of individual owls nesting in apple tree hollows. Second, we installed nest boxes in orchards to attract breeding owl pairs and collected data on vole population changes around owl nests to compare with control areas. The population changes were analysed using a generalised linear mixed model to assess the effect of breeding owls within their breeding territory. The model considered seasonal fluctuations in vole population size as well as surrounding land-use. We also examined vole populations around the owl nests in April, and the distance between nests and forested areas, to determine if these variables influenced nest site selection. Voles were the primary prey of Ural owls breeding in orchards and the owls reduced vole populations within their estimated breeding territories by 63% (±SE: 53%–70%) compared with the predicted density without owls. Owls preferred to nest in orchards with higher vole population densities in April. Our findings also indicate that higher occupancy rates are possible by distributing nest boxes based on Ural owl breeding territory size (306 m radius circle in our study). Synthesis and applications. As breeding Ural owls provide significant pest control effects within their breeding territories, the reintroduction of breeding Ural owl pairs within orchards would contribute to rodent pest control. Promoting the reproduction of native raptors in agricultural areas can be an option for developing integrated pest management while simultaneously maintaining regional biodiversity. © 2018 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: In this study, a batch least square estimator that utilizes optical observation data is developed and utilized to determine geostationary orbits (GEO). Through numerical simulations, the effects of error sources, such as clock errors, measurement noise, and the a priori state error, are analyzed. The actual optical tracking data of a GEO satellite, the Communication, Ocean and Meteorological Satellite (COMS), provided by the optical wide-field patrol network (OWL-Net) is used with the developed batch filter for orbit determination. The accuracy of the determined orbit is evaluated by comparison with two-line elements (TLE) and confirmed as proper for the continuous monitoring of GEO objects. Also, the measurement residuals are converged to several arcseconds, corresponding to the OWL-Net performance. Based on these analyses, it is verified that the independent operation of electro-optic space surveillance systems is possible, and the ephemerides of space objects can be obtained. © The Korean Space Science Society.

ABSTRACT: Dispersal is crucial for population viability and thus a popular target for conservation measures. However, the ability of individuals to move between habitat patches is notoriously difficult to estimate. One solution is to quantify functional connectivity via realistic individual-based movement models. Such simulation models, however, are difficult to build and even more difficult to parameterize. Here, we use the example of natal little owl (Athene noctua) dispersal to develop a new analysis chain for the calibration of individual-based dispersal models using a hybrid of statistical parameter estimation and Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). Specifically, we use locations of 126 radio-tracked juveniles to first estimate habitat utilization by generalized additive models (GAMs) and the biased random bridges (BRB) method. We then include the estimated parameters in a spatially explicit individual-based model (IBM) of little owl dispersal and calibrate further movement parameters using ABC. To derive efficient summary statistics, we use a new dimension reduction method based on random forest (RF) regression. Finally, we use the calibrated IBM to predict the dispersal potential of little owls from local populations in southwestern Germany to suitable habitat patches in northern Switzerland. We show that pre-calibrating habitat preference parameters while inferring movement behavioral parameters via ABC is a computationally efficient solution to obtain a plausible IBM parameterization. We also find that dimension reduction via RF regression outperforms the widely used least squares regression, which we applied as a benchmark approach. Estimated movement parameters for the individuals reveal plausible inter-individual and inter-sexual differences in movement behavior during natal dispersal. In agreement with a sex-biased dispersal distance in little owls, females show longer individual flights and higher directional persistence. Simulations from the fitted model indicate that a (re)colonization of northern Switzerland is generally possible, albeit restricted. We conclude that the presented analysis chain is a sensible work-flow to assess dispersal connectivity across species and ecosystems. It embraces species- and individual-specific behavioral responses to the landscape and allows likelihood-based calibration, despite an irregular sampling design. Our study highlights existing, yet narrow dispersal corridors, which may require enhancements to facilitate a recolonization of little owl habitat patches in northern Switzerland. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America

ABSTRACT: A wild adult Eurasian scops owl (Otus scops), which was unable to fly, was rescued. Physical examination revealed a sticky exudate around the glottis. Heterophilic leukocytosis was identified through complete blood count, and radiography revealed a marked elevated density of posterior air sacs and inner cavities in both sides of the humerus and femur. Fungal cultures of samples taken from the owl suggested a respiratory fungal infection. Through molecular typing, the fungus was identified as Epicoccum nigrum. The owl was treated with oral itraconazole and broad-spectrum antibiotics. After one month, the inner cavities of pneumatic bones were slightly distinguishable by radiography and the owl started to fly well. Two months later, the air sac and all pneumatic bones displayed normal appearance. © 2019 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: To use vocalizations properly for the estimation of owl population size, it is important to identify how environmental factors affect owl calling behaviour. Here, we analyse how intrinsic and extrinsic factors modify the vocal activity of Tawny Owls Strix aluco in two areas of northern Spain. From March 2013 to May 2015, we radiotracked 20 Tawny Owls and also undertook a systematic survey in which we collected data on spontaneous vocal activity (hoot/call) of the tagged owls, plus their mates and neighbours (36 untagged owls). After 223 nights in Valle de Mena and 224 in Duranguesado we obtained a total of 8791 records of vocal activity. The annual proportion of surveys on which an owl called was 6.3% and did not differ between the study areas. Vocal activity of Tawny Owls varied with sex, annual cycle stage and weather. Male owls were significantly more vocal than females year-round, and vocal activity peaked during the incubation and post-breeding periods. Wind and rain adversely affected vocal activity of both sexes throughout the year. Tagged owls were detected more often than untagged owls, which we interpret as an observer effect because the systematic survey ensured that short distances to tagged owls increased the probability of detecting vocal activity. In fact, 2.8% of variation in vocal activity was due to detectability differences between tagged and untagged owls. We conclude that if fieldwork is carried out during the optimum period of the year for vocal detection (i.e. incubation, which in our case was around mid-April), and under good weather conditions (dry and calm nights), censuses based on spontaneous vocal activity would detect only approximately 12% of the true Tawny Owl population. © 2018 British Ornithologists’ Union

ABSTRACT: We studied the Little Owl Athene noctua distribution in the city of Milan with a single-visit survey carried out during the 2013 breeding season. We searched for Little Owls in 82 sampling stations spread out all over the city using play-back technique. We detected 52 Little Owls in 33 sampling stations. The species appeared to be quite common in the municipality of Milan but with a greater abundance in the southern outskirts (Parco Agricolo Sud Milano). We modelled species occurrence by means of Generalized Additive Models selecting our best models with an information-theoretic approach. Little Owls' presence resulted more likely in presence of permanent crops and farmsteads. The latter represent one of the main sources of nesting sites for the species. Little Owl's detection is also more likely in relation with buildings' mean height, of about 10 meters while it appears to avoid completely the more dense urban areas present in the central and in the north-eastern side of Milan. The Little owl is finally more likely to be found in the larger urban parks. The species' distribution in the study area showed a significant spatial autocorrelation. Our best model accurately predicts 80.2% of observed data. According to model predictions 29.5% of the municipal territory has a medium or medium-high habitat suitability for the Little Owl. Field methods used in this work seemed to be easily carried out even by non-professionals. We discussed the global survey protocol for the species in light of our experience and with the desirable outlook of a large scale monitoring programme in our country: This is urgently needed to fill in the gap of knowledge on large scale distribution and population trends of the Little owl. © 2019 CISO.

ABSTRACT: The assessments of breeding losses and adverse impacts are crucial in monitoring endangered populations of species such as the eagle owl, Bubo bubo, in Bulgaria. The study population from 45 breeding territories lost 21.7% of laid eggs (n = 761) and 25.2% of nestlings (n = 596) in 327 clutches over 20 years. Out of 11 specified causes, people working or otherwise engaged in activities near nests were the primary reason for destroyed or disturbed nests (35.8%, n = 165 lost eggs, 37.3%, n = 150 lost nestlings). Cannibalism (24.0%), nestlings dying of unknown reasons in the nest (10.0%) and predation (9.9% of lost eggs, 15.3% of lost nestlings) were the most important for the natural decrease of productivity. Breeding in human-made rocky complexes was more successful than in natural sites: treasure hunters destroyed nests only in natural rock formations and predators depredated nests more frequently at these sites. Successful breeding corresponded significantly positively with more difficult access to cliffs and nest places in both categories of rocky complexes. Greater vegetation cover at wider, shady nest sites with easier accessibility showed greater depredation from carnivorous mammals. Nests poorly concealed by vegetation were more vulnerable to the activities of treasure hunters and tourists. We propose biodiversity-friendly management practices of eagle owl breeding territories in relation to analyzed causes of breeding failures. © 2019, NWJZ, Oradea, Romania.

ABSTRACT: Standard representation of data is key for the reproducibility of designs in synthetic biology. The Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) has already emerged as a data standard to represent information about genetic circuits, and it is based on capturing data using graphs. The language provides the syntax using a free text document that is accessible to humans only. This paper describes SBOL-OWL, an ontology for a machine understandable definition of SBOL. This ontology acts as a semantic layer for genetic circuit designs. As a result, computational tools can understand the meaning of design entities in addition to parsing structured SBOL data. SBOL-OWL not only describes how genetic circuits can be constructed computationally, it also facilitates the use of several existing Semantic Web tools for synthetic biology. This paper demonstrates some of these features, for example, to validate designs and check for inconsistencies. Through the use of SBOL-OWL, queries can be simplified and become more intuitive. Moreover, existing reasoners can be used to infer information about genetic circuit designs that cannot be directly retrieved using existing querying mechanisms. This ontological representation of the SBOL standard provides a new perspective to the verification, representation, and querying of information about genetic circuits and is important to incorporate complex design information via the integration of biological ontologies. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

ABSTRACT: Farmland birds in the European Union have declined by 57% in the past 35 years, raising the need for efficient, large-scale conservation measures to halt and reverse their negative trends. The Eurasian Scops Owl Otus scops is an indicator of extensively managed agricultural landscapes, typical of areas of high biodiversity. Its breeding biology is poorly known, but central to understanding the drivers of its marked decline in different European countries, including Slovenia. We used GPS-loggers to study home range size and habitat use of breeding individuals in NE Slovenia. Kernel home ranges (95%) of three females were estimated and their habitat use was analysed by spatial logistic regression models with Moran's Eigenvectors. Individual home range sizes ranged from 2.2 to 48.2 ha. In general, the females preferred to forage close to their nests. One female had a much larger home range than the other two, because of her exploitation of presumably highly profitable foraging grounds far away from her nest. In a mosaic of different agricultural habitats, the females showed a clear preference for extensively managed areas, such as hedges, meadows, abandoned vineyards and traditional orchards. Based on our findings several conservation measures are proposed, aimed at enhancing insect diversity and abundance as well as prey accessibility. © 2019 E-flow BioOne. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Habitat loss and fragmentation are listed among the most significant effects of urbanization, which is regarded as an important threat to wildlife. Owls are the top predators in most terrestrial habitats, and their presence is a reliable indicator of ecosystem quality and complexity. However, influence of urbanization on owl communities, anthropogenic noise in particular, has not been investigated so far. The aim of this study was to identify the role of noise and landcover heterogeneity in the species richness of owl assemblage in the urban ecosystem. Owls were surveyed in the city of Kraków (southern Poland) on 65 randomly selected sample plots (1 km2). The area of main landcover types, landcover diversity index, mean size of landcover patch, and nocturnal noise level were defined within the sample plots and correlated with owl species richness. Five owl species were recorded in the study area with forests as the dominant landcover type for Tawny and Ural owls, grasslands for Long-eared and Barn owls, and gardens for Little owls. In total, 52% of sample plots were occupied by at least one species (1–3 species per plot). The number of owl species was positively correlated with landcover diversity index and negatively correlated with nocturnal noise emission. This study demonstrates that species richness of owls in urban areas may be shaped by landcover heterogeneity and limited by noise intensity. This indicates that noise changes top predator assemblage, which in consequence may disturb predator-prey interactions within human-transformed habitats. © 2019, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: To resolve conflicts over limited resources, animals often communicate about their motivation to compete. When signals are transient, the resolution of conflicts may be achieved after an interactive process, with each contestant adjusting its signaling level according to the rival’s behavior. Unfortunately, the importance of the real-time signal adjustment in conflict resolution remains understudied, especially using experimental approaches. Here we developed a novel “automatic interactive playback” that interacts real-time with a live individual. It allowed us to experimentally test the efficacy of different behavioral strategies to dominate conflicts in nestling barn owls (Tyto alba). In this species, nestlings vocally negotiate for priority access to the impending food item in the absence of parents. Two opposite vocal strategies were tested for their prospects of success: under the “matching” vs. “mismatching” strategy, the playback behaves in the same vs. opposed way as the nestling, respectively. We evaluated how these two strategies affected the two main negotiation parameters: call duration and call rate. We found that the best strategies to reduce the nestling’s vocalizations and hence dominate the negotiation are to match the call duration of the opponent and to mismatch its call rate. However, the latter strategy is the only one that allowed the playback to dominate the vocal interaction by inducing the opponent to become totally silent. Therefore, to prevail in a negotiation session, barn owl nestlings should delay the transmission of signals rather than simultaneously escalate vocalizations as commonly observed in animal competitive interactions. In addition, we showed that matching call duration and mismatching call rate require a larger investment by the playback, in terms of number and duration of calls, than the less effective strategies. Assuming that vocalizations are costly, this suggests that such behavioral strategies are honest. Our results highlight the importance of real-time signaling adjustment in communication processes over resource competition and emphasize the power of using interactive playback settings to investigate conflict resolution in animals. © 2019 Ducouret, Romano, Dreiss, Marmaroli, Falourd and Roulin.

ABSTRACT: Accurate knowledge of the distribution of rare species remains a great challenge in conservation biology because these species are prone to extinction and the number of species becoming rare is increasing. However, the distribution of rare species is usually difficult to delimit because of their low abundances and/or small distribution ranges. These difficulties are even greater when they are sympatric with morphologically similar species that can lead to identification errors. Here, we use barn owl (Tyto alba) pellets to infer, indirectly, potential habitat associations of the lesser white-toothed shrew (Crocidura suaveolens) in the Gulf of Cádiz, south-western Iberia and to clarify the distribution of the species in this region. In the Gulf of Cádiz, C. suaveolens is a rare species that lives in sympatry with its congener, the greater white-toothed shrew (Crocidura russula), a much more abundant and extremely similar species. Through several indirect lines of evidence we inferred a possible association of C. suaveolens with tidal marsh habitat. This was a very surprising finding since C. suaveolens is a habitat generalist throughout its global distribution range. The species presented a highly restricted distribution in the Gulf of Cádiz occurring only in four tidal marshes. The causes of this limited distribution remain poorly understood to date, but our results are consistent with the hypothesis that C. suaveolens was displaced to tidal marshes through competitive exclusion by C. russula, although the geomorphological history of the tidal marshes of the Gulf of Cádiz may also explain its regional distribution and the phylogeographical patterns recently described in the region. © 2019 The Zoological Society of London

ABSTRACT: Owl pellets, regurgitates formed by the undigested parts of owls’ prey, have been used since the 1960s to estimate relative species abundances and community diversity of small mammals in the field. Although insects are important food sources for raptors, the usefulness of owl pellets as a collecting method for entomological studies remains practically unexplored. Many terrestrial arthropods have fragile bodies that degrade during the raptor’s digestive process; however, darkling beetles (Tenebrionidae) resist this process. These organisms are abundant and rich in species, and play significant roles in food and nutrient soil cycles in arid regions. Moreover, darkling beetles are well known and represent up to 52% of prey abundances in Bubo magellanicus (Lesson), one of the most common owls in arid Patagonia. The aim of this work is to evaluate the suitability of B. magellanicus pellets as a research tool for studies of tenebrionid beetle biodiversity assessments in arid Patagonia. Thus, we compare tenebrionid relative species abundances, species richness, and their species assemblage estimated from the diet of B. magellanicus with those identified simultaneously by conventional trapping (pitfall trapping and hand collecting) using multivariate techniques and the Fisher’s exact test. Mitragenius araneiformis Curtis, Patagonogenius quadricollis Fairmaire, and Emmallodera crenaticostata crenaticostata Blanchard were the most abundant tenebrionid species. Relative abundances of almost all species, the estimation of species richness, and tenebrionid assemblage from both collecting methodologies were similar. Therefore, we propose the owl pellet analysis as a useful sampling tool for rapid estimations of the tenebrionid assemblage structure in arid Patagonia. © 2019, Sociedade Entomológica do Brasil.

ABSTRACT: Extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs)-producing Enterobacteriaceae have been classified as critical priority pathogens by the World Health Organization (WHO). We have conducted a microbiological and genomic surveillance study, in order to investigate the occurrence and features of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in wild birds admitted to a wildlife rescue and rehabilitation centre in Chile. This study reports for the first time the occurrence of highly virulent ESBL-producing Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Infantis in wild owls inhabiting the Southern Cone of America. Genomic analysis revealed a wide resistome (for antibiotics, heavy metals and disinfectants) among international lineages of E. coli belonging to ST345 and ST2705, and S. Infantis ST32, producing CTX-M-8 or CTX-M-65 ESBLs. On the other hand, wide virulome was associated with a highly virulent behaviour in the Galleria mellonella infection model. Worryingly, all these lineages have been previously reported in humans, supporting that wide resistome and virulome could be contributing to rapid adaptation and dissemination of these clones at the human-animal-environment interface. In summary, wild owls can constitute environmental reservoirs of international clones of ESBL (CTX-M)-producing E. coli and S. Infantis carrying a wide resistome and virulome, in the Southern Cone of America, with potential risks to human, animal and environmental health. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Since 2002, our research muse has been owl monkey (Aotus), a native to Neo-tropical region. Due to their evolutionary choice of nocturnal life, owl monkeys do possess many secrets which diurnal living species like humans still cannot fathom. As of now, nothing is known about the circadian variation of melatonin in owl monkeys. Simply stated, two established facts are, (1) melatonin promotes sleep in diurnal primates including humans. (2) Melatonin levels in the cerebrospinal fluid, serum and plasma of diurnal primates like rhesus monkey, chacma baboon, common marmoset and humans peak during night hours. If this is so, how owl monkeys maintain their night alertness and daytime sleep routine and what role melatonin plays in the circadian zeitgebers of owl monkeys still remains a puzzle to be solved. © 2019 Reviews in Agricultural Science.

ABSTRACT: Slow ecological processes challenge conservation. Short-term variability can obscure the importance of slower processes that may ultimately determine the state of a system. Furthermore, management actions with slow responses can be hard to justify. One response to slow processes is to explicitly concentrate analysis on state dynamics. Here, we focus on identifying drivers of Northern Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) territorial occupancy dynamics across 11 study areas spanning their geographic range and forecasting response to potential management actions. Competition with Barred Owls (Strix varia) has increased Spotted Owl territory extinction probabilities across all study areas and driven recent declines in Spotted Owl populations. Without management intervention, the Northern Spotted Owl subspecies will be extirpated from parts of its current range within decades. In the short term, Barred Owl removal can be effective. Over longer time spans, however, maintaining or improving habitat conditions can help promote the persistence of northern spotted owl populations. In most study areas, habitat effects on expected Northern Spotted Owl territorial occupancy are actually greater than the effects of competition from Barred Owls. This study suggests how intensive management actions (removal of a competitor) with rapid results can complement a slower management action (i.e., promoting forest succession). © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America

ABSTRACT: Owls are well adapted to nocturnal hunting. This includes vision tuned to low level light conditions, silent flight, and asymmetrical ears. Asymmetrical ears facilitate sound localization and evolved up to seven times independently in the evolutionary history of owls. However, there are also owl species with a crepuscular or diurnal lifestyle, like the little owl (Athene noctua), that have symmetrical ears as adults. Here we show that a small, but significant ear asymmetry occurs in the embryonic development of little owls, despite the presence of symmetrical ears in adults. In the asymmetric period, the left ear opening is bigger in area than its counterpart on the right. The asymmetry in the little owl occurs in the same stages at which the asymmetry in the barn owl (Tyto furcata) develops, but in the little owl the asymmetry vanishes shortly before hatching. Asymmetries in the size of the ear openings are also found in the adults of other owl species, most of them belonging to the genus Strix. We interpret our finding as an indication of a secondarily evolved diurnal activity in little owls. Further, ear asymmetry might be more deeply rooted in the evolution of owls than previously assumed. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH

ABSTRACT: Understanding resource utilization and economic diversification amongst Holocene hunter-gatherers in southern Brazil requires in-depth taphonomic analysis of faunal assemblages. Three Early to Late Holocene archaeological sites (Garivaldino, Pilger and Sangão) in Rio Grande do Sul State, southern Brazil, revealed large assemblages of small mammal (˂1 kg) remains, composed mainly of rodents. To appreciate depositional processes of fauna in relation to human consumption, taphonomic attributes and processes were evaluated. The results indicated that the remains accumulated through different antemortem taphonomic pathways, apparently linked to the size and natural history of the species represented. The small- and medium-sized (<150 g) cricetid rodents (e.g. Pseudoryzomys simplex and Sooretamys angouya) were represented by a low proportion of teeth with lightly digestive corrosion suggesting that they were derived from the predatory activity of owls, possibly Tyto alba. In contrast, large-sized cricetids (>150 g; Kunsia tomentosus, Gyldenstolpia sp. and Holochilus sp.), and several caviomorph rodents with aggregated spatial distributions (Echimyidae (†Dicolpomys fossor, Phyllomys sp., †Clyomys riograndensis and †Euryzygomatomys mordax), Caviidae (Cavia sp.) and Ctenomyidae (Ctenomys sp.)) showed evidence of thermoalteration patterns and cut marks on bones, suggesting human exploitation. A postmortem depositional environment was deduced from dendritic and branched patterns of rootlet etching, apparent mostly at Garivaldino and Pilger. Polished areas and holes on bone surfaces, and impregnation of manganese showed moderate (Sangão) or low (Garivaldino and Pilger) incidence, pointing to water transport under moderate (Pilger) and low (Garivaldino and Sangão) energy over short distances. The results obtained here provide the first clear evidence of early human exploitation of small mammals in southern Brazil, suggesting a diversification of economies. In addition, as several of the recorded rodents are today regionally or biologically extinct, a preliminary discussion about the potential impact of humans on this process is provided. © 2019 Collegium Boreas.

ABSTRACT: This study aims to improve the implementation of models of geospatial information in Web Ontology Language (OWL). Large amounts of geospatial information are maintained in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) based on models according to the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and standards from ISO/TC 211 and the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). Sharing models and geospatial information in the Semantic Web will increase the usability and value of models and information, as well as enable linking with spatial and non-spatial information from other domains. Methods for conversion from UML to OWL for basic concepts used in models of geospatial information have been studied and evaluated. Primary conversion challenges have been identified with specific attention to whether adapted rules for UML modelling could contribute to improved conversions. Results indicated that restrictions related to abstract classes, unions, compositions and code lists in UML are challenging in the Open World Assumption (OWA) on which OWL is based. Two conversion challenges are addressed by adding more semantics to UML models: global properties and reuse of external concepts. The proposed solution is formalized in a UML profile supported by rules and recommendations and demonstrated with a UML model based on the Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) standard ISO 14825 Geographic Data Files (GDF). The scope of the resulting ontology will determine to what degree the restrictions shall be maintained in OWL, and different conversion methods are needed for different scopes. © 2019 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The Snowy Owl (Bubo scandiacus) is a rare resident species in Iceland and nests have been found intermittently. Nests are unusual because lemmings (Dicrostonyx spp. and Lemmus spp.), the primary prey of the Snowy Owl across much of its distribution, do not occur in Iceland. We studied summer diets by analyzing pellets from three areas in Iceland where owls were detected; breeding was confirmed at two of these sites. We identified 257 prey items (total mass of 73.6 kg) of at least 13 species. Birds made up most of the diet (96.5% by number). The Rock Ptarmigan (Lagopus muta) was the primary prey species (30.4%). Shorebirds were important prey (46.2%), and passerines (5.1%), as well as waterfowl (6.3%), were also taken. Wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus; 2.7%) and Arctic fox pups (Vulpes lagopus; 0.8%) were taken occasionally. Adult prey birds made upd 60.3% and nestlings 36.3% of the diet by number. © 2019 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) is developing a new wave observation system named Ocean Wave Linux (OWL). OWL will replace the NDBC's older and now obsolete Digital Directional Wave Module (DDWM). The OWL uses the existing DDWM processing algorithm but is implemented with Linux-based modern processing hardware and a high performance motion sensor. These improvements avoid parts obsolescence and lower power demand. The OWL consists of a nine axis motion sensor, a Linux processing board, and a custom NDBC circuit board that provides control and data collection. The NDBC performed extensive tests to verify proper code operation, motion sensing, and operation of the electronics. Tests included using the NDBC's Desktop Wave Simulator (DTWS) and the Ocean Wave Instrumentation Facility (OWIF) to simulate wind and swell ocean waves, respectively. Other laboratory tests were conducted to confirm proper operation at extreme cold and heat (e.g. twenty degrees below Celsius and fifty degrees above Celsius) and to measure power consumption. The OWL achieves a sixty-five percent reduction in power consumption as compared to DDWM. Test systems that incorporate both the older DDWM and OWL systems in one enclosure have been fabricated, bench tested, and one deployed for field evaluations at the NDBC 46022 station. The OWL's wave height and period compared well with the collocated DDWM and a Waverider located approximately twenty-five kilometers away. Further collocated tests between the DDWM and OWL and a Datawell Waverider are planned for other West Coast and East Coast locations. © 2019 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Owls are nocturnal raptors that are prevalently infected with haemosporidian parasites wordwide. These birds were commonly submitted to the Kasetsart University Raptor Rehabilitation Unit, Kasetsart University, Thailand and were examined using PCR-based methods for the presence of haemosporidian infections of by the genera Plasmodium and Haemoproteus. Blood samples from 167 individual owls belonging to 12 species common in Thailand were collected between September 2012 and February 2018. The overall prevalence of haemosporidians was 34.1%, with Haemoproteus infections (25.1%) being more prevalent than Plasmodium infections (9.0%). The prevalence of both Haemoproteus and Plasmodium parasites was similar in all seasons of the year. Molecular characterization revealed 17 new haemosporidian parasite lineages (11 Haemoproteus and six Plasmodium), with genetic variation among partial cytochrome b sequences ranging from 0.0% to 3.6% in Haemoproteus lineages and 0.2%–8.8% in Plasmodium lineages. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all Haemoproteus lineages detected in owls appeared in one well-supported clade together with other parasites belonging to the Parahaemoproteus subgenus, indicating their close evolutionary relationship and common transmission modality by Culicoides biting midges. This study showes the existence of prominent non-described haemosporidian parasite diversity in Thai owls and provides baseline molecular information for further research on the genetic diversity of owl haemosporidian parasites. New DNA sequence information can be used for the diagnosis of owl infections, which have been often reported during rehabilitation planning. © 2019

ABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to describe how the diet of tawny owl changed along an urbanisation gradient. The research was conducted from 2003 to 2011 in central Poland. Pellets were collected in the following zones: the center of Warsaw, capital city of Poland (inhabited by approximately 2 million people), its outskirts and rural areas beyond the city. To investigate the differences in the percentages of the main groups of prey between the three zones, a redundancy analysis (RDA) method was implemented using CANOCO software. Sparrows, rats, pine voles and striped field mice were most connected to the city center, whereas voles (all species pooled together), northern birch mice, hazel dormice and insects were more commonly found among prey items collected in rural areas. As the outskirts were transitional areas where different habitats typical for both rural areas (such as forest complexes) and urban areas (such as parks or built-up areas) were present, no prey group was strongly connected to this landscape. Mammals were dominant in the diet in winter in all habitat types. Their share ranged from 52% (in the city center) to approximately 90% in the outskirts and rural areas. Birds, amphibians, reptiles and insects were more frequent in summer. Overall, the study confirmed high plasticity of the species as an opportunistic predator and its ability to adapt to long-term changes in its main prey in most urbanized areas. © 2018, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Western dry conifer forests continue to experience increased severe, stand-replacing wildfire that is outside of historical precedent. Fuels treatments, landscape-scale modifications of forest fuels and structure, are likely to remain a management tool to modify fire behavior and restore ecological resilience. The impacts of fuels treatments to listed species such as spotted owls (Strix occidentalis) remain uncertain and are contested because of limited available information. To evaluate spotted owl foraging habitat selection in a landscape recently modified by forest fuels-reduction treatments, we radio-marked and tracked 10 California spotted owls (S. o. occidentalis) for 2 years immediately following fuels treatment installation in the northern Sierra Nevada, California, USA. We categorized fuels treatments into 3 types: mechanical thin, installed within the study area as landscape-scale fire breaks characterized by even tree spacing, open understory, and low canopy cover, or group selections; understory thin, a hand-removal of small trees and shrubs; and understory thin followed by underburn, a controlled surface-fuel burn that left the overstory intact. We described post-treatment habitat using forest structural metrics derived from a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) dataset that was collected 1 year after fuels treatments were completed. We collected 436 spotted owl foraging locations during 2 breeding seasons and evaluated breeding season home range size and composition using a resource selection function. We assessed possible contributors to owl foraging patterns by comparing a priori hypotheses in an information-theoretic approach and using randomly generated points that estimated available habitat. Spotted owl breeding season home ranges contained fuels treatments in proportion to their availability on the landscape and averaged 17.1% treated area. Within the home range, owl foraging locations in the post-treatment landscape were best predicted by lower proportions of gaps than anticipated at random, steeper slopes, and minimized distance from the owl's site center. Our results suggest that moderate to high proportions of gaps, typically a feature of forest fuels reduction and restoration treatments, may reduce the probability of spotted owl foraging. © 2018 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2018

ABSTRACT: Centromeres play crucial roles in faithful chromosome segregation and genome integrity. In simian primates, centromeres possess tandem array of alpha satellite DNA (also referred to as alphoid DNA). Average sizes of alpha satellite repeat units vary between species, for example, 171 bp in human and 343–344 bp in many platyrrhini species (New World monkeys). Interestingly, Azara's owl monkey (Aotus azarae), a platyrrhini species, possesses alpha satellite DNA of two distinct unit sizes, OwlAlp1 (185 bp) and OwlAlp2 (344 bp), both of which present as megasatellite DNAs in the genome. It is, however, unknown which repeat sequence is responsible for functional centromere formation. To investigate the localization of centromeres in vivo, we carried out chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay using Azara's owl monkey cells. We found that CENP-A, a histone H3 variant essential for centromere formation, was enriched at OwlAlp1, but not at OwlAlp2. Moreover, CENP-A was detected only at constricted regions of chromosomes by immunofluorescent microscopy. In contrast, trimethylation of histone H3-K9 (H3K9me3), a marker of heterochromatin, was enriched at both OwlAlp1 and OwlAlp2. Our results show that the shorter alpha satellite repeat, OwlAlp1, is selectively used for centromere formation in this monkey. © 2019 Molecular Biology Society of Japan and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd

ABSTRACT: A large number of young birds are caught each year shortly after having left the nest and subsequently brought to bird care centres. These birds are temporarily hand-raised before release. To date, the effectiveness of this action has remained largely unassessed. Here we monitored the fate of 119 rehabilitated Little Owls (Athene noctua) and found that the recruitment rate of the rehabilitated birds was similar to that of wild birds (11.8% of 119 rehabilitated birds vs. 10.7% of 382 wild fledglings). The timing of release, i.e. whether rehabilitated birds were released in the autumn or in the following spring, did not appear to affect recruitment probabilities, although birds released the following spring showed a tendency for reduced breeding success and dispersal compared to wild birds, suggesting that autumn releases may be more favourable. © 2019, Deutsche Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.

ABSTRACT: The global wildlife trade poses an increasing threat to the world's biota. One-fifth of the global wildlife trade is fuelled by the demand for animals used as pets and entertainment purposes. The CITES Trade Database contains data on the declared trade of CITESlisted species from 1975 onwards. Previous research has focussed on the commercial trade of heavily persecuted species such as the Saker Falcon Falco cherrug. However there has yet to be an extensive review quantifying CITES trade data for live raptors and owls destined for global commercial markets. This study analyses trends in CITES trade data between 1975 and 2015 for live raptors and owls, highlighting key importer and exporter countries and discusses implications for raptor and owl conservation. Our results showed that the number of traded raptor and owl species has increased since 1975. We found that the most traded raptor species included hybrids in the genus Falco, the Gyrfalcon F. rusticolus and the Saker Falcon. In addition, our analyses revealed that the Eurasian Scops Owl Otus scops, Northern White-Faced Owl Ptilopsis leucotis and the Little Owl Athene noctua were the most commonly traded owl species. Our results suggested that Japan was the largest global importer of raptors and owls contributing to 94% of wild-caught owl imports since 1975, followed by the United Arab Emirates who imported the largest number of captive-bred raptors. Key exporter and re-exporter countries were the United Kingdom, Guinea and Germany. We conclude that the declared, legal commercial trade in live raptors and owls does not currently pose a large conservation concern to many such species. However, at present, there is a lack of quantified evidence highlighting the global extent and impact of the unregulated illegal raptor and owl trade, which is of conservation concern and is a current research gap that must be addressed.  © 2019 CISO.

ABSTRACT: Biodiversity conservation in mixed-ownership landscapes often depends on contributions from privately-owned lands, where natural resource development can alter and produce novel habitat conditions for species of conservation concern. A lack of research on private lands stemming from access issues and concerns over regulatory outcomes, however, often limits evaluation of the impact of land management. The California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis), for example, often occurs in mixed-ownership landscapes but research on this species has occurred primarily on public lands. Therefore, we conducted the first large-scale private-public cooperative and comparative analyses of California spotted owls inhabiting mixed-ownership landscapes in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA. We surveyed 151 spotted owl sites from 2013 to 2017 within two study systems: one comprised primarily of public lands (national forests) where the owl population has declined over the last ∼20 years and a set of study areas comprised mostly of private lands on which relatively high estimates of site occupancy were recently reported. Multistate occupancy modeling indicated that the probability of occupancy and successful reproduction by owls depended on site status in the previous year, with both probabilities highest at sites where owls successfully reproduced in the previous year, intermediate at occupied sites where owls had not successfully reproduced, and lowest at previously unoccupied sites. Site occupancy probability was higher at low-elevation sites and lower at sites that contained more open area and younger forest. Successful reproduction by owls was also more likely at low-elevation sites and at sites with more north-facing slope and younger forest with high basal area of hardwoods. Study areas with more private lands tended to occur at lower elevations and have greater amounts of younger forest with high basal area of hardwoods, which may have contributed to higher occupancy and reproductive probabilities than the study area with more public land. Thus, differences in occupancy and reproductive probabilities between study areas appeared to be the result of differences in topographic and vegetation conditions that likely promote populations of key spotted owl prey species. Our results suggest that private lands in mixed-ownership landscapes may contribute to spotted owl conservation by conferring different benefits to owls than public lands and, more broadly, highlight the importance of including private lands in conservation research and planning. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The extent to which wildfire adversely affects spotted owls (Strix occidentalis) is a key consideration for ecosystem restoration efforts in seasonally dry forests of the western United States. Recently, Jones et al. (2016) demonstrated that the 2014 King Fire (a “megafire”) adversely affected a population of individually-marked California spotted owls (S. o. occidentalis) monitored as part of a long-term demographic study in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA because territory occupancy declined substantially at territories burned at high-severity and GPS-tagged spotted owls avoided large patches of high-severity fire. Hanson et al. (2018) attempted to reassess changes in territory occupancy of the Jones et al. (2016) study population and claimed that occupancy declined as a result of post-fire salvage logging not fire per se and suggested that the avoidance of GPS-marked owls from areas that burned at high-severity was due to post-fire logging rather than a response to high-severity fire. Here, we demonstrate that Hanson et al. (2018) used erroneous data, inadequate statistical analyses and faulty inferences to reach their conclusion that the King Fire did not affect spotted owls and, more broadly, that large, high-severity fires do not pose risks to spotted owls in western North American dry forest ecosystems. We also provide further evidence indicating that the King Fire exerted a clear and significant negative effect on our marked study population of spotted owls. Collectively, the additional evidence presented here and in Jones et al. (2016) suggests that large, high-severity fires can pose a threat to spotted owls and that restoration of natural low- to mixed-severity frequent fire regimes would likely benefit both old-forest species and dry forest ecosystems in this era of climate change. Meeting these dual objectives of species conservation and forest restoration will be complex but it is made more challenging by faulty science that does not acknowledge the full range of wildfire effects on spotted owls.

ABSTRACT: Scientific study of raptors often requires the use of a lure to capture individuals for marking or collecting various data and samples. Live lure owls in the genus Bubo are commonly used with mist nets or dho-gazas to trap nesting raptors, but the use of these live lures presents ethical, logistical, and financial challenges. Although owls mounted by taxidermists and mechanical owls have been used in place of a live bird, the success of these types of lures varies widely. We created a more realistic mechanical owl with a greater range of motion than previous models, and then tested the owl on six raptor species in a variety of habitats. For all but one species, capture rates using our mechanical owl were similar to or slightly higher than those reported in studies using live lure owls or previously designed mechanical owls. Time to capture of Northern Goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) was, on average, 8 min faster when using our mechanical owl compared to a live owl. Cost analysis revealed that both the initial expense and long-term maintenance of a mechanical owl were less than that of a live lure owl. Mechanical owls can be a useful tool for capturing raptors. Although there are some drawbacks to using a mechanical owl, our results suggest that mechanical birds are comparable to live lure owls and we believe the benefits of using a mechanical owl often outweigh the costs. © 2019 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The Eurasian Scops Owl Otus scops is a migratory owl whose population is declining throughout a large part of its breeding range, due to intensification of farming practices and land-use changes. For this reason, it is considered Europe’s most threatened owl species. Scops Owl is one of several raptor species that are difficult to sex, due to limited morphological differences between the sexes. A reliable method of sexing Scops Owls through biometric measurements would facilitate the study of their sex-related survival, movements and behaviour characteristics, improving their conservation management. In the current study, we developed a cost-effective and accurate method of sexing Scops Owls, based on discriminant analysis of morphometrics. A sample of 105 birds were captured, sexed using genetic methods and had biometric measures taken. A generalised linear model was built to evaluate the biometric measures that are statistically linked to sex. The best model selected three variables: wing length, tail length and weight. The results of the model were used to derive model scores, and the probability of male and female to be correctly identified was predicted. The discriminant function provides an accurate method of sexing Scops Owls in the hand. © 2020, © 2020 British Trust for Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: The Tropical Screech-Owl (Megascops choliba) is a nocturnal raptor with a wide distribution across the Neotropics, which uses cavity trees as nesting and roosting sites. Our objectives were to address cavity use by the Tropical Screech-Owl in the piedmont forest of Argentina and to evaluate if logging affects the availability of suitable cavities for nesting and roosting and the frequency of response of the species to playback. The Tropical Screech-Owl used trees with DBH values > 46 cm of three tree species (69% Calycophyllum multiflorum, 15% Phyllostylon rhamnoides, and 8% Cedrela angustifolia), besides standing dead trees (8%). The density of suitable cavities was significantly lower in logged forests than in the control site. The frequency of response of the species to playback was significantly lower at one logged site. Our results can contribute to delineate sustainable forest management to ensure the conservation of this owl in logged forest. © Alejandro A. Schaaf et al.

ABSTRACT: The American Barn Owl (Tyto furcata) is a bird of prey that predominantly feeds on small mammals by swallowing them whole; the undigested parts are regurgitated in pellets. This study aimed to characterize the diet of the American Barn Owl in a lowland Atlantic Forest remnant in southeastern Brazil by analyzing the material contained in pellets. Prey items were quantified by counting the number of skulls or paired bones in each pellet, and the ages of the mammals (rodents) found as prey were classified based on the pattern of wear of the occlusal surface of the molars. For invertebrates, we counted the number of heads or hind legs. We analyzed 48 pellets and each one contained 1-7 depredated individuals (mean= 4.0). Two major groups of food items were identified (192 specimens in total): mammals (Mus musculus [n=179 specimens, or 93.2% of prey items; FO = 100%], Rattus rattus [n = 2, or 1.0%; FO= 4.2%], and Carollia sp. [n = 1, or 0.5%; FO= 2.1%]) and insects (n=8 samples; FO=16.7%: Orthoptera [n=6 specimens, or 3.1%; FO=12.5%], Lepidoptera [n=2, or 1.0%; FO=4.2%], and Hymenoptera [n=2, or 1.0%, FO=4.2%]). For the exotic rodent M. musculus, 142 right mandibular branches were identified, of which 8.5% were classified as Pup (n = 12 individuals), 57.0% as Adult I (n = 81), 19.0% as Adult II (n = 27), and 15.5% as Senior (n = 22). The results corroborate similarities in the diet and feeding behavior of T. furcata throughout its distribution in the Americas and with T. alba. Tyto furcata, although generally a rodent specialist, has an opportunistic foraging strategy and may respond to prey availability, possibly acting as a natural biological control agent of agricultural pests such as exotic rodents. Further studies are recommended to assess whether seasonality influences the frequency at which nonnative prey are consumed by T. furcata. © 2019 Wilson Ornithological Society. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: We studied Northern Hawk Owls in Montana from 1994 through 2015. We report 36 breeding records, 18 of which included a known nest location. Owls reused one nest in subsequent years, but this nest was included only once in our analysis of nest-site characteristics. All nests were in moderate to severely burned forests from 1-11 yr post-burn. Nests were found in black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa; n = 6), quaking aspen (P. tremuloides; n = 6), Engelmann's spruce (Picea engelmannii; n = 3), and western larch (Larix occidentalis; n = 2). Average nest tree height was 19.6 ± 3.4 m (95% CI, n = 17), average nest height was 14.1 ± 1.6 m (95% CI, n = 17), and average diameter at breast height was 43 ± 4 cm (95% CI, n = 17). Average measurements of nest tree height and nest height were larger than those reported from elsewhere in North America. Diet, based on 274 prey identified from pellets, was 88% voles, most frequently Microtus pennsylvanicus (51%, n = 140). Only 1 of 72 banded owls was recaptured or recovered over the course of this 22-yr study, suggesting a non-sedentary or nomadic population with low site fidelity. The lone recapture represents the first report of a philopatric Northern Hawk Owl in North America. Although this owl is still considered a rare breeder in the conterminous United States, we documented breeding records in 11 of the last 12 yr of this study. All but four known breeding records in Montana occurred within Glacier National Park. © 2019 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Exposure of nontarget wildlife to anticoagulant rodenticides (AR) is a global conservation concern typically centered around urban or agricultural areas. Recently, however, the illegal use of ARs in remote forests of California, USA, has exposed sensitive predators, including the federally threatened northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina). We used congeneric barred owls (S. varia) as a sentinel species to investigate whether ARs pose a threat to spotted owls and other old-forest wildlife in northern regions of the Pacific Northwest. We analyzed the liver tissue from 40 barred owls collected in Oregon and Washington and confirmed exposure to ≥1 AR compounds in 48% of the owls examined. Brodifacoum, an extremely toxic second-generation AR, was the most common compound detected (89% of positive cases), followed by bromadiolone (11%), difethialone (11%), and warfarin (5%). Brodifacoum was also detected in one barred owl and one spotted owl opportunistically found dead (liver concentrations were 0.091 and 0.049 μg/g, respectively). We found no evidence that exposure varied with proximity to developed and agricultural areas, or among different study areas, age-classes, and sexes. Rather, exposure was ubiquitous, and the rates we observed in our study (38–64%) were similar to or greater than that reported previously for barred owls in California (40%). Together these studies indicate widespread contamination in forested landscapes used by spotted owls and other wildlife of conservation concern. Owls collected in older forests may have been exposed via illegal use of ARs, highlighting a mounting challenge for land managers and policy makers. © 2019

ABSTRACT:                              Avian uropygial glands have received increasing attention in recent years, but little is known about micro-organisms in uropygial glands. In this study, we isolated a strain of Gram-stain-positive, non-motile, non-spore-forming cocci, designated 442                             T                             , from the uropygial gland of an American barn owl (Tyto furcata) and characterized it using a polyphasic approach. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis placed the isolate in the genus Kocuria. The G+C content was 70.8 mol%, the major menaquinone was MK-7(H2) and the predominant cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C                             15: 0                             , anteiso-C                             17: 0                              and iso-C                             15: 0                             . Phylogenetic analyses based on the 16S rRNA gene identified Kocuria rhizophila DSM 11926                             T                              (99.6% similarity), Kocuria salsicia DSM 24776                             T                              (98.7 %), Kocuria varians DSM 20033                             T                              (98.3 %) and Kocuria marina DSM 16420T (98.3 %) as the most closely related species. However, average nucleotide identity values below 86% indicated that the isolate differed from all species hitherto described. Chemotaxonomic analyses and whole-cell protein profiles corroborated these findings. Accordingly, the isolate is considered to be a member of a novel species, for which the name Kocuria tytonis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 442                             T                              (=DSM 104130                             T                             =LMG 29944                             T                             ).                          © 2019 IUMS.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: This paper considers mass materials related to the feeding of the eagle owl from three latitudinal regions of the Urals (northern and southern taiga and steppe). All collections were carried out in the same type of location of bone remains of prey from pellets at the nesting grounds of eagle owls in niches and caves at cliffs along riverbanks. The prey of the eagle owl is divided into three categories: main, alternative, and concomitant. The paper shows the degree of correspondence of the proportions of individuals of different species and their groups in the diet of the eagle owl and the population of rodents in the environs of nesting areas. The importance of separate consideration of the main and other prey of the eagle owl in reconstruction of the composition of the fauna and structure of the rodent population based on subfossil ornithogenic materials is emphasized. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Throughout western North America, longer, hotter fire seasons and dense fuels are yielding more frequent, larger, and higher-severity wildfires, including uncharacteristically large "megafires." Wildlife species associated with late-seral forest characteristics may be particularly vulnerable to habitat loss stemming from changing fire regimes. The Great Gray Owl (Strix nebulosa) is a state-listed endangered species in California that typically nests in large snags in well-shaded forests adjacent to montane meadows. The 2013 Rim Fire burned 104,000 ha in Yosemite National Park and Stanislaus National Forest, making it the largest recorded fire in California's Sierra Nevada. The fire perimeter contained 23 meadows known to be occupied by Great Gray Owls during the decade prior to the fire, representing nearly a quarter of all known or suspected territories in California at the time. We analyzed 13 yr (2004-2016) of Great Gray Owl detection/non-detection data from 144 meadows in the central Sierra Nevada, including meadows inside and outside the Rim Fire perimeter in Yosemite National Park and on Stanislaus National Forest. During 3 yr of surveys after the fire, Great Gray Owls were detected at 21 of 22 meadows surveyed within the fire perimeter that were occupied during the decade prior to the fire. Bayesian hierarchical modeling revealed that, rather than decreasing after the fire, persistence of owls at meadows actually increased on both National Park Service (NPS) and non-NPS lands, while colonization rates exhibited no significant change. Within the burned area, these dynamics were unrelated to forest structure variables describing post-fire stands around individual meadows. Notably, post-fire increases in owl persistence occurred both inside and outside the fire perimeter, suggesting factors other than the fire were likely favorable to Great Gray Owls during the post-fire years. Great Gray Owls appear to have been largely resilient to effects of the Rim Fire during the 3 yr after it burned. Copyright © American Ornithological Society 2019. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The mechanisms associated with the ability of owls to fly silently have been the subject of scientific interest for many decades and may be relevant to bioinspired design to reduce noise of flapping and nonflapping flying devices. Here, we characterize the near wake dynamics and the associated flow structures produced during flight of the Australian boobook owl (Ninox boobook). Three individual owls were flown at 8 ms-1 in a climatic avian wind tunnel. The velocity field in the wake was sampled at 500 Hz using long-duration high-speed particle image velocimetry (PIV) while the wing kinematics were imaged simultaneously using high speed video. The time series of velocity maps that were acquired over several consecutive wingbeat cycles enabled us to characterize the wake patterns and to associate them with the phases of the wingbeat cycle. We found that the owl wake was dramatically different from other birds measured under the same flow conditions (i.e., western sandpiper, Calidris mauri and European starling, Sturnus vulgaris). The near wake of the owl did not exhibit any apparent shedding of organized vortices. Instead, a more chaotic wake pattern was observed, in which the characteristic scales of vorticity (associated with turbulence) are substantially smaller in comparison to other birds. Estimating the pressure field developed in the wake shows that owls reduce the pressure Hessian (i.e., the pressure distribution) to approximately zero. We hypothesize that owls manipulate the near wake to suppress the aeroacoustic signal by controlling the size of vortices generated in the wake, which are associated with noise reduction through suppression of the pressure field. Understanding how specialized feather structures, wing morphology, or flight kinematics of owls contribute to this effect remains a challenge for additional study. © The Author(s) 2019.

ABSTRACT:                              Objective: To determine endothelial cell density (ECD) and morphology and morphometry of corneal endothelial cells in the tawny owl (Strix aluco), as well as to report the effects of aging on these parameters. Animal study and procedures: Twenty tawny owls were included in the study and classified into 2 groups according to their age: fledglings (<1 year old) and adults (>1 year old). Central corneal endothelium was studied by means of noncontact specular microscopy (Specular Microscope SP-2000P; Topcon, Tokyo, Japan), and results for ECD (cells/mm                             2                             ), mean cell area ((MCA (μm                             2                             )), polymegathism (CV), and pleomorphism (% hexagonal cells) were obtained. Results are described by median, interquartile range (25th, 75th percentiles), and absolute range for ECD, MCA, pleomorphism, and polymegathism. In addition, inferential analyses by Mann-Whitney U test were also performed. A two-tailed Type I error of 5% was established. Results: Results in fledglings were as follows: ECD = 2864 cells/mm                             2                             , MCA = 348 μm                             2                             , % hexagonal cells = 72.75%, and CV = 21. Results in adults were as follows: ECD = 2602 cells/mm                             2                             , MCA = 384 μm                             2                             , % hexagonal cells = 78.83%, and CV = 16. No significant differences in ECD and MCA were seen between the groups (P >.05), although there were significant differences in % hexagonal cells and CV (P <.05). Conclusions: Tawny owls present a uniform endothelium in cell size and shape, although ECD and MCA differ greatly from other bird species. Differences in ECD and MCA could not be found between fledglings and adults probably because of the youth of adult specimens, although there were differences in pleomorphism and polymegathism.                          © 2018 American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists

ABSTRACT: Case studies have a long tradition in biomedical research. Here, I will analyze an important person from a chronobiological aspect, Santa Claus. Although it might be dangerous for researchers to publish analyses about Santa Claus, because, given the possibility that he may be unsatisfied with my analysis, this could lead to an embargo of parcels for my whole family. Nevertheless, some intrepid researches already diagnosed Santa Claus, ending up in some important research results. A search in Web of Science revealed only N = 224 publications about Santa Claus, which is really low. The question, I am addressing here is, whether Santa Claus is an “evening owl” or a night chronotype. In this report, I summarize the facts known about Santa Claus on the one side and about evening chronotypes on the other and sum up these results in a “vote counting” manner as pros and cons. The results are summarized in Table 1. In total, there is 12 times support for the hypothesis, 2 times against and 1 equivocal (Table 1). This result is significant (binomial test, p = 0.013). Therefore, the conclusion is “Santa Claus is an evening type”. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

ABSTRACT: Multiple factors can give rise to population genetic structure. Therefore, the generating process of genetic structure should be examined from multiple aspects simultaneously. We describe the fine-scale genetic structure of the Ryukyu scops owl Otus elegans interpositus population on Minami-daito Island and test isolation-by-distance, isolation-by-adaptation and assortative mating as candidates for its underlying mechanisms. Spatial principal component analysis detected a spatial autocorrelation structure for males, but not for females. Discriminant analysis of principal components and STRUCTURE analysis allowed us to classify the owl population into six genetically distinct groups. These clustering results were associated with relatedness. In addition, to these descriptive analyses, analyses of mechanisms preferred isolation-by-distance to others. Therefore, we inferred that isolation by distance and kinship structure are the most important underlying processes leading to their genetic structure. © 2018 The Zoological Society of London

ABSTRACT: Barred owls (Strix varia) are forest-dwelling owls, native to eastern North America, with populations that expanded westward into the range of the spotted owl (Strix occidentalis). Barred owls exert an overwhelmingly negative influence on spotted owls, thereby threatening spotted owl population viability where the species co-occur. In this review, we provide an overview of the barred owl's range expansion and detail and synthesize previously published literature on spotted and barred owls within the range of the spotted owl as related to potential future outcomes for the northern spotted owl (S. o. caurina). We include research on diet, habitat use and selection, effects of barred owls on spotted owl demography and behavior, hybridization with spotted owls, parasites, contemporary management, and future research needs for spotted owl populations given continued barred owl expansion throughout western North America. Our literature review and synthesis should provide managers with the information necessary to develop strategies that mitigate deleterious effects of barred owls at local and landscape scales. © 2019 The Wildlife Society. © 2019 The Wildlife Society

ABSTRACT: Synaptic currents are frequently assumed to make a major contribution to the extracellular field potential (EFP). However, in any neuronal population, the explicit separation of synaptic sources from other contributions such as postsynaptic spikes remains a challenge. Here we take advantage of the simple organization of the barn owl nucleus laminaris (NL) in the auditory brain stem to isolate synaptic currents through the iontophoretic application of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepro-pionic acid (AMPA)-receptor antagonist 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6-nitro-2,3-dioxo-benzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide (NBQX). Responses to auditory stimulation show that the temporal dynamics of the evoked synaptic contributions to the EFP are consistent with synaptic short-term depression (STD). The estimated time constants of an STD model fitted to the data are similar to the fast time constants reported from in vitro experiments in the chick. Overall, the putative synaptic EFPs in the barn owl NL are significant but small (<1% change of the variance by NBQX). This result supports the hypothesis that the EFP in NL is generated mainly by axonal spikes, in contrast to most other neuronal systems. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Synaptic currents are assumed to make a major contribution to the extracellular field potential in the brain, but it is hard to directly isolate these synaptic components. Here we take advantage of the simple organization of the barn owl nucleus laminaris in the auditory brain stem to isolate synaptic currents through the iontophoretic application of a synaptic blocker. We show that the responses are consistent with a simple model of short-term synaptic depression. © 2019, American Physiological Society. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Patterns of lead and other trace metals were examined in 122 Eurasian eagle owls Bubo bubo found dead in Sweden in the period 1978–2013. Environmental lead (Pb) has decreased over recent decades from reduced anthropogenic emissions but mortality by Pb poisoning is still frequently reported for avian raptors and scavengers exposed to Pb ammunition. One objective here was to determine if Pb concentrations in a nocturnal non-scavenging raptor follow the general decline observed in other biota. Pb concentration in owl liver was significantly correlated with body weight, sex, latitude, longitude and season. Pb showed a significant decreasing trend towards north and west. Starved birds had significantly higher concentrations. Total Pb concentrations in liver averaged 0.179 μg g−1 dry weight (median 0.103) and decreased by 5.6% per year 1978–2013, or 5.3% after adjustment for confounding factors, similar to trends in other species. Among 14 other trace elements only antimony and arsenic showed decreasing trends. Lead isotope ratios 206Pb/207Pb and 208Pb/207Pb increased from 1.138 and 2.408 in 1978–1985 to 1.170 and 2.435 in 2010–2013, respectively, demonstrating that the decreasing Pb concentration in eagle owl is related to the phase-out of leaded gasoline in Europe, where Pb additives had much lower isotope ratios than natural lead in Swedish soils. Only one incidence of suspected Pb poisoning (40.7 μg g−1 in liver) was observed indicating that poisoning from ingestion of metallic lead is rare (< 1%) in eagle owl in Sweden, in contrast to what has been reported for eagles. © 2019, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The phylogenetic position of owl monkeys, grouped in the genus Aotus, has been a controversial issue for understanding Neotropical primate evolution. Explanations of the difficult phylogenetic assignment of owl monkeys have been elusive, frequently relying on insufficient data (stochastic error) or scenarios of rapid speciation (adaptive radiation) events. Using a coalescent-based approach, we explored the population-level mechanisms likely explaining these topological discrepancies. We examined the topological variance of 2,192 orthologous genes shared between representatives of the three major Cebidae lineages and the outgroup. By employing a methodological framework that allows for reticulated tree topologies, our analysis explicitly tested for non-dichotomous evolutionary processes impacting the finding of the position of owl monkeys in the cebid phylogeny. Our findings indicated that Aotus is a sister lineage of the callitrichines. Most gene trees (>50%) failed to recover the species tree topology, although the distribution of gene trees mismatching the true species topology followed the standard expectation of the multispecies coalescent without reticulation. We showed that the large effective population size of the common ancestor of Aotus and callitrichines was the most likely factor responsible for generating phylogenetic uncertainty. On the other hand, fast speciation scenarios or introgression played minor roles. We propose that the difficult phylogenetic placement of Aotus is explained by population-level processes associated with the large ancestral effective size. These results shed light on the biogeography of the early cebid diversification in the Miocene, highlighting the relevance of evaluating phylogenetic relationships employing population-aware approaches. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: A captive, adult, male northern saw-whet owl (Aegolius acadicus) was examined for blepharospasm of the left eye. The owl was diagnosed with bilateral anterior uveitis and a corneal ulceration in the left eye. It was treated with oral and topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications and a topical antibiotic. Multiple recheck examinations and medication adjustments were performed over the next 4 months, at the end of which time the bilateral anterior uveitis was controlled with a topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory applied 3 times per week to both eyes. The owl was re-examined 2 months later after 2 suspected neurologic episodes. On physical examination, the owl was quiet and had difficulty standing and ambulating. Five firm multilobular and immobile masses were identified overlying the pectoral muscle and sternum. Fine-needle aspiration from 1 mass revealed neoplastic cells consistent with a sarcoma. The owl was euthanatized. On the basis of results of histopathologic examination, the mass was diagnosed as a pleomorphic spindle cell sarcoma with features of rhabdomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, and osteosarcoma. Numerous tumor cells were immunopositive for myoglobin and desmin, indicating striated muscle origin. Although a metastatic lesion was present in 1 adrenal gland, lesions of inflammation or neoplasia were absent in either eye on histopathologic examination. This report describes an apparent ocular manifestation of systemic disease in an avian species with clinically diagnosed recurrent anterior uveitis. © 2019 by the Association of Avian Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT:                              Although birds are hosts to a large number of microorganisms, microbes have rarely been found in avian oil glands. Here, we report on two strains of a new bacterial species from the preen oil of American barn owls (Tyto furcata). Phenotypic as well as genotypic methods placed the isolates to the genus Kocuria. Strains are non-fastidious, non-lipophilic Gram-positive cocci and can be unambiguously discriminated from their closest relative Kocuria rhizophila DSM 11926                             T                             . In phylogenetic trees, the owl bacteria formed a distinct cluster which was clearly separated from all other known Kocuria species. The same conclusion was drawn from MALDI-TOF MS analyses. Once again, the new bacterial strains were very similar to one another, but exhibited substantial differences when compared to the most closely related species. Besides, the results of the biochemical tests, optimum growth conditions and pigmentation differed from closely related Kocuria spp. Finally, ANIb values of less than 87% provided striking evidence that the isolates recovered from American barn owls represent a hitherto undescribed species, for which we propose the name Kocuria tytonicola sp. nov. The type strain is 489                             T                              (DSM 104133                             T                              = LMG 29945                             T                             , taxonumber TA00340).                          © 2018 Elsevier GmbH

ABSTRACT: Populations of Leach's Storm-Petrels (Oceanodroma leucorhoa) are in decline globally, but causes of these declines are unclear. One possibility is predation at breeding colonies. To estimate effects of one pair of Great Horned Owls (Bubo virginianus) on a Leach's Storm-Petrel colony, we analyzed owl pellets collected from Bon Portage Island, Nova Scotia, Canada, over 5 consecutive breeding seasons (2011-2015). Great Horned Owl diets were mainly Leach's Storm-Petrels by number (79%) and by mass (66%). Muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus), meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus), and masked shrews (Sorex cinereus) completed the diet. This is, to our knowledge, one of the most specialized diets reported for this species of owl. We estimate that this specialized diet reduced by at most 1% annually the population of Leach's Storm-Petrels on this island. © 2019 Wilson Ornithological Society. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Small mammals are key elements of terrestrial ecosystems, yet in south-eastern Europe many questions about their taxonomy and distribution remain unanswered. This is particularly true for the small mammal fauna of Greece. We investigated the distribution of small mammals in the district of Evros (NE Greece) through Tyto alba pellet analysis and live-trapping in 19 localities (29 samplings). We collected remains from a total 2434 individual vertebrates through pellet analyses and captured 110 small mammals through live trapping. We provide data on the distribution and community composition in the corresponding localities, for 17 small mammal species (11 rodents and 6 insectivores). Our findings include the first record of Myomimus roachi in Greece, a result facilitated by the yearly dynamics of Microtus sp. populations, as well as the first record of Sorex minutus in Evros. The Barn owl’s main prey (by percentage, allocated to genera) were Crocidura (29.7%) Mus (27%) Microtus (23.2%) and Apodemus (13%). © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: The federally threatened northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) has been intensively studied across its range, and habitat needs for the species have influenced forest management in northwestern North America for decades. Dense forest canopies are often reported in the scientific literature and agency management plans as an important habitat attribute for spotted owls, though the means of measuring forest canopy and interpreting species requirements vary across studies and more importantly, among management plans. We used light detection and ranging (lidar) measurements of canopy cover, canopy surface heterogeneity, and upper canopy surface connectivity, and an index of the presence of a competitive invasive species, the barred owl (S. varia), in multinomial discrete choice models using a Bayesian framework to evaluate selection of forest cover types by spotted owls in Oregon, USA, 2008–2015. We designated yearly activity centers based on the most biologically significant observation during the nesting season (Mar–Aug), generally centered on the nest tree. Spotted owls selected activity centers with more canopy cover and higher heterogeneity of the canopy surface within 100 m than was available within their territories. The average proportion of canopy cover within 100 m of a spotted owl activity center was 0.79 ± 0.12 (SD; range = 0.34–0.99). The presence of barred owls did not explain variability in selection of spotted owl activity centers, but barred owls might not affect third-order habitat selection within territories, or our index was too spatially coarse to detect these effects on spotted owl resource selection. We demonstrate that lidar provides researchers and managers with a tool that can accurately measure forest canopies over large areas, and assist in mapping spotted owl habitat. © 2019 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2019

ABSTRACT: The relative contribution of private and public forest to the conservation of species in mixed-ownership landscapes has often been contentious because management goals vary among owners. This tension can be exacerbated by a lack of understanding about how wildlife use habitats managed by different landowners and the relative value of habitats in having different structures, configurations, and management histories. To address this knowledge gap and enhance science-based conservation planning among different ownerships, we analyzed habitat selection by 53 GPS-tagged California spotted owls across multiple temporal scales within mixed-ownership landscapes in the Sierra Nevada. At a fine temporal scale, step-selection function analysis of hourly locations collected by GPS tags suggested that foraging spotted owls selected closed-canopy, larger-tree forest (Quadratic Mean Diameter [QMD] ≥ 33 cm, canopy cover ≥ 60%). Point selection function (PSF) analysis based on single nightly locations suggested that spotted owls selected a broader range of forest conditions including selection of forests having intermediate sized trees and intermediate canopy cover (QMD 28–33 cm, canopy cover ≥ 50%), and the strength of selection for these forest conditions increased in the less frequently used areas of home ranges. The PSF also suggested that spotted owls selected areas with relatively high cover type heterogeneity that included a mix of seral stages, except in the core of their home range where they selected relatively spatially homogenous forests characterized by large trees and closed canopy. Spotted owl home ranges increased in size with increasing elevation and cover type heterogeneity, and decreased in size with forest characterized by intermediate-sized trees. Collectively, these results indicate that landscapes having forest patches characterized by either intermediate or large-sized trees, both with high canopy cover, likely constitute the important foraging habitat for California spotted owls in Sierra Nevada mixed conifer forests. However, selection for any one particular cover type was not sufficiently strong for us to infer selection of individual landownership types, in spite of differences in forest conditions among ownerships. Collectively, our findings suggest that privately-owned lands used in our study may harbor more suitable spotted owl foraging habitat than previously recognized. Finally, given the importance of understanding the relationship between landowner management priorities and the resultant pattern of vegetation on lands with different ownerships, the development of forest management strategies relevant for broad-scale conservation of the Sierra Nevada forest will benefit from effective collaboration between forest managers, landowners, and research organizations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Protected lands like national parks are important refuges for threatened and endangered species as environmental pressures on wildlife and their habitats increase. The Northern Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis caurina), a species designated as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, occurs on public lands throughout the western United States including Mount Rainier National Park (MRNP), Washington. With virtually no history of timber harvest or large forest disturbance within MRNP boundaries since the park's creation in 1899, MRNP provides an ideal place to evaluate potential impacts of climate change and invasive Barred Owls (Strix varia) on the Northern Spotted Owl. We used a multi-state, multi-season occupancy model to investigate how Northern Spotted Owl occupancy dynamics and breeding propensity are related to the presence of Barred Owls, local and regional weather, and habitat characteristics at MRNP from 1997 to 2016. Historical occupancy of Northern Spotted Owl breeding territories in MRNP has declined by 50% in the last 20 yr, and territory occupancy by breeding Northern Spotted Owls also decreased, reaching a low of 25% in 2016. Occupancy rates were higher on territories with steeper terrain and breeding rates were lower when Barred Owls were detected within historical territories. Our results also indicated that breeding propensity was higher when early nesting season temperatures during March and April were higher. In addition, the ability to detect breeding Northern Spotted Owls decreased when Barred Owls were present in the territory. Habitat variables from LiDAR were not correlated with Northern Spotted Owl occupancy dynamics, likely reflecting the dominance of old-growth forest in this protected park. This study illustrates the strong relationship between Barred Owls and Northern Spotted Owl demographics and breeding site selection in a landscape where habitat loss by timber harvest and fire has not occurred. © 2019 Published by Oxford University Press for the American Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Motivated by the high turnover rate of the Eurasian eagle owl (Bubo bubo) population in the south of the province of Limburg, the Netherlands, which is linked to extremely high concentrations of PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) and DDE (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene) found in owl carcasses, a habitat suitability (HS) assessment for this region was conducted to identify possible sources of PCBs in the environment. Twelve environmental characteristics (ECs) that are known to influence the presence of the species were selected. With each EC, a suitability index (SI) was associated and a uninorm was used to aggregate these individual SIs into one overall HS index value. The HS assessment was validated using GPS tracking data of six adult eagle owls. Further, Ivlev’s electivity index and Manly’s habitat selection index were used to compare the area used with what is available in the landscape. To describe the former, we considered both the probability of occurrence and the home range of the tracked individuals. The resulting HS map shows that quarries and vegetation structures, such as hedgerows or solitary trees, are the main attractors for the species, though also forest edges, orchards, and tree and fruit nurseries attract the species in the study area. Hence, further field sampling campaigns to identify possible sources of poisoning should focus on parcels with these land covers. Such a prioritization of parcels becomes possible using our approach. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT:                              Non-random gene flow is a widely neglected force in evolution and ecology. This genotype-dependent dispersal is difficult to assess, yet can impact the genetic variation of natural populations and their fitness. In this work, we demonstrate a high immigration rate of barn owls (Tyto alba) inside a Swiss population surveyed during 15 years. Using ten microsatellite loci as an indirect method to characterize dispersal, two-third of the genetic tests failed to detect a female-biased dispersal, and Monte Carlo simulations confirmed a low statistical power to detect sex-biased dispersal in case of high dispersal rate of both sexes. The capture–recapture data revealed a female-biased dispersal associated with an excess of heterozygote for the melanocortin-1 receptor gene (MC1R), which is responsible for their ventral rufous coloration. Thus, female homozygotes for the MC1R                             WHITE                              allele might be negatively selected during dispersal. Despite the higher immigration of females that are heterozygote at MC1R, non-random gene flow should not lead to a migration load regarding this gene because we did not detect an effect of MC1R on survival and reproductive success in our local population. The present study highlights the usefulness of using multiple methods to correctly decrypt dispersal and gene flow. Moreover, despite theoretical expectations, we show that non-random dispersal of particular genotypes does not necessarily lead to migration load in recipient populations.                          © 2018, The Genetics Society.

ABSTRACT: Enticed by the migratory irruption of 2007, we established three banding stations in northeastern Alabama, USA, to determine the prevalence of Northern Saw-whet Owls (Aegolius acadicus) in the state and subsequently examine the broader extent of migration patterns and demographics at latitudes ≤35°N. We captured 202 Northern Saw-whet Owls between 2007 and 2016, with annual totals ranging from 3 in 2014 to 64 in 2012. The proportion of hatch-year owls captured was 38.1% overall, which was considerably lower than levels reported at more northern stations. Morphometric estimates and a sex-specific discriminant function analysis table indicated 63.9% of all Northern Saw-whet Owls captured were female and 11.9% were males, with the remaining 24.2% of undetermined sex. Peak migration occurred during mid-November. We locally recaptured 44 individuals and determined that recaptures were bimodally distributed, with most owls recaptured 1 wk after initial banding and a second peak 10-13 wk afterward. We estimated 50% of owls emigrated from stations within 3 wk of initial banding. We encountered seven owls initially banded at northern stations; one of these had flown 1518 km from Whitefish Point Bird Observatory, Michigan to Hollins, Alabama. Of these encounters, three were intra-seasonal and represented owls that had migrated at an average rate of 36.2 km/night. Four owls banded in Alabama were encountered during subsequent seasons in the northern United States. Although limited, these data suggest owls follow the Appalachian Mountains and western Great Lakes migration routes into Alabama. Our findings indicate Northern Saw-whet Owls regularly overwinter in northeastern Alabama, although abundances probably vary annually with migration dispersion cycles. We recommend additional Northern Saw-whet Owl banding stations be established across the southeastern United States to further study this secretive species within the southern periphery of its winter range. © 2019 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Background: The eyes of some birds of prey (Strigiformes and some eagles) are tubular in shape, which contrasts strongly with those in others, which are more globose (e.g., Galliformes) or flat (most diurnal birds). Regardless, all birds have an ocular skeleton composed of a ring of ossicles (annulus ossicularis sclerae) and a cartilage cup within the sclera. Results: We show that the tubular eye of the barn owl, Tyto furcata, grows substantially in length to achieve its long axial length several weeks after hatching, well after the period when the visual input adjusts the optical system and when the scleral ossicles mineralize. This is in contrast to the chicken. The conjunctival papillae are morphologically different in each species, however, they are present for about 3 days in both birds before they degenerate. Conclusions: Our data shows a heterochronic shift in the timing of scleral cartilage development and ossicle mineralization (but not induction) to later in development compared to in the chicken. These shifts likely relate to the altricial vs precocial nature of these birds and suggests that the scleral ossicles are likely functionally important bones for vision in owls and possibly other altricial species. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: New study systems and tools are needed to understand how divergence and speciation occur between lineages with gene flow. Migratory birds often exhibit divergence despite seasonal migration, which brings populations into contact with one another. We studied divergence between 2 subspecies of Northern Saw-whet Owl (Aegolius acadicus), in which a sedentary population on the islands of Haida Gwaii, British Columbia (A. a. brooksi), exists in the presence of the other form (A. a. acadicus) during migration but not during the breeding season. Prior research showed fixed mtDNA divergence but left open the question of nuclear gene flow. We used 2,517 ultraconserved element loci to examine the demographic history of this young taxon pair. Although we did not observe fixed single nucleotide polymorphism differences between populations among our genotyped individuals, 100% of the birds were diagnosable and aI analyses suggested the demographic model best fitting the data was one of split-bidirectional-migration (i.e. speciation with gene flow). We dated the split between brooksi and acadicus to ∼278 Kya, and our analyses suggested gene flow between groups was skewed, with ∼0.7 individuals per generation coming from acadicus into brooksi and ∼4.4 going the opposite direction. Coupled with an absence of evidence of phenotypic hybrids and the birds' natural history, these data suggest brooksi may be a young biological species arising despite historic gene flow. ©American Ornithological Society 2019.

ABSTRACT: Background: The use of distinct drugs and techniques for establishing balanced anesthesia protocols has shown promising results in birds. The techniques of locoregional block can be incorporated to these protocols, thereby providing intra- and post-operative analgesia and reducing the requirement for general anesthesia. Additionally, the use of neurostimulators increases the chances of success and reduces the risk of toxicity; however, there are limited reports in the literature of its applicability in wild birds. Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe the brachial plexus block technique guided using a neurolocalizer in a striped owl (Asio clamator) submitted for right wing amputation. Case: A striped owl weighing 400 g with a history of exposed fracture of the right wing was supplied by the clinical sector at the Veterinarian Hospital of the Federal University of Bahia. Following hydration and stabilization of vital signs, the animal was referred to the surgical center for amputation of the limb. Dexmedetomidine (10 µg.kg−1 IM) was administered as premedication, and after 20 min, anesthetic induction was performed using sevoflurane (FiO2 = 100%) via a mask followed by maintenance using the same drug. The animal was positioned in a left lateral decubitus position with access to the brachial plexus determined by palpation and identification of the border of the following muscles: pectoral, cranial branch of the brachial biceps, and dorsal branch of the ventral serratus. The brachial plexus nerves are situated in the subcutaneous site craniodorsal to the axillary depression. For the block, a neurolocalizer was used, fixing the positive electrode to approximately 5 cm from the needle insertion site (21G × 2'”) in the axillary depression, which remained connected to the neurostimulator by the second electrode. At first, the needle was attached to the peripheral nerve stimulator using a pulse frequency of 1 Hz with an impulse duration of 0.1 ms and initial current of 1 mA. The needle was advanced in the direction of the nerve plexus until it was observed that muscular contractions and movement in the limb were blocked, gradually decreasing the contractions, which disappeared at a current of 0.3 mA. At this juncture, after verifying the absence of blood on aspiration, ropivacaine was injected (2 mg/kg) with a latency period of 20 min. Data were recorded via monitoring of vital signs (DigicareLifeWindowLW9xVet), recording an average hearth rate of 140 ± 9.84 bpm, respiratory rate of 30 ± 4.18 mpm, oxyhemoglobin saturation of 99%, end-tidal carbon dioxide of 26 ± 1.98 mmHg, and temperature of 37.4°C ± 0.11°C over the course of 20 min of the surgical procedure. No movements were observed in response to pain stimuli, and the animal exhibited normal recovery, free of excitation or signs of pain. Discussion: Considering the imprecise history regarding fracture time as well as the lack of specific tests to clearly elucidate the condition of this animal, selective and safe drugs were selected including dexmedetomidine and sevoflurane, which provided superior quality of sedation during the handling of the animal and rapid and smooth anesthetic induction, respectively. Based on experiences with numerous species, the inclusion of the locoregional block has substantial value for lengthening the analgesic duration and quality in addition to reducing adverse effects inherent in general anesthesia. In the present study, the use of ropivacaine in the brachial plexus block with the use of a neurolocalizer in the striped owl was demonstrated to be easy to perform using the axillary approach, demonstrating efficacy confirmed by the stability of physiological variables and muscle relaxation as well as the absence of adverse events during recovery. © 2019 Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul.

ABSTRACT: A free-living adult great horned owl (Bubo virginianus) was presented to a wildlife rehabilitation centre in Southern California with a firm, pedunculated mass arising from the caudal-dorsal border of the left ulna. Two secondary covert feathers were incorporated into the mass and multiple secondary flight and covert feathers adjacent to the mass were broken. Radiographs revealed a calcified mass with no cortical involvement. The mass was surgically removed. Histopathology was consistent with a diagnosis of osteoma. Despite tumour removal, the owl sustained a significant flight impairment resulting from lack of regional feather regrowth. Waiting for a natural moult to take place would likely require 9-12 months. An attempt was made at inducing moult by manually pulling feathers but was not successful. As the rehabilitation facility was space limited and the bird was behaviourally a poor candidate for long-term rehabilitation, humane euthanasia was elected. © 2019 British Veterinary Association.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: In small mammals, the degree of micro- and mesowear of molars depends on the feed hardness, abrasiveness, and some other characteristics. Analysis of micro- and mesorelief of the paleontological material is used for reconstruction of some animal diet parameters. Small mammals pass through a series of complex transformations on the way from the objects of biocenosis to paleontological objects. Bone remains underwent transformations during accumulation and fossilization. In particular, bone remains from ornithogenous deposits were exposed to the bird digestive system elements. We have experimentally studied changes in some parameters of the narrow-headed vole (Microtus gregalis) molars derived from the owl pellets. Comparison of the same samples before and after exposure to the digestive system of the polar owl (Nyctea scandiaca) and eagle owl (Bubo bubo) showed that the tooth enamel microrelief undergoes serious changes and therefore, provides no information on the intravital diet of voles. A different degree of preservation of the characteristics of the mesorelief was shown. Depending on this, an assessment of their applicability to paleoreconstructions was given. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Anticoagulant rodenticides (ARs) are widely used across North America to control rodent infestations but may cause direct mortality or nonlethal effects when secondarily consumed by raptors. Barn Owls (Tyto alba) are at high risk for secondary consumption because they specialize in rodent prey and often live in human-made structures. We investigated the exposure of Barn Owls in Kentucky, US, to ARs and to dicoumarol, an anticoagulant compound naturally found in certain moldy forages. We tested the liver tissue of 48 Barn Owl carcasses collected during 2012– 16. We confirmed exposure to one or more ARs in 33% of the birds examined and detected dicoumarol in 13% of the samples. Rodenticides detected included brodifacoum, coumachlor, and bromadiolone. The prevalence of detected exposure to brodifacoum for after-hatch-year birds (65%) was significantly (P=0.012) higher than hatch-year birds (22%). Brodifacoum was the most commonly detected AR, found in 88% of AR-positive birds. The pesticide registration for this chemical in the US was canceled in 2015 for general consumer products, which likely resulted in a decreasing rate of detected exposure to brodifacoum during our study. We present these results as an example of secondary exposure rates during a period when a pesticide has been restricted and then removed from the consumer market. © Wildlife Disease Association 2019.

ABSTRACT: Our aim was to determine dynamics in a population of tawny owls Strix aluco over 15-year period, in relation to year-to-year variation in environmental conditions. The research was carried out in a habitat mosaic of fields and forest in central Poland, over the 2004-2018 period. Numbers of pairs (territories) were established by the standard playback survey technique supplemented by searches for nest sites. The selected environmental factors studied in parallel were the acorn production, density changes in field and forest rodents, meteorological conditions in winter and density of martens (Martes spp.). At the start of the study period 20 nest boxes designed for tawny owls were placed out in the study area. This number was enlarged by additional 27 nest boxes placed in 2012. The number of owls in the area remained stable - in the range of 26-29 pairs, despite changes in nesting sites availability. However, moderate influence of rodent density and winter conditions on population abundance was detected. Also, peak in the rodent population coincided with greater clutch size and numbers of young owls reared. Densities of martens remained relatively stable throughout the study period, and there were no reported cases of these carnivores killing tawny owls, despite the former taking shelter in the owl-boxes. © 2019 Polish Academy of Sciences.

ABSTRACT: The Grande Comoro Scops Owl (Otus pauliani) is an endangered, rare and elusive owl species restricted to the Karthala forest, Grande Comore. This scops owl species is listed among the most threatened animals of the Comoro archipelago. The species is subjected to strong anthropogenic pressures causing a high rate of habitat loss. Little is known about the species’ population size, habitat suitability and geographic distribution, making the establishment of relevant conservation strategies difficult. In this study we assessed the population density and abundance of the species using the distance sampling approach through (1) the conventional distance sampling method (CDS), and (2) density surface modeling (DSM). Based on DSM, we applied a species distribution modeling method to investigate habitat suitability and geographic distribution of the species to close this knowledge gap. Average population density was estimated to be ca. 27 individuals km−2. We estimated a global population size of 3452 individuals. Our DSM suggested that the Grande Comoro Scops Owl has a very limited distribution (133 km2), restricted to high elevations in Grande Comore’s remaining natural forests (between 800 and 2000 m altitude). However, the currently high level of habitat disturbance and conversion of natural forest into agricultural land could render the species vulnerable to extinction. To ensure the viability of the species and the biodiversity of the Karthala forest, we suggest (1) restoring forest and securing corridors in the Karthala remnant forest; (2) avoiding the conversion of secondary forest into agricultural land, and using existing agroforestry for plantation development; (3) involving a broad community of local individuals and entities in their conservation and management. © 2019, Deutsche Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.

ABSTRACT: Food spectrum was based on 62, 314 prey specimens belonging to 367 taxa collected between 1994 and 2013. The diet included 40.9 % new taxa for the Eagle owl food in Bulgaria. Mammals and birds were most hunted, while reptiles, amphibians, fishes and arthropods were negligible with total 7.8 % by number and 0.8 % by biomass. Voles (Microtus spp.) 18.2 %, true mice (Mus spp.) 8.2 % and Northern white-breasted hedgehog (Erinaceus roumanicus) 5.9 % were the most numerous prey. The staple prey for food biomass were Northern white-breasted hedgehogs 22.9 %, European hares (Lepus europaeus) 8.9 %, Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) 6.5 % and Common moorhens (Gallinula chloropus) 5.5 %. The individual diets of successful pairs were dominated most often by the same taxa. The present study reports increasing shares of small prey in total diet and first records of dominance in individual diets by a number of passerines, amphibians and arthropods. Hunting on predatory birds and mammals accounted for 11.4 % by biomass. Dominance by a carnivorous mammal, Red fox (Vulpes vulpes) - only young individuals, of the biomass of three individual diets is first reported for the country. The large share of small unusual prey and more predators in the diets were most likely the Eagle owl adaptation to local unfavourable food supply. © 2019 Lesotekhnicheski Universitet (University of Forestry).

ABSTRACT: The Masked Owl Tyto novaehollandiae was introduced to Lord Howe Island in the 1920s to control an irruption of the Black Rat Rattus rattus. The owl is a threatened species in New South Wales but is regarded as a pest on the island due to the perceived risk it poses to endemic land birds and breeding seabirds. However, its main diet there comprises Rattus rattus and House Mice Mus musculus and because it is proposed to eradicate these rodents from the island in 2019, the owls are also scheduled for removal then due to the likelihood of their switching their prey base to endemic land birds and breeding seabirds. Simultaneous point surveys and radio-tracking of two female owls over 14 months in 2009-2010 indicated that owls occupied small overlapping home ranges with smaller discrete home range cores. The population of Tyto novaehollandiae on the island was estimated at between 20 and 30 pairs, almost ten times the density that the species occurs at in its natural range. Roost sites were mainly in the dense crowns of canopy trees and in hollows and crevices of large trees. Analysis of regurgitated pellets and pellet remains showed that owl diets were predominantly comprised of Rattus rattus (in 72% of intact pellets) and Mus musculus (in 28% of intact pellets) with the remainder mostly seabird species (in 21% of intact pellets). It is suggested that the introduction of Tyto novaehollandiae in the 1920s may have slowed the extinction rate of endemic terrestrial birds on the island, with the species now functioning as the top apex predator there and possibly limiting population numbers of Rattus rattus. If Tyto novaehollandiae is exerting mesopredator control, this cautions the removal of its population, as required to prevent it switching its prey base once rodents are removed. Removal of owls prior to the removal of rats could lead to mesopredator release, with further highly detrimental effects on the island’s biodiversity, emphasising that owls should be removed concurrently with rodents. © 2019 Royal Zoological Society of New South Wales.

ABSTRACT: We studied the diet and prey delivery behavior of Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia hypugaea) during the breeding season in the southeastern Chihuahuan desert, Mexico. The diet of the Burrowing Owl included 8 orders, 13 invertebrate families, and 5 genera of mammals, gastropods, reptiles, and birds. By frequency, invertebrates (Orthoptera, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, and Hemiptera) were the most common prey, with vertebrates making up a much smaller proportion. However, by biomass, owls consumed mainly vertebrates (56.7%). Among invertebrates, the families Tenebrionidae and Acrididae accounted for 33.2% of the total consumed biomass. Females delivered more prey items than males (55.6% and 44.4%, respectively). Our observations contribute to our knowledge of the ecology of this owl in a region where it has been little studied. © 2019 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The Moon cycle exposes nocturnal life to variation in environmental light. However, whether moonlight shapes the fitness of nocturnal species with distinct colour variants remains unknown. Combining data from long-term monitoring, high-resolution global positioning system tracking and experiments using prey, we show that barn owls (Tyto alba) with distinct plumage colourations are differently affected by moonlight. The reddest owls are less successful at hunting and providing food to their offspring during moonlit nights, which associates with lower body mass and lower survival of the youngest nestlings and with female mates starting to lay eggs at low moonlight levels. Although moonlight should make white owls more conspicuous to prey, it either positively affects or does not affect the hunting and fitness of the whitest owls. We experimentally show that, under full-moon conditions, white plumage triggers longer freezing times in prey, which should facilitate prey catchability. We propose that the barn owl’s white plumage, a rare trait among nocturnal predators, exploits the known aversion of rodents to bright light, explaining why, counterintuitively, moonlight has a lesser impact on the whitest owls. Our study provides evidence for the long-suspected influence of the Moon on the evolution of colouration in nocturnal species, highlighting the importance of colour in nocturnal ecosystems. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

ABSTRACT: Field surveys were conducted fortnightly from February 2014 to May 2015 for recording diversity of owl species inhabiting Margalla Hills National Park, Islamabad (MHNP). Three owl species viz., Spotted Owlet (Athene brama), Little owlet (Athene noctua) and the Tawny Owl (Strix aluco) were recorded from the park at five different sampling sites, at elevations ranging from 615 m to 655 m above sea level. Only one of the three species Tawny owl was previously known from the park while the other two species have been recorded for the first time from the MHNP. On the contrary, three other owl species that were previously known from the park (Asian Barred Owlet Glaucidium cuculoides, Oriental Scops-owl Otus sunia and Pallid Scops Owl Otus brucei ) were not recorded in the current study. Nests of Spotted owlet were found at three sampling sites (Kalinger, Gandhian and Shah Allah Ditta), those of little owlet at Kalinger valley, while single cavity nest of the Tawny owl was located in a mountain ridge at Kalinger valley site.

ABSTRACT: Forest and Spotted Owl management documents often state that severe wildfire is a cause of recent declines in populations of Spotted Owls and that mixed-severity fires (5–70% of burned area in high-severity patches with >75% mortality of dominant vegetation) pose a primary threat to Spotted Owl population viability. This systematic review and meta-analysis summarize all available scientific literature on the effects of wildfire on Spotted Owl demography and ecology from studies using empirical data to answer the question: How does fire, especially recent mixed-severity fires with representative patches of high-severity burn within their home ranges, affect Spotted Owl foraging habitat selection, demography, and site occupancy parameters? Fifteen papers reported 50 effects from fire that could be differentiated from post-fire logging. Meta-analysis of mean standardized effects (Hedge's d) found only one parameter was significantly different from zero, a significant positive foraging habitat selection for low-severity burned forest. Multi-level mixed-effects meta-regressions (hierarchical models) of Hedge's d against percent of study area burned at high severity and time since fire found the following: a negative correlation of occupancy with time since fire; a positive effect on recruitment immediately after the fire, with the effect diminishing with time since fire; reproduction was positively correlated with the percent of high-severity fire in owl territories; and positive selection for foraging in low- and moderate-severity burned forest, with high-severity burned forest used in proportion to its availability, but not avoided. Meta-analysis of variation found significantly greater variation in parameters from burned sites relative to unburned, with specifically higher variation in estimates of occupancy, demography, and survival, and lower variation in estimates of selection probability for foraging habitat in low-severity burned forest. Spotted Owls were usually not significantly affected by mixed-severity fire, as 83% of all studies and 60% of all effects found no significant impact of fire on mean owl parameters. Contrary to current perceptions and recovery efforts for the Spotted Owl, mixed-severity fire does not appear to be a serious threat to owl populations; rather, wildfire has arguably more benefits than costs for Spotted Owls. © 2018 The Author.

ABSTRACT: Habitat models are fundamental tools for designing evidence-based conservation measures, particularly for locating sites with high potential for promoting a species’ recolonisation and occupancy. However, it remains challenging to respond to both the need for large-scale general rules, and for fine-scale information concurrently. Multi-level habitat models provide all-in-one surfaces that explicitly account for conditional dependencies among single-level selection probabilities. We integrated occurrence data obtained from citizen-science species observation data with radio-tracking data to develop multi-level resource selection functions for the little owl (Athene noctua), a species of conservation concern in Central Europe. The results of our habitat selection analyses confirmed that suitable little owl habitat is located in widely open agricultural landscapes that often exist in the vicinity of human settlements. We mapped habitats at fine resolution (40 × 40 m) over an area covering 77,313 km2 in Switzerland and Baden-Württemberg, Germany. We validated the models with external out-of-sample data, and we demonstrated good predictive ability and transferability over the broad landscape. Overall, a fifth of the modelled landscape was estimated to be suitable for little owls. Habitat suitability scores in Switzerland were generally lower than in Baden-Württemberg due to higher elevation, fewer orchards, and more forest patches. Extant populations currently occupy c. 15% of the potential suitable habitats in Baden-Württemberg, and 2% in Switzerland, suggesting that considerable space for recolonisation is available. However, while Baden-Württemberg offers vast open landscapes, lowlands in Switzerland show narrow swaths of habitat along valleys and lakes. We showed that the simultaneous integration of different levels of habitat selection behaviour into a multi-level habitat suitability map creates a promising tool for conservation planning of endangered species over large geographical areas. Our multi-level model allowed for identification of both large-scale habitat suitability patterns to develop conservation strategies, and fine-scale clusters of high quality habitats where conservation measures can be applied at once, thereby increasing relevance of such all-in-one habitat maps for policy makers, wildlife managers and conservations practitioners alike. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Understanding the evolutionary forces maintaining avian color polymorphisms is a major challenge in evolutionary ecology. Aiming to give new insights into the functional basis of color polymorphism, we studied plumage color variation and its associations with fitness proxies in an individually marked population of scops owls Otus scops during 8 yr. We found a repeatable method to assign individuals to three discrete morphs, using both photography and spectrophotometry. Individuals were either grey (33%), intermediate (37%) or brown (30%). Scops owl proved to be polymorphic as the three morphs were found in the two sexes and across ages. Frequency distribution of color within the population did not vary for the two sexes during the study period, and, within individuals, color was repeatable and not explained by plumage maturation. Females of the two extreme morphs seemed to mate at random while intermediate females seemed to mate assortatively. The color of females was not related to laying date, mean fledging mass or number of fledglings per nest. Finally, intermediate females survived slightly better than females of the other morphs. Hence, pairing seems to favor intermediate males, because all females include intermediate males among their mates, and survival seems to favor intermediate females. Despite this, the proportion of intermediate individuals did not increase during the study. This fact may allude to the importance, not analysed here, of larger scale temporal and/or spatial fluctuations in selection acting on different fitness-affecting factors, which may help to explain the maintenance of color polymorphism in the species. © 2018 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Aim: The islands of the south-western Indian Ocean region are home to many endemic bird species, with their closest relatives occurring in Africa and Madagascar, Eurasia, the Sunda Islands, and the Australasian region. Among owls, the extant endemic scops owls (genus Otus) from Madagascar, Comoros, Seychelles, and Socotra are related to the Southeast Asian species, O. sunia, the Oriental scops owl. Three owl species, presumably Otus derivatives, twice the size of standard scops owls and now extinct, once inhabited the Mascarene Islands, and have been placed in a separate genus, Mascarenotus. Insular apomorphies have made their precise relationships difficult to determine. Here we investigate the phylogenetic position of these enigmatic owls. Location: The Mascarene Islands (Réunion, Mauritius, Rodrigues) in the south-western Indian Ocean. Methods: Phylogenetic relationships were reconstructed using ancient DNA extracted from subfossil remains. Fragments of cytochrome b gene were amplified and sequenced. The ancient sequences were analysed with modern sequences of 19 ingroup Otus taxa using Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood methods. Results: The Mauritian extinct species M. sauzieri was reconstructed as the sister to both O. pauliani (Grand Comoro) and O. rutilus (Madagascar). The Rodrigues extinct species M. murivorus was the sister, in a star-like differentiation, to the preceding clade as well as the remaining Comorian species and a clade formed by O. insularis (Seychelles) and O. sunia. Main conclusions: The ancestor of O. sunia simultaneously colonized Rodrigues Island (evolving into Otus murivorus), Madagascar, and part of the Comoros Islands around 3 million years ago. Later, presumably from Madagascar, new lineages colonized Grand Comoro and Mauritius (O. sauzieri). Independently, a more recent O. sunia ancestor colonized the Seychelles Islands and Socotra. These colonizations were probably favoured by Pliocene cyclonic events, stronger and more frequent than today. Several features, including giantism, wing reduction, and a relative decrease in skull and orbit size evolved convergently in the polyphyletic species O. sauzieri and O. murivorus. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

ABSTRACT: Web Ontology Language (OWL) is designed to represent varied knowledge about things and the relationships of things. It is widely used to express complex models and address information heterogeneity of specific domains, such as underwater environments and robots. With the help of OWL, heterogeneous underwater robots are able to cooperate with each other by exchanging information with the same meaning and robot operators can organize the coordination easier. However, OWL has expressivity limitations on representing general rules, especially the statement “If… Then… Else… ”. Fortunately, the Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) has strong rule representation capabilities. In this paper, we propose a rule-based reasoner for inferring and providing query services based on OWL and SWRL. SWRL rules are directly inserted into the ontologies by several steps of model transformations instead of using a specific editor. In the verification experiments, the SWRL rules were successfully and efficiently inserted into the OWL-based ontologies, obtaining completely correct query results. This rule-based reasoner is a promising approach to increase the inference capability of ontology-based models and it achieves significant contributions when semantic queries are done. © 2018 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: We report on tetrapod (Reptilia, Amphibia, Mammalia, Aves) vertebrates recovered during excavations at Tron Bon Lei rockshelter on the south coast of Alor Island, eastern Indonesia. These include both archaeological specimens recovered from a 1 m² test pit dating from ∼21 kya cal BP to the late Holocene, and a modern eastern barn owl deposit recovered nearby. To discern between the depositional processes that accumulated the small numbers of micro- and macrovertebrate remains from the archaeological deposits, the taphonomic signature of the natural assemblage was quantified and compared to the archaeological record. The taphonomic data indicates that the tetrapod archaeofaunal remains are a combination of barn owl predation of microfauna and human predation of larger fauna. This approach provides new information on human-tetrapod interactions on Alor in Wallacea during the late Quaternary, including an apparent increase in cave site use and hunting intensity during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, sea turtle butchery and probable transport, and extinctions of previously unknown giant to large rat species. © 2018, Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Birds primarily create and control the forces necessary for flight through changing the shape and orientation of their wings and tail. Their wing geometry is characterised by complex variation in parameters such as camber, twist, sweep and dihedral. To characterise this complexity, a multi-view stereo-photogrammetry setup was developed for accurately measuring surface geometry in high resolution during free flight. The natural patterning of the birds was used as the basis for phase correlation-based image matching, allowing indoor or outdoor use while being non-intrusive for the birds. The accuracy of the method was quantified and shown to be sufficient for characterising the geometric parameters of interest, but with a reduction in accuracy close to the wing edge and in some localised regions. To demonstrate the method’s utility, surface reconstructions are presented for a barn owl (Tyto alba) and peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) during three instants of gliding flight per bird. The barn owl flew with a consistent geometry, with positive wing camber and longitudinal anhedral. Based on flight dynamics theory, this suggests it was longitudinally statically unstable during these flights. The peregrine falcon flew with a consistent glide angle, but at a range of air speeds with varying geometry. Unlike the barn owl, its glide configuration did not provide a clear indication of longitudinal static stability/instability. Aspects of the geometries adopted by both birds appeared to be related to control corrections and this method would be well suited for future investigations in this area, as well as for other quantitative studies into avian flight dynamics. © 2019.

ABSTRACT: Capsule: Territory monitoring using playback of calls is a reliable approach for assessing population trends of Tawny Owls Strix aluco, particularly when human resources are limited or survey areas are difficult to access. Aims: To explore whether response calls of Tawny Owls towards broadcast conspecific and heterospecific male owl playback calls would provide similar estimates of population size and trends over time as nest-box monitoring. Methods: Between 1998 and 2017, Tawny Owls were monitored in a predominantly forested area of central Slovenia. Throughout the year, territories were monitored using a playback protocol comprising silent listening during five minutes before and after ten minutes of broadcasting male Tawny Owl. Seasonal variation in response rate was examined and results from the playback method were compared to data on occupancy rate of nest-boxes. Results: Territory monitoring using playback calls showed a similar direction of population trends as nest-box monitoring but a different population dynamics pattern. The overall response rate in occupied territories to conspecific playback calls at first visits was 70%. This was significantly higher than for heterospecific playback calls and the frequency of spontaneous vocalizations. The response rate to conspecific playback calls when including two visits rose to nearly 90%. There was no difference in response rate between seasons. The average time to respond to conspecific playback calls was five minutes. Conclusions: Compared to nest-box monitoring of breeding pairs, territory monitoring of breeding and non-breeding Tawny Owls using playback provides a robust and cost-effective method for monitoring. We recommend conducting territory monitoring between January and May during the breeding season, with two visits to each site using conspecific playback of territorial male hoot calls using the 5 + 10 + 5 minutes protocol. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Mount Oku is well known for its exceptional species diversity for both animals and plants. A total number of 27 species of rodents and six species of shrews are reported from the area. Ten of these species are endemic at local or regional level and are considered as endangered or vulnerable, with a decreasing population trend. They are thus considered as having a high conservation importance. We sampled terrestrial small mammals from owl pellets during a period of 22 months in different areas near the village Oku, in order to assess the importance of these taxa in the diet of owl species present in the area. The 236 pellets attributed to three sympatric owl species (Barn owl, Tyto alba, the African wood owl, Strix woodfordii, Northern white-faced owl, Ptilopsis leucotis), yielded a total number of 543 specimens of rodents and shrews, belonging to 22 species (16 species of rodents and six species of shrews). They represented respectively 69.06% and 30.94% of the total assemblage, the species Dasymys sp., with a final score of 18.23%, having the highest relative abundance. Of the ten species with a high conservation importance, only Lemniscomys mittendorfi was missing. All constituted about 27.62% of all specimens collected, with a relative abundance of 4.23% for species strictly restricted to Mount Oku. This study confirms the position of Mount Oku as an important conservation area for rodents and shrews, and highlights the evidence that terrestrial small mammal predation by owls cannot be considered a threat to species of conservation concern at Mount Oku. © Zoologisches Forschungsinstitut und Museum Alexander Koenig.

ABSTRACT: Between 29 Mar and 10 Apr, 2015, a Little Owl Athene noctua survey was carried out using the playback method in the southern part of Montenegro. The study area was situated between the town of Ulcinj and the Bojana River delta. A total of 55 calling males were registered at 26 survey points with a maximum of 4 calling males per survey point. Considering the low response rate of the Little Owl, its local population was estimated at be 55-110 calling males. This study presents the first systematic survey of the Little Owl in Montenegro. © 2018 Ivan Kljun et al., published by Sciendo 2018.

ABSTRACT: An adult, male snowy owl (Bubo scandiacus) was found down and unable to fly in western New York State. Physical examination and radiographs revealed a subacute, open wound and fractured major and minor metacarpals of the right wing. A minimal type II external skeletal fixator (ESF) device was placed on the right major metacarpal bone and the open wound was allowed to granulate and close. After evidence of bone union, the ESF device was removed. The owl performed auto-physiotherapy throughout the process and was released with sustained flight 2 months postoperatively. It was recaptured 7 weeks later and underwent further rehabilitation to allow successful release 11 months after surgical stabilization. To our knowledge, this is the first case report describing use of a type II ESF device on the metacarpus of a bird. © 2018 by the Association of Avian Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: The OWL-Net (Optical Wide-field patroL Network) is composed of 0.5-m wide-field optical telescopes spread over the globe (Mongolia, Morocco, Israel, South Korea, and USA). All the observing stations are identical, operated in a fully robotic manner, and controlled by the headquarters located in Daejeon, Korea. The main objective of the OWL-Net is to obtain the orbital information of Korean LEO and GEO satellites using purely optical means and to maintain their orbital elements. The aperture size of the mirror is 0.5 m in the Ritchey-Chretien configuration, and its field of view is 1.1 deg on the CCD sensor. The telescope is equipped with an electrically cooled 4 K CCD camera with a 9-µm pixel size, and its pixel scale is 1 arcsec/pixel. A chopper wheel with variable speed is adopted to obtain multiple points in a single shot. Each observatory is equipped with a heavy-duty environment monitoring system for robust robotic observation. The headquarters has components for status monitoring, scheduling, network operation, orbit calculation, and database management. The test-phase operation of the whole system began in early 2017, although test runs for individual sites began in 2015. Although the OWL-Net has 7 observation modes for artificial satellites and astronomical objects, we are concentrating on a few modes for LEO satellites and calibration during the early phase. Some early results and analysis for system performance will be presented, and their implications will be discussed. © 2018 COSPAR

ABSTRACT: The present study analyses the taphonomic features of recent small mammal bone and teeth accumulations recovered from pellets generated by Strix chacoensis in a Natural Protected Area in the central Monte Desert of Mendoza, Argentina. In order to identify the taphonomic signature of this predator in the formation of zooarchaeological and palaeontological accumulations, taxonomic profiles, relative abundances, bone breakage patterns and digestive corrosion were evaluated. Taphonomic results locate S. chacoensis in modification category 2 (intermediate). Although the general taphonomic patterns detected in the present study were similar to a typical owl pattern, some differences from that pattern were detected. This sample showed lesser relative abundances of skeletal elements, greater loss of teeth and a larger number of incisors modified by digestion than those generated by other strigiforms. The comparison with reported archaeological accumulations suggested that the small mammal remains recovered in some sites from the Monte Desert may correspond to the predatory activity of S. chacoensis. The identification of the action of S. chacoensis in archaeological and palaeontological small mammal bone and teeth accumulations is a promising tool to evaluate the conservation status of native forests in the past. © 2018 Collegium Boreas.

ABSTRACT: Understanding factors that determine haemosporidian prevalence is critical in predicting how parasite and avian host populations will respond to environmental change. Here, we used molecular screening of blood samples from migrating northern saw-whet owls Aegolius acadicus in eastern North America to characterize haemosporidian infections and examine parasite prevalence with respect to abundance of migrants, timing of migration, climatic conditions at the breeding grounds, and avian host age. We identified three haemosporidian genera (Leucocytozoon, Plasmodium, and Haemoproteus) and discovered a new lineage of Leucocytozoon that is thus far specific to the northern saw-whet owl. We found no significant relationship between parasite prevalence and northern saw-whet owl abundance or timing of migration. After-hatch-year birds were significantly more likely to be parasitized by Leucocytozoon than hatch-year birds, whereas prevalence of Plasmodium was higher in hatch-year birds. Of the three climatic variables analyzed at owl breeding grounds (temperature, precipitation, and snowpack days), lower average annual temperatures significantly increased the chance of a bird being parasitized by Leucocytozoon; no significant temperature-dependent relationship was found for Plasmodium. This study contributes to our general understanding of the relationship between parasite prevalence and host density, host age, resource abundance, and abiotic factors such as temperature and precipitation. © 2018 The Authors

ABSTRACT: A 1-month-old brown wood owlet (Strix leptogrammica) purchased from a wholesaler and housed as a companion bird by an individual owner in Japan showed severe dehydration and anorexia following a week of vomiting and severe diarrhea. A great number of approximately 5 × 4-μm-sized Cryptosporidium oocysts were found in the feces by microscopy. The owlet was administered subcutaneous fluid and intragastric tube feeding for 2 weeks, resulting in improvement of the condition with a decreased number of oocysts in the feces. At days 51 and 119, no oocysts were found in the feces by microscope and PCR detection. These results suggested that this parasite was a possible agent of severe diarrhea in the affected bird. Molecular analysis of DNA extracted from oocysts based on the 18SrRNA loci identified C. avium; however, analysis of actin and hsp (heat shock protein) genes identified a novel genotype indicating a mixed infection with C. avium and a novel genotype. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Censusing nocturnal species such as the Tawny Owl (Strix aluco) living in a dense population can lead to an overestimate if individual signatures are not available. A technique that separates the individualistic call of the Tawny Owl could be a useful tool for an exhaustive census. Six Tawny Owl males were followed for nine months; 654 vocalizations were analysed. Three methods–Spectrographic Cross Correlation (SPCC), Acoustic Space (AS) and Visual Spectrogram Comparison (VSC)–were tested to assess their ability to classify the typical male call. For SPCC, 10 randomly selected hoots for each male were compared: the distributions of correlation coefficients differed in only 26.7% of the cases when intra and inter individual variability are compared. For AS, all the spectrograms were measured through 13 parameters and intra and inter individual distances were compared: the interval containing 95.4% of intra-individual measures also contained 95.9% of inter-individual comparisons. Both SPCC and AS are considered not to be able to adequately separate subjects. For VSC, 31 randomly selected hoots were visually compared by 5 helpers; their classifications were compared pairwise and with the real situation; operators correctly identified a male in 70% of cases (mean = 70.4 SD = 5.4). If we integrate VSC with information coming from field notes, we have a more powerful tool than the mapping method. It is plausible that this technique can be useful for an exhaustive census of Tawny Owl populations living at high densities. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: The diet of the Indian Eagle Owl was studied from April to September 2017 in Tiruchirapalli District, Tamil Nadu, India. Analysis of 1082 regurgitated pellets yielded 2077 prey items; the mean prey items/ pellet was 1.91. The diet constituted 65.1% of rodent prey and the remaining 34.83% of other groups of both vertebrate and invertebrate animals. The mean percentage of prey composition was 31.15% Millardia meltada Soft-furred Field Rat, 12.95% Bandicota bengalensis Lesser Bandicoot Rat, 10.25% Mus booduga Indian Field Mouse, and 10.24% of other rodent species. Of the 34.83% of non-rodent prey, the owls ingested insects (Rhinoceros beetles, 9.58%), Arachnida (Solifugae or Sun spider, Galeodes sp., 9.58%), reptiles (Calotes sp., 3.7%), amphibians (3.56%), shrews (Suncus murinus, 2.84%), and others (5.57%). The Indian Eagle Owls consumed more than one prey per day and chiefly foraged in agricultural crop fields and consumed both small mammals and insects of agricultural importance under crop ecosystems. © Siva et al. 2019.

ABSTRACT: The Barn Owl Tyto alba was introduced to the Hawaiian Islands in the late 1950s as a biological control for rats Rattus spp. and has since become common throughout the main Hawaiian Islands. Herein, we address the impact on Hawaiian seabirds by summarizing the number of seabird depredations recorded in the database of the Kaua‘i Endangered Seabird Recovery Project. Data were collected on Kaua‘i and the neighboring islets of Lehua and Moku‘ae‘ae between January 2011 and October 2018 as part of ongoing seabird survey work; 379 Barn Owl depredations were recorded of eight seabird species, the most common of which were Wedge-tailed Shearwater Ardenna pacifica, Black Noddy Anous minutus, and Bulwer’s Petrel Bulweria bulwerii. Included were 21 depredations on federally listed Newell’s Shearwater Puffinus newelli and Hawaiian Petrel Pterodroma sandwichensis. Most depredations were on adult birds. The effectiveness of Barn Owl control was also evident, with depredations on Lehua Islet decreasing significantly after dedicated control operations were initiated. Barn Owl control should be considered as an integral part of all Hawaiian seabird management programs. © 2019, Marine Ornithology. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The thermoregulatory responses of owls to heat stress have been the subject of few studies. Although nocturnality buffers desert-dwelling owls from significant heat stress during activity, roost sites in tree and cactus cavities or in deep shade provide only limited refuge from high environmental temperatures during the day. We measured thermoregulatory responses to acute heat stress in two species of small owls, the elf owl (Micrathene whitneyi) and the western screechowl (Megascops kennicottii), which occupy the Sonoran Desert of southwestern North America, an area of extreme heat and aridity. We exposed wild-caught birds to progressively increasing air temperatures (Ta) and measured resting metabolic rate (RMR), evaporative water loss (EWL), body temperature (Tb) and heat tolerance limits (HTL; the maximumTa reached). Comparatively low RMR values were observed in both species, Tb approximated Ta at 40°C and mild hyperthermia occurred as Ta was increased toward the HTL. Elf owls and screechowls reached HTLs of 48 and 52°C, respectively, and RMR increased to 1.5 and 1.9 times thermoneutral values. Rates of EWL at the HTL allowed for the dissipation of 167-198% of metabolic heat production (MHP). Gular flutter was used as the primary means of evaporative heat dissipation and produced large increases in evaporative heat loss (44-100%), accompanied by only small increases (<5%) in RMR. These small, cavity-nesting owls have thermoregulatory capacities that are intermediate between those of the open-ground nesting nightjars and the passerines that occupy the same ecosystem.  © 2018.

ABSTRACT: Inbreeding has been difficult to quantify in wild populations because of incomplete parentage information. We applied and extended a recently developed framework for addressing this problem to infer inbreeding rates in Northern Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) across the Pacific Northwest, USA. Using pedigrees from 14,187 Northern Spotted Owls, we inferred inbreeding rates for 14 types of matings among relatives that produce pedigree inbreeding coefficients of F = 0.25 or F = 0.125. Inbreeding was most common in the Washington Cascades, where an estimated 15% of individuals are inbred. Inbreeding was lowest in western Oregon (3.5%) and northern California (2.7%), and intermediate for the Olympic Peninsula of Washington (6.1%). Estimates from the Olympic Peninsula were likely underestimates because of small sample sizes and the presence of few pedigrees capable of resolving inbreeding events. Most inbreeding resulted from matings between full siblings or half siblings, although a high rate of inbreeding from mother-son pairs was identified in the Olympic Peninsula. Geographic variation in inbreeding rates may reflect population declines and bottlenecks that have been detected in prior investigations. We show that there is strong selection against inbred birds. Only 3 of 44 inbred birds were later identified as parents (6.8%), whereas 2,823 of 10,380 birds that represented a comparable cross section of the data were later seen as reproducing parents (27.2%). Habitat loss and competition with Barred Owls (S. varia) remain primary threats to Northern Spotted Owls. However, given the negative consequences of inbreeding, Spotted Owl populations in Washington with suitable habitat and manageable numbers of Barred Owls may benefit from translocations of individuals from Oregon and California to introduce new genetic variation and reduce future inbreeding events. © 2018 American Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Fledgling birds sometimes abandon their own nest and move to neighboring nests where they are fed by host parents. This behaviour, referred to as ‘nest-switching’, is well known in precocial birds that are mobile soon after hatching and can easily reach foster nests. In contrast, due to the difficulty of observing nest-switching in territorial altricial birds, the causes and consequences of moving to others’ nests are poorly known in this group of birds. Nest-switchers can be adopted by the foster parents or they can steal food from the host parents meant for their offspring, a form of kleptoparasitism, which may result in reduced breeding success of the host nest. In Israel, 12 barn owl fledglings left their natal nests and were found in 9 host nests out of 111 monitored nests (8.1%). Nest-switchers that fledged earlier in the breeding season flew shorter distances to reach host nests probably because the density of nests with younger nestlings is higher early in the season. The number of host nestlings fledged and the percentage of nestlings fledged was lower in host nests than in nests without switchers. The occasional nest-switchers were always older than host nestlings (respectively 80 and 50 days of age, on average) and host parents fledged fewer young when nest-switchers occupied host nests with younger nestlings. This suggests that nest-switchers are kleptoparasites because the presence of the older alien fledglings is associated with a lower breeding success of the host parents. © 2018 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Citizen science is gaining popularity as a means for all persons to participate in and contribute to scientific projects, and can increase our understanding of avian conservation and ecology by facilitating the collection of more data. Understanding the type of person who participates in citizen science projects, including their motivations, behaviors, and gains, allows researchers to better recruit and retain participants and to design enjoyable and educational projects with direct and indirect benefits to conservation and science. We surveyed participants of the Manitoba Nocturnal Owl Survey, an ongoing 25-year-old citizen science project, to evaluate how and why people participated and to determine their relationship with science and ecology. The interpersonal dimensions of surveying was important at all stages of participation, affecting recruitment, participation, and reasons for leaving. Being in nature and encountering wildlife was often cited as the most important aspect of the actual surveying experience, though many respondents also reported they enjoyed experiencing nature socially. Educational opportunity was rarely cited as a motivation, although gaining knowledge was the most common reported benefit. Respondents were highly educated, and concerned about a variety of environmental and conservation issues. The majority of respondents had participated in multiple citizen science projects. Marketing citizen science projects as social learning opportunities embedded in nature may help attract and retain more volunteers, ensuring long-term sustainability of programs while engaging new participants in activities that increase their ecological knowledge and awareness. © 2018 by the author(s).

ABSTRACT: An OpticalWide-field patroL-Network (OWL-Net) has been developed for maintaining Korean low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites’ orbital ephemeris. The OWL-Net consists of five optical tracking stations. Brightness signals of reflected sunlight of the targets were detected by a charged coupled device (CCD). A chopper system was adopted for fast astrometric data sampling, maximum 50 Hz, within a short observation time. The astrometric accuracy of the optical observation data was validated with precise orbital ephemeris such as Consolidated Prediction File (CPF) data and precise orbit determination result with onboard Global Positioning System (GPS) data from the target satellite. In the optical observation simulation of the OWL-Net for 2017, an average observation span for a single arc of 11 LEO observation targets was about 5 min, while an average optical observation separation time was 5 h. We estimated the position and velocity with an atmospheric drag coefficient of LEO observation targets using a sequential-batch orbit estimation technique after multi-arc batch orbit estimation. Post-fit residuals for the multi-arc batch orbit estimation and sequential-batch orbit estimation were analyzed for the optical measurements and reference orbit (CPF and GPS data). The post-fit residuals with reference show few tens-of-meters errors for in-track direction for multi-arc batch and sequential-batch orbit estimation results. © 2018 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Vocal activity is one ofthe main attributes that enables assessment ofthe presence and abundance of animal populations. However, the factors affecting vocal activity are rarely studied, especially in owls. We studied the vocal activity ofBoreal Owl (Aegolius funereus) using acoustic monitoring in relation to environmental factors in Central Europe (Czech Republic), over an area oflOO km2. We analysed a total ofl,310 hours of sound recordings collected over two years (2015 and 2016) at the turn of March/April and April/May. The frequency of sampling points in which we recorded Boreal Owl vocaliza-tions varied from 0.17 to 0.59 and was higher in the year of increased prey abundance (2015) and earlier in the breeding season (March/April). The duration ofBoreal Owl vo-cal activity varied from 1 to 60 minutes per hour and was related to temporal factors. In particular, the duration ofBoreal Owl vocalization increased late in the breeding season (April/May) and in the year of higher prey abundance (2015), and it showed two peaks of vocal activity during the night. Weather conditions, the occurrence ofnesting Boreal Owl pairs, and the vocalization ofother owl species had no effect on the duration of Boreal Owl vocalization. These findings highlight the importance of between-year, seasonal, and within-night variability in the Boreal Owl vocal activity and document that acoustic monitoring based on sound recorders works well for monitoring of nocturnal bird species. © 2019 University of Helsinki.

ABSTRACT: The owl family Tytonidae comprises two genera: Phodilus, limited to the forests of central Africa and South-East Asia, and the ubiquitous Tyto. The genus Tyto is majorly represented by the cosmopolitan Common Barn Owl group, with more than 30 subspecies worldwide. Discrete differences in body size and plumage colouration have led to the classification of this family into many species and subspecies, but the taxonomic status and phylogenetic relationships between taxa remain unclear, and in some groups controversial. Although several previous studies attempted to resolve this problem, they have been limited in their taxonomic and geographical coverage, or have relied on restricted molecular evidence and low sample sizes. Based on the most comprehensive sampling to date (16 out of 17 Tyto species, and one out of three Phodilus species), a multi-locus approach using seven mitochondrial and two nuclear markers, and taking advantage of field data and museum collections available worldwide, our main questions in this study were: (1) what are the phylogenetic relationships and classification status of the whole family; (2) when and where did the most important speciation events occur? We confirm that the Common Barn Owl, Tyto alba is divided into three main evolutionary units: the American Barn Owl, T. furcata; the Western Barn Owl, T. alba; and the Eastern Barn Owl, T. javanica, and suggest a Late Miocene (ca. 6 mya) Australasian and African origin of the group. Our results are supported by fossil age information, given that the most recent common ancestor between the Tytonidae genera Phodilus and Tyto was probably from the Oligocene (ca. 28 mya) of Australasia. We finally reveal six major Pleistocene radiations of Tyto, all resulting in wide-range distributions. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: TRIMCyp generated by retrotransposition of a cyclophilin A inserting into TRIM5 locus, has been identified in owl monkey and most of Old World monkeys (OWM). Owl monkey TRIMCyp (omTRIMCyp) inhibits HIV-1 infection by direct interaction with viral capsid and indirect innate immune induction, whereas most of TRIMCyps from OWM cannot inhibit HIV-1, and the impact of which on immunoregulation is largely unknown. Here we reported that omTRIMCyp induces NF-κB, AP-1 and IFN-β activation in a dose-dependent manner, while TRIMCyp from northern pig-tailed macaque (npmTRIMCyp) does not activate NF-κB and moderately enhances AP-1 and IFN-β activities. The Cyclophilin A (CypA) domain plays an important role in omTRIMCyp-mediated NF-κB activation, and RBCC domains have a synergetic effect. We further indicated the mechanism by which npmTRIMCyp unable to activate NF-κB is that npmTRIMCyp hardly phosphorylates IκBα, different from omTRIMCyp which dramatically induces IκBα phosphorylation. Ubiquitination activity of omTRIMCyp was greater than npmTRIMCyp, although both could be ubiquitylated. Given that npmTRIMCyp neither interacts with viral capsid resulting in susceptibility to HIV-1 infection, nor activates NF-κB that is indispensable to HIV-1 provirus transcription, we proposed a model that npmTRIMCyp may play an important role in HIV-1 infected northern pig-tailed macaque with latency. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: In Argentinian Patagonia, the coexistence of owls and humans has a long and sometimes conflictive ethnobiological heritage. This paper presents a recent environmental situation which brought humans and owls together after massive fruiting of the native bamboo Chusquea culeou (Poaceae) in Los Alerces National Park, near Esquel city (Patagonia, Argentina). The event was followed by an increase in the population of native mice (e.g. Oligoryzomys longicaudatus, Abrothrix longipilis) which, in turn, caused an increase in the population of owls and other predators. This caused concern and fear in towns and homesteads close to the National Park. The objectives of our work were (a) to analyze the perceptions and attitudes of high school students and their families toward owls in Esquel city, after the rodent invasion and (b) to evaluate the effects on students of the integration of academic and traditional knowledge in teaching the ecological role of regional owls. We conducted workshops, interviews and laboratory classes. Our results show that a high percentage of the families interviewed know that owls feed primarily on rodents. Seventy four percent of people interviewed reported knowing at least one myth concerning owls; among these, 61% consider owls are diabolic birds, while 13% think they are good and wise. Both perceptions have behavioral implications ranging from some people wanting to protect owls or not interested in them, to some others who want to kill them. We believe that teaching through an intercultural approach increases the interest of students for owls’ conservation. In Patagonian urban areas, state-run wildlife conservation programs should reinforce cultural and ecological values of these birds in order to minimize any conflict with humans. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Chris Wood enhanced the world of Cretaceous research for more than 50 years. His British Geological Survey work helped develop the lithostratigraphy and biostratigraphy used to build the framework for investigating and then remapping the Chalk in England and Northern Ireland. In recognition of his work on the English Northern Province Chalk of the Lincolnshire and Yorkshire Wolds, the Yorkshire Geological Society presented him their most prestigious award, the John Phillips Medal, in 2015. His knowledge of the Chalk was also sought and applied to many engineering projects including the Channel Tunnel. In the international arena his palaeontological studies, in conjunction with the many European colleagues he corresponded with, contributed greatly to defining Cretaceous Stage and Substage concepts using a wide range of faunal indices which he also applied to the British successions. Having taught himself German he developed a lifelong working relationship with German colleagues, especially Gundolf Ernst and his research students in Berlin. Latterly, his special focus was on inoceramid bivalve fossils, working closely with Polish colleagues, in recognition of their abundance in the Upper Cretaceous and potential use as substage indices. His final years were marked by reviewing and editing papers for the journals Acta Geologica Polonica and Cretaceous Research. © 2017

ABSTRACT: A characteristic feature of the giant owl butterfly, i.e. Caligo memnon, is its big wing eyespot. This feature could serve as deceiving functionality for the butterfly against predators. As evidenced by scanning electron microscope (SEM) image on black part of eyespot, the scales on wing eyespot contain nanostructured ridges and cross-ribs. Applying direct measurement, statistical method, and Fourier analysis, the authors evidence that these nanostructures display order-disorder in their shape and position. The autocorrelation of SEM image provides average values of characteristic periods of the order-disorder nanostructures together with an estimation of corresponding correlation lengths. Linecuts obtained from the Fourier transform of SEM image were also analysed with the Hosemann function to extract similar information. These analyses indicate that the nanostructured order-disorder may contribute to blackness on wing eyespot. The authors thus conclude that the blackness on wing eyespot of C. memnon could be attributed to contributions from both the nanostructured order-disorder and melanin pigment. © 2018 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

ABSTRACT: The aim of our study was to investigate the feeding of the Little Owl (Athene noctua) dur-ing the breeding period in three protected sites (Upper Kiskunság Puszta, Upper Kiskunság Lakes, Peszéradacs Mead-ows) in an extensively managed lowland plain area (Upper Kiskunság) of the Carpathian Basin. A further objective was to provide a detailed assessment of the vertebrate prey spectrum and dominance structure based on the analyses of pellets. Little Owl pellets were collected in September 2015 and 2016 from 20 artificial nest boxes in which successful breeding occurred in both years. Mean pellet number was calculated per individuals. Distribution of individual number and biomass of vertebrate prey taxa were also examined. The number of collected and dissected owl pellets was 2,094 in 2015 and 2,024 in 2016, respectively. The average rate of pellet regurgitation was 25.57 pellets/ind. in 2015, and 27.74 pellets/ind. in 2016. From the 40 samples (4,118 owl pellets) a total of 2,017 vertebrate preys were determined. Cumulative species richness was 21, including 12 mammalian, 1 amphibian, 4 reptile and 4 bird species. Mammals were dominant in the food (average 50.83%), and the consumption of amphibians was similar (48.06%). The consumption of birds and reptiles was not significant. Amphibians were represented by a single species, the Common Spadefoot (Pelobates fuscus) in remarkably high proportions among the prey items, followed by the Common Vole (Microtus arvalis) by approx. 37% proportion. The high proportion of the latter two species was also clearly reflected in the biomass amounts. Among the birds, the Starling (Sturnus vulgaris) proved to be the most commonly predated species apart from other species closely related to farmland habitats (Motacilla alba, M. flava, Passer montanus). © 2019, BirdLife Hungary.

ABSTRACT: The most recent comprehensive estimates of Northern Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) natal dispersal distances were reported in 2002. Since then, Northern Spotted Owl populations have experienced substantial demographic changes, with potential attendant changes in natal dispersal distances, including temporal or geographic trends. We analyzed the natal dispersal of Northern Spotted Owls during 1985-2012 in Oregon and Washington, USA (n = 1,534 dispersal events), to determine current natal dispersal distances and to evaluate potential trends that may inform management actions. Mean net dispersal distance (natal site to site of first attempted breeding) was 23.8 km ± 19.2 km SD, with females dispersing ∼50% farther than males. Net dispersal distance varied by ecoregion (Washington Coast and Cascades, Washington Eastern Cascades, Oregon Coast Range, Oregon and California Cascades, and Oregon and California Klamath) but declined similarly in all ecoregions over time (∼1 km yr-1). Dispersal direction also varied by ecoregion, following coarse-scale forest habitat configuration, and was bimodal (north-south) in the Oregon Coast Range, south-southwest in the Oregon and California Cascades, and showed little directionality in the Washington Eastern Cascades, Washington Coast and Cascades, and Oregon and California Klamath. Long-distance dispersal events (>50 km) also varied by ecoregion (mean: 62.3-99.5 km), with most long-distance dispersal (8% of dispersers; distances up to 177 km) originating in southern ecoregions. We found no direct relationship between Barred Owl (Strix varia) detections near natal or settling locations and dispersal distance. These findings, particularly the declining trend of dispersal distances, may inform management actions aimed toward conservation of the Northern Spotted Owl. © 2018 American Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Highway programmes typically focus on reducing vehicle collisions with large mammals because of economic or safety reasons, while overlooking the millions of birds that die annually from traffic. We studied wildlife–vehicle collisions along an interstate highway in southern Idaho, USA, with among the highest reported rates of American Barn Owl Tyto furcata road mortality. Carcass data from systematic and ad hoc surveys conducted in 2004–2006 and 2013–2015 were used to explore the extent to which spatial, road geometric and biotic factors explained Barn Owl–vehicle collisions. Barn Owls outnumbered all other identified vertebrate species of roadkill and represented > 25% of individuals and 73.6% of road-killed birds. At a 1-km highway segment scale, the number of dead Barn Owls decreased with increasing numbers of human structures, cumulative length of secondary roads near the highway and width of the highway median. The number of dead Barn Owls increased with higher commercial average annual daily traffic (CAADT), small mammal abundance index and grass rather than shrubs in the roadside verge. The small mammal abundance index was also greater in roadsides with grass vs. mixed shrubs, suggesting that Barn Owls may be attracted to grassy portions of the highway with more abundant small mammals for hunting prey. When assessed at a 3-km highway segment scale, the number of dead Barn Owls again increased, with higher CAADT as well as with greater numbers of dairy farms. At a 5-km scale, the number of dead Barn Owls increased with a greater percentage of cropland near the highway. Although human conversion of the environment from natural shrub-steppe to irrigated agriculture in this region of Idaho has probably enhanced habitat for Barns Owls, it simultaneously has increased risk for owl–vehicle collisions where an interstate highway traverses the altered landscape. We review some approaches for highway mitigation and suggest that reducing wildlife–vehicle collisions involving Barn Owls may contribute to the persistence of this species. © 2018 British Ornithologists’ Union

ABSTRACT: Ural owl has been poorly studied in Romania, where its distribution is only partially known. Based on 308 acoustic point-count stations across Eastern Romania, we investigated, a total of 87 Ural owls potential territories where detected. We employed a Boosted Tree Regression (BRT) to analyse the influence of 29 variables regarding the climate, disturbances and habitat over species distribution. The best predictor on the occurrence of Ural owls in the study area was forest age. Ural owl showed a high association with glades and forests with trees older than 80 years, while young forests and undergrowth were used much less. The species also showed a tendency to avoid forest edges and steep slopes. © NWJZ, Oradea, Romania, 2018.

ABSTRACT: The diet of the Powerful Owl Ninox strenua is relatively well studied, particularly in the Melbourne area. Nevertheless, the opportunity was taken to collect 111 pellets, or partial pellets, regurgitated from birds at six sites across the Greater Melbourne area between April 2009 and February 2015. As expected from previous and more detailed studies, analysis of these pellets showed that Common Ringtail Possum Pseudocheirus peregrinus was the most common prey, and occurred in 79 pellets. Two unexpected findings were Swamp Wallaby Wallabia bicolor remains found in one pellet collected on Bourkes Creek, near the township of Emerald, and Little Red Flying-fox Pteropus scapulatus remains in three owl pellets collected at a site on the lower Yarra River. © 2018, Field Naturalists Club of Victoria.

ABSTRACT: Little was known about the small mammal fauna of the Marcal Basin to date, therefore we collected 1,144 Barn Owl pellets from 15 locations in 2017. After the analysis of the pellets, remnants of 3,063 prey items were identified, of which 97.5% were small mammals, belonging to 21 species, while the remaining 2.5% were birds, frogs and insects. Mammal prey items consisted of Cricetidae 41%, Muridae 31% and Soricidae 28%, and in some samples, we found the remnants of European Mole (Talpa europaea), Kuhl’s Pipistrelle (Pipistrellus kuhlii), Hazel Dormouse (Muscardinus avellanarius) and Least Weasel (Mustela nivalis). Small mammal species were classified into four functional groups based on their preferences for urban, open, forest or wetland habitats. We investigated whether their relative abundances match with the proportions of the four habitat types in the assumed Barn Owl hunting ranges (cca. 2 km radius circle) in five sample sites. The relative abundance of small mammal species preferring urban habitats showed concordance with the proportion of the appropriate habitat types in the hunting area in two samples, while such concordance was proved for species favouring open, forest and wetland habitats just in one out of five samples. Small mammal functional groups represented in the prey composition do not directly correspond to the proportion of their typical habitats. We conclude that the abundance of various prey types is not suitable for characterising the landscape within the Barn Owl’s hunting range. © 2019, BirdLife Hungary. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: To further knowledge of the physiology of opioid receptors in birds, the structure and expression of the μ-, δ-, and κ-opioid receptor genes were studied in a peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), a snowy owl (Bubo scandiacus), and a blue-fronted Amazon parrot (Amazona aestiva). Tissue samples were obtained from birds that had been euthanatized for poor release prognosis or medical reasons. Samples were taken from the brain (telencephalon, thalamus, pituitary gland, cerebellum, pons, medulla oblongata, mesencephalon), the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglions, and plantar foot skin. Messenger RNA was recovered, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to generate complementary DNA (cDNA) sequences. Gene structures were documented by directly comparing cDNA sequences with recently published genomic sequences for the peregrine falcon and the blue-fronted Amazon parrot or by comparisons with genomic sequences of related species for the snowy owl. Structurally, the avian μ-opioid receptor messenger RNA (mRNA) species were complex, displaying differential splicing, alternative stop codons, and multiple polyadenylation signals. In comparison, the structure of the avian κ-receptor mRNA was relatively simple. In contrast to what is seen in humans, the avian δ-receptor mRNA structure was found to be complex, demonstrating novel 3-prime coding and noncoding exons not identified in mammals. The role of the δ-opioid receptor merits further investigation in avian species. © 2018 by the Association of Avian Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Birds, due to their multiple colourful displays, constitute a classic paradigm for the study of colour evolution. Although avian eyes are remarkably coloured, the functional basis behind inter-specific variability in iris colouration remains poorly understood. Owls are an ideal system to shed light on the role of ecology in promoting iris colour evolution as they show inter-specific variation in iris colour and in niche specialization with some species being strictly nocturnal and others active during the day. Owls perching for hunting at night might be unnoticed by both predators and their prey if they had dark irises, which would predict that dark irises were more likely to evolve in strictly nocturnal species than in diurnal ones. Using phylogenetic comparative models, we tested the camouflage hypothesis for eye colour. The proportion of dark-eyed owl species is higher among strictly nocturnal owls than among diurnal ones. Ancestral state reconstruction revealed that the owl ancestor of the family Strigidae was more likely bright-irided whereas the ancestor of the family Tytonidae was more likely dark-irided. Our results show robust support for the coevolution of iris coloration and nocturnality in the owls, and suggest that shifting to a nocturnal niche would be a prerequisite leading to the evolution of dark eyes in owls. The specific evolutionary pathway by which iris coloration and activity rhythm coevolve, however, remains to be investigated further as we have found only partial support for the idea that dark irises in birds might be an adaptive feature evolved due to the selective advantage of concealment from undesired visual receptors. © 2018 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Owls are a master to achieve silent flight in gliding and flapping flights under natural turbulent environments owing to their unique wing morphologies. While the leading-edge serrations are recently revealed, as a passive flow control micro-device, to play a crucial role in aerodynamic force production and sound suppression (Rao et al 2017 Bioinspiration Biomim. 12 1-13), the characteristics of wind-gust rejection associated with leading-edge serrations remain unclear. Here we address a large-eddy simulation-based study of aerodynamic robustness in owl-inspired leading-edge serrations, which is conducted with clean and serrated wing models through mimicking wind-gusts under a longitudinal fluctuation in free-stream inflow and a lateral fluctuation in pitch angle over a broad range of angles of attack (AoAs) over 0° Φ 20°. Our results show that the leading-edge serration-based passive flow control mechanisms associated with laminar-turbulent transition work effectively under fluctuated inflow and wing pitch, indicating that the leading-edge serrations are of potential gust fluctuation rejection or robustness in aerodynamic performance. Moreover, it is revealed that the tradeoff between turbulent flow control (i.e. aero-acoustic suppression) and force production in the serrated model holds independently to the wind-gust environments: poor at lower AoAs but capable of achieving equivalent aerodynamic performance at higher AoAs >15° compared to the clean model. Our results reveal that the owl-inspired leading-edge serrations can be a robust micro-device for aero-acoustic control coping with unsteady and complex wind environments in biomimetic rotor designs for various fluid machineries. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: This study presents an account of the diet of barn owls Tyto alba (Scopoli) which fed mainly on two invasive species in County Cork, Ireland during a one-year period. Greater white-toothed shrew Crocidura russula (Hermann) (68%) and bank vole Myodes glareolus (Schreber) (18%) constituted 86% of diet by number and 76% by biomass. Among indigenous species, numbers of brown rats Rattus norvegicus (Berkenhout) (2.8%), field mice Apodemus sylvaticus (Linnaeus) (9.6%), house mice Mus domesticus (Linnaeus) (1.2%) and a single pygmy shrew Sorex minutus Linnaeus (0.2%) formed a combined total of only 13.8% among the total of 508 rodent and shrew prey items recovered and identified. Barn owls preyed almost exclusively on invasive species as soon as they became estab­lished in the environment, the greater white-toothed shrew being an important prey species in all seasons of the year. © Royal Irish Academy.

ABSTRACT: Although studies on many owl species diets are common, there are only scarce data on the diet of the boreal owl from the lowlands of Eastern Europe. We have therefore studied its diet in one of the most important Polish population areas, the Knyszyńska Forest (north-eastern Poland). Pellets were gathered between February and June in 2006, 2012-2016 from tree hollows and the ground underneath. Altogether 178 pellets and six sets of pellet fragments were collected from 19 different sites. Eight mammal and eight bird species were identified among the 213 prey items found in the gathered material. Small mammals dominated, both in prey number (88.3%) and biomass (85.1%). Bank vole proved to be the main prey (over 40% of prey numbers), while Microtus voles (27.3%), small passerine birds (11.7%) and shrews (7.5%) were important alternative prey. Diet range proved to be similar to other sites in Europe. © 2018 Tomasz Tumiel et al., published by Sciendo 2018.

ABSTRACT: Modern astrophysics heavily relies on Web services to expose most of the data coming from many different instruments and researches worldwide. The virtual observatory (VO) has been designed to allow scientists to locate, retrieve and analyze useful information among those heterogeneous data. The use of ontologies has been studied in the VO context for astrophysical concerns like object types or astrophysical services subjects. On the operative point of view, ontological description of astrophysical services for interoperability and querying still has to be considered. In this paper, we design a global ontology (Astrophysical Services ONtology, ASON) based on web Ontology Language for Services (OWL-S) to enhance existing astrophysical services description. By expressing together VO specific and non-VO specific services design, it will improve the automation of services queries and allow automatic composition of heterogeneous astrophysical services. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Birds exhibit variation in fear behaviour in response to an approaching human within and between species and across different habitat contexts. We analyze urban and rural burrowing owls’ variation in risk perception along separate but consecutive days (Treatment 1) and risk perception within the same day (Treatment 2). Fear behaviour was measured as flight initiation distances (FIDs) and aggressiveness level when a pedestrian approached repeatedly to an owl individual. We predict that the attenuation in fear response along treatments should add support to the habituation hypothesis (decrease the response to a repeatedly stimulus after verifying that it is irrelevant) while consistency in behaviour might be indicative of a personality trait. We found that FID decreased for measurements made on both treatments in rural owls and also in urban owls for Treatment 2. These results are compatible with a habituation process. We found that aggressiveness remained invariable along treatments in both habitats suggesting that different mechanisms underlie these behavioural responses. Our results suggest that owls’ risk perception to humans can be adjusted based on environmental risk perception and that individuals are able to recognize and learn when a stimuli stops being a threat. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Many children learn about and experience animals in the everyday environment where they live and attend school. One way to obtain information about children’s understanding of concepts or phenomena is by using their drawings in combination with written responses or interviews. This study assesses how much Slovenian students 10–15 years old (in sixth to ninth grade) know about owls by analysing their drawings and written responses. The study included 473 students. From assessing students’ drawings and written responses, it can be concluded that the respondents had some knowledge of owls’ appearance, their behaviours, diet and habitats. The differences between students in different grades regarding the representations of owls was not statistically significant. Some students had misconceptions about owls, such as the idea that owls can turn their heads 360 degrees, or they confused the long ear-tufts with external parts of the ears. The students’ written responses provided additional information on their ideas about owls; particularly about owls’ specific behaviours, diet, and conservational status. However, some information, such as depicting owls’ body parts and body proportions or their habitats, was more clearly depicted with drawings. One third of the students drew owls in trees and forests, which makes owls good candidates for promoting forest conservation. © 2018, © 2018 Royal Society of Biology.

ABSTRACT: The motion of wing joints is a critical factor for successful flight in avian patients, but little information is available about goniometry in birds. Elbow and carpus joints in flexed and extended positions from 10 orthopedically normal wings of 6 adult wild barred owls (Strix varia) were evaluated with the animals under general anesthesia using a modified universal plastic goniometer and an electrogoniometer. These measurements were compared to those obtained using radiographic assessment. Intra-and interobserver reliability was calculated. Measurements in live animals were compared to those obtained from frozen-thawed carcasses. Results showed that the modified universal plastic goniometer can be used to obtain accurate results for elbow flexion and extension and for carpal flexion with good to excellent reliability compared to measurements collected from radiographic assessment. Measurements obtained using an electrogoniometer were less accurate and less reliable than those obtained with a plastic goniometer, possibly because of the size and configuration of the model used. Comparison of measurements from live animals and carcasses revealed no significant differences between mean measurements and suggested that further evaluation of carcasses as a model for study of goniometry measurements in avian wing joints should be considered. © 2018 by the Association of Avian Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Sexing of barn owls, Tyto alba javanica, using morphological traits has not been accurate enough due to ambiguous sexual dimorphism between sexes. This has been one of the major problems for the management of barn owls worldwide, especially for translocation and captive-breeding programs. In order to increase the success rate of sexing the barn owl, we compared the results of a molecular sexing method to six morphological traits for sexing the owls: the shape and colour of the facial disc, the colour of the throat area, the tail plumage, the colour of their tarsus, the back plumage, and the frequency of spotting on the chest and underside of the wings. The result of our comparison showed that sex identification using morphological traits had an accuracy of only 72.7%. Three of our samples were identified as females using morphological traits, but molecular sexing determined that these samples were males. We also used our results to determine the best morphological traits for sexing barn owls, and concluded that the best traits for morphological sexing are the frequency of spotting on the chest and underparts of barn owls (accuracy of 81.8%), as well as colour of the owls' facial disc and throat area (accuracy of 63.6%). © 2018 Shakinah Ravindran et al., published by Sciendo 2018.

ABSTRACT: At present, urban areas cover almost 3% of the Earth's land surface, and this proportion is constantly increasing along with human population growth. Although urbanization leads to biodiversity decline, at the same time it creates a novel and extensive environment that is exploited by whole assemblages of organisms. These include predators, which use the matrix of different habitat types within the urban environment for breeding and/or foraging. This study investigated how attributes of the urban landscape influence the distribution pattern of a nocturnal acoustic predator, the Tawny Owl Strix aluco. The probability of occurrence of this species was correlated with the presence of natural forests, and the increasing size of wooded habitat patches within the urban landscape; however, Tawny Owls were less likely to occur at sites with high noise levels at night. Our study suggests that the distribution pattern of acoustic predators is shaped by the availability of primary habitat but reduced by noise intensity (which may decrease hunting efficiency). The Tawny Owl is a top predator in the urban environment and its presence/absence may therefore affect populations of other species; this provides clear evidence of the indirect effect of noise pollution on animal populations inhabiting urban environments. © 2017 British Ornithologists’ Union

ABSTRACT: The diet composition and dietary patterns of the Long-eared Owl Asiootus were studied in Mediterranean agrosystems in central Crete (Greece) over the winters of 2009-2015. Overall, 2,819 prey items were recovered from 1,207 pellets, belonging to six taxa of mammals, 22 taxa of birds and four taxa of insects. Small mammals were the most common prey species, accounting for 75.8% by frequency and 79.7% by biomass, followed by birds (23.2% and 20.1%); the latter being rather an island component compared to continental regions. The House Mouse Mus musculus was the most important prey species in the owl's diet (56.3%) ahead of the Wood Mouse apodemus sylvaticus (9.51%) and the Black Rat Rattus rattus (7.9%). The species proved to be a significant rodent predator in olive groves and vineyards during winter months, selecting Wood Mouse and young Black Rat more than expected. Long-eared Owl feeding ecology studies could lead to improved land management and agricultural practices in the rural landscapes of the Mediterranean. © The Ornithological Society of Japan 2019.

ABSTRACT: The present study was conducted on the os coaxe of adult Indian eagle owl. The os coxae of Indian eagle owl consisted of 3 bones namely ilium, ischium and pubis. All the three bones were fused and the space between the pelvic bones was occupied by lumbo-sacral mass. Ventrally, the bones did not unite with each other leaving pelvis open. Ilium was divided into pre-acetabular and post-acetabular parts. The dorsal surface of pre-acetabular part was concave whereas post-acetabular part was small and slightly convex. A very sharp and prominent crest was observed dorsally on either side of the lumbo-sacral mass. Anteriorly, the ventral surface of the ilium was flat and posteriorly, it presented renal fossa for the lodgment of the kidneys. The ischium was flat and somewhat triangular in outline. It formed a large sciatic foramen with ilium and a small obturator foramen with pubis. Pubis was a thin rib-like elongated bone situated along the ventral border of ischium and formed ischio-pubic incisures with the ventral border of ischium. There was no pectineal process at the anterior end of the pubis. The acetabulum was circular in outline and in the form of a foramen. A large triangular shaped anti-trochanter was observed in the caudo-dorsal aspect of acetabulum for articulation with trochanter major of the femur. © 2018 Exploratory Animal and Medical Research.

ABSTRACT: The Ural owl (Strix uralensis) is considered to be a habitat specialist preferring structurally heterogeneous old montane forests in Central Europe. Unlike the sympatric tawny owl (Strix aluco), the Ural owl is negatively affected by human activities in its forest habitats and usually avoids human settlements. Although the young birds and wintering adults show no strong dependence on the size of forest patches and their structure, there are only a few studies on the occurrence of this owl species in non-forest and urban habitats. Here we describe several observations of wintering Ural owls in south-eastern and south-western Slovakia outside the forests during the winter 2017/2018. The Ural owls were recorded in agricultural country, but not infrequently also in human settlements. © 2018 Michal Baláž et al., published by Sciendo 2018.

ABSTRACT: Capsule: A questionnaire identified 1196 raptor monitoring species schemes within 236 monitoring programmes across 37 countries. Aims: To assess the level of monitoring of status/trends of raptors across Europe, to produce a web-based inventory of activities. Methods: A questionnaire promoted by voluntary national coordinators assessed monitoring coverage, focusing on breeding populations. Results: One thousand one hundred and ninety-six species schemes (236 monitoring programmes; 90% active in 2012) were reported from 37 countries. Sixty per cent of schemes were of over 10 years duration and nine countries ran schemes of over 40 years duration. Nineteen species had at least one scheme in 10 or more countries, and 15 species had schemes that ran for over 10 years. Thirteen species had breeding monitoring schemes in over 50% of countries where they breed, including widespread species (e.g. Peregrine Falcon Falco peregrinus) and localized species (e.g. Rough-legged Buzzard Buteo lagopus). Lanner Falcon Falco biarmicus, Levant Sparrowhawk Accipiter brevipes and Booted Eagle Hieraaetus pennatus had the least representative coverage, and four rare species had no coverage. Coverage was more representative in north and west Europe than further south and east. Coverage was more representative for widespread species and those with more favourable conservation status. Conclusions: Large potential exists to enhance reporting on status/trends, ecotoxicology analyses and volunteer-based monitoring at the pan-European scale. National coordinators provide an ideal network to develop and disseminate best practice guidance across Europe. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: In this study, the results of a long-term nest box installation program of the Common Barn-owl Tyto alba (Scopoli, 1769) in Southern Hungary were evaluated, which program was conducted during a 24-year period (1995– 2018). The percentages of occupied nest boxes ranged from 9.72 to 73.44% in the first breeding periods while this varied between 0 and 41.46% in the case of repeated clutches in the same nest boxes with second broods. A total of 1,265 breeding attempts were recorded including 1,020 (80.63%) in the first and 245 (19.36%) in the second breeding periods, from which a total of 210 (16.6%) clutches did not produce any fledglings. The modal clutch size was 7 eggs in both first and second annual clutches. However, the value of productivity was higher in the case of larger clutch sizes and we found significant linear relationship between initial clutch size and fledgling production per nesting attempt in both breeding periods. Significant variation of reproductive parameters was observed among the years. The proportion of egg loss showed significant decline, while the change of hatching success and the variation of annual productivity showed significant slight positive linear trend during the 24 years. Our results suggested that despite the outlier values of reproduction characteristics in the extreme years with negative effect, a relatively stable Common Barn-owl population can be maintained by the placement of nest boxes in the investigated region. © 2019, BirdLife Hungary.

ABSTRACT: Collisions with vehicles can contribute significantly to overall mortality in many species. We aim to clarify causal factors affecting Barn Owl (Tyto alba) mortality along roads in the Province of Friesland, The Netherlands. Although Barn Owl road casualties have received a lot of attention in the past, relationships with food availability and road design have not been clarified. We quantified breeding densities and reproduction rates, and combined these with road casualty records and characterization of road design. We obtained 996 ring-recoveries of Barn Owls (1994–2009), all of which were found dead in Friesland. All locations were accurate to within 100 meters. Along three routes with minor and major roads we made an inventory of road, verge, and hinterland typology. In two other datasets (539 and 461 birds) we analyzed the relationships between road mortality, body mass, and sex ratio. More than 70% of all owl casualties were in their first year of life and 15% in the second year. The highest mortality was in autumn and winter. Sex ratios were equal (232 males, 229 females). Although casualties were on average lighter than live-caught control birds, many of the traffic victims were in good condition. In years of high owl productivity, road mortality was strongly reduced. The number of road victims on major roads was significantly higher than on other road types. Highway junctions and highway-secondary road junctions contributed significantly to the spatial clustering of owl mortality. We conclude that in years when prey availability in the agricultural fields is high, roads/verges are not favored as hunting grounds. Therefore, the best option to reduce owl traffic victims is to improve the quality of farmland as foraging areas, and secondly to make design adjustments at major junctions to reduce owl-traffic collisions. © 2018 by the author(s).

ABSTRACT: We examined the pellets of the Barn Owl Tyto alba, collected in Pisa, Italy, in 2012. Altogether, 219 specimens of small mammals were found in 85 pellets. The Barn Owl diet was composed of ten species of small mammals, representing three different families (Muridae, Cricetidae, Soricidae). The main prey species was the Wood Mouse Apodemus sylvaticus, followed by the House Mouse Mus musculus and the Savi's Pine Vole Microtus savii. While the smallest of the small mammals from the area, the Etruscan Shrew Suncus etruscus, was well represented in the pellets, some larger species of small mammals were not represented at all. The reason for such result may lie in the upper limit for our Barn Owl's prey size. Results suggest that optimal prey weight for our Barn Owl may be between 26-75 g of body mass, however, the prey can be occasionally as heavy as almost 100 g, represented by adult Rat Rattus spp. Nevertheless, our results may not reflect the true hunting strategy of the Barn Owl, but the availability of a certain food item at one point in time. © 2018 Tjaša Zagoršek, published by Sciendo 2018.

ABSTRACT: To resolve conflicts of interest, animals can vocally signal their resource-holding potential and motivation to compete. This allows conspecifics to adjust their behaviour to each other without fighting physically. Making sure that competitors correctly assess each other's vocal information requires mechanisms to prevent signal interference. Alternating calls with those of an opponent (i.e. waiting until the opponent's call has ended before starting to vocalize) is widely observed in animals and could be partly acquired through learning. Regardless of whether competitors interrupt conspecifics as a signal of dominance or by accident, the information transferred by the interrupted individual is likely to be partly blurred. Interrupted individuals would hence benefit from counterattacking by calling more intensely, indicating to their competitors that calling simultaneously is counterproductive. We tested this 'social feedback’ hypothesis in the barn owl, Tyto alba, in which young siblings negotiate vocally over which individual will have priority access to the next food item delivered. It has already been shown that nestlings actively avoid interrupting each other, but it remains untested whether nestlings give social feedback when interrupted. To test this, we developed an ‘automated interactive playback’ which broadcast calls that either interrupted or did not interrupt the calls of a singleton nestling. When a playback call interrupted a nestling, this individual immediately intensified vocal communication by quickly producing a long call and by producing more calls. As previously shown, this reaction tends to silence competitors and thereby increases the individual's likelihood of obtaining the next food item. Such social feedback could reinforce the evolutionary stability of vocal sibling negotiation as a nonaggressive way to share food. © 2018

ABSTRACT: Life history traits differ between organisms living in the tropics, Northern and Southern Hemispheres, and sexual selection is thought to be stronger close to the equator than in temperate regions. Although birds are often supposed to be more brightly coloured in the tropics, the current evidence of geographic variation in the intensity of sexual selection and sex-specific natural selection is equivocal. Whether sex-specific traits signal aspects of individual quality better in the tropics than in the temperate regions of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres therefore remains an open question. We examined predictions of this hypothesis in the Tytonidae family (barn owls and their relatives) because females, on average, display larger black spots on the tip of their ventral body feathers than males, and this trait is associated with aspects of individual quality. We measured the size of melanic spots and the wing length of 7893 Tytonidae skins collected worldwide and preserved in natural history museums. The covariation between spot size and wing length was stronger in females than in males, in large- than small-spotted Tyto taxa and close to the equator than in temperate regions. This suggests that selection for spot size, which can be used by owls as an additional cue to assess individual body size and other aspects of phenotypic quality, is stronger in females than in males, particularly near the equator. © 2018 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

ABSTRACT: Eavesdropping is a widespread behaviour among animals, providing the receiver with valuable information to assess the habitat, resources or threats. This kind of behaviour has been reported for the burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia), which in its northern range lives in close association with fossorial mammals and eavesdrops on their alarm calls as indicators of risk. In their southernmost range, burrowing owls do not associate with mammals, but they are often found sharing foraging and nesting patches with the southern lapwing (Vanellus chilensis), a noisy, territorial and aggressive plover species. We designed a field experimental study aimed at determining if burrowing owls are able to use lapwing calls as indicator of potential risk. We exposed focal owls to a sequence of sounds including lapwing alarm calls, and biological and non-biological controls, and registered their response as alert or relax behaviours. Linear mixed modeling showed that owls increased their alert behaviour in response to lapwing alarm calls but not in response to control treatments. In addition, owls’ response was consistent between habitats (rural and urban) and seasons (breeding and non-breeding). Our results suggest that eavesdropping is a generalized strategy of burrowing owls to acquire environmental information throughout its distribution range. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: This study reports two clinical cases of avian haemosporidian infection caused by a Haemoproteus sp., involving a snowy owl (Bubo scandiacus) and a goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), at a zoo. The snowy owl died after presenting with anorexia, depression and lethargy. A blood smear with Wright’s staining confirmed Haemoproteus infection. Necropsy of the snowy owl revealed hypertrophy of the internal organs, including the liver, gallbladder, kidney and adrenal glands. The goshawk showed anorexia, depression and a lowered head position, and was diagnosed with a Haemoproteus infection based on a blood smear. The goshawk was completely cured by treatment with a combination of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride. Both cases showed decreased erythrocytes, hemoglobin and hematocrit values on complete blood count. © 2018 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: Patterns of winter irruptions in several owl species apparently follow the ‘lack of food’ hypothesis, which predicts that individuals leave their breeding grounds in search of food when prey populations do not allow breeding and are too small to ensure survival. Recent analyses, however, suggest an alternative mechanism dubbed the ‘breeding success’ hypothesis, which predicts that winter irruptions might instead be the result of a very successful breeding season, with a large pool of young birds subsequently migrating south from the breeding grounds. Here we assessed age-class (juvenile vs. non-juvenile) composition of winter irruptive Snowy Owls Bubo scandiacus over a 25-year period (winter 1991–1992 to 2015–2016) between regular (North American Prairies and Great Plains) and irregular wintering areas (northeastern North America) using live-trapped individuals and high-resolution images of individual owls. Our results show that the proportion of juveniles (birds less than 1 year of age) varies considerably annually but is positively correlated with irruption intensity in both regions. In irregular wintering areas, it can constitute the majority (up to more than 90%) of winter irruptive Snowy Owls over a large geographical area. These results are consistent with the idea that large winter irruptions at temperate latitudes are not the result of adults massively leaving the Arctic in search of food after a breeding failure but are more likely to be a consequence of good reproductive conditions in the Arctic that create a large pool of winter migrants. © 2018 British Ornithologists’ Union

ABSTRACT: Elucidating the differential use of resources by animals is fundamental to both understanding ecological processes and making informed conservation decisions. Such information is particularly important for poorly studied species that may be dependent upon heavily exploited resources. We examine habitat selection of the Northern Pygmy-Owl (Glaucidium gnoma), which is thought to depend upon mature forests, but for which information on habitat use is scant. We conducted our study in northern Idaho and western Montana, and used the synoptic model of space use. We obtained sufficient location data to include 27 radio-tagged owls in the study (16 in Idaho and 11 in Montana). To evaluate habitat selection, we developed 36 models in Idaho and 24 models in Montana, each with different combinations of habitat covariates hypothesized to influence Northern Pygmy-Owl space use. Covariates representing larger tree size were statistically significant ( ≥ 3.01, t ≥ 2.7, P ≤ 0.02) predictors of space use in the best-supported population-level models in both Idaho and Montana. In addition, the distance-to-stream covariate was a statistically significant ( = -3.60, t = -3.3, P = 0.005) predictor of the probability of use in the best-supported population-level model in Idaho, but not in the best-supported Montana model ( = -0.08, t =0.03, P = 0.98). Owls selected forested areas with larger tree sizes and (in Idaho) selected areas closer to stream courses. Differences between the two study areas in the apparent importance of stream proximity to habitat selection may reflect differences in timber harvest practices and the amount of coniferous vegetation; however, this hypothesis should be addressed with additional research. © 2018 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Collisions between wildlife and aircraft (wildlife strikes) pose notable risks. Previous research has found that a variety of birds and mammals are involved in wildlife strikes, but no comprehensive evaluation of collisions between owl and aircraft (owl strikes) has been conducted. We queried the Federal Aviation Administration's National Wildlife Strike Database (from 1 January 1990 to 30 June 2014) and the US Air Force's Birdstrike Database (from 1 January 1994 to 30 June 2014) to characterize owl strikes. We found 2531 owl strikes involving at least 20 species of owls. Barn Owls (Tyto alba) were the most frequently struck species, accounting for 42% of all reported owl strikes. Almost 75% of owl strikes occurred during the night. Owl strikes typically occurred within the airfield environment itself, and 86% of owl strikes occurred when the aircraft was at or below 30 m above ground level. Some mitigation tools and techniques (e.g., nonlethal hazing, translocation, lethal removal) can reduce the frequency of owl strikes, but the efficacy of these methods remains unevaluated. An important area of future research will involve the development and evaluation of effective, publicly acceptable methods of reducing human-owl conflicts. © 2018 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: We present the results of long-slit echelle spectroscopy and deep narrow-band imaging of the Owl Nebula (NGC 3587), obtained at the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional, San Pedro Mártir. These data allow us to construct an isovelocity data cube and develop a 3D morphokinematic model. We find that, instead of the previously assumed bipolar dumbbell shape, the inner cavity consists of multipolar fingers within an overall tripolar structure. We identify three additional planetary nebulae that show very similar morphologies and kinematics to the Owl, and propose that these constitute a new class of strigiform (owl-like) nebulae. Common characteristics of the strigiform nebulae include a double-shell (thin outside thick) structure, low-luminosity and high-gravity central stars, the absence of a present-day stellar wind, and asymmetric inner cavities, visible in both optical and mid-infrared emission lines, that show no evidence for surrounding bright rims. The origin of the cavities is unclear, but they may constitute relics of an earlier stage of evolution when the stellar wind was active. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.

ABSTRACT: Most approaches for assessing species vulnerability to climate change have focused on direct impacts via abiotic changes rather than indirect impacts mediated by changes in species interactions. Changes in rainfall regimes may influence species interactions from the bottom-up by increasing primary productivity in arid environments, but subsequently lead to less predictable top-down effects. Our study demonstrates how the effects of an EL Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-driven rainfall pulse ricochets along a chain of interactions between marine and terrestrial food webs, leading to enhanced predation of a vulnerable marine predator on its island breeding grounds. On Santa Barbara Island, barn owls (Tyto alba) are the main predator of a nocturnal seabird, the Scripps's murrelet (Synthliboramphus scrippsi), as well as an endemic deer mouse. We followed the links between rainfall, normalized difference vegetation index and subsequent peaks in mouse and owl abundance. After the mouse population declined steeply, there was approximately 15-fold increase in the number of murrelets killed by owls. We also simulated these dynamics with a mathematical model and demonstrate that bottom-up resource pulses can lead to subsequent declines in alternative prey. Our study highlights the need for understanding how species interactions will change with shifting rainfall patterns through the effects of ENSO under global change. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Summary. Factors that influence the distribution and abundance of the endemic and threatened owls of the Andaman Islands have not been assessed, in contrast to those affecting diurnal birds. Such studies would assist in prioritising habitats that have high conservation importance for owls. We evaluated the status and species composition of owls along c. 343km of the Andaman Trunk Road, employing one-time point counts between December 2013 and April 2015. We conducted spontaneous listening, broadcasting of conspecific calls and spotlight searches as survey protocols. The pointcentred quarter method was used to evaluate the habitat at each count site. We recorded five owl species whose mean abundance was 2.09 owls/point. Species richness and abundance were greater in unlogged sites and deciduous forests. Habitat differences between owl species were noted according to land use, cover type and intensity of logging activity. However, these factors had no significant effect on the abundance of Oriental Scops-owl and Hume's Boobook, but were significant for Andaman Boobook and Andaman Scops-owl. Mean understory height, tree height and grass cover positively influenced the owl species richness and abundance. The Andaman Boobook and Andaman Scops-owl appeared stenotopic in habitat use and in contrast to the eurytopic Oriental Scops-owl and Hume's Boobook. A review of the conservation status of Andaman Scops-owl and Andaman Boobook is suggested bearing in mind their low abundance, restricted distribution and less preference for altered habitats. © Author(s) 2019.All right reserved.

ABSTRACT: Even though intra-guild predators frequently prey on the same species, it is unclear whether diet overlap between two predators is a source of interspecific competition or whether predators simply use the same abundant prey resource. We measured the extent to which the diets of barn owls (Tyto alba) and long-eared owls (Asio otus) in Israel overlap and examined whether yearly differences in diet overlap correlate with barn owl breeding success. Pianka’s index of niche overlap was positively related to barn owl population size but not to its breeding success. The number of breeding barn owls was higher when long-eared owls consumed more rodents, suggesting that diet overlap most likely increased when rodents became more abundant. Therefore, in Israel, when these two owl species prey more often on rodents, their diets are more similar and interspecific competition is reduced. Unlike sympatric populations in Europe, in years when rodents are less abundant in Israel long-eared owls switch to hunting alternative prey (e.g., birds), perhaps to avoid competition with barn owls. © 2018, The Society of Population Ecology and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Few studies have examined the patterns of co-occurrence between diurnal birds such as woodpeckers and nocturnal birds such as owls, which they may facilitate. Flammulated Owls (Psiloscops flammeolus) and Northern Saw-whet Owls (Aegolius acadicus) are nocturnal, secondary cavity-nesting birds that inhabit forests. For nesting and roosting, both species require natural cavities or, more commonly, those that woodpeckers create. Using day and nighttime broadcast surveys (n = 150 locations) in the Rocky Mountain biogeographic region of Idaho, USA, we surveyed for owls and woodpeckers to assess patterns of co-occurrence and evaluated the hypothesis that forest owls and woodpeckers co-occurred more frequently than expected by chance because of the facilitative nature of their biological interaction. We also examined co-occurrence patterns between owl species to understand their possible competitive interactions. Finally, to assess whether co-occurrence patterns arose because of species interactions or selection of similar habitat types, we used canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to examine habitat associations within this cavity-nesting bird community. We found that Flammulated Owls co-occurred more with Hairy Woodpeckers (Picoides villosus), Northern Saw-whet Owls co-occurred with Northern Flickers (Colaptes auratus) and Red-naped Sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus nuchalis) and, when primary excavators were considered as a group, each species of owl was positively associated with the presence of woodpeckers. The owl species were distributed independently of one another suggesting a lack of competitive interactions. The CCA had relatively low explanatory power but suggested that habitat associations alone did not explain the patterns of positive co-occurrence we observed: Flammulated Owls and Hairy Woodpeckers associated with different habitats and Northern Saw-whet Owls, Northern Flickers, and Red-naped Sapsuckers appeared as habitat generalists. We interpret these patterns of co-occurrence and habitat use as evidence that woodpeckers facilitate presence of these species of owl and suggest management for forest owls could also include focus on the diurnal species with which they appear to associate. © 2018 by the author(s).

ABSTRACT: A major task for researchers in the twenty-first century is to predict how climate-mediated stressors such as wildfires may affect biodiversity under climate change. Previous model predictions typically did not address non-stationarity in climate-fire relationships across time and space. In this study, we applied spatially-explicit non-stationary area burned projection models to evaluate recent and future climate-driven trends in area burned across the ranges of three spotted owl subspecies in the western United States. We also used high-severity fire probability models to evaluate the risk of high-severity fire in recent times. Results suggest that the proportion of area burned will increase within the range of all three subspecies under climate change, but the extent of that increase will vary both among subspecies and among ecoregions within subspecies. Similarly, the current risk of high-severity wildfire varies both among subspecies and among regions within subspecies. The Mexican spotted owl is expected to have a 13-fold increase in area burned within its range by the 2080s. The combination of increased climate-driven fire extent and risk of high-severity fire suggests a potential for large-scale future loss or modification of spotted owl habitat. We recommend conducting further studies to understand the interaction and synergistic effects of climate change and wildfire on the spotted owl, especially in regions that are understudied such as Mexico. © 2019 Wan, Cushman and Ganey.

ABSTRACT: Animal home ranges are typically characterized by their size, shape and a given time interval and can be affected by many different biotic and abiotic factors. Understanding of animal movements and assessing the size of their home ranges are essential topics in ecology and necessary for effective species protection, especially concerning birds of prey. Using radio-telemetry (VHF; 2.1 g tail-mounted tags) we studied the movements of two Tengmalm's owl (Aegolius funereus) males during the breeding season 2008 in a mountain area of Central Europe (the Czech Republic, the Jizera Mountains: 50° 50' N, 15° 16' E). We determined their average nocturnal hunting and diurnal roosting home range sizes. The mean hunting home range size calculated according to the 90% fixed kernel density estimator was 251.1 ± 43.2 ha (± SD). The mean roosting home range size calculated according to the 100% minimum convex polygon method was 57.9 ± 15.8 ha (± SD). The sizes of hunting home ranges during breeding in this study coincide with those previously reported by other studies focusing on Tengmalm's owl males. However, we found the roosting home ranges were smaller in size compared to those previously reported. This result was most probably connected with different habitat structure in our study area, which was severally damaged by air-pollution in the past, thus probably offering fewer suitable hiding-places, for instance from predators. We found the roosting locations were concentrated in the oldest and densest Norway spruce forest patches. We emphasize that these parts of forest stands require the highest possible protection in our study area. © 2018 Marek Kouba et al., published by Sciendo 2018.

ABSTRACT: Objective: A complete and accurate understanding of extraocular muscle function is important to the veterinary care of the avian eye. This is especially true for birds of prey, which rely heavily on vision for survival and yet are prone to ocular injury and disease. To better understand the function of extraocular muscles in birds of prey, we studied extraocular muscle architecture grossly and histologically. Animals studied: This sample was composed of two each of the following species: red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), Harris's hawk (Parabuteo unicinctus), great horned owl (Bubo virginianus), and barn owl (Tyto alba). Procedures: All extraocular muscles were dissected and weighed. To analyze muscle fiber architecture, the superior oblique and quadratus muscles were dissected, weighed, and sectioned at 5 μm thickness in the transverse plane. We calculated the physiologic cross-sectional area and the ratio of muscle mass to predicted effective maximum tetanic tension. Results and Conclusions: Hawk and owl extraocular muscles exhibit significant physiological differences that play roles in ocular movements and closure of the nictitating membrane. Owls, which do not exhibit extraocular movement, have muscle architecture suited to stabilize the position of a massive, tubular eye that protrudes significantly from the orbit. Hawks, which have a more globose eye that is largely contained within the orbit, do not require as much muscular stability and instead have muscle architecture that facilitates rapid eye movement. © 2018 American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists

ABSTRACT: Capsule: Voles are the main prey of the Ural Owl Strix uralensis in Europe, with larger prey and higher prey diversity being positively associated with owl breeding performance. Aims: To assess the breeding diet and its influence on the breeding performance of the Ural Owl across a north–south gradient of its European range using nest box monitoring data. Methods: Comparable monitoring of nest boxes in different biogeographical regions of Europe (Finland, Latvia, Slovenia) and diet analysis from nest samples to assess the taxonomic and trait influence of prey on owl breeding performance in different environments. Results: High plasticity in the Ural Owl hunting behaviour under different prey availability conditions resulted in significant differences between regions and years. Voles formed the highest proportion of the diet in all studied regions. Owl brood size was positively associated by higher proportions of voles and mice in the diet, and with increasing proportions of seasonally available larger prey and consequently prey diversity. Brood size was negatively associated with the proportion of non-mammalian and predominantly forest-living prey. Conclusions: The study highlighted the importance of comparative studies of raptor ecology across their geographical ranges in different environmental conditions to reveal undiscovered patterns, which may go undetected when conducting studies at the regional scale only. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Although many Western Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia hypugaea) populations have been declining, a high-density population nests at the National Radio Transmission Facility (NRTF), Dixon, California. We compared density at NRTF to densities elsewhere, and nest-site use and reuse to available nest substrates. Breeding pairs numbered 24-44 per year, averaging 34 pairs on 83 ha, the fourth-highest on record. Occupancy of eight artificial nest sites installed in 2000 declined from six pairs in 2006 to one pair in 2007 and 2008, and none afterward. Nearest-neighbor distance among artificial nests averaged half the distance among nest sites in fossorial mammal burrows and concrete half-rounds covering aboveground power cables. Undisturbed clay soils supported pocket gophers (Thomomys bottae) but few ground squirrels (Spermophilus beecheyi), whereas disturbed soils supported both ground squirrels and Burrowing Owls. The presence of both ground squirrels and Burrowing Owls was associated with backfill soils over buried cable, cable covers, and areas where soils bordered impervious surfaces. Nest-site reuse was low, with only 12% of the sites occupied in all study years, 2006-2011. Most (78%) nest sites reused in a subsequent year involved nests in a different burrow or cable cover opening >1 m from the previous year's nest. We recommend research on whether concrete half-rounds might outperform buried utility boxes as artificial nests, especially in conjunction with efforts to conserve the fossorial mammals that naturally excavate burrows used by Burrowing Owls. © 2018 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: An adult great-horned owl (Bubo virginianus; GHOW) presented with a history of recurrent corneal ulceration of the right eye (OD). Findings included ulcerative superficial keratitis, proliferative conjunctivitis, and iris pigmentary changes. The ulcer was initially nonresponsive to medical therapy, but showed rapid and appropriate healing following diamond burr debridement. Proliferative conjunctivitis markedly improved following topical antiviral therapy with cidofovir 1%, interferon alpha 2B ophthalmic solutions, and oral l-lysine. Histopathologic evaluation of a conjunctival biopsy revealed epithelial features suspicious for viral cytopathic changes and intranuclear structures suspicious for viral inclusions, suggestive of a possible viral-induced papillomatous conjunctivitis. A novel alphaherpesvirus, referred to as Strigid Herpesvirus 1 (StrHV1), was identified using PCR and gene sequencing. This case represents a new clinical manifestation of a previously unreported herpesvirus in the GHOW. Identification of the herpes virus was critical to administration of appropriate therapy and resolution of the conjunctivitis, and corneal epithelial debridement promoted resolution of the chronic corneal epithelial defect. © 2018 American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists

ABSTRACT: Surprisingly little is known about the basic biology of many large raptor species. Zoos and wildlife rehabilitation centers can help remedy this knowledge gap by providing a wealth of data on species whose in situ counterparts are difficult to study. We present one such example here by recording multiple new longevity records for the Barred Owl (Strix varia Barton, 1799). At 34 years and 1 month of age, the longest-lived new record surpasses the previous oldest known individual by a decade. Along with the additional new and already available longevity data we reviewed, the information provided here will prove useful for those working on many aspects of owl biology. © 2018 Wilson Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: In this study, the mitogenome of Asio otus, the Northern Long-eared Owl, was analysed using Illumina next-generation sequencing. The mitogenome was found to be a circular molecule, 17,735 bp long with a slight AT bias (53.0%). The gene arrangement pattern was the same as that of a typical vertebrate, containing 37 genes (13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNA genes, two ribosomal RNA genes, and a non-coding control region). In the putative control region (1984 bp), there were two types of tandem repeats at the end of the region. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the 13 PCG sequences discovered in this study and those of that have been previously published of other Strigidae species and revealed a close relationship between A. otus and A. flammeus. The newly generated mitogenome from this study enriches the genomic resources available for future evolutionary studies and promotes conservation genetics of this species. © 2018 National Institute of Biological Resource.

ABSTRACT: Unusual ocular abnormalities were documented in 3 wild eastern screech owls (Megascops asio) presented to a wildlife rehabilitation hospital after vehicular strike-induced trauma to the head. All 3 had anterior uveitis and free air bubbles in the anterior chamber, but none of the cases had any discernable corneal damage, either grossly or with fluorescein stain technique. Perforation of the globe at the level of the scleral ossicle was considered a possible cause. All 3 cases recovered with standard treatment for anterior uveitis, and the free air was absorbed within 10-14 days and did not appear to cause any lingering complications. The owls were later released back into the wild after demonstrating the ability to navigate obstacles in a flight cage and capture live prey. © 2018 by the Association of Avian Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Herpesvirus (HV) was detected using PCR in the organs of eight of 55 wild owls (14.5%) from seven species that were found dead in various locations in Slovenia between 1995 and 2015. HV was detected in three species: the Eurasian eagle owl (Bubo bubo), Ural owl (Strix uralensis), and long-eared owl (Asio otus). Phylogenetic analysis of partial DNA polymerase gene nucleotide sequences showed that the detected HVs are similar to the avian and mammal alphaherpesviruses. Two sequences were very similar to known bird HV sequences. One sequence was identical to the columbid herpesvirus 1 (CoHV1) sequence, and the other was very similar to the gallid herpesvirus 2 (GaHV2) sequence. The phylogenetic tree revealed a lower similarity of the other six analyzed Slovenian sequences with the sequences of alphaherpesviruses of birds and mammals. This is the first study to report the detection of different HVs in owls. © 2019 American Association of Avian Pathologists.

ABSTRACT: We evaluated how differences between two empirical resistance models for the same geographic area affected predictions of gene flow processes and genetic diversity for the Mexican spotted owl (Strix occidentalis lucida). The two resistance models represented the landscape under low-and high-fragmentation parameters. Under low fragmentation, the landscape had larger but highly concentrated habitat patches, whereas under high fragmentation, the landscape had smaller habitat patches that scattered across a broader area. Overall habitat amount differed little between resistance models. We tested eight scenarios reflecting a factorial design of three factors: resistance model (low vs. high fragmentation), isolation hypothesis (isolation-by-distance, IBD, vs. isolation-by-resistance, IBR), and dispersal limit of species (200 km vs. 300 km). Higher dispersal limit generally had a positive but small influence on genetic diversity. Genetic distance increased with both geographic distance and landscape resistance, but landscape resistance displayed a stronger influence. Connectivity was positively related to genetic diversity under IBR but was less important under IBD. Fragmentation had a strong negative influence on the spatial patterns of genetic diversity and effective population size (Ns). Despite habitats being more concentrated and less widely distributed, the low-fragmentation landscape had greater genetic diversity than the high-fragmentation landscape, suggesting that highly concentrated but larger habitat patches may provide a genetic refuge for the Mexican spotted owl. © 2018 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Capsule: Monitoring of demographic parameters by volunteer ringers provides insight into the factors driving population changes in owls. Aims: To assess the value of national ringing, recapture and recovery data from volunteers to understand population dynamics. Methods: We analysed 49 years of ringing, recapture and recovery data from throughout Finland for Tawny Owls Strix aluco and Ural Owls Strix uralensis and compared them with annual population and productivity indices from other volunteer-based surveys. Results: Volunteer-based ringing data show that all aspects of the demography of Ural and Tawny Owls fluctuate dramatically in relation to an approximately three-year cycle of voles. When voles are abundant, a high proportion of owls breed and many young are produced; however, few of those young survive because vole populations crash the following winter. Survival of adults fluctuates less than that of young, suggesting that adults are better able to survive on alternative prey. In 2005, when vole populations remained high two years in row, many young were produced and survived, leading to a peak in owl breeding populations four years later at the top of the next vole cycle. This was immediately followed by a crash in populations suggesting a density-dependent interaction with vole abundance. Changing climate could affect owls both directly, by influencing winter survival, as well as indirectly through impacting prey availability. Conclusion: Encouraging similar, volunteer-based national-scale ringing efforts for owls elsewhere in Europe, especially for Tawny Owls which occur in most countries, would be a cost-effective way to understand how factors such as changing prey availability, climate and habitat availability are influencing the population levels of this and other raptors. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The risk of overestimating the number of nocturnal owls during a census is substantial when the territory density is high and no individual signature is available. The tawny owl voice was demonstrated to be individual, but no statistical technique evaluated to date is suitable for a census of this species. To overcome the problem, the combination of two methods is suggested in this study: (1) the Visual Spectrographic Comparison (VSC), a bioacoustics tool which tries to separate owls' voices classifying the spectrograms of their calls based on their visual characteristics, and (2) the extensively used technique of Mapping Method (MM). The technique was applied to a dense population of tawny owls living in an isolated deciduous wood of northern Italy. Fourteen territorial males were individuated in the area, resulting a density of 6.0 pairs/km2. Most of the home ranges seem to overlap substantially, an evidence not in step with the common idea of high territoriality of the species. Since the technique is believed to be exhaustive, a future monitoring of this population could be precise, cheap and very informative. This technique could be easily extended to other elusive species that show individual vocal cues. © 2018 Université Laval.

ABSTRACT: Variation in the diet of the Great Gray Owl, a specialist predator, at different levels of prey abundance in different biotopes was studied in the middle Transural region. Microtus voles were found to be the main prey, with shrews being alternative prey. In different plots, two types of change in the diet were observed during the nesting season: (1) substitution of Microtus voles inhabiting meadow biotopes by Microtus voles characteristic of forest habitats, and (2) substitution of the latter by shrews. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The dislodging effect of breaking waves is among the critically important factors structuring rocky intertidal communities. Because behavior is so difficult to study in the field, the interaction of wave force with behavior of intertidal organisms is poorly understood. Here, we present a field study of the interaction of breaking waves with the natural behavior of individuals of Lottia gigantea, an intertidal limpet with a complex territorial behavioral ecology. We hypothesized that limpets engaging in fast-moving territorial chase in response to intraspecific contact are more vulnerable to wash-off by a passing wave than are slowly foraging limpets that do not take part in such chase. We measured the lift force required to dislodge limpets while they were engaged in three natural behavioral responses to intraspecific contact in the field: 1.) continued foraging, 2.) retreat, and 3.) territorial pursuit. We divided the measured force-to-remove by aperture area to estimate resistance to wave-induced lift force, or tenacity. Tenacity (Newtons·cm−2) in slowly foraging limpets was 2–4 times stronger than previously reported for moving limpets (retreating at high speed from sea stars). Small foraging limpets showed stronger tenacity than did large limpets. Tenacity was significantly reduced by high-speed territorial and retreat responses, especially in small limpets. We compounded the wash-off probabilities of tenacity during the expected number of high-speed chases in the face of an entire year of reported waves at a nearby ocean buoy, and estimated that limpets should suffer substantially greater mortality (11.5%) than do limpets that refrain from all territorial chase (2.9%). Overall, these data support our hypothesis that dislodgement by breaking waves comprises a significant risk attendant to territorial chase. The fact that limpets nevertheless engage in these chases suggests that the resources gained by this behavior are substantial. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Circadian rhythms result from adaptations to biotic and abiotic environmental conditions that cycle through the day, such as light, temperature, or temporal overlap between interacting species. At high latitudes, close to or beyond the polar circles, uninterrupted midsummer daylight may pose a challenge to the circadian rhythms of otherwise nocturnal species, such as eagle owls Bubo bubo. By non-invasive field methods, we studied eagle owl activity in light of their interactions with their main prey the water vole Arvicola amphibius, and their competitor the white-tailed eagle Haliaeetus albicilla during continuous midsummer daylight on open, treeless islands in coastal northern Norway. We evaluated circadian rhythms, temporal overlap, exposure, and spatial distribution. The owls maintained a nocturnal activity pattern, possibly because slightly dimmer light around midnight offered favourable hunting conditions. The eagles were active throughout the 24-h period as opposed to the strictly diurnal rhythm reported elsewhere, thus increasing temporal overlap and the potential for interference competition between the two avian predators. This may indicate an asymmetry, with the owls facing the highest cost of interference competition. The presence of eagles combined with constant daylight in this open landscape may make the owls vulnerable to interspecific aggression, and contrary to the available literature, eagle owls rarely exposed themselves visually during territorial calls, possibly to avoid detection by eagles. We found indications of spatial segregation between owls and eagles reflecting differences in main prey, possibly in combination with habitat-mediated avoidance. Eagle owl vocal activity peaked in the evening before a nocturnal peak in visual observations, when owls were active hunting, consistent with the hypothesis of a dusk chorus in nocturnal bird species. The owls may have had to trade-off between calling and foraging during the few hours around midnight when slightly dimmer light reduced the detection risk while also providing better hunting conditions. © 2018 The Authors

ABSTRACT: During the years 2008–2014, we studied diet composition, the number of breeding pairs, and reproductive output of tawny owls in Central Europe (Czech Republic) in relation to availability of main prey in the field. We also performed a meta-analysis on diet composition of tawny owl in Europe that confirmed the important role of Apodemus mice in tawny owl diet in Central Europe. In concordance, Apodemus mice were the main prey of tawny owl in our study area (38.7%), and Microtus/Myodes voles (15.4%), birds (12.1%) and others (33.8%) were alternative prey. We found a positive relationship between the proportion of Apodemus mice in the diet and their abundance in the field (beta = 0.23, P = 0.001). Availability of main prey (Apodemus mice, Microtus/Myodes voles or Sorex shrews) in the field was not correlated with the number of breeding pairs. Proportion of birds in diet (expressed by scores from multivariate analysis), which was inversely related to proportion of Apodemus mice, was positively correlated with laying date (beta = 0.66, P = 0.012) and negatively correlated with clutch size (beta = − 0.45, P = 0.004) and brood size (beta = − 0.16, P = 0.076). We also found negative relationships between laying date and clutch size (beta = − 0.13, P = 0.014) and brood size (beta = − 0.07, P = 0.057). Our results support the idea that diet and breeding ecology of owls in Central Europe is mainly driven by the availability of Apodemus mice that are suitable prey due to their similar habitat requirements and nocturnal activity. © 2018, The Society of Population Ecology and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The present study was conducted on the tibiotarsus, fibula and tarsometatarsus of Indian eagle owl. Tibiotarsus was formed by the fusion of the distal end of the tibia with the proximal row of the tarsal bones. Proximal extremity presented large medial and a smaller lateral condyle. The lateral border of lateral condyle presented a facet for articulation with the head of the fibula. The proximal end of tibiotarsus possessed a sharp cranial cnemial crest and a lateral crest separated by inter-cnemial sulcus. Distal extremity presented large lateral and small medial condyles anteriorly which were separated by the inter-condyloid fossa. Extensor canal was seen immediately proximal to the condyles. Just below the lateral condyle, shaft presented a distinct fibular crest for the attachment of the shaft of the fibula. About the middle of the lateral surface there was presence of nutrient foramen. Fibula was much reduced bone. Body of the fibula had a rough area for attachment with fibular crest of tibiotarsus. Tarsometatarsus was formed by metatarsal bones II, III and IV which were fused with each other and with distal tarsal bones. Proximal extremity presented two concave articular facets for the condyles of tibiotarsus. On planter surface of proximal extremity hypotarsus was present hypotarsus. Shaft presented longitudinal lateral and medial crests on both dorsal and planter surfaces which were more prominent on planter surface. The distal extremity had three trochlea separated by two inter-trochlear clefts. Medial articular trochlear was at a higher level than middle and lateral. Medial inter-trochlear cleft was wider than the lateral cleft. © 2012. Exploratory Animal and Medical Research.

ABSTRACT: Landscape genetics investigations examine how the availability and configuration of habitat influence genetic structure of plants and animals. We used landscape genetics to evaluate the role that forest connectivity plays in determining genetic structure of the federally-threatened Northern Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) using genotypes of 339 Northern Spotted Owls obtained for 10 microsatellite loci. Spatial clustering analyses identified a distinct genetic cluster at the southern extent of the region examined. This cluster could not be linked to landscape connectivity patterns and suggested that post-Pleistocene processes were involved with its development rather than contemporary landscape configuration. We also compared matrices of pairwise inter-individual genetic distances with resistance distances derived from a circuit-theory based framework. Resistance distances were obtained for an idealized raster map that reflected continuous unimpeded dispersal habitat across the landscape along with five empirically-derived raster maps reflecting the 1870’s, 1940’s, 1986, 1994, and 2012. Resistance distances from the idealized map served as surrogates for linear geographic distances. Relative to idealized conditions, resistance distances were ~250% higher in the 1940’s and ~200% higher from 1986 onward. Resistance distances from the 1870’s were ~40% higher than idealized conditions. Inter-individual genetic distances were most highly correlated with resistance distances from the idealized map rather than any of the empirical maps. Two hypotheses explain our results. First, our results may reflect temporal lags between the onset of large-scale habitat alterations and their novel effects on genetic structure in long-lived species such as Northern Spotted Owls. Second, because Northern Spotted Owls disperse over long distances, our results may indicate that forest habitat has never been sufficiently fragmented to the point where connectivity was disrupted. The second hypothesis could indicate that forest management practices mandated by the Northwest Forest Plan succeeded with one of its primary goals. However, our results do not represent a complete portrayal of the status of Northern Spotted Owls given detection of significant population declines and bottlenecks in other studies. Future investigations based on computer simulations may help distinguish between hypotheses.

ABSTRACT: Between 2005 and 2015 I undertook eight trips to Jordan during which I collected pellets from seven owl species. In them 14,203 food items were identified. Mammals (Mammalia, 46 species, 37.9% of prey items) formed the most numerous component, invertebrates (Evertebrata) made up 33.4%, birds (Aves, 25.4%) were represented with at least 104 species, reptiles (Reptilia) came to 3.2%, and two species of amphibian were identified (Amphibia, 0.2%). Pharoah eagle owls (Bubo ascalaphus) and Byzantine eagle owls (Bubo bubo interpositus) primarily hunt larger mammals and birds, although Agamidae and Scorpiones were also represented more frequently among B. ascalaphus. Mammals predominated among tawny owls (Strix aluco wilkonskii) (Mammalia, 58.9%), mainly the eastern rock mouse (Apodemus mystacinus) (24.9%). For wintering long-eared owls Asio otus otus the most important food was small birds (Aves, 78.3%), especially house sparrows (Passer domesticus), Fringillidae and Sylviidae. For barn owls (Tyto alba erlangeri) the principal prey was small mammals (83.1%), mainly mice (Mus sp.), Günther's vole (Microtus guentheri), grey hamster (Cricetulus migratorius) and shrews (Soricidae). Hume's tawny owl (Strix butleri) pellets contained mostly invertebrates (58.9%) and lizards, and their most frequent mammal prey were Wagner's gerbil (Gerbillus dasyurus) and spiny mice (Acomys sp.). There was an even higher propostion of invertebrates (86.4%) among lilith owlets (Athene lilith). In addition to the insect orders Coleoptera, Orthoptera and Hymenoptera, remains of Scorpiones and Solifugae were also frequently found. The summarized results from individual owl species are compared with those gathered by the author in the surrounding Middle Eastern countries: Israel, Syria, Lebanon and Egypt. © 2018 Ján Obuch, published by Sciendo 2018.

ABSTRACT: The use of database technologies as a tool for implementing data for quantitative ecological studies and biodiversity conservation planning has recently attracted the attention of the biological community. Despite the fact that the number of biodiversity data sets is quickly rising, online databases of small mammals are still scarce, especially for Mediterranean ecosystems. We implemented the first standardized and accessible georeferenced European database of small mammal occurrences, abundances, and functional traits. Data derived from owl pellets was obtained from different sources, including original field surveys, publications, gray literature, existing databases, and museum collections. The OpenMICE database covers the years 1972 to 2017 and includes nearly 50,000 individuals from 23 species (13 Rodentia and 10 Eulipotyphla) at 190 sites in south-central Italy. Our specific goals in compiling this data set were as follows: (1) to make data that is usually accessible to a restricted audience widely available; (2) to identify the gaps in knowledge about small mammal communities and guide future sampling and conservation efforts; and (3) to gain a first insight into small mammal diversity and abundance in the study area. The potential applications of our spatial relational database are many, from individual-based to community-based models as potential indicators of environmental changes at different geographical scales. Given the long-term support for data storage, the OpenMICE database could be further expanded to include other geographical contexts and implemented with new information and traits. We would appreciate that researchers cite this paper if using all or part of the data set. We also request that researchers and teachers inform us of how they are using the data. We intend to keep it up to date as novel studies become available (see Data Availability). © 2018 The Authors. Ecology © 2018 The Ecological Society of America

ABSTRACT: Numerical analysis of airfoil geometries inspired by the down coat of the night owl is presented. The bioinspired geometry consists of an array of finlet fences, which is placed near the trailing edge of the baseline (NACA 0012) airfoil. Two fences with maximum nondimensional heights, H/δ = 1 and 2.26 are investigated, where δ∗ is the displacement thickness at 2.9% chord upstream of the airfoil trailing edge. Wall-resolved large eddy simulations are performed at chord-based Reynolds number, Rec = 5 × 105, flow Mach number, M = 0.2, and angle of attack, α = 0°. The simulation results show significant reductions in unsteady surface pressure and farfield radiated noise with the fences, in agreement with the measurements available in the literature. Analysis of the results reveals that the fences increase the distance between the boundary layer turbulence (source) and the airfoil trailing (scattering) edge, which is identified to be the mechanism behind high-frequency noise reduction. These reductions are larger for the taller fence as the source-scattering edge separation is greater. Two-point correlations show that the fences reduce the spanwise coherence at low frequencies for separation distances greater than a fence pitch (distance between two adjacent fences) and increase the coherence for smaller distances, the increase being higher for the taller fence. This increase in coherence and the reduced obliqueness of the leading edge of the fence are hypothesized to be responsible for the small increase in farfield noise at low frequencies observed in the simulations with the taller fence. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Capsule: Plumage colour of Northern Saw-whet Owls Aegolius acadicus was strongly associated with body condition and may be used to distinguish the highest quality individuals. Relationships between eye colour and body condition were more complex and deserve further study. Aims: We explored the association of colouration with body condition of Northern Saw-whet Owls during their autumnal migration across Pennsylvania, USA from 1999 to 2012. Methods: We used fat and keel scores of female owls to index body condition. Since feathers are laid down during pre-migration moult, we hypothesized that facial white plumage would be more strongly associated with long-term condition (keel scores) whereas eye colour should indicate short-term condition (fat scores). Results: Facial white plumage and eye colour were largely uncorrelated, but were strongly associated with both fat and keel scores. Contrary to our hypothesis, owls with more facial white plumage had both higher fat and keel scores, indicating that facial white was strongly associated with both short- and long-term condition. This appears to be because facial white was highest in individuals most capable of maintaining good condition in both scores (the highest quality owls). Relationships between condition and eye colour were more complex, since owls with highest fat scores but lowest keel scores had lightest eyes, possibly resulting from trade-offs with pigment function and immunocompetence. Our results also demonstrated environmental forcing (cyclic prey availability) of colouration and body condition, although not the relationship between them which remained consistent between years and for different ages. Conclusion: Facial white, but not eye colour, was a robust predictor of short- and long-term body condition, permitting detection of individuals in the best and most consistent condition. Further study of colouration and condition are needed to elucidate the extent of genetic control and environmental factors in feather melanization. © 2019, © 2019 British Trust for Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: Evaluating raptor populations is challenging because of their low population densities and secretive breeding behavior. Barn Owls (Tyto alba) are particularly difficult to monitor given their nocturnal nature and irregular vocalization patterns. In an effort to help develop more effective survey protocols for locating breeding Barn Owls and for monitoring Barn Owl populations, we examined factors influencing Barn Owl detections and responses to broadcast surveys. We conducted 288 surveys at 33 different nest locations in 2013 and 2014 in Illinois, USA, and examined the influence of using call broadcasts, breeding stage, day of year, cloud cover, moon phase, time of night, wind speed, ambient noise, temperature, and the number of Barn Owls in proximity on detection rates. We detected Barn Owls on 11.2% of passive surveys and 49.4% of broadcast surveys; 97.6% of the detections during broadcast surveys involved individuals flying within 20 m of observers. Detections were more common earlier in the breeding season and in areas where density of known Barn Owl nests was greater, but these variables affected detections from broadcast and passive surveys similarly; other variables did not have meaningful associations with Barn Owl detections. These results suggest that broadcast surveys may be an effective approach for identifying areas where Barn Owls are breeding or for monitoring population trends. © 2018 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Barred Owls (Strix varia) are generalist predators that take a variety of birds, small mammals, herps, fish, crustaceans, insects, gastropods, and other invertebrates as prey. Here we document 2 different Barred Owl individuals that ingested rough-skinned newts (Taricha granulosa) as prey in northern California. Few vertebrate predators are known to feed on newts of the genus Taricha because they carry a potent defensive neurotoxin (tetrodotoxin) lethal to most vertebrate predators. Our examples suggest that Barred Owls may prey on newts in some areas and that consuming newts is not always lethal to Barred Owls. © 2018 Wilson Ornithological Society. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: A barn owl swooping down generated a quieter, almost silent, noise (acoustic impulses) compared to a louder noise generated by the owl when taking off. These acoustic impulses are at low frequencies which are below the auditory threshold to most rodents. Therefore, rodents are less likely to hear these noises of owl flight. A previous study revealed that rodents exhibit frantic response to an owl taking off (as opposed to their typical freezing response during owl attack). The frantic response could be the result of tactile reception of the air-puffs generated by the owl's wingbeats and may reduce the success in subsequent attacks. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Porphyrins are pigments produced in most animal cells during the synthesis of heme, but their importance for external coloration is unclear. Owls (Order Strigiformes) are among the few animals that accumulate porphyrins in the integument, where it could serve as a means of signaling. Here we hypothesized that the porphyrin content of feathers may depend on body condition and breeding site quality in Eurasian eagle owl (Bubo bubo) fledglings and, thus, constitute amplifiers of the quality of the area where they are born. Using high-performance liquid chromatography, we found 2 porphyrins (protoporphyrin IX and coproporphyrin III) in the body feathers of 19 eagle owl fledglings from 7 breeding territories. Coproporphyrin III, but not protoporphyrin IX feather concentration, was positively associated with the body mass of fledglings and with the quality of the breeding sites where they were reared with respect to food quality and availability. As coproporphyrin III is produced under oxidative stress, we suggest that good breeding sites may lead to fledglings in good condition. This, in turn, may make fledglings induce a certain level of free radical and coproporphyrin III production to signal to conspecifics their site-mediated capacity to cope with oxidative stress. This is the first time that porphyrin content in the integument has been found to be related to individual quality, opening a new scenario for studying evolution of animal coloration. © 2018 International Society of Zoological Sciences, Institute of Zoology/Chinese Academy of Sciences and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd

ABSTRACT: As the barred owl (Strix varia; Aves: Strigiformes: Strigidae) expands throughout western North America, hybridization between barred and spotted owls (Strix varia and S. occidentalis, respectively), if abundant, may lead to genetic swamping of the endangered spotted owl. We analyzed low-coverage, whole-genome sequence data from fifty-one barred and spotted owls to investigate recent introgression between these two species. Although we obtained genomic confirmation that these species can and do hybridize and backcross, we found no evidence of widespread introgression. Plumage characteristics of western S. varia that suggested admixture with S. occidentalis appear unrelated to S. occidentalis ancestry and may instead reflect local selection. © 2018 Montesinos-López et al.

ABSTRACT: The Long-eared Owl (Asio otus) in Crete (Greece) is a common agricultural species affected by the recent changes in agro-forestry systems. Concrete studies of habitat selection are needed in order to improve our knowledge of its foraging behaviour in managed rural landscapes. In the present study, we analysed the home range size and habitat selection of 11 Long-eared Owls inside olive groves in the plain of central Crete using radio tracking data and remote sensing images. Six nominal scale and 11 landscape scale predictors were used for habitat selection analysis, using a maximum entropy approach. Home range size ranged between 337 and 969 ha while a 52% of home range overlap was observed suggesting that Long-eared Owls do not defend hunting territories. At the nominal scale, distance to potential roosts (trees) was the most important contributor to model performance, followed by vegetation heterogeneity. Furthermore, local heterogeneity of greenness was a better predictor than simply greenness at the presence location. At the landscape scale the amount of habitat openness significantly improved model performance. Incorporating landscape heterogeneity improved habitat selection prediction compared to using only discrete land cover classification. Results of our study pinpoint that although Long-eared Owls exhibit a wide range of habitat tolerance, they prefer mixed habitat conditions avoiding particularly open areas or dense olive plantations. The research has implications in the face of new reforms of European Common Agricultural policy which emphasised the importance of landscape structure in preserving biodiversity in agricultural areas of Europe. © 2018 Science Reviews 2000 Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Birds overwintering at high latitudes may find it challenging to meet their energy budgets when thermoregulatory costs are high and food availability is low. Snowy Owls (Bubo scandiacus), like most raptors, exhibit reversed sexual size dimorphism, so, if availability of high-quality (food-rich) habitats is limited, we predicted that larger and dominant females would use better-quality habitat than males. During the winters of 2014–2015 and 2015–2016 in Saskatchewan, where many Snowy Owls overwinter annually, we measured prey (small mammal) abundance in fields with four types of cover, including cut stalks (stubble) of canola, grain and legume crops, and pasture, and related this estimate of quality to habitat selection by males and females. Small mammal abundance varied annually, but not among the three types of crop stubble. However, prey were less abundant in pastures than in the three types of crop cover in one of three years. Biweekly surveys of owls conducted during the two winters along a 60-km transect revealed weak selection for legume fields, especially by males. The home ranges of nine females with transmitters included proportionally less canola stubble than those of eight males with transmitters. Within home ranges, males avoided canola stubble and tended to use legume fields more, whereas females used all four habitat types in proportion to availability. Fewer Snowy Owls than expected were observed at locations along the transect within 800 m of Great Horned Owls (Bubo virginianus) and their associated habitats, suggesting that Snowy Owls also avoided these potential competitors on the landscape. Our results suggest that larger females outcompete smaller male Snowy Owls for home ranges in preferred habitat with less canola stubble because stubble-free legume fields provide easier access to prey than canola fields with numerous rigid stalks. © 2018 Association of Field Ornithologists

ABSTRACT: Extra-cellular field potentials (EFP) are widely used to evaluate in vivo neural activity, but identification of multiple sources and their relative contributions is often ambiguous, making the interpretation of the EFP difficult. We have therefore analyzed a model EFP from a simple brainstem circuit with separable pre- and postsynaptic components to determine whether we could isolate its sources. Our previous papers had shown that the barn owl neurophonic largely originates with spikes from input axons and synapses that terminate on the neurons in the nucleus laminaris (NL) (Kuokkanen PT, Wagner H, Ashida G, Carr CE, Kempter R. J Neurophysiol 104: 2274–2290, 2010; Kuokkanen PT, Ashida G, Carr CE, Wagner H, Kempter R. J Neurophysiol 110: 117–130, 2013; McColgan T, Liu J, Kuokkanen PT, Carr CE, Wagner H, Kempter R. eLife 6: e26106, 2017). To determine how much the postsynaptic NL neurons contributed to the neurophonic, we recorded EFP responses in NL in vivo. Power spectral analyses showed that a small spectral component of the evoked response, between 200 and 700 Hz, could be attributed to the NL neurons’ spikes, while nucleus magnocellularis (NM) spikes dominate the EFP at frequencies ≳1 kHz. Thus, spikes of NL neurons and NM axons contribute to the EFP in NL in distinct frequency bands. We conclude that if the spectral components of source types are different and if their activities can be selectively modulated, the identification of EFP sources is possible. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Extracellular field potentials (EFPs) generate clinically important signals, but their sources are incompletely understood. As a model, we have analyzed the auditory neurophonic in the barn owl’s nucleus laminaris. There the EFP originates predominantly from spiking in the afferent axons, with spectral power ≳1 kHz, while postsynaptic laminaris neurons contribute little. In conclusion, the identification of EFP sources is possible if they have different spectral components and if their activities can be modulated selectively. © 2018 the American Physiological Society.

ABSTRACT: Selective attention, the prioritization of behaviorally relevant stimuli for behavioral control, is commonly divided into two processes: bottom-up, stimulus-driven selection and top-down, task-driven selection. Here, we tested two barn owls in a visual search task that examines attentional capture of the top-down task by bottom-up mechanisms. We trained barn owls to search for a vertical Gabor patch embedded in a circular array of differently oriented Gabor distractors (top-down guided search). To track the point of gaze, a lightweight wireless video camera was mounted on the owl’s head. Three experiments were conducted in which the owls were tested in the following conditions: (1) five distractors; (2) nine distractors; (3) five distractors with one distractor surrounded by a red circle; or (4) five distractors with a brief sound at the initiation of the stimulus. Search times and number of head saccades to reach the target were measured and compared between the different conditions. It was found that search time and number of saccades to the target increased when the number of distractors was larger (condition 2) and when an additional irrelevant salient stimulus, auditory or visual, was added to the scene (conditions 3 and 4). These results demonstrate that in barn owls, bottom-up attention interacts with top-down attention to shape behavior in ways similar to human attentional capture. The findings suggest similar attentional principles in taxa that have been evolutionarily separated for 300 million years. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Here we report a new species of Sarcocystis with a barred owl (Strix varia) as the natural definitive host and interferon gamma gene knockout (KO) mice as an experimental intermediate host. A barred owl submitted to the Carolina Raptor Center, Huntersville, North Carolina, was euthanized because of paralysis. Fully sporulated 12.5 × 9.9 μm sporocysts were found in intestinal scrapings from the owl. Sporocysts from the barred owl were orally fed to 4 laboratory-reared outbred Swiss Webster (SW) (Mus musculus) and 8 KO mice. All mice remained asymptomatic. Microscopic sarcocysts were found in all 5 KO mice euthanized on day 32, 59, 120, 154, and 206 post-inoculation (PI), not in KO mice euthanized on day 4, 8, and 14 PI. Sarcocysts were not found in any SW mice euthanized on day 72, 120, 206, and 210 PI. Sarcocysts were microscopic, up to 70 μm wide. By light microscopy, the sarcocyst wall < 2 μm thick had undulating, flat to conical, protrusions of varying dimensions. Numerous sarcocysts were seen in the histological sections of tongue and skeletal muscles from the abdomen, limbs, and eye but not in the heart. By transmission electron microscopy, the sarcocyst wall was "type 1j." The ground substance layer (gs) was homogenous, up to 2 μm thick, with very fine granules, and a few vesicles concentrated toward the villar projections. No microtubules were seen in the gs. Longitudinally cut bradyzoites at 206 days PI were 7.8 × 2.2 μm. Based on molecular characterization using 18S rRNA, 28S rRNA, and cox1 genes and morphology of sarcocysts, the parasite in the present study was biologically and structurally different from species so far described, and we therefore propose a new species name, Sarcocystis strixi n. sp. © American Society of Parasitologists 2017.

ABSTRACT: In fire-adapted forest ecosystems around the world, there has been growing concern about adverse impacts of post-fire logging on native biodiversity and ecological processes. This is also true in conifer forests of California, U.S.A. which are home to a rare and declining owl subspecies, the California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis). While there has been recent concern about the California spotted owl occupancy in large fire areas where some territories have substantial high-severity fire effects, the influence of post-fire logging on the California spotted owl occupancy has been investigated very little, leading to some uncertainty about interpretation of conflicting results in different large fires. Research has found these owls preferentially select high-severity fire areas, characterised by high levels of snags and native shrubs, for foraging in forests that were not logged after fire, suggesting that removal of this foraging habitat might impact occupancy. The authors assessed the effect of post-fire logging and high-severity fire, on occupancy of this subspecies in eight large fire areas, within spotted owl sites with two different levels of high-severity fire effects. They found a significant adverse effect of such logging and no effect of high-severity fire alone. These results indicate it is post-fire logging, not large fires themselves, that poses a conservation threat to this imperilled species. Copyright © 2018 Chad T. Hanson et al.

ABSTRACT: Scavenging has been increasingly documented for difficult to observe species through advances in motion-triggered photography. Here, we document several instances of scavenging over multiple days by a Northern Hawk Owl (Surnia ulula) on a Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) carcass. These observations are of particular interest because the owl visited the carcass 25 times, with the longest visit lasting >3 hrs. In addition, the owl routinely defended the carcass against Black-billed Magpies (Pica hudsonia). These observations suggest scavenging may represent a larger role in the diet of Northern Hawk Owls; further research is required in order to understand its importance for this and other raptor species. © 2017 Wilson Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: When a species successfully colonizes an urban habitat it can be expected that its population rapidly adapts to the new environment but also experiences demographic perturbations. It is, therefore, essential to gain an understanding of the population structure and the demographic history of the urban and neighbouring rural populations before studying adaptation at the genome level. Here, we investigate populations of the burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia), a species that colonized South American cities just a few decades ago. We assembled a high-quality genome of the burrowing owl and re-sequenced 137 owls from three urban-rural population pairs at 17-fold median sequencing coverage per individual. Our data indicate that each city was independently colonized by a limited number of founders and that restricted gene flow occurred between neighbouring urban and rural populations, but not between urban populations of different cities. Using long-range linkage disequilibrium statistics in an approximate Bayesian computation approach, we estimated consistently lower population sizes in the recent past for the urban populations in comparison to the rural ones. The current urban populations all show reduced standing variation in rare single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), but with different subsets of rare SNPs in different cities. This lowers the potential for local adaptation based on rare variants and makes it harder to detect consistent signals of selection in the genome. © 2018 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The documentation of anticoagulant rodenticides (AR) in nontarget species has centered around wildlife that inhabit urban or agricultural settings. However, recent studies in California have shown that AR use in remote forest settings has escalated and has exposed and killed forest carnivores. Anticoagulant rodenticides have been documented as physiological stressors for avian species. Northern Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) critical and occupied habitat overlaps the areas where these studies occurred, yet no data were previously available to demonstrate whether this species was similarly affected. We investigated whether avian predators are also exposed to these specific pesticides and whether Barred Owls (Strix varia) may be a surrogate to indicate exposure rates in Northern Spotted Owls. We documented that 70% of Northern Spotted Owls and 40% of Barred Owls were exposed to one or more anticoagulant rodenticides. None of the rodent prey species sampled within the study area were positive for ARs. There were no spatial clusters for either low or high rates of exposure, though we detected low temporal trend early on throughout the study area. We hypothesize a recent change in land-use toward marijuana cultivation may have led to the increased use of AR in this area. This study demonstrates environmental contamination within occupied Northern Spotted Owl habitat and that Barred Owls can be used as adequate surrogates for detecting these pollutants in a rare species such as the Northern Spotted Owl. Furthermore, additional studies should focus on whether these pesticides are also affecting prey availability for these forest avian species. © 2018 by the author(s).

ABSTRACT: Meeting energy requirements during the nonbreeding season is important for many animals and some defend winter territories to secure a food supply. In birds of prey, females, the larger and competitively dominant sex, may monopolize areas with higher prey abundance than males. We thus predicted that female Snowy Owls (Bubo scandiacus (Linnaeus, 1758)), which might acquire the high-quality habitats and individuals in better body condition, would be able to persist on smaller home ranges, travel shorter distances, and spend proportionally more time on a home range than males, during the winter. On the prairies in central Saskatchewan, we deployed satellite transmitters on 11 male and 12 female Snowy Owls over two winters. There were no significant differences between the sexes in home-range size or the amount of travelling during the winter months. Mean first home range (95% minimum convex polygon) size was 54.4 km2 for males, 31.9 km2 (estimated marginal means) for females, and 53.8 km2 for the sexes combined. However, within sexes, home-range size was negatively correlated with body condition as predicted. A lack of defense of home-range perimeters against conspecifics could increase variation in home-range size and movement patterns and reduce differences between the sexes. © 2018, Canadian Science Publishing.

ABSTRACT: Carotenoids have important roles in bird behavior, including pigmentation for sexual signaling and improving color vision via retinal oil droplets. Yellow carotenoids are diet-derived, but red carotenoids (ketocarotenoids) are typically synthesized from yellow precursors via a carotenoid ketolase. Recent research on passerines has provided evidence that a cytochrome p450 enzyme, CYP2J19, is responsible for this reaction, though it is unclear if this function is phylogenetically restricted. Here I provide evidence that CYP2J19 is the carotenoid ketolase common to Aves using the genomes of 65 birds and the retinal transcriptomes of 15 avian taxa. CYP2J19 is functionally intact and robustly transcribed in all taxa except for several species adapted to foraging in dim light conditions. Two penguins, an owl and a kiwi show evidence of genetic lesions and relaxed selection in their genomic copy of CYP2J19, and six owls show evidence of marked reduction in CYP2J19 retinal transcription compared to nine diurnal avian taxa. Furthermore, one of the owls appears to transcribe a CYP2J19 pseudogene. Notably, none of these taxa are known to use red carotenoids for sexual signaling and several species of owls and penguins represent the only birds known to completely lack red retinal oil droplets. The remaining avian taxa belong to groups known to possess red oil droplets, are known or expected to deposit red carotenoids in skin and/or plumage, and/or frequently forage in bright light. The loss and reduced expression of CYP2J19 is likely an adaptation to maximize retinal sensitivity, given that oil droplets reduce the amount of light available to the retina. © 2017

ABSTRACT: Capsule: Analysis of regurgitated pellets showed that fish were a very rare prey in the diet of the Long-eared Owl Asio otus. Remains of 38 individual fish were found at 8 of 121 nests and only in 2 out of 11 years. Occurrence tended to be more frequent in warm dry periods, when water ditches were dry. © 2018, © 2018 British Trust for Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: The winter roost of the long-eared owl Asio otus in Crimea (South of Ukraine), located in Simferopol, is described. In 2015-2017, the number of long-eared owls varied on a convex curve, with the maximum reached at the end of November and in December. The birds exhibited a strong preference for roosting in conifers, where we recorded 89% of the owls. There was an inverse relationship between the mean of the maximum daily temperature (°C) and the number of owls in both seasons. The owls were not sensitive to abrupt but short-term temperature changes, but the temperature decrease curve caused practically synchronous changes in the dynamics of bird numbers. It was found that the number of owls significantly differed based on weather conditions in 16 trees. The proportion of owls sitting on coniferous trees increased with unfavourable weather, and the converse pattern was observed for deciduous trees. © 2018 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Owing to habitat loss, changes in farming practices, urbanization, and high mortality through vehicle collisions, barn owls Tyto alba are a species of conservation concern in portions of their range. This species can be secretive and difficult to survey, particularly away from breeding sites, so factors related to barn owl occurrence often remain unknown. We conducted nighttime broadcast surveys for barn owls during the early- and post-breeding seasons and used an occupancy modeling framework to understand how factors related to landcover, landscape features, and human development related to occupancy in southern Idaho, USA. We also assessed the effectiveness of using broadcasts of conspecific vocalizations to improve owl detection. Barn owls were detected during 52 of 666 point counts and at 37 of 222 locations in the early-breeding season and 50 of 198 point counts and 31 of 66 locations in the post-breeding season. The probability of detecting barn owls was 0.32 ± 0.06 (SE) and 0.45 ± 0.07 (SE) during the early- and post-breeding seasons, respectively. Based on analysis within 1-km buffers surrounding point-count locations, occupancy in the early-breeding season increased with percentage of crop coverage and presence of trees and decreased with background noise. Post-breeding season occupancy increased with stream length and decreased with area of development and distance from the Snake River, a major geologic feature that likely provided roost sites in its canyon walls and riparian woodlands and a dispersal corridor for juveniles. Broadcast of barn owl vocalizations increased detection probability as much as nine times. Thus, incorporating call broadcast into future barn owl surveys should help investigators reduce false conclusions of absence. Ultimately, understanding factors influencing occupancy of barn owls will facilitate effective conservation, especially in light of population pressures related to factors such as roadway mortality and loss of nesting sites with increased urbanization. © 2018 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Many researchers have suggested that abundance of Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia) has declined in many portions of their breeding range, but a thorough review of their population trends over time is lacking. Published population trends from the North American Breeding Bird Survey program suggested that Burrowing Owl populations in the US have declined over the past 60 yr, but the declines were not considered significant until 2014. However, accurate trend estimates and the statistical significance of those estimates were hampered by low relative abundance of owls. Moreover, many authors have suggested that eradication of burrowing animals is a major cause of Burrowing Owl declines, because burrows dug by burrowing animals are a critical resource for Western Burrowing Owls (A. cunicularia hypugaea). Despite this, we currently lack a range-wide summary of the burrowing animals on which Western Burrowing Owls depend. To help fill these two information gaps, my objectives were to: (1) use Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data to examine geographic patterns in population trends of Burrowing Owls throughout their breeding range in the USA, and (2) use past studies to provide the first summary of the spatial extent to which Western Burrowing Owls rely on the suite of burrowing animals throughout their breeding range. Significantly more BBS routes in the US show declining counts of owls than show increasing or stable counts, and the declines were most apparent prior to 1995. Counts of Burrowing Owls declined most precipitously on the northern edge and southern edge of the owl's US breeding range. Western Burrowing Owls primarily use black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) burrows in the eastern portion of their breeding range, whereas the diversity of burrowing species on which the owls depend is much greater in the western and central portions of their breeding range. Burrowing owl declines have been most apparent in portions of their range where they rely primarily on Richardson's ground squirrels (Urocitellus richardsonii), California ground squirrels (Otospermophilus beecheyi), black-tailed prairie dogs, and American badgers (Taxidea taxus). © 2018 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: This study investigated the dietary niche of the Barn Owl (Tyto alba) in an intensively farmed landscape, based on pellet samples from 12 nesting pairs containing 25 animal taxa and 1,994 prey items after the breeding season in 2016. Based on land use categories of the buffer area around each nest, three landscape types (agricultural, mosaic, urban) were considered, to analyse the diet composition and food-niche parameters. Niche breadth was calculated at the local and landscape level. Small mammals were the most frequent in the diet than other prey in each of the landscape types. The Common Vole (Microtus arvalis), considered to be an important agricultural pest was the most numerous prey in all landscape groups. The trophic niche of Barn Owl varied between 0.69 – 0.86 at the local level, and the overall value of niche breadth was significantly higher in the urban than in the other two landscape types. Our results showed that the increase of Common Vole frequency lead to a decrease in niche breadth; significantly negative relationship was detected between these parameters. Despite differences in niche breadth, similarly high niche overlaps were detected by the randomisation test in the three landscapes. Our results suggest that the diet composition of Barn Owls, mainly their food-niche pattern, reflected prey availability in the comparison of the studied landscapes, which pointed out that it is necessary to examine the dietary difference of Barn Owls at the finer scale of land use. © 2018, BirdLife Hungary.

ABSTRACT: The Mottled Wood-Owl (Strix ocellata) is a poorly studied species endemic to the Indian subcontinent. During nine nesting seasons from 2005-2016, we studied 15 breeding pairs near Pune, west-central India. Important nest tree species were mango (Mangifera indica, 52%) and tamarind (Tamarindus indica, 22%). Habitat in plots with a 0.5-km radius centered on the nest comprised a mosaic of agricultural landscapes (41.9 ± 17.7%), deciduous/scrub forests (16.8 ± 21.8%), natural grasslands (15.0 ± 8.2%), human habitation (11.2 ± 8.5%), streams/rivers (10.1 ± 4.6%), and low hills (5.0 ± 5.8%). In a subset of five nests where the entire breeding cycle was studied, the average clutch size was 2.6 eggs (±0.5 SD, n = 20 breeding attempts eggs laid), of which an average 2.2 (± 0.4) young hatched, and 1.9 (±0.8) young fledged/breeding attempt. In addition, among ten other pairs where the nests were detected at the stage of fledging of young, an average of 1.6 young (±0.7, range = 1-4) fledged/successful nest. The primary nesting season from egg-laying to fledging lasted from 10 February until 20 May. From 1033 pellets analyzed, we identified 711 prey, including insects (39%), small mammals (rodents 10%; shrews 21%, bats 3%), birds (11%), and reptiles (9%). © 2018 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Northern Saw-whet Owls (Aegolius acadicus) are banded across the United States, yet neither migration nor dispersal of Northern Saw-whet Owls are fully understood. In spring of 2007 and 2008, the banding station at Whitefish Point Bird Observatory in Michigan's Upper Peninsula began broadcasting male and female (respectively) audio lures at dedicated net arrays to complement the passive mist netting performed since 1994. We analyzed data from spring owl captures (1994-2016) that used either male "advertising call" audio lures, female "tssst" audio lures, or no audio lures. From the analysis of 6659 owls captured during that period, we found that (1) there was a substantial female-bias in the owls caught at the passive and male audio lure nets, (2) a more extreme female-bias in the owls caught at the male audio-lure nets than the passive nets, and (3) a nearly equal proportion of male and female owls caught at the female audio-lure nets. These results corroborate a model of differential migration, in which females compose a larger portion of migrating Northern Saw-whet Owls than males. We also found that audio lures that use female calls can increase relative capture rates of male Northern Saw-whet Owls during spring migration. © 2018 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Animals living in urban areas are exposed to novel and potentially stressful human disturbances. In response to the increased number of stressors in these habitats, they may manifest changes in their immune system, body condition and physiology. Many bird species are negatively impacted by urbanization, whilst other species thrive in urban areas. The capacity to adjust the physiological responses to the stressors associated with urban areas may play a key role in explaining the success of some bird species in these environments. In this study, we compared indicators of physiological stress response and body condition in freeliving Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia) inhabiting urban and rural areas. We calculated a scaled index of body condition, and assessed leukocyte profiles and the heterophil/lymphocyte ratios of chicks and adults. We found no significant differences in these parameters between individuals from rural and urban areas. Chicks showed higher relative leukocyte counts than adults, which may be associated with ontogenetic development and immune system activation processes. © 2018, Sociedade Brasileira de Ornitologia.

ABSTRACT: A Great Grey Owl population on the territory of Polisskiy Nature Reserve (Olevsk and Ovruch District, Zhytomyr Region, Ukraine) was investigated in 2006-2008, 2013-2016. The main breeding locations were mesotrophic mires, where the lack of Birds of Prey nests made owls to breed on artificial constructions. Reproductive indexes of mean clutch size were similar to such indexes achieved in 1985-1996, and indexes of mean number of fledglings on active nest and breeding success decreased reliably. © 2018 Yu.

ABSTRACT: We describe the diet of the Spectacled Owl (Pulsatrix perspicillata) based on the collection and analysis of pellets between 20 to 24 December 2016, from a reproductive territory located in Zapotillo, southwestern Ecuador. Mammals were the main food source of the species, accounting for 80% of the identified prey items and 94% of the biomass. Other taxonomic groups, such as amphibians, reptiles and crabs were also identified. Based on our results and the existing observations, P. perspicillata consumed a big amount of arboreal prey or those that are located at medium height within the forest. This may be due to their hunting habits, the abundance of available prey or a combination of both. Our observation is the first to document the diet of the subspecies P. perspiciliata chapmani, and increases scarce knowledge about the trophic ecology of this species. © 2018, Sociedade Brasileira de Ornitologia.

ABSTRACT: Winter irruptions, defined as irregular massive movement of individuals over large distances, have been linked to food supply. Two hypotheses have been put forward: the “lack-of-food” suggests that a shortage of food forces individuals to leave their regular winter range and the “breeding output” suggests that unusually large food supplies during the preceding breeding season allows production of a large number of offspring dispersing in winter. According to the breeding output hypothesis, irruptive Snowy Owls (Bubo scandiacus (Linnaeus, 1758)) in eastern North America should not exhibit a lower body condition than individuals in regular wintering regions and individuals on the breeding grounds. Additionally, body condition of irruptive individuals should be unrelated to irruption intensity. Although body condition of juveniles was generally lower than that of adults and improved during the winter, we measured a fair body condition in both juvenile and adult irruptive Snowy Owls across North America. The results showed that Snowy Owls are not in a starving state during winter and that body condition of all age classes was not related to winter irruption intensity. Those results support the breeding output hypothesis suggesting that winter irruptions seem to be primarily the result of a large number of offspring produced when food availability on the breeding grounds is high. © 2018, Canadian Science Publishing.

ABSTRACT: In some areas, Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia) occur in human-altered, urbanized environments. However, their use of these anthropogenic land-cover types during nighttime is not well understood. We studied nocturnal and crepuscular space-use of eight juvenile Burrowing Owls in urban, greenspace, and agriculture dominated landscapes during 2012 and 2013 in Doña Ana County, New Mexico. For each owl, we obtained an average of 22 (range 14-37) nighttime telemetry fixes covering a period of 1-8.5 wk post-fledging. The juvenile Burrowing Owls avoided urban cover types and spent more time in agriculture and greenspace. In agricultural areas, owls used canals, weedy ditches, and associated farm roads, whereas in greenspace owls used city parks, golf courses, and patches of native habitat. Juvenile owls in this study were not observed to move large distances and on average most owls (n = 5) remained within 500 m of their roost burrow, with one owl traveling up to 743 m from its roost site. Conservation efforts for Burrowing Owls within human-altered environments should focus on the protection of nest and roost burrows near important foraging areas. © 2018 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: In this study, we determined the concentrations of As, Cd and Pb in the shaft of all primary flight feathers from ten tawny owl (Strix aluco) specimens, with the aim of selecting which shaft of the corresponding primary feather should be used in biomonitoring surveys to enable inter-individual comparisons of the levels of these metals. The birds had died between 2006 and 2013 and their bodies were stored in the various Wildlife Recovery Centres in Galicia (NW Spain). The analyses revealed a high degree of inter-shaft variability, mainly in the concentrations of As and Cd. However, it was possible to identify the most representative samples in each case: for As, the shaft of primary flight feather number 5 (S5) (which represented 11% of the total As excreted in all of the primary flight feathers); for Cd, the shaft of primary flight feather number 2 (S2) (11% of the total excreted); and for Pb, the shaft of primary flight feather number 8 (S8) (14% of the total excreted). However, the difficulties associated with the analytical determination of these pollutants in the shaft should be taken into account when this technique is applied in biomonitoring studies. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The objective of this study was to determine evidence of previous West Nile virus (WNV) infection in northern California owls. Owl serum samples were collected from birds presenting to a veterinary medical teaching hospital between 2007 and 2014 and were screened for the presence of WNV antibodies by an indirect enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Only one of 71 samples (1.41%) tested was positive by EIA and confirmed by a plaque reduction neutralization test; it was the most recent sample collected. The reason for the low prevalence of WNV in these California owls despite a high prevalence in sympatric avian species in the same region is unknown and should be a topic for further research. © Copyright 2017 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: In California, the Great Gray Owl (Strix nebufoso) has a very small population and is considered endangered. The Coast Range of northwestern California is not considered part of the species' regular range, and prior to January 2016 there were only three records for the region. During the winters of 2015-2016 and 2016-2017, however, a Great Gray Owl occurred in Humboldt County at locations separated by about 50 km. We evaluated photographs from both winters to assess whether they were of the same individual owl. Patterns of retained juvenile wing feathers and replaced feathers of the definitive basic plumage were consistent with the owl photographed in winter 2016-2017 (likely in its fourth cycle) being one year older than the one photographed in winter 2015-2016 Oikely in its third cycle). Furthermore, during both years, the same primary feather on the right wing showed an irregularity along the inner web near the tip, including a notch and additional damage to the barbs, evidence that the observations in both years were of the same individual. Feather-replacement patterns in this individual during these two winters, along with those of another specimen from Humboldt County from 2007, imply that the sequences of molt of the remiges in the Great Gray Owl parallel those of other Strix but that the rate of molt may be slower than previously reported. © 2018 Western Field Ornithologists.

ABSTRACT: Owls (Strigiformes) are small to large birds, mostly solitary and nocturnal predators. They can be found all around the Earth except Antarctica and some remote islands. The species differ in size, diet and habitat, which led to different morphological adaptations of the skull. The main differences are in the orbital and the otical region, which are connected to the visual and hearing capabilities. The aim of the recent study is to increase our knowledge of the relationship between skull shape and foraging habits and tried to find those characters that are related to diet. A geometric morphometric approach was used to analyse two-dimensional cranial landmarks. We used principal component (PC) analyses on measurements that may be related to visual and hearing abilities. The PCs are resulted in the robusticity of the skull and the asymmetry of the otical region. There are differences in position and shape of postorbital processes (POP) and tympanic wings (TW). Species with symmetrical skull shape are basically crepuscular or diurnal predators and species with more asymmetrical skulls are mostly nocturnal hunters and have better hearing capabilities. © 2018, BirdLife Hungary.

ABSTRACT: Dietary studies are one of the most developed research areas in biology and ecology studies of Neotropical owls, but most of these studies have focused on few species. Our study describes the diet of Barn Owl (Tyto alba), Spectacled Owl (Pulsatrix perspicillata), and Rufous-banded Owl (Strix albitarsis) in Jardin and Ciudad Bolivar, western Andes of Colombia. The diet of T. Alba, based on 495 prey items consisted 98.6% of vertebrates, the main food items being rodents (66%) and shrews (21.4%). Out of 142 prey items identified from P. Perspicillata fractured pellets, the main prey species were Artibeus lituratus (23.9%), Rattus norvegicus (21.8%), and Didelphis sp. (16.1%), species of small and medium-sized mammals that tolerate environmental changes and often live in urban areas. Pulsatrix perspicillata preyed also on at least 14 bird species including hummingbirds and migratory birds. Based on 165 prey items S. Albitarsis consumed more invertebrates (57.7%) than vertebrates (42.3%). Among the insects, the main preys were Coleoptera beetles and Orthoptera crickets. Among the vertebrates, the main prey species included mammals such as Thomasomys aureus, Marmosops sp., Marmosa sp., and Reithrodontomys mexicanus. These scansorial species are likely to be vulnerable to aerial predators such as S. Albitarsis which hunt from a perchs. According to standardized Levins index values T. Alba was the most selective in its food habits, P. Perspicillata had intermediate values, while S. Albitarsis showed the least selective diet. © Neotropical Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: The endangered Blakiston's Fish-Owl (Bubo blakistoni) has a fragmented distribution in the northeastern Eurasian continent, as well as on Hokkaido, southern Kuril, and Sakhalin islands. To examine the phylogeography of this species, we analyzed mitochondrial sequences. The whole mitochondrial genome, which included duplicated genes, was the largest (>21 kbp) in vertebrates to date. A Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial gene sequences revealed a clear separation between two clades. The insular clade comprised the mitochondrial haplotypes from Hokkaido, southern Kuril, and Sakhalin islands, whereas the continental clade consisted of those from the Eurasian continent, including the Primorye, Amur, and Magadan areas. Analyses based on whole mitochondrial sequences suggested that the level of genetic differentiation between the two subspecies, B. b. blakistoni on the islands and B. b. doerriesi on the continent, was enough to recognize them as separate species. The estimated divergence time between the clades was at least 500,000 yr before present. In contrast, the divergence times within the clades were less than 10,000 yr before present, indicating that the haplotypes within the clades diverged after the last glacial maximum (LGM). Information on the distribution of vegetation suggests that the main areas currently inhabited by B. blakistoni were unsuitable as habitats during the LGM. Lower diversities, higher growth rate, and the pattern of haplotype distribution in the continental population suggest a severe bottleneck and rapid dispersion through the last glacial period. In contrast, the insular population retains a higher haplotype variation. Because southern Hokkaido Island was covered with forests in the LGM, the area could have acted as a refugia for this species. © 2018 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The barn owl (BO) and the collared scops owl (CSO) are common nocturnal raptors throughout Thailand. Blood samples from 23 adult BOs and 14 CSOs were collected and processed for complete blood cell counts and parasite morphological examinations. Two Haemoproteuspositive samples were processed for ultrastructural observation. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for a partial cytochrome b gene (cytb) from Haemoproteus was performed in all samples. Haemoproteus presence detected by light microscopy was lower than that detected by PCR (30.4% and 34.8%, respectively, in BO; and 50.0% and 78.6%, respectively, in CSO). Comparative hematology revealed that Haemoproteus-positive BOs had higher mean cell hemoglobin concentration, total leukocyte, absolute heterophil, basophil, and monocyte counts than Haemoproteus-negative BOs, but no significant differences between Haemoproteus-negative and -positive CSOs. Monocyte ultrastructure analysis revealed a role in the elimination of gametocytes. Morphologically, the Haemoproteus in 3 BOs and 6 CSOs were identified as H. noctuae, while that in 1 CSO was identified as H. syrnii. Phylogenetic analysis indicated the Haemoproteus spp. in 8 BOs and 7 CSOs were not closely related to H. noctuae or H. syrnii, and the cytb of 2 CSOs was that of H. syrnii. These results should be useful for study of Haemoproteus. ©2018 The Korean Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: We tested how well barn owls can discriminate objects of different sizes. This ability may be important for the owls when catching prey. We performed a quantitative experiment in the laboratory and trained owls in a task in which the owls had to discriminate whether two rhombi presented simultaneously on a computer monitor were of the same or of different sizes. We obtained full data sets with two experienced owls and one data point with a third owl. For objects being sufficiently larger than the spatial resolution of the barn owl, the angular threshold was related to object size, implying that the discrimination followed Weber’s law. The range of Weber fractions we determined was between 0.026 and 0.09. For object sizes close to the spatial resolution, performance degraded. We conducted similar experiments with human subjects. Human thresholds showed the same dependence on object size, albeit down to smaller object sizes. Human performance resulted in a range of Weber fractions extending from 0.025 to 0.036. The differences between owls and humans could be explained by the much higher spatial acuity of humans compared with owls. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Understanding the rules of habitat selection and the individual behavioural routines in the home-range is crucial for developing evidence-based conservation action. We investigated habitat selection and range use of adult little owls Athene noctua in relation to landscape configuration, habitat structure and resource distribution. We determined the preference of habitat structures by VHF-telemetry. Large- and fine-scale distribution patterns of voles – the main prey during the breeding season – were assessed by transect counts of signs of vole presence. An experiment using artificial perches was carried out to determine the fine-scale adjustment of the owls' range use in relation to prey abundance and vegetation height. Habitat selection and resource exploitation by little owls were structured at all spatial levels: (1) at the landscape scale, orchards were highly preferred over other areas. This accords with the patchy large-scale occurrence of voles, which were absent in cropland, but abundant in orchards and grassland; (2) within home-ranges, the spatial distribution of voles was highly inhomogeneous and structures with high prey abundance were used over-proportionally; (3) at the scale of foraging sites, little owls preferred patches with low vegetation over those with high prey abundance, establishing that prey availability is the crux. The results suggest that all levels of habitat selection and range use were related to farming practices and affected by current cultivation. Conservation measures should focus on the conservation and restoration of orchards on the landscape level and habitat management measures should focus on grasslands – the main food providers – by creating a mosaic of patches with short grass and tall grass. Together with other habitat structures providing food resources such as field edges, wildflower areas and structures facilitating access to prey, the quality of habitat patches in terms of food availability may be highly improved. © 2017 The Zoological Society of London

ABSTRACT: Browsing effects of voles on plants can be mitigated by means of non-lethal predation, i.e. by subjecting voles to predator cues. Earlier studies largely focused on mammalian olfactory cues, whereas here we exposed Microtus voles to owl calls to examine whether the introduced predation risk reduces browsing on tree seedlings (silver birch, Scots pine, Norway spruce). We found that owl risk was associated with higher growth rate of birch seedlings, but only late in the growing season, while there was no obvious effect in case of pine and spruce. Early in the season, in the absence of predation risk, voles were able to move freely and search for their preferred food, grasses. Late in the season, when grasses were less palatable, voles likely targeted birch seedlings to a higher degree. Our results suggest that owl calls could alleviate vole herbivory on birches but, at least on a short temporal scale, will not protect seedlings of conifers. © 2018 Finnish Zoological and Botanical Publishing Board.

ABSTRACT: The Snowy Owl (Bubo scandiacus) is a circumpolar raptor that nests in Arctic tundra. Satellite tracking of nesting Snowy Owls in Alaska and eastern Canada has allowed researchers to document the widely nomadic movements of these owls between summer and winter ranges. This study expands that knowledge for Snowy Owls in the western Canadian Arctic. Based on previous studies, we predicted that owls: (1) would not have strong fidelity to specific winter or summer ranges; (2) would travel widely in search of breeding and nonbreeding areas at which they would settle for considerable time (months); (3) would choose areas to settle based on prey concentration; and (4) would use a mix of overwintering strategies, with some staying in Arctic and boreal regions, and some migrating south. Movement patterns of four female owls captured at nesting sites on Herschel Island, Yukon Territory, Canada, supported the first two predictions. The third prediction was partly supported: some sites of summer settlement were located where prey was relatively abundant, whereas other selected sites did not appear to have enough prey for successful nesting. The latter sites may have been the best available in those areas, however. Sites of winter settlement generally overlapped regions with high abundance of snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) or ptarmigan (Lagopus spp.), and were located in relatively open alpine, subalpine, or wetland environments, where prey were likely most accessible. Contrary to our last prediction, all four study owls settled in boreal Alaska and the northern Yukon Territory. This pattern contrasts with observations that eastern North American Snowy Owls rarely wintered in the boreal biome. This study highlights the need to better understand the habitat choices and food habits of wintering Snowy Owls in the northern boreal mountains. © 2017 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The Short-eared Owl Asio flammeus is a common to uncommon winter visitor to Gujarat. The species roosted in bushes of Prosopis juliflora in the grassland of Shiroda area, Odadar Village of Porbandar District. Communal roosts were identified by foot surveys between 9-17 November 2016. A total of 20 individuals co-existed with grazing cattle in the grassland of ca. 1km2. At present due to their restricted nesting habits and nomadic nature, the species is vulnerable to habitat loss at their feeding and roosting grounds. Conversion of open habitats to agriculture, grazing, recreation, housing and tourism development are the current threats to the species in the wetland complex. The IUCN conservation status further confirms that though they are assessed as Least Concern, in spite of the species population constantly declining with global population estimated at 3,000,000 individuals which equates to 2,000,000 mature individuals. The present study is the first systematic attempt to count a roost in Gujarat. © Varagiya & Chakraborty 2018.

ABSTRACT: The paper reports the whole mitochondrial genome (approximately 13 kb) sequencing in three individual representatives of the continental population of Blakiston’s fish owl Bubo blakistoni (Seebohm 1884), the IUCN Red List species in the family Strigidae. The analysis revealed extremely low mtDNA genetic diversity, which may be indicative of the critical state of the studied population. The phylogenetic analysis performed on the basis of the whole mitochondrial genome sequencing data showed that Blakiston’s fish owl is more closely related to the Strix genus than to the Bubo genus with the genetic divergence between blakistoni and either of the two genera being statistically significant and close to intergeneric level (p-distance of 0.135 in the case of the Strix genus and p-distance of 0.151 in the case of the Bubo genus). The results obtained in this work do not match the published data on the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and the nuclear RAG-1 gene, which laid the basis for the assignment of Blackiston’s fish owl to the Bubo genus in the recent taxonomic bulletins, but rather support the earlier taxonomic classification according to which all four Asian forms, blakistoni, flavipes, zeylonensis, and ketupu, constituted a separate Ketupa genus. © 2018, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Paleoenvironmental reconstructions based on micromammalian assemblages are a commonly used tool in paleoecology and zooarcheology. However, predator prey preferences may bias these assemblages to an unknown degree, thus leading to unreliable paleoenvironmental reconstructions. While attempts at taxonomically identifying micromammal predators through taphonomy has been conducted in the past, none has satisfactorily differentiated between owl taxa. Here we introduce the novel postcranial fracture index and revised versions of digestion indices for obtaining higher taxonomic resolution in taphonomic signatures. We taphonomically analyzed bone assemblages created by owls both in controlled feeding experiments and in the wild. We used blind experiment methodology involving multiple experimenters (each analyzing different bones) to test known and novel indices for reproducible taphonomic signatures within five species of owls (Tyto alba, Asio otus, Athene noctua, Bubo bubo and Strix aluco), Falco tinnunculus and Vulpes vulpes for comparison. We found that experimenter identity has a profound impact on the digestion indices. Nonetheless, the breakage indices and our novel fracture index found significant differences and subjective differences between owl species. Mandible breakage differentiated between Tyto alba and the other, more destructive owls. Postcranial breakage distinguished Strix aluco from the other owls. The postcranial fracture index differentiated between all species except between Athene noctua and Bubo bubo. We recommend a combination of taphonomic indices as a reliable tool for inferring owl species identity of micromammal assemblages. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Urbanization causes drastic changes in habitat and species behavior. In birds, these changes influenced the extinction of some species. The Burrowing Owl Athene cunicularia (Molina, 1782) (Aves: Strigiformes) has achieved some success in its adaptive process in anthropic environments. The main objective of this study was to measure distribution of this species in urban areas. The specific objectives were to quantify and compare the occurrence of this owl and its satellite burrows among urban biotopes; evaluate the importance of satellite burrows as a defense strategy and compare the depth of burrows in different biotopes. Field activities were carried out from August 2015 to November 2016. Sixty areas were sampled in different urban regions. The species was present in 29 of the 60 sites investigated, totaling 112 individuals, 88 adults, 14 young and 10 chicks; 98 burrows were recorded, from which 22 were refuges, seven nests and 67 satellite burrows. Residential and Urban Green Area biotopes had the highest number of individuals and burrows with a significant difference relative to the Commercial/Industrial biotope. A greater number of individuals were found in areas with a high number of burrows showing a positive linear relationship between these variables. The burrows were deepest, on average, in Urban Green Area biotopes. We conclude that the species has a wide distribution in the city with significantly high numbers in the Residential biotope. This same tendency is verified for the distribution of burrows. In areas with a large number of individuals, the same was observed for the number of satellite burrows. Deeper burrows in the Urban Green Areas are perhaps due to the greater transit of people, one of the main features of this biotope and one of the major threats to the Burrowing Owls. © 2018, Sociedade Brasileira de Ornitologia.

ABSTRACT: Male birds of prey are usually smaller than females, known as "Reverse Size Dimorphism" (RSD). We quantified sexual size dimorphism in species that occur in Brazil, and suggest a bootstrap-based approach that allows an estimate of confidence intervals for dimorphism indices. We used body mass, total length, and wing length, measured from museum specimens and a few live birds, to quantify size. We gathered data from eight owl species, for which sample sizes were considered to be minimally adequate to provide reliable dimorphism estimates. We calculated a dimorphism index (DI) for each measurement and then these indices were reduced to a single latent variable using a principal component analysis. A clear trend toward positive DI values confirms RSD as a general pattern, except for negative values in Asio clamator (Striped Owl) for all measurements, for total length in Athene cunicularia (Burrowing Owl), and Ciccaba virgata (Mottled Owl), and for virtually equal to zero values in Pulsatrix koeniswaldiana (Tawny-browed Owl) for total length and A. cunicularia for wing length. Body mass was the most dimorphic trait in all species and DI values were consistent across all three traits. Wing length DI was the most precise index and total length DI was the least precise index. In descending order of overall RSD the species studied were Strix hylophila (Rusty-barred Owl), Megascops choliba (Tropical Screech-Owl), Glaucidium brasilianum (Ferruginous Pygmy-Owl), Tyto alba (Barn Owl), P. koeniswaldiana, C. virgata, A. cunicularia and A. clamator. © 2017 Wilson Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Noise in natural environments can mask important acoustic signals used for animal communication. Owls use vocal communication to attract mates and defend territories, and also rely on acoustic cues to locate their prey. Industrial noise has been shown to negatively affect owl hunting success and reduce foraging efficiency by affecting their ability to detect prey, but it is not known if this results in reduced habitat suitability for owls in areas near industrial noise sources. To determine if owls avoid areas surrounding industrial noise sources in northeastern Alberta and at what scale, we acoustically surveyed for owls at sites with chronic industrial noise, sites with intermittent traffic noise, and sites with no noise. We deployed autonomous recording units at multiple stations within each site to detect territorial individuals vocalizing. Detections of owls were extracted from the recordings using automated species recognition and analyzed using occupancy models at two spatial scales. Barred Owls (Strix varia), Great Horned Owls (Bubo virginianus), and Boreal Owls (Aegolius funereus) were equally likely to occupy both types of noisy sites compared to sites with no noise, indicating that site level occupancy (representing a home range scale) was unaffected by the presence of noise sources on the landscape. On a smaller scale, there was no decline in station level occupancy (representing use of the area surrounding recording stations) at stations with higher noise levels for either of the three owl species. Our study contributes to research on the effects of anthropogenic noise, but suggests the effect on owls is minimal, and unlikely to result in a population change. © 2017 by the author(s).

ABSTRACT: The diet of predators is influenced by local conditions (e.g., characteristics of habitat and microhabitat, seasonality, prey availability) and therefore tends to change across time. In this paper, the diet composition of the barn owl (Tyto alba) in Italy was studied using a meta-analysis of 47 articles (covering 212 independent sites, with multiple surveys for some sites, thus giving a total of 290 datasets) between 1972 and 2012. General Linear Models were used to assess the effects of year and study site on four distinct diversity indices (species richness, dominance, Shannon-Weaver diversity and equitability). The year of data collection was a factor used in all analyses. Year had a greater effect than study site on all diversity indices, but the effect was not significant for the evenness and the species richness. However, dietary dominance increased significantly over the years, the Shannon-Weaver index of diversity decreased significantly over time, and equitability also decreased significantly over time. The relative abundance of various species of rodents did not increase/decrease progressively over the years, although there were inter-annual fluctuations. On the other hand, the relative abundance of insectivores tended to decrease with time, and there was a significantly negative correlation between year and the frequency of consumption of Sorex spp. and a marginally significant negative correlation for Crocidura leucodon. © 2018 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.

ABSTRACT: Conspecific broadcasts are effective to increase detection of owls. To determine the most appropriate time of the year to survey owls, we played conspecific owl vocalisations monthly in a temperate rainforest of southern Chile. From 12 broadcast points surveyed we recorded detections of Glaucidium nana, Strix rufipes and Tyto alba. Glaucidium nana presented a bimodal detection curve throughout the year and we recorded two regular vocalisations in response to broadcasting: contact pair call and territorial call. Strix rufipes and T. alba both showed a peak of detection between February and May. Strix rufipes presented three vocalisations: territorial call, contact pair call and female contact pair call while T. alba uttered two vocalisations: territorial call and twittering call. We recommend surveys during the end of the breeding season (austral summer–autumn) when detection is higher in most owls. Surveys should also take into consideration the variability of the vocalisations and include covariates in monitoring to evaluate occupancy/detection models. © 2017 The Royal Society of New Zealand.

ABSTRACT: Knowledge of the habitat requirements of nocturnal birds is vital for the development of effective conservation strategies. This study is the first intensive systematic survey of the occurrence of the threatened Tasmanian masked owl (Tyto novaehollandiae castanops), the Tasmanian boobook (Ninox leucopsis) and the Australian owlet-nightjar (Aegotheles cristatus) in Tasmania using call playback, spotlighting and listening techniques. Occupancy models were created that explain the spatial distribution of the three species. Temperature and wind influenced the detectability of all species. Detectability of the Tasmanian boobook was also associated with nightlight. The Tasmanian masked owl was most often found in low-elevation mature dry eucalypt forest. This may be related to a combination of availability of nesting sites, food availability and accessibility, and physiological factors. The Australian owlet-nightjar also showed a broad preference for dry eucalypt forest and avoided open country. In contrast, the Tasmanian boobook was most often found in wet eucalypt forest with higher temperatures and fewer roads. We conclude that mature dry and wet forest types at low elevations need to be carefully managed to maintain populations of Tasmania's nocturnal birds, particularly the threatened Tasmanian masked owl. Consideration should be given to retention of a network of contiguous areas of undisturbed mature forest across forested landscapes. © 2018 CSIRO.

ABSTRACT: To describe the parasitic community of the Magellanic Horned Owl, Bubo magellanicus (Aves, Strigiformes), 19 carcasses from central Chile were analyzed. Ectoparasites were collected through plumage inspection, while endoparasites were collected through traditional techniques of parasitological necropsy. Sixteen owls were infected with at least one species of ectoparasite (84.21%) or endoparasite (31.58%). Eleven of 19 birds (57.89%) harbored feather mites of the three species Pandalura cirrata (42.11%), Glaucalges attenuatus (47.37%), and Kramerella sp. (10.53%), whereas 16 individuals (84.21%) harbored the chewing louse Strigiphilus chilensis. Only six birds (31.58%) were infected with helminths; the nematodes Capillaria tenuissima (26.32%) and Dispharynx nasuta (5.26%); the acanthocephalan Centrorhynchus spinosus (5.26%); and the trematode Neodiplostomum sp. (5.26%). Apart from S. chilensis, all parasites comprised new records for B. magellanicus.

ABSTRACT: Bones consumed by carnivores and raptors, and subsequently deposited on the landscape in scats and pellets, respectively, can make up a considerable portion of the faunal remains recovered by North American archaeologists, particularly in caves and rockshelters. This paper compares and contrasts bones recovered from the scats of the mountain lion and coyote, as well as from the pellets of the great-horned owl and golden eagle. Bones in lion scats, coyote scats, and eagle pellets all may be relatively large in size, and display considerable etching, corrosion, and polishing, although bones in coyote scats tend to be smaller in size compared to those in lion scats. Bones in great-horned owl pellets tend to be larger in size and show much less degree of corrosion and polishing compared to the scats and eagle pellet bones. © 2016

ABSTRACT: Non-native invasive species threaten Galápagos’ endemic biodiversity, and increasing efforts are underway to protect its species from further harm. One such project is focused on the eradication of invasive rodents using rodenticide bait on Floreana, the archipelago’s sixth largest island. Short-eared owls (Asio flammeus galapagoensis) that consume poisoned rodents will, therefore, be at risk of secondary poisoning. If negatively impacted, it is not known to what degree the Floreana Island short-earned owl population is isolated, and whether potential re-colonization exists from its closest neighboring large population on Santa Cruz. Based on eight microsatellite loci and mtDNA control region sequence data from museum and contemporary samples, the short-eared owl populations on Floreana and Santa Cruz are not isolated from each other. However, gene flow is asymmetric from Floreana to Santa Cruz and not in the opposite direction. Morphometric data, including tarsus and bill size, and behavioral observations corroborate the genetic results and suggest that the Floreana population may possess unique traits compared to neighboring populations. For example, Floreana short-eared owls are more crepuscular than neighboring islands, which are predominately nocturnal, and were also non-responsive to inter-island call back recordings. Therefore, these results have important management implications concerning short-eared owl persistence on Floreana following rodenticide application. We recommend that managers implement additional precautions to protect the short-eared owl population until the risk of secondary poisoning has passed such as maintaining individuals in captivity. This study provides no evidence to suggest that short-eared owls are likely to disperse from Floreana’s closest large population on Santa Cruz if the local population is negatively impacted by rodenticide exposure, and the observed morphological and behavioral traits argue against translocating owls between islands. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

ABSTRACT: Excavations during November 2013 in the Rising Star Cave, South Africa, yielded more than 1550 specimens of a new hominin, Homo naledi. Four bird bones were collected from the surface of the Dinaledi Chamber during the first phase of the initial excavations. Although mentioned in the initial geological and taphonomic reports, the bird remains have not been formally identified and described until now. Here we identify these remains as the extant barn owl (Tyto alba) which is today common in the region and which is considered to have been an important agent of accumulation of microfaunal remains at many local Plio-Pleistocene sites in the Cradle of Humankind. Based on the greatest length measurement and breadth of the proximal articulation of the tarsometatarsus specimen, it is suggested that a single (female) individual is represented, despite the small sample sizes available for comparison. Although it is unclear how the remains of this female owl came to be accumulated in the remote Dinaledi Chamber, we suggest several possible taphonomic scenarios and hypothesise that these remains are not directly associated with the Homo naledi remains. Significance: • Owl bones from the Dinaledi Chamber are the only other macro-vertebrate remains from this Chamber. • The other remains discovered are that of more than 15 individuals of the enigmatic Homo naledi. • The remains of the Dinaledi Chamber owl further our understanding of the contents of the important material contained within the Dinaledi system as they are the only more recent fossils to be recovered from this area of the Rising Star Cave system and are therefore important in and of themselves as an indicator that more proximal parts of the Rising Star Cave system have been suitable for use by barn owls at greater time depths than the present. © 2018.

ABSTRACT: The purpose of this review is to present a brief overview of literature published through 2016 on the Burrowing Owl (BUOW; Athene cunicularia) as an example of how the science of bibliometrics allows us to examine the literature on this species and to determine and display important trends, including gaps in that literature. We conducted various analyses on approximately 1681 BUOW articles to demonstrate the utility of bibliometrics. We also compare the effectiveness of a traditional bibliography versus online databases. The query of even several online databases does not guarantee identifying but a fraction of the total references. Even the most complete database searched for the term "Athene cunicularia" produced only 38% of those of the current World Owl Bibliography Update. Topical areas that seem absent or limited in the published literature include: the genetics of many subspecies of this owl; the population status and trend in intact ecosystems versus human-altered habitats; details on the demography of Burrowing Owls in Central and South America; migratory patterns and overwintering habitat conditions; the dispersal and movement of several metapopulations; successful mitigation strategies; the effectiveness of translocation; the effect of various artificial burrow designs on interior microclimate and owl reproductive success; and a more comprehensive approach to management. This is an ongoing project that will contribute to a larger update of the literature on the owls of the world. © 2018 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Otus angelinae is included as a protected animal because of its endangered existence. Whereas, it has many values such as for mice pest control. Therefore, this research aims to optimize the reproductive function of Otus angelinae by administering turmeric powder mixed in its feed. This study was held on a laboratory scale with two male and two female Otus angelinae three months of age. Each subject is divided into two groups: a control group and a treatment group which is treated with turmeric powder 108 mg/owl/day mixed in 30 g catfish/day for a month. The parameter observed were the development of hierarchy follicles and the ovarium weight of female Otus angelinae, whereas the testis organs and testes weight were observed for the male. Both the female's and male's body weight, liver weight and the length of ductus reproduction were also observed. The data was analyzed descriptively. The results showed that the administration of turmeric powder can induce the development of ovarian follicles hierarchy and the length of ductus reproduction of female Otus angelinae and also induce the development of the testes and the length of ductus reproduction of male Otus angelinae. The addition of turmeric powder increased the liver weight of the female Otus angelinae, however it does not affect the body weight. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: A metal detector was used to recover passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags from below wedge-tailed eagle and barn owl nests and roost trees. The effectiveness of four different metal detectors to locate PIT tags and Australian Bird and Bat Banding Scheme (ABBBS) bands were compared. Twenty PIT tags from 14 golden bandicoots, five burrowing bettongs and one rufous hare-wallaby were recovered from wedge-tailed eagle sites. One unreadable PIT tag was recovered from a barn owl site. This technique has potential for use in determining the survivorship of translocated threatened species. © Australian Mammal Society.

ABSTRACT: Owl monkeys are the only one species possessing the nocturnal lifestyles among the simian monkeys. Their eyes and retinas have been interested associating with the nocturnal adaptation. We examined the cellular specificity and electroretinogram (ERG) reactivity in the retina of the owl monkeys by comparison with the squirrel monkeys, taxonomically close-species and expressing diurnal behavior. Owl monkeys did not have clear structure of the foveal pit by the funduscope, whereas the retinal wholemount specimens indicated a small-condensed spot of the ganglion cells. There were abundant numbers of the rod photoreceptor cells in owl monkeys than those of the squirrel monkeys. However, the owl monkeys’ retina did not possess superiority for rod cell-reactivity in the scotopic ERG responses. Scanning electron microscopic observation revealed that the rod cells in owl monkeys’ retina had very small-sized inner and outer segments as compared with squirrel monkeys. Owl monkeys showed typical nocturnal traits such as rod-cell dominance. However, the individual photoreceptor cells seemed to be functionally weak for visual capacity, caused from the morphological immaturity at the inner and outer segments. ©2018 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: The Little Owl is currently endangered bird species of agricultural lowland areas in Central Europe. Nesting sites of the Little Owl are often old trees as well as buildings and quarries with suitable nesting cavities. The Little Owl has severely declined in a major part of Europe during the past decades. Information on habitat requirements of the Little Owl and data related to land-use changes at nest sites (covering both the breeding and foraging habitats) are needed for conservation programmes aimed at this bird species. Land-use changes in farmland rank among frequently discussed negative factors causing the population decline of the Little Owl. The aim of this study is to analyse land-use changes at nest sites of the Little Owl in the South-Moravian region (Czech Republic) between the years 1976/1977 and 2014. In both studied periods (1976/1977 and 2014), the most important land-use type within 500 m from the nest sites of the Little Owl was arable land (66.94 % - 62.25 %), followed by built-up areas (19.97 % -22.41 %), while the other land-use types made up less than 5 %. The proportion of the particular land-use type did not change significantly between the years 1976/1977 and 2014. The most important change in comparison with the period 1976/1977 was the decrease in the area of arable land by 4.69 % and that of orchards and gardens by 1.99 %, while the surface of built-up areas increased slightly by 2.45 % and that of meadows and pastures by 1.5 %. The analysis shows that at the known nest sites of the Little Owl in the South-Moravian region (Czech Republic), there were no significant changes in the proportion of the particular land-use types within 500 m from the nests between the years 1976/1977 and 2014. Based on these results, we can conclude that in comparison with the availability of nest sites, which seems to be the important limiting factor for the occurrence and population density of the Little Owl, land-use changes in study area were not very important factor influencing decline of the Little Owl. © 2018 De Gruyter Open Ltd.

ABSTRACT: We documented the hooting and cavity scratching behaviours in a captive male Ryukyu Scops Owl Otus elegans during three years from hatching in 2005, and examined these behaviors in relation to the moult cycle. The owl first hooted 14 days after one of primaries was finally shed in September 2006, the second year of life of the owl. Cavity-scratching behaviour was first observed in March 2007, and continued until eight days after the primaries began shedding in June 2007. © Yamashina Institute for Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: Eight metals were analyzed in the pellet of Eurasian eagle owls (Bubo bubo) breeding in Korea: Paju, Ganghwa, Gimpo, and Sihwa, Gyeonggi-do (N = 15, respectively). Except for cadmium (Cd), concentrations of all metals differed among sites (ANOVA, p < 0.001); Sihwa had relatively higher metal concentrations compared with other sites. Clutch size did not differ among the four sites. However, Sihwa had the greatest nesting success and number of fledglings (per hatchlings and laid egg) and highest mean weight of diet. Lead concentrations in the pellets were generally lower than the excrements of various birds worldwide. We suggest that all metal concentrations in pellets do not negatively affect the reproduction of Eurasian eagle owls, and food supply at Sihwa seems likely more important to breeding success than metal contamination. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

ABSTRACT: An adultmale Eurasian eagle owl (Bubo bubo) housed at a wildlife rehabilitation facility in southern Oregon died after a short period of progressive ill-thrift. Radiographs taken prior to death demonstrated abnormal radiopaque material in the coelom and the owl was submitted for postmortem examination. Black pigmented fungus was noted grossly, particularly in the respiratory tissues, with abundant oxalate crystal deposition associated with and without hyphal elements subsequently observed histologically. Aspergillus section Nigri was cultured from the lesions. Although there have been a few reports of aspergillosis caused by Aspergillus Niger in avian species, the severity and wide tissue distribution of oxalates in this case are highly unusual. © 2018 Patti K.

ABSTRACT: An understanding of the calling behaviour of nocturnal birds is critically important for their detection. The Australian Masked Owl (Tyto novaehollandiae) is most commonly located by call playback surveys that prompt calling responses by resident owls, yet Masked Owl calling behaviour remains poorly understood. We present a detailed analysis of the calling behaviour of the Tasmanian subspecies of the Australian Masked Owl (T. n. castanops) to, (1) describe the vocal repertoire of the species, using spectrograms, (2) examine differences in relation to plumage colour morph, sex, age and individual variation to consider the potential for identifying individual birds, and, (3) examine environmental and temporal effects on calling behaviour. Three types of calls were identified: screech, continuous screech and chatter calls. The Tasmanian Masked Owl was found to produce a deeper (lower frequency) screech than mainland Masked Owls. Adult and juvenile Masked Owls produced different screech calls, and paired male and female Masked Owls produced different chatter calls from each other. Comparison of the chatter calls between individuals suggested that these types of calls may be used to identify individual owls via this non-invasive call playback survey technique. © 2018 Royal Zoological Society of New South Wales.

ABSTRACT: To determine whether Eastern Screech-Owls (Megascops asio; hereafter "screech-owl") typically guard or avoid food items cached within cavities, we conducted an experiment involving the addition of dead mice to paired roosting boxes during the nonbreeding season. Multiple factors may influence the tendency of a screech-owl to cache food: the value of the item(s), the likelihood of pilferage, the degree to which cached carcasses attract predators, and the availability of alternative cavities for roosting and/or caching. We hypothesized that providing roosting screech-owls with paired cavities (nest boxes) and a standardized windfall of food could reveal important information about food-caching behavior in this species. Twice per month over the course of a winter, we provided roosting owls with either 200 g of frozen mice or nothing on day 1 of the experiment. On day 2, we visited all box pairs occupied on day 1 and determined whether the experimental and control owls remained in the original box, shifted to the adjacent box, or roosted elsewhere. We also noted whether the experimental owls sought to scatter-hoard the mice by moving some into the adjacent box. We found that screech-owls neither guard nor avoid prey in roosting cavities: owls provided with mice shifted roost sites at the same frequency as owls not provided with mice. Additionally, we found no evidence that screech-owls scatter-hoard prey into an adjacent cavity when provided with a windfall of food. © 2018 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: In 1997, Eurasian Eagle Owls Bubo bubo returned to Limburg, the south-eastern province of The Netherlands. However, since then the population size has stagnated, while extremely high concentrations of PCBs have been found in Eagle Owl carcasses. These observations suggest that a further expansion of the species in Limburg is under threat. The high concentrations of toxic substances may be explained by the Eagle Owls' position at the top of the food chain. Studying their hunting behaviour may help to identify possible sources of poisoning. Identifying the most important habitat characteristics of hunting grounds is a first step towards recognizing poisoning sources. For this purpose, and to gain general insight into their habitat use, a GPS tracking study was conducted on six adult Eagle Owls from three adjoining territories in 2010-2011. We found that the quarries in the region are important for the Eagle Owls since they are used as nesting sites. Other habitat characteristics that attract the species are pastures, differences in altitude, forest edges and water bodies. Major roads and town centres are avoided. The highlighted areas and habitat characteristics provide information about the most important hunting habitats of Eagle Owls and insight into the underlying causes threatening this species in Limburg. © 2019 Nederlandse Ornithologische Unie.

ABSTRACT: The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) includes many genes that are essential for the adaptive immune system, and variation in the antigen binding site (ABS) is related to resistance against pathogens. In the present study, quantitative real-time PCR indicated a larger number of MHC gene copies in the endangered population of Blakiston's fish owl (Bubo blakistoni) than in five other owl species, and massively parallel pyrosequencing detected more MHC class IIβ per individual alleles in B. blakistoni than in the other species. A chromosomal fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis showed that the MHC class I and class IIβ loci are closely linked on a single pair of microchromosomes, indicating that the MHC genes were tandemly duplicated in a limited chromosomal region. Because B. blakistoni has twice as many MHC genes as its sister species, the tawny fish owl (Bubo flavipes), the duplication of MHC genes occurred after these species diverged by speciation. A Bayesian molecular phylogenetic analysis showed that the DAB1 and DAB2 lineages of MHC class IIβ alleles from various strigid species each formed a separate clade, indicating that the two allelic lineages preceded the radiation of Strigidae and evolved as paralogs. By contrast, the ABS sequences did not form distinct clades between DAB1 and DAB2 alleles but were intermixed, presumably due to gene conversion. Despite the low diversity of alleles per locus, B. blakistoni had many lineages of MHC class IIβ alleles. Gene duplication increases variation in the MHC genes in this species, and could have facilitated adaptation in small populations. © 2017 Zoological Society of Japan.

ABSTRACT: The Eurasian Scops Owl, a small nocturnal raptor living in continental and southern Europe, is often solitary and territorial but sometimes forms local groups, of which little is known. In this study, I examined a group of territorial Scops Owls in a habitat with limited nest site availability in Southern Italy in July of 2016 and 2017. Male Scops Owls were identified through spectrographic analysis of their vocalizations, and their location was recorded. Male Scops Owls clustered around a human-inhabited area with significant noise and light pollution and avoided the undisturbed forest, which apparently was only used for foraging. The location of territories was relatively consistent in two subsequent years. Scops Owls tended to sing where conspecifics occurred, not necessarily near their own nests. Sometimes neighbouring males occupied the same area and sang simultaneously, even when close to each other. The results are in contrast with the concept of an all-purpose, exclusive territory described for this species as the norm, and suggest that the social and spatial organization of this population is more flexible than previously thought. Scops Owls bred exclusively in abandoned Eurasian Magpie Pica pica nests, which is unusual for this typically cavity-nesting species and was presumably caused by the lack of alternative sites. The distribution of Magpie nests might thus be the main driver of nest spacing and territorial behaviour of Scops Owls in this presumably nesting site limited population. However, the underlying cause of aggregation is unknown. © 2022 IGI Global. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Population of the Eagle Owl (Bubo bubo) has been increasing in Europe including Hungary. The species occupy new habitats beside its ancient territories including quarries and buildings. This may result in conflicting conservation and economic interests in active quarries. Because eagle owls are strictly protected in Hungary, human activities around known nest sites require environmental permits. We aimed to obtain information on Eagle Owl behaviour in an operating quarry by tracking an adult female to base a future species-specific guideline to issue environmental permits for mining in quarries. We used a combined GPS-GSM and VHF telemetry. We found that the tracked female did not breed in the study year but remained in her home range during the study period. By studying her seasonal and daily patterns of movements, we found that she was not disturbed by regular human activities under the nesting cliff, but she was more sensitive to unexpected non-regular disturbance. Based on the satellite-tracking data, this specimen used an approximately 18 km2 home range during the study period. © 2018, BirdLife Hungary. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Ontologies are representations of a conceptualization of a domain. Traditionally, ontologies in biology were represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAG) which represent the backbone taxonomy and additional relations between classes. These graphs are widely exploited for data analysis in the form of ontology enrichment or computation of semantic similarity. More recently, ontologies are developed in a formal language such as the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and consist of a set of axioms through which classes are defined or constrained. While the taxonomy of an ontology can be inferred directly from the axioms of an ontology as one of the standard OWL reasoning tasks, creating general graph structures from OWL ontologies that exploit the ontologies' semantic content remains a challenge. RESULTS: We developed a method to transform ontologies into graphs using an automated reasoner while taking into account all relations between classes. Searching for (existential) patterns in the deductive closure of ontologies, we can identify relations between classes that are implied but not asserted and generate graph structures that encode for a large part of the ontologies' semantic content. We demonstrate the advantages of our method by applying it to inference of protein-protein interactions through semantic similarity over the Gene Ontology and demonstrate that performance is increased when graph structures are inferred using deductive inference according to our method. Our software and experiment results are available at http://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/Onto2Graph . CONCLUSIONS: Onto2Graph is a method to generate graph structures from OWL ontologies using automated reasoning. The resulting graphs can be used for improved ontology visualization and ontology-based data analysis.

ABSTRACT: Owls show an astonishing variation in their degree of colour polymorphism, although the exact mechanisms driving such variation remain controversial. Here we address this fundamental question by considering information on all extant owls and recent advances in comparative methods in the frame of three mutually non-exclusive evolutionary scenarios. In addition, we study for the first time whether the evolution of influential ecological characters facilitated the evolution of colour polymorphism (or vice versa). In agreement with the niche divergence hypothesis, we found that species living under more variable luminal conditions, i.e., species with diurnal and crepuscular habits and those inhabiting in a mixture of open and closed habitats, were more likely to show colour polymorphism. Correlated evolution analyses revealed that a change in the luminal niche might be a fundamental requisite for the evolution of colour polymorphism. Moreover, polymorphism was more frequent among owl species occupying lower trophic levels, which could be explained by a particularly high selection for crypsis on small predator owls. Our results, thus, provide support for the idea that colour polymorphism in owls is an adaptive character likely maintained by the selective advantage of morphs under different environmental conditions via disruptive selection mechanisms. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Vector-borne hemoparasites are commonly found in avian species. Plasmodium spp., the causative agent of avian malaria, are intraerythrocytic parasites that can cause signs ranging from subclinical infection to severe acute disease. In raptor species, most hemoparasites are associated with subclinical infection and are generally not treated when seen on blood evaluation. This case series reviews five cases of hemoparasite infection in snowy owls (Bubo scandiacus). These animals were infected with a variety of hemoparasites, including Plasmodium, Haemoproteus, and Leukocytozoon spp. Death of one of these birds due to hemoparasite burden led to a change in the monitoring for and treatment of subclinical hemoparasitic infections in this species. Three subsequently infected snowy owls have been treated with primaquine and chloroquine. The birds that were treated survived infection, and parasite burdens in peripheral blood diminished. Postulated reasons for increased morbidity and mortality associated with hemoparasitic infections in captive snowy owls, as opposed to other raptor species, include stress, concurrent disease, novel pathogen exposure, and elevated environmental temperatures. © Copyright 2018 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Ecological theory suggests that prey size should increase with predator size, but this trend may be masked by other factors affecting prey selection, such as environmental constraints or specific prey preferences of predator species. Owls are an ideal case study for exploring how predator body size affects prey selection in the presence of other factors due to the ease of analyzing their diets from owl pellets and their widespread distributions, allowing interspecific comparisons between variable habitats. Here, we analyze various dimensions of prey resource selection among owls, including prey size, taxonomy (i.e., whether or not particular taxa are favored regardless of their size), and prey traits (movement type, social structure, activity pattern, and diet). We collected pellets of five sympatric owl species (Athene noctua, Tyto alba, Asio otus, Strix aluco, and Bubo bubo) from 78 sites across the Mediterranean Levant. Prey intake was compared between sites, with various environmental variables and owl species as predictors of abundance. Despite significant environmental impacts on prey intake, some key patterns emerge among owl species studied. Owls select prey by predator body size: Larger owls tend to feed on wider ranges of prey sizes, leading to higher means. In addition, guild members show both specialization and generalism in terms of prey taxa, sometimes in contrast with the expectations of the predator–prey body size hypothesis. Our results suggest that while predator body size is an important factor in prey selection, taxon specialization by predator species also has considerable impact. © 2018 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The winter home ranges, foraging habitats, and roost characteristics of migrant Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia) have not been described in central Mexico. This information is needed to prioritize habitat conservation measures because the species is in decline across much of western North America. We used VHF telemetry to describe the foraging range, habitat use, and roost sites of 17 Burrowing Owls in two study areas: Irapuato and Zapopan, Mexico. Burrowing Owls did not forage in the daytime. Cropland and grasslands made up the majority of the owls' foraging ranges, which averaged 70 ha. Burrowing Owls responded quickly and opportunistically to changes in land uses that removed tall dense vegetation, such as the harvest of tall crops, and fires. Distances from foraging areas to roost sites averaged 514-751 m, but varied widely from 32-1981 m. Roost characteristics were highly variable between study sites. Overall, Burrowing Owls incorporated anthropogenic land uses into their winter habitat needs. © 2018 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Aim: Geological barriers within a species range play a key role in shaping patterns of genetic variation by restricting gene flow. Mountain ranges are particularly imposing barriers responsible for creating genetic differentiation across multiple taxa, from small amphibians to large mammals and birds. Here, we examined the population structure of North American barn owls (Tyto alba) and investigated whether the Rocky Mountains influence gene flow and dispersal at the continental scale. Location: Continental North America. Methods: We collected 292 museum samples covering the species range, genotyped them at 20 microsatellite markers and sequenced 410 bp of the mitochondrial gene ND6. Population and landscape genetics tools were used to study range-wide patterns of structure and identify gene flow barriers. Ring recapture data were also analysed to investigate individual movement patterns and frequency of exchanges between both sides of the Rocky Mountains. Results: We found faint overall genetic structure, which is consistent with barn owl's high mobility across its continuous range. Nonetheless, we identified two distinct genetic groups on the western and eastern regions of the Rocky Mountains with a likely contact point through the narrow southern pass between them and the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. Accordingly, most recaptured barn owls remain on the same side of the mountains. The Rockies appear to significantly isolate the populations in the west, which, as a consequence, display lower genetic diversity than their counterparts to the east. Main conclusions: The Rocky Mountains appear to constrain barn owl dispersal and gene flow. Our study supports the hypothesis that regional landscape barriers can shape gene flow and population structure even in highly mobile organisms. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

ABSTRACT: Background and purpose: The assumption that the species composition and the relative abundance of small mammals in pellets of Barn Owls reflects the landscape structure of the hunting area is tested, based on habitat preferences of small mammals identified from pellets collected in the hilly and lowland parts of Baranja county (Croatia). Materials and methods: During 2007 we collected 2395 whole pellets and their fragments in 21 localities, from which 6613 prey remains were identified as belonging to small mammals (99.5%) of 23 species. The correlation between the relative abundance of mammal species and landscape structures (habitat types and landscape features) was tested. Results: There was a significant correlation between the relative abundance of seven small mammal species and the proportion of particular landscape structure classes. The number of small mammal species showed a negative correlation with the area of inland marshes. The evenness of the small mammal fauna grew with the mosaicity of landscape and the length of the borders in the owl’s hunting area. In the total prey the Common Vole (Microtus arvalis) dominated with more than 62%, which indicates its population outbreak. The diversity and evenness of small mammals in the hilly and lowland regions did not differ. Conclusions: We found significant correlations between the relative abundance of some small mammal species and the landscape structure classes in the owls’ hunting area. Our results suggested that the diversity of small mammals increases as the mosaic of the landscape increases, while the degree of population outbreak of the Common Vole decreases. These relationships should be taken into consideration when designing landscapes or changing land use. © 2018, Croatian Society of Natural Sciences. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: A total of eight juvenile great horned owls (Bubo virginianus) were found lethargic and on the ground in spring 2015, 2016, and 2017, including one fledgling from Louisiana, USA and seven nestlings from California, USA. One bird survived to release after rehabilitation; seven birds died or were euthanized due to poor prognosis and were necropsied. Necropsy findings were similar and included general pallor of all tissues, particularly the subcutis and lungs, and enlarged liver and spleen. Histopathology revealed multi-organ necrosis, abundant meronts containing merozoites, and intracytoplasmic pigmented haemosporidian parasites in blood cells in one bird. Leucocytozoon lineages lSTOCC16 and BUVIR06 were identified by polymerase chain reaction and genetic sequencing. The systemic Leucocytozoon infections were likely associated with morbidity and mortality in these owls. A second parasite, Haemoproteus lineage hSTVAR01, was also identified in an owl from Louisiana. This is the first identification of Leucocytozoon lineages that have been associated with mortality in young great horned owls. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Western Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia hypugaea) frequently nest near agricultural lands. In southwestern Idaho, greater population density in agricultural landscapes appears to be driven in part by reliable and abundant prey populations. However, these potential benefits may be offset if agricultural land use increases pesticide exposure, especially during the sensitive reproduction period. Thus, we investigated the extent to which Burrowing Owls nesting near croplands within the Morley Nelson Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area (NCA), Idaho, were exposed to organophosphate (OP), carbamate (CB), and/or organochlorine (OC) pesticides. We examined plasma cholinesterase activity, OP and CB residues in foot-wash samples, and OCs in soils and whole egg contents collected from owls and their nests along a distance gradient from agricultural fields. We further measured eggshell thickness to assess potential for thinning from OC exposure. There was no inhibition of cholinesterase activities in adult or nestling owls near agriculture, and foot-wash samples from adults tested negative for OP and CB pesticides. The OC p,p′-DDE, a metabolite of DDT, occurred in eggs at 27 of 58 nests, but there was some evidence that concentrations increased with increasing distance from agriculture. Concentrations of p,p′-DDE in eggs were relatively low compared to harmful levels in other avian species, were not correlated with eggshell thickness, and did not appear to reduce nesting success. Neither DDT, its metabolites, nor any other OCs were detected in soil samples from local owl breeding areas. These results indicate that p,p′-DDE, organophosphate, and carbamate exposure were not causing toxicity or reproductive impairment of Burrowing Owls in the NCA during our study years. © 2018 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Northern saw-whet owls (Aegolius acadicus) are known for their unique asymmetrical ear structure and ability to localize prey acoustically, yet few attempts have been made to explore the auditory capabilities of this species. In this study, we evoked auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) with tonebursts to assess three main hypotheses regarding the evolution of auditory sensitivity: sender-receiver matching, ecological constraints, and phylogenetic/morphological constraints. We found that ABR amplitude increased with increasing stimulus level, which is consistent with results in other avian species. ABR amplitudes, latencies, and thresholds indicate that the hearing range of Northern saw-whet owls extends from 0.7 to 8.6 kHz, with an extended frequency range of best sensitivity between 1.6 and 7.1 kHz. Sensitivity fell off rapidly above and below these frequencies. The average audiogram was structurally similar to those found in other species of owls, suggesting that phylogeny or morphology may be constraining the frequency range of auditory sensitivity. However, ABR thresholds were 10–25 dB lower than those of Eastern screech-owls (Megascops asio), with thresholds below 0 dB SPL in some individuals. The lowest thresholds were at frequencies not found in the vocalizations of Northern saw-whet owls, suggesting ecological constraints rather than conspecific vocalizations are driving absolute sensitivity. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

ABSTRACT: Migratory species can exploit many habitats over vast geographic areas and adopt various patterns of space and habitat use throughout their annual cycle. In nomadic species, determinants of habitat use during the non-breeding season are poorly known due to the unpredictability of their movement patterns. Here, we analysed variability in wintering space and habitat use by a highly nomadic species, the snowy owl, in eastern North America. Using 21 females tracked by satellite telemetry between 2007 and 2016, we 1) assessed how space use patterns in winter varied according to the type of environment (marine vs terrestrial), latitudinal zone (Arctic vs temperate), local snow conditions and lemming densities and 2) investigated winter habitat and site fidelity. Our results confirmed a high inter-individual variation in patterns of habitat use by wintering snowy owls. Highly-used areas were concentrated in the Arctic and in the marine and coastal environments. Owls wintering in the marine environment travelled over longer distances during the winter, had larger home ranges and these were divided in more smaller zones than individuals in terrestrial environments. Wintering home range sizes decreased with high winter lemming densities, use of the marine environment increased following high summer lemming densities, and a thick snow cover in autumn led to later settlement on the wintering ground. Contrary to expectations, snowy owls tended to make greater use of the marine environment when snow cover was thin. Snowy owls were highly consistent in their use of a given wintering environment and a specific latitudinal zone between years, but demonstrated flexibility in their space use and a modest site fidelity. The snowy owls’ consistency in wintering habitat use may provide them with advantages in terms of experience but their mobility and flexibility may help them to cope with changing environmental conditions at fine spatial scale. © 2018 The Authors

ABSTRACT: An increasing urbanization of habitats in which birds live influences their populations by modifying behaviour, dietary composition, causes of mortality and variables related to breeding. This study aimed to compare breeding periods and productivity among tawny owls, Strix aluco, inhabiting either an urban or an extra-urban area. Studies were conducted in parallel in two locations: central zone of Warsaw-the Polish capital-and the Rogów Forest-ca 70 km west of Warsaw. Number of fledglings and the beginning of the breeding period was assessed by direct observations and listening to calls of juveniles within tawny owl territories. Birds in the urban area were found to start breeding significantly earlier (from 5th February) than those in the extra-urban area (from 17th March). However, the two populations proved to be similarly productive, with 3.2 or 3.4 young per nest on average. The phenomenon of early breeding in city dwelling birds was confirmed in other tawny owl populations as well as other bird species. It can be potentially driven by factors such as higher temperature, artificial light and rich and stable food base. © 2018 Polish Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Morphological differentiation of island-dwelling organisms provides model systems for studying evolution. Computed tomography (CT) scanning is an entirely non-destructive technique that provides detailed three-dimensional (3D) images of physical structures. Geometric morphometrics has been increasingly used in avian morphology studies by analyzing 3D data obtained from CT scans. We used geometric morphometrics to evaluate the morphological details of the skulls of three, genetically distinct, island populations of the Ryukyu Scops Owl Otus elegans: O. e. elegans from the northern part of the Ryukyu Archipelago, O. e. elegans from the southern part of the Ryukyu Archipelago, and O. e. interpositus from Minami-daito Island. Skulls were scanned using an X-ray CT system and the digitized 3D coordinates of 16 landmarks for each skull were analyzed in order to describe geometric morphometric features. O. e. interpositus was found to have a significantly smaller skull than either population of O. e. elegans. From principle component analysis of shape variation, we also found that the skull shape of O. e. interpositus differed significantly from both the northern and southern groups of O. e. elegans. This difference was in terms of PC1, which mainly represented relative anteroposterior length, and angle of the orbit. We inferred that the small skull of O. e. interpositus is partly a consequence of the particular founders of the population, or evolutionary selection that has taken place on Minami-daito Island and that the distinctive shape of the skull of O. e. interpositus is partly a consequence of adaptations for foraging efficiency, or of morphological integration. © The Ornithological Society of Japan 2018.

ABSTRACT: Response adaptation is the change of the firing rate of neurons induced by a preceding stimulus. It can be found in many sensory systems and throughout the auditory pathway. We investigated response adaptation in the external nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICX) of barn owls (Tyto furcata), a nocturnal bird of prey and specialist in sound localization. Individual neurons in the ICX represent locations in auditory space by maximally responding to combinations of interaural time and level differences (ITD and ILD). Neuronal responses were recorded extracellularly under ketamine-diazepam anesthesia. Response adaptation was observed in three double stimulation paradigms. In two paradigms, the same binaural parameters for both stimuli were chosen. A variation of the level of the second stimulus yielded a level increase sufficient to compensate for adaptation around 5 dB. Introducing a silent interstimulus interval (ISI) resulted in recovery from adaptation. The time course of recovery was followed by varying the ISI, and full recovery was found after an ISI of 50 ms. In a third paradigm, the ITD of the second stimulus was varied to investigate the representation of ITD under adaptive conditions. We found that adaptation led to an increased precision and improved selectivity while the best ITD was stable. These changes of representation remained for longer ISIs than were needed to recover from response adaptation at the best ITD. Stimuli with non-best ITDs could also induce similar adaptive effects if the neurons responded to these ITDs. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We demonstrate and characterize response adaptation in neurons of the auditory space map in the barn owl’s midbrain with acoustic double-stimulation paradigms. An increase of the second level by 5 dB compensated for the observed adaptive effect. Recovery from adaptation was faster than in upstream nuclei of the auditory pathway. Our results also show that response adaptation might improve precision and selectivity in the representation of interaural time difference. © 2018 American Physiological Society.

ABSTRACT: The diet of the barn owl Tyto alba was studied at the Kızılırmak Delta (Northern Turkey) between May 2014 and May 2015. A total of 436 pellets were analysed and 1118 prey remains (mammals, birds, amphibians and insects) were encountered. Participation of animal species in the diet was assessed on the basis of their frequency (F%) and biomass (B%). Nine mammal taxa (3 of Eulipotyphla, 1 of Chiroptera and 5 of Rodentia) were found in the diet composition. Mammals (F=96.8%, B=95.65%) were more frequent in the diet content than other groups (F=<4%, B=<5%). White-toothed shrews Crocidura spp. were the most frequent prey (annual F=64%, B=34.9%). Voles Microtus spp. (F= 18.3%, B=28.76%) were more abundant in summer. Rats Rattus spp. were only found in autumn (F=0.5%, B=6.03%) and winter (F=0.5%, B=4.59%). The distribution of preys in the content of the barn owl diet did not vary seasonally (p>0.05). Both prey diversity and evenness were low. © 2018 Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. All Rights Reserved.

ABSTRACT: The 3 spotted owl (Strix occidentalis) subspecies in North America (i.e., northern spotted owl [S. o. caurina], California spotted owl [S. o. occidentalis], Mexican spotted owl [S. o. lucida]) have all experienced population declines over the past century due to habitat loss and fragmentation from logging. Now, the emerging influences of climate change, high-severity fire, and barred owl (Strix varia) invasion also appear to be synergistically and differentially affecting population trends of each subspecies. Our objective was to review the existing literature on the spotted owl to describe historical and emerging threats and whether those threats have been adequately examined for each subspecies. Using 527 publications from a Web of Science search of the literature from 1900–2015, we statistically evaluated the emphasis placed on each subspecies regarding 4 influences: mechanical tree removal, fire, climate change, and barred owl invasion. There were 98 papers that explicitly examined the effects of ≥1 of these influences. Most of these papers were focused on the northern spotted owl, and for all 3 subspecies, most papers examined short-term effects only. We used our results to identify significant information gaps relative to historical and emerging threats. Commercial timber harvesting remains a potential threat for all 3 spotted owl subspecies, but effects from forest thinning may be increasing because of the heightened emphasis on fuels reduction and forest restoration treatments on public lands. Owl response to mechanical tree removal, especially forest thinning, remains understudied. Climate change also may threaten all 3 subspecies. Changes in climate likely affect survival and reproduction of spotted owls and their prey, and alter habitat availability by affecting disturbance regimes and vegetation composition and succession, but little empirical information is available describing specific responses to climate change. The literature on response to high-severity fire is sparse for some subspecies, primarily short-term in nature, and not consistent. Barred owl invasion is a major threat to the northern spotted owl and the California spotted owl but does not currently threaten the Mexican spotted owl. Rigorous research on the response of spotted owls to all factors influencing population change, particularly for the Mexican spotted owl, is needed. The most useful information for predicting owl response to these threats stems primarily from long-term studies of owl demography. The lack of such studies within the range of the Mexican spotted owl greatly limits our understanding of its population dynamics and our ability to predict the effects of various threats on Mexican spotted owl populations. For all 3 subspecies, we encourage long-term studies of their responses to threats, using uniquely marked owls across large spatial extents to account for spatiotemporal variability in ecological conditions within and among subspecies. © 2018 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2018

ABSTRACT: In Mexico, the ferruginous pygmy-owl (Glaucidium brasilianum) is widely distributed and is considered a generalist predator consuming insects, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians. In this note we report the first evidence of a ferruginous pygmy-owl consuming an entire iguana (Iguana iguana) in the state of Veracruz, Mexico, on 7 July 2012 near Rio Jamapa, and include feeding behavior. Although the ferruginous pygmy-owl has been known to feed on reptiles, this is the first documented case of this owl feeding on this species of lizard. This event permits us to increase the knowledge about the diet of this predator and provides the way in which the pygmy-owl consumes prey items. © 2016 Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles.

ABSTRACT: Breeding dispersal, the movement between successive breeding sites, is important to many aspects of life history and population dynamics but poorly understood for many raptor populations. We used longitudinal data collected from Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia) nesting in southwestern Idaho from 1994-2007 to examine characteristics of breeding dispersal behavior. First, we measured frequency and distance of breeding dispersal and compared those to published results from other owl populations. The dispersal frequency (78%, n = 86) was greater than previously reported for any Burrowing Owl population and for most owl species. The mean distance dispersed (835 ± 98 m SE) was slightly greater than reported distances for most other Burrowing Owl populations. Second, we examined factors associated with two decisions owls faced between breeding seasons: whether to move to a new nest site (dispersal likelihood), and how far to move if dispersing to a new site (dispersal distance). We assessed the potential effects of sex, productivity, age, and site quality on breeding dispersal likelihood and distance. Owls were more likely to disperse if they were female and if they had fledged fewer young in the previous breeding season. Nesting failure was a perfect predictor of breeding dispersal, but high productivity did not always result in philopatry. Owls dispersed farther if they were relatively younger, female, had lower productivity in the previous breeding season, and had previously nested in lower quality sites. Our comparisons to other studies indicate that the factors that most influence breeding dispersal behavior in Burrowing Owls appear to vary among populations and may relate to migration tendency and geographic heterogeneity. © 2018 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Long-eared Owls (Asio otus) usually winter in groups in settlements, hunt at night and rest in evergreen trees during the day. From prey remnants regurgitated as pellets, one can detect species present in their hunting areas and changes in their abundance. Our aim was to reveal how the ratio of small mammal species in Long-eared Owl prey changes during the winter, since weather can influence hunting success and the availability of prey. There were 40-60 Long-eared Owls wintering in the city of Pécs. From November 2014 to mid-March 2015 we collected 6,328 pellets from which 9,087 prey remains were identified. 97.5% of prey consisted of small mammals belonging to 21 species. The diversity of small mammals in the pellets collected in November was significantly lower in comparison with other months. With the increase of precipitation, the relative abundance of the Common Vole (Microtus arvalis) and Common Dormouse (Muscardinus avellanarius) decreased, while that of the Striped Field Mouse (Apodemus agrarius) and Wood Mouse (A. sylvaticus) increased. In the periods when the area was covered by snow, the ratio of the Common Vole as prey continually decreased, probably because it stayed under the snow. Since the availability of the Common Vole declined, the proportions of the Striped Field Mouse and Lesser White-toothed Shrew (Crocidura suaveolens) as alternative prey grew significantly. In low temperature periods, Brown Rats (Rattus norvegicus) and birds are more often preyed upon. Despite the hunting area being predominantly urban, species preferring open grassland habitats were significantly more common. As winter progressed, the role of forest-dwelling species in the diet continuously increased. © 2018 Science Reviews 2000 Ltd. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Snowy Owls Bubo scandiacus often face the sun when sitting on the ground or when perched. Such sun-orienting has been suggested to represent a visual display to conspecifics but other explanations have not been thoroughly examined. We observed the orientation of wintering Snowy Owls to both the sun and the wind, and their perching behaviour during two winters in central Saskatchewan, Canada. We proposed three new explanations for sun orientation in addition to the display hypothesis: thermoregulation, hunting and defence against predators. On sunny days, 44% of 710 Owls faced the sun; this was non-random because few did so on overcast days. Sun- as opposed to wind-orienting was strongly associated with weather conditions. Logistic regressions indicated that at temperatures below –13 °C and at wind speeds greater than about 18 km/h, Owls tended to orient to the wind rather than to the sun. The likelihood of wind-orienting increased if the Owl perched above the ground, whereas the likelihood of sun-orientating increased slightly when the Owl was sitting on the ground. There was no difference between the sexes in orienting behaviour. Snowy Owls seemed to prioritize wind-orienting for thermoregulation but the results are also consistent with the idea that sun-orientation can reduce heat loss. Facing into the sun did not support the hunting explanation because the birds would have been blinded and not able to see prey, but was consistent with the protection explanation if it helps to increase vigilance against enemies. Although we cannot completely rule out the display explanation, the spatial context of sunning Owls and a lack of a sex effect makes it unlikely that this is the main function. Instead, Owls seem to trade-off wind- vs. sun-orienting according to the prevailing weather conditions and do so mainly to thermoregulate and perhaps to maintain vigilance. © 2017 British Ornithologists' Union

ABSTRACT: The northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) is a federally-threatened subspecies in the United States associated with late-successional forests. In mesic forests it nests primarily in tree cavities, but also uses various types of external platform nests in drier forests. We describe 1717 northern spotted owl nests in 16 different tree species in five study areas in Washington and Oregon in the Pacific Northwest, USA. The vast majority of nests (87%) were in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) trees, except on the Olympic Peninsula, Washington, where nests were about equally abundant in Douglas-fir, western red cedar (Thuja plicata), and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) trees. Distribution of nests was 57.9% in top cavities of trees with broken tops, 20.3% in side cavities of hollow tree trunks, and 21.8% on external platforms of trees. Platforms were most common in the two driest study areas in the Eastern Cascades Physiographic Province, Washington (89% of nests), and the Klamath Province, Oregon (32%). The vast majority (89%) of nests were in trees with intact or declining crowns. Nests in dead trees were most common on the Olympic Peninsula. Nest trees with top and side cavities were larger and much more prevalent in study areas where annual precipitation was highest (Olympic Peninsula, Oregon Coast Range). Large nest cavities and platforms used by northern spotted owls occur almost exclusively in old forest. Managing for the retention of such forests and for their replacement is a significant challenge for land managers, especially in the face of climate change and an increasing human population, but will likely be required for the persistence of viable populations of northern spotted owls.

ABSTRACT: Annual variation in the diet, composition, and prey diversity of Tengmalm’s owl Aegolius funereus (Linnaeus, 1758) was investigated in high-mountain coniferous forests of Mt. Kopaonik (central Serbia) during 3 consecutive years. Prey remains and decomposed pellets (detritus) were collected at the bottom of nest-boxes during 2 separate periods: during mating and after nesting. Prey remains such as maxillae, mandibles, beaks, or feathers were used for prey identification. In total, 438 prey items were separated and identified. Small mammals represented the most numerous class of prey (87.23%). The most frequent prey item was bank vole Myodes glareolus (23.29%). During the nesting season the proportion of voles eaten was significantly higher in comparison with the mating period. The mean prey weight was 20.74 g. In the study area, according to diversity index calculations, prey diversity was high and it seems that the number of breeding attempts by Tengmalm’s owl showed dependence on the annual abundance of small rodents, but further research is needed to confirm this assertion. © TÜBİTAK.

ABSTRACT: Broadening our knowledge of olfactory communication in strictly monogamous systems can inform our understanding of how chemosignals may facilitate social and reproductive behavior between the sexes. Compared to other social and mating systems, relatively little is known about olfactory communication in strictly monogamous non-human primates. Furthermore, platyrrhines are not well represented in chemical analyses of glandular secretions. We conducted semi-quantitative headspace gas chromatography with mass spectrometry to investigate the chemical components of glandular secretions from the subcaudal and pectoral glands of a strictly pair-living platyrrhine, the owl monkey (Aotus spp.). In this study, the first chemical analysis of a wild platyrrhine population, our goals were to (1) conduct a robust analysis of glandular secretions from both captive and wild owl monkey populations and (2) identify whether biologically relevant traits are present in glandular secretions. We also compared and contrasted the results between two Aotus species in different environmental contexts: wild Aotus azarae (N = 33) and captive A. nancymaae (N = 104). Our findings indicate that secretions from both populations encode sex, gland of origin, and possibly individual identity. These consistent patterns across species and contexts suggest that secretions may function as chemosignals. Our data also show that wild A. azarae individuals are chemically discriminated by age (adult or subadult). Among the captive A. nanycmaae, we found chemical differences associated with location, possibly caused by dietary differences. However, there was no noticeable effect of contraception on the chemical profiles of females, nor evidence that closely related individuals exhibit more similar chemical profiles in A. nancymaae. Overall, our data suggest that glandular secretions of both wild and captive Aotus convey specific information. Future studies should use behavioral bioassays to evaluate the ability of owl monkeys to detect signals, and consider whether odor may ultimately facilitate social and sexual relationships between male and female owl monkeys. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Athene cunicularia’s diet is composed of vertebrates and invertebrates, whose relative frequencies can change in space or time. We analyse habitat and temporal variation in the weight and the composition of prey in bird pellets. We collected 396 pellets from nine owl couples for six months and in three open habitats: near forest, far from forest, and urban. Mean pellet weight was 1.03 g. August showed pellets 15% heavier and March 22% lighter than average, differing from the other months. Regarding composition of prey, vertebrates occurred more in the pellets during June, July and August, while invertebrates showed higher frequency in summer months in open habitats far from forest. At the lower taxonomic level, we identified the presence of mammals, serpents, amphibians, birds, beetles, ants, spiders, grasshoppers, woodlice, molluscs and cockroaches in the pellets. The diet during winter in open habitats far from forest showed higher presence of mammals, while summer months in open habitats near forest and in urban habitats showed more hymenopterans. The results showed that A. cunicularia preys on a wide spectrum of prey, but we found some preference for specific prey depending on the season and on the open habitat types. © 2018, Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos.

ABSTRACT: Owls are known for their nocturnal hunting capability. Many owl species are able to localize prey in complete darkness just by hearing. Sound localization of strictly nocturnal owls is improved by asymmetrically arranged outer ears. According to Norberg (1977), who worked with adult owls, asymmetrical ears evolved at least four times independently among owls. What is unknown so far is how the ear asymmetry develops in the embryo. Here we examine the embryonic development of ear asymmetry in the American barn owl (Tyto furcata pratincola) in the frame of the 42 stages suggested by Köppl et al. (2005). In this species, the left ear opening in the skin is located higher than its counterpart on the right. Micro-CT scans show that in an anatomically defined coordinate system, the ear openings initially appear symmetrically as does the skull as well as the eyes, the nasal openings, the stapes and the squamosum. The ear openings are initially located ventrally in the skull. Soon after their appearance, the ear openings start to move dorso-occipitally. At the developmental stages 36–39, the left ear opening moves faster than the right one. In this way, an ear asymmetry develops within a few developmental stages. The skull and the other anatomical markers remain symmetrical. Thus, these data show that the soft tissue asymmetry in the barn owl develops already before hatching. It will be interesting to compare the time course described here with the time course of development in owl species with bony ear asymmetries. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH

ABSTRACT: One common strategy to mitigate the loss of natural nest burrows for Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia) from ground-disturbing activities has been the installation of artificial burrows outside the disturbance area. I assessed the effectiveness of artificial burrows as a mitigation tool at two study sites in northern California. Parameters included nesting success at natural and artificial burrows; long-term occupancy rates of maintained and unmaintained artificial burrows; choice of burrow type (natural vs. artificial burrows) by owls raised in artificial burrows; and site fidelity and natal philopatry of Burrowing Owls raised in artificial burrows. I analyzed long-term datasets biologists collected from 1990 through 2012, including demographic data, band resightings, and burrow maintenance records. Nesting success at artificial burrows was significantly higher than at natural burrows at both study sites. At one site, nesting success at artificial burrows was 83% compared to 76% at natural burrows (P = 0.035); at the other site, nesting success at artificial burrows was 96% compared to 75% at natural burrows (P = 0.036). Artificial burrows that received annual surface maintenance were occupied for a significantly longer time (2.1 ± 1.9 yr; n = 57) than unmaintained artificial burrows (0.5 ±1.0 yr, n = 51; U = 561, P < 0.001) during the first 8 yr post-installation. Even with surface maintenance, occupancy rates declined from 44% (n = 25) of burrows occupied during the first year post-installation, to 28% (n = 15) of burrows occupied during the fourth year post-installation. Based on this decline, regular maintenance of the entire artificial burrow, including tunnel and nest chamber, may be crucial for longer-term use. Of 120 Burrowing Owls raised in maintained artificial burrows and resighted during subsequent breeding seasons, 70% occupied artificial burrows and 30% natural burrows. Only 3% of these owls occupied their natal burrow during the first nesting season post-fledging. Of those owls that were resighted during two or more nesting seasons, almost half (48%) occupied different artificial burrows from one year to the next; therefore, the number of artificial burrows at a management site should be sufficient to provide opportunities for Burrowing Owls to move between nest burrows from year to year. © 2018 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The invasion of the Pacific Northwest, USA by northern barred owls (Strix varia) is a conservation conundrum because it contributes to lingering declines in populations of northern spotted owls (Strix occidentalis caurina). We evaluated factors influencing nocturnal (i.e., foraging) habitat selection by northern barred owls using a repeated-studies design and information-theoretic methods across 3 Pacific Northwest study areas, each containing a broad range of forest and environmental conditions. We constructed discrete-choice resource selection functions (RSF) based upon telemetry points linked to forest inventory plots and map-based physical environmental metrics within home ranges of radio-tagged barred owls at Chehalis, Washington (n = 16), Springfield, Oregon (n = 22), and Arcata, California (n = 15). A general RSF based upon pooling data across study areas suggested barred owls selectively hunted for prey in lower-slope positions on southerly aspects often near streams at low elevations, and often within red alder (Alnus rubra) dominated stands or in moderately dense patches of medium- and large-diameter coniferous trees close to patches containing nests. The relative probability of use decreased with increasing densities of small-diameter trees, suggesting barred owls avoided clearcuts and young plantations. These general patterns were modified by study-area variation in tree species composition and density. Study-area-specific factors that were associated positively with barred owl habitat selection included increasing basal area of western redcedar (Thuja plicata) and red alder at Chehalis and increasing densities of western redcedar and basal area of bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum) and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) at Springfield. At Arcata, high densities of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) trees and increasing basal area of tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus) were negatively associated with barred owl habitat selection. Seasonal patterns of habitat selection did not differ dramatically although model coefficients suggested selection for specific tree species was weaker in the non-breeding season and barred owls did not seek topographic situations that provided thermo-regulatory benefits. The information may help inform conservation strategies for reducing competition between barred owls and northern spotted owls or perhaps in predicting colonization of new areas by barred owls. © 2017 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2017

ABSTRACT: Owl monkeys (Aotus spp.) are socially monogamous, yet allogrooming is reported to be rare. Because Aotus are nocturnal and arboreal, allogrooming is difficult to observe in natural settings. We observed 21 male-female pairs of captive Aotus nancymaae during 2 nonconsecutive study periods in order to describe the details of allogrooming between mates (partner grooming). We found that grooming bouts are brief and consist of tugging the hair or skin with flexed fingers and/or the mouth. Males groomed females most often, and their rates of partner grooming were negatively related to age. Partner grooming occurred regardless of mating behavior. Camera trap data revealed that the rate of partner grooming (1.50 bouts/h) is greater than that recorded from our direct observations in the early evenings (0.51 bouts/h, in 2013; 0.37 bouts/h in 2003) given that most bouts occurred later in the night. A positive relationship between the rates of the parents' partner grooming and those of their offspring later in life suggests intergenerational transmission. This relationship is influenced by the fathers' rates of partner grooming. We conclude that allogrooming in Aotus is a normal part of their behavioral repertoire that likely serves social functions similar to those in other pair-bonded primates. © 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel.

ABSTRACT: Most uses of remotely sensed satellite data to characterize wildlife habitat have used metrics such as mean NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) in a year or season. These simple metrics do not take advantage of the temporal patterns in NDVI within and across years and the spatial arrangement of cells with various temporal NDVI signatures. Here we use 13 years of data from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) to bin individual MODIS pixels (5.3 ha) into phenoclasses, where each phenoclass consists of pixels with a particular temporal profile of NDVI, regardless of spatial location. We present novel procedures that assign sites to phenoclusters, defined as particular composition of phenoclasses within a 1 km radius. We apply these procedures to Mexican spotted owl (Strix occidentalis lucida) nesting locations in the Sacramento Mountain range in south-central New Mexico. Phenoclasses at owl nest sites and phenoclusters around owl nest sites differed from those at and around points randomly placed in forest types that are known to support nesting owls. Stand exam data showed that the phenoclasses associated with owl nest sites are dominated by Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and white fir (Abies concolor). The availability of phenoclusters and phenoclasses on Mescalero Apache tribal lands differed from those on adjacent National Forest lands within the Sacramento Mountain, consistent with different elevations and forest management practices. Nonetheless owls predominately used the same phenoclasses and phenoclusters in both land ownerships. MODIS phenoclasses and phenoclusters offer a useful means of remotely identifying forest conditions suitable for wildlife. Because the remote sensing data are freely available and regularly updated, they can be part of a cost effective approach to monitor and assess forested wildlife habitat over large temporal and spatial scales. © 2017

ABSTRACT: Presence or abundance of owls is frequently assessed using call-broadcast surveys to elicit responses and increase detection rates, but can draw owls in from a distance and could affect conclusions about fine-scale habitat associations. Passive acoustic surveys with field personnel or autonomous recording units (ARUs) may be a less biased method for surveying owls. Automated recognition techniques have proven useful to process large volumes of acoustic recordings from ARUs, and we sought to test the utility of automated recognition for three owl species. We built templates or "recognizers" for the territorial calls of the Barred Owl (Strix varia), the Boreal Owl (Aegolius funereus), and the Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus). We assessed the performance of each recognizer by evaluating precision, processing time, and false negatives. We used ARUs to survey for owls in northeastern Alberta, Canada, and compared the results from the recognizers to results from researchers listening to a subsample of the recordings. We verified the results to filter out false positives, but verification time was substantially lower than time spent listening. We processed more recordings and obtained a larger dataset of owl detections than would have been possible with either listening to the recordings only or conducting traditional field surveys without ARUs, suggesting a significant benefit of automated recognition. Precision was quite variable, but false negatives were relatively low and did not affect results of owl habitat associations. Given the relatively low detection rates of owls by listening to recordings, an automated recognition approach is likely to be highly useful for monitoring owls. © 2018 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Habitat loss and fragmentation is recognized as one of the main causes of global biodiversity declines. Birds of prey are considered good environmental bioindicators because they are sensitive to changes in the environment and can suffer local extinctions due to habitat fragmentation. In this study, we aimed to determine whether forest fragment area is correlated with the richness and abundance of owl species, and whether owl species recorded exhibit preferences for fragment edge or interior. The study was undertaken in six remnants of southeastern Atlantic Forest located in Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Six species of owls were recorded: Buff-fronted Owl (Aegolius harrisii), Tropical Screech-Owl (Megascops choliba), Tawny-browed Owl (Pulsatrix koeniswaldiana), Striped Owl (Asio clamator), Mottled Owl (Strix virgata), and Rusty-barred Owl (Strix hylophila). Megascops choliba was the most abundant species. The richness and abundance of species were higher at the edge when compared to the interior of the fragments. The owl species recorded did not seem to prefer the forest interior, while M. Choliba had a preference for forest edges. This study adds new empirical knowledge on the effects of fragmentation on Neotropical owl communities. © Neotropical Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Data collected over the past 25 years reveal that Northern Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) of the Oregon Coast region are being displaced by invasive Barred Owls (Strix varia). A component of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service recovery plan is studying the culling of Barred Owls from Spotted Owl habitat. Using information theory to perform a model selection, we fit the most parsimonious ordinary differential equation competition model to the data. We then augment the model to incorporate Barred Owl culling and determine the minimum culling rate required to completely eliminate the Barred Owl population and the amount of time required to achieve such an elimination for various culling rates. Our analysis shows that even with culling Barred Owls, there exists no coexistence equilibrium given the current growth and competition parameters. Copyright © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: People’s perception on birds of prey is heavily influenced by its intrinsic value, utility, myths and superstitions. In particular, negative perceptions may encourage poaching and persecution of these birds, affecting their conservation status. One nocturnal raptor species widely distributed across the world is the Barn Owl (Tyto alba, Tytonidae). In Chile, this species has been recorded and studied exclusively in rural and sub-urban areas. However, in the city of Valdivia Barn owls exist within the city boundaries. In this study we documented the feeding habits of Barn owls nesting in urban settings of Valdivia, and we analyze the opinions of local neighbors toward the owls. To characterize the diet of owls, we collected all pellets found around their nesting tree on a monthly basis between August 2010 and August 2011. We interviewed the neighbors using a questionnaire that included questions about the utility, ethical or aesthetic value of the owl and the tree where they nested. Our results indicate that the main prey of the Barn Owl was the Long-tailed Colilargo (Oligoryzomys longicaudatus). The neighbors’ perception was favorable to the Barn Owl primarily for aesthetic and ethical reasons, and not utilitarian reasons. Our results suggest that people perception in urban areas is different than in rural areas, where previous studies showed the prevalence of utilitarian values. This positive perception represents a great potential to promote conservation and environmental education in the city, creating a link between people and the natural elements they have in their environment. © 2017, Universidad de Concepcion.

ABSTRACT: Mexico has 34 owl species, but little is known about their ecology particularly for tropical species. Of the 12 genera of owl species in the country, the genera Megascops and Glaucidium are the most diverse with eight species each. Strix has five species and Asio four. Four species are extensively distributed in the country, while others have distributions restricted to only one state in the country: Megascops lambi (endemic to the Pacific slope in the state of Oaxaca), M. barbarus (endemic to the highlands of Chiapas and Guatemala), and G. hoskinsii (endemic to the highlands of South Baja California). Another distributional pattern is altitudinal, where species with a wide latitudinal distribution also have a wide altitudinal distribution (e.g., Tyto furcata, Bubo virginianus). Thirteen species are distributed below 1500 m above sea level, and only seven species have a distribution over an altitude greater than 1500 m. The majority of owl species are forest species, and then the loss of these environments strongly affects their survival. Currently, secondary forests and ecotones have been considered important areas for owls. All of the owl species are included in Appendix II of CITES, and three species are listed on BirdLife International as near threatened (Megascops barbarus, M. seductus, and S. occidentalis). The Mexican Official Norm (NOM-059) currently considers 18 owls in a risk category, the majority is endangered, and three are at risk of extinction. Although these are national categories, there is little empirical information about the population trends or status of these species. The different impacts on and threats to owl populations are local, but also regional. The principal threats are habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation; introduction of exotic species; pesticide contamination; illegal trafficking; and superstitious beliefs of bad luck. Empirical knowledge about this group has been increasing in recent years, primarily for species with species distributed in temperate zones. However, more effort in research should be considered necessary to improve our understanding from descriptive approaches but also functional and evolutionary ones. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

ABSTRACT: Suriname is one of the smallest countries in South America. This country has a bird diversity of approximately 720 species, 15 of which are owls. Little ecological and biological information exist for the owl species. There is only information on their distribution and abundance. There is no information on the conservation status of owls in the country. Suriname has several biosphere reserves and national parks where owls are distributed. More information is needed to determine the conservation status of those species in the country. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

ABSTRACT: Urbanization and agricultural intensification resulting in habitat loss is having a profound negative effect on grassland and farmland birds worldwide. Barn owls (Tyto furcata), as a species, have been affected by this intensification. To evaluate how urbanization and agricultural intensification affects barn owls we sought to address: 1) how human land use influences barn owl hunting behavior and diet, and 2) do habitat and prey choice influence the likelihood of barn owls consuming anticoagulant rodenticide (AR) exposed prey. We radio tagged 11 owls across the rural-urban landscape gradient in the Lower Mainland, British Columbia, and collected sufficient location data on 10 barn owls. We found that the 95% kernel home-ranges ranged from 1.0 to 28.5 km2 (n = 10) and were positively correlated with the proportion of urban land use within home-ranges. Barn owls across all landscapes selected roadside grass verges significantly more than other habitat types within home-ranges, which may reflect the loss of grassland associated agriculture in the region. The risk of consuming AR exposed prey was highest in roadside grass verges compared to other habitat types. However, the overall likelihood of consuming AR exposed prey significantly decreased when the proportion of grass patches within home-ranges increased, which suggests smaller linear grass sections are more likely to contain AR exposed small mammal prey. These results highlight the need to retain and enhance hunting habitat for barn owls during urban development and to mitigate the risk of barn owl road mortality along major highways. © 2017

ABSTRACT: Modelling territorial occupancy and reproductive success is a key issue for better understanding the population dynamics of territorial species. This study aimed to investigate these ecological processes in a Eurasian Eagle-owl (Bubo bubo) population in south-eastern Spain during a seven-year period. A multi-season, multi-state modelling approach was followed to estimate the probabilities of occupancy and reproductive success in relation to previous state, time and habitat covariates, and accounting for imperfect detection. The best estimated models showed past breeding success in the territories to be the most important factor determining a high probability of reoccupation and reproductive success in the following year. In addition, alternative occupancy models suggested the positive influence of crops on the probability of territory occupation. By contrast, the best reproductive model revealed strong interannual variations in the rates of breeding success, which may be related to changes in the abundance of the European Rabbit, the main prey of the Eurasian Eagle-owl. Our models also estimated the probabilities of detecting the presence of owls in a given territory and the probability of detecting evidence of successful reproduction. Estimated detection probabilities were high throughout the breeding season, decreasing in time for unsuccessful breeders but increasing for successful breeders. The probability of detecting reproductive success increased with time, being close to one in the last survey. These results suggest that reproduction failure in the early stages of the breeding season is a determinant factor in the probability of detecting occupancy and reproductive success. © 2017 León-Ortega et al.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this work is to show the Optical Wireless Link to intraSpacecraft Communications (OWLS) technology as a platform technology for space missions, and more specifically its use within the On-Board Communication system of OPTOS satellite. OWLS technology was proposed by Instituto Nacional de Técnica Aeroespacial (INTA) at the end of the 1990s and developed along 10 years through a number of ground demonstrations, technological developments and in-orbit experiments. Its main benefits are: mass reduction, flexibility, and simplification of the Assembly, Integration and Tests phases. The final step was to go from an experimental technology to a platform one. This step was carried out in the OPTOS satellite, which makes use of optical wireless links in a distributed network based on an OLWS implementation of the CAN bus. OPTOS is the first fully wireless satellite. It is based on the triple configuration (3U) of the popular Cubesat standard, and was completely built at INTA. It was conceived to procure a fast development, low cost, and yet reliable platform to the Spanish scientific community, acting as a test bed for space born science and technology. OPTOS presents a distributed OBDH architecture in which all satellite’s subsystems and payloads incorporate a small Distributed On-Board Computer (OBC) Terminal (DOT). All DOTs (7 in total) communicate between them by means of the OWLS-CAN that enables full data sharing capabilities. This collaboration allows them to perform all tasks that would normally be carried out by a centralized On-Board Computer. © 2017, CEAS.

ABSTRACT: The Short-eared Owl (Asio flammeus) is a widespread raptor whose abundance and distribution fluctuates in response to the varying amplitudes of its prey, which are predominately microtines. Previous efforts to describe the seasonal movements of Short-eared Owls have been hindered by few band recoveries and the species' cryptic and irruptive behavior. We attached satellite transmitters to adult Short-eared Owls at breeding areas in western and interior Alaska in June 2009 and July 2010, and tracked their movements for up to 19 mo. Owls initiated long-distance southward movements from Alaska and most followed a corridor east of the Rocky Mountains into the Prairie provinces and Great Plains states. Four owls followed a coastal route west of the Rocky Mountains, including one owl that crossed the Gulf of Alaska. Completed autumn migration distances ranged from 3205-6886 km (mean = 4722 ± 1156 km SD). Wintering areas spanned 21° of latitude from central Montana to southern Texas, and 24° of longitude from central California to western Kansas. Subsequent seasonal migrations were generally northward in spring and southward in autumn; these movements were comparatively short-distance (mean = 767.5 ± 517.4 km SD) and the owls exhibited low site fidelity. The Short-eared Owls we tracked from two relatively local breeding areas in Alaska used a patchwork of diverse open habitats across a large area of North America, which highlights that effective conservation of this species requires a collaborative, continental-scale focus. © 2017 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Information on 13 nocturnal raptors (Strigiformes) distributed in El Salvador was organized using 900 records from 1912 to 2008. Two hundred and fifty-eight bird studies from El Salvador were revised, of which 72 contain information on the group or on individual owl species (50 unpublished papers and 22 published papers). In addition, 18 habitat types were evaluated and classified as natural ecosystems (costal vegetation, mangroves, secondary vegetation, pastures, alluvial forest, deciduous forest, semi-deciduous forest, riparian forest, pine forest, pine-oak forest, oak forest, cloud forest), agrosystems (agricultural land, livestock areas, coffee plantation, cypress tree plantations), and human settlements. The natural ecosystems with greatest diversity were identified in terms of species evenness. Distribution maps of owl species in the country were obtained and used to define classification categories for the species according to their habitat. We determined that five species are habitat generalist, two are habitat specialist of open habitats, three species are generalists of forest areas (they use diverse type of natural forest), and three are specialists of forest areas (they use specific types of natural forest). The main threats to nocturnal raptors are capture for the illegal pet trade and deforestation caused by changes in land use. In the short term, specific information on nocturnal raptors will be necessary in order to define their distribution status in fragmented landscape and the habitat requirements of each owl species. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

ABSTRACT: Competition for critical resources is one of the key mechanisms through which invasive species impact on native communities. Among birds, the widely introduced ring-necked parakeet Psittacula krameri locally affects cavity-nesting communities through competition for suitable tree cavities, although it remains unclear to what extent such competition translates into population declines of native species. Here, we studied the potential for nest site competition between ring-necked parakeets and the native scops owl Otus scops, a small nocturnal migratory raptor, by comparing the spatial distribution of the nest site locations of the raptor before (2002) and after (2015) the parakeet invasion. Pre-invasion nesting sites of scops owls (2002) strongly coincided with those selected by ring-necked parakeets, but although both parakeet and scops owl populations increased during the study period, this was no longer true for 2015. Ring-necked parakeets took over several cavities formerly occupied by scops owls, and land-use data suggest that because of the higher overall breeding densities in 2015, scops owls were forced to occupy suboptimal breeding habitats to minimize nest site competition with invasive parakeets. Ring-necked parakeets start breeding early in the season, a behaviour enabling them to secure the best nest sites first, before the owls return from their wintering grounds. Our study highlights that locally observed competition not necessarily impacts on population dynamics of competing species and thus warns against uncritical extrapolation of smaller scale studies for assessing invasive species risks at larger spatial scales. Nonetheless, given the increasing number of studies demonstrating its competitive capacities, monitoring of ring-necked parakeet populations is prudent and mitigation measures (such as mounting of man-made nest-boxes, which are used by scops owls, but not by parakeets) may be justified when the parakeets are likely to invade areas harbouring cavity-nesters of conservation concern. © 2017 The Zoological Society of London

ABSTRACT: Cyprus Scops Owl, Otus cyprius, has recently been split from Eurasian Scops Owl, Otus scops, partly because of song differences. Spectrographic analysis of a more recent O. cyprius song recording shows that it differs from that of O. scops in phrase length and frequency more than previously analysed recordings. The recorded song is also most unusual in possessing two phrases each containing 11 consecutive quiet notes; these two phrases are also remarkably similar in pattern, timing and amplitude. Previously only three consecutive quiet notes were known from O. cyprius though so far its multiple quiet note phrases have been little studied. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.

ABSTRACT: Behavioral studies are fundamental to understanding how animal populations face global change. Although much research has centered upon the idea that individuals can adaptively modify their behaviors to cope with environmental changes, recent evidence supports the existence of individual differences in suites of correlated behaviors. However, little is known about how selection can change these behavioral structures in populations subject to different environmental constraints. The colonization of urban environments by birds has been related to their inter-individual variability in their fear of humans, measured as their flight initiation distance to an approaching human, such that urban life would select for fearless individuals. This behavior has been demonstrated to be heritable and highly consistent throughout the adult lifespan of burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia). Here, we experimentally assessed, in field conditions, whether urban life involves changes in other behaviors such as exploration and antipredatory response through their correlation with fear of humans. Breeding urban birds were more fearless toward humans and were quicker to explore a new food resource and defend their nests from predators than their rural counterparts. However, while fear of humans positively correlated with exploration and antipredatory response in the rural population, it only correlated with exploration in the urban one. Predator release in urban environments could relax-and even counterselect-antipredator behaviors, thus dismantling the behavioral correlation existent in natural populations. Altogether, our results suggest that rural and urban animals may differ in some behavioral aspects, may be as a consequence of the selection processes acting during the colonization of urban areas as well as the different ecological environments encountered by individuals. © 2017 Carrete and Tella.

ABSTRACT: This book presents a comprehensive biological and ecological information about owls in the neotropic area. In addition the book covers topics such as threats and conservation strategies for these nocturnal birds of prey from 18 Neotropical countries. Owls are a good example of diversification processes and have developed evolutionary characteristics themselves. These species are found almost everywhere in the world but most of them are distributed in tropical areas and about a third of them live in the Neotropics. This biogeographic region has a high biodiversity and even share lineages of species from other continents because at some point all were part of Pangea. Although we still have much to know and understand about this diverse, scarcely studied and threatened group this work aims to be a precedent for future and further research on the subject. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

ABSTRACT: Using radiotelemetry we determined for a managed landscape, seasonal home-range sizes and habitat compositions of the threatened Haida Gwaii subspecies of the Northern Saw-whet Owl (Aegolius acadicus brooksi). We trapped 17 owls, and successfully monitored seven: four adult males from May-June 2011 (spring) and three owls (adult male, juvenile male, juvenile female) from January-February 2012 (winter). The adult males in spring moved up to 2.9 km in a 24-hr survey period and had nonoverlapping 95% fixed kernel home ranges (276-375 ha) that were composed of four defined habitat classes (open, early seral forest, mid-seral forest, older forest). Comparisons between internal core-use areas (50% and 30% fixed kernels) and the larger surrounding 95% fixed kernel home ranges suggested these males used foraging and roosting habitat proportional to its availability within the home ranges. The three tagged winter owls had larger 95% fixed kernel home ranges (690-1310 ha) than those in spring, and moved up to 4.4 km in a 24-hr survey period. Winter home ranges overlapped (14.7-78.4%) and included the four habitat classes. Roosts in spring and winter were confirmed in all but open habitat types. Although our findings suggest that spring and winter home ranges can be composed of a diverse mixture of habitat types, consistent with studies of the subspecies A. a. acadicus, differences in home-range size suggest possible differences in the two subspecies' ecology. Our findings will inform recovery planning for brooksi in managed landscapes. © 2017 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: More than 50 years ago the owl monkey (genus Aotus) was found to be highly susceptible to developing human malaria, making it an excellent experimental model for this disease. Microbes and parasites' (especially malaria) tremendous genetic variability became resolved during our malaria vaccine development, involving conserved peptides having high host cell binding activity (cHABPs); however, cHABPs are immunologically silent and must be specially modified (mHABPs) to induce a perfect fit into major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules (HLA in humans). Since malarial immunity is mainly antibody-mediated and controlled by the HLA-DRB genetic region, ∼1000 Aotus have been molecularly characterised for MHC-DRB, revealing striking similarity between human and Aotus MHC-DRB repertories. Such convergence suggested that a large group of immune protection-inducing protein structures (IMPIPS), highly immunogenic and protection inducers against malarial intravenous challenge in Aotus, could easily be used in humans for inducing full protection against malaria. We highlight the value of a logical and rational methodology for developing a vaccine in an appropriate animal model: Aotus monkeys. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Neonicotinoid pesticides have gained great interest in the last years both for agricultural and domestic use. Since the information on their environmental distribution or the effects derived from exposure to ecosystems and biota is scarce, new analytical techniques are being developed for monitoring studies. In this sense, two extraction techniques based on QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe) methodology to detect the neonicotinoids authorised in Spain (acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, imidacloprid, thiacloprid, nitenpyram and thiamethoxam) were adapted and compared: a) using acetate buffer (AB); and b) using citrate buffer (CB). For detection and quantification, high performance liquid chromatography coupled with time of flight mass spectrometry (HPLC/TOF-MS) was used. The CB method provided a wide range of recoveries (68–134%) and accuracy (4–9%). The AB method provided good recoveries (59–76%, 59% corresponded to clothianidin) precision (4–11%) linearity (0.987–0.998%) and limit of quantification (2–10 ng/mL) for all the compounds. To test the effectiveness of the technique, we analysed 30 blood samples of free-ranging nestlings of Eurasian eagle owl (Bubo bubo). The only compound detected, in one nestling from a dry land farming area, was imidacloprid, with a concentration of 3.28 ng/mL. To our knowledge, this is the first study of neonicotinoid pesticides in free-ranging birds of prey using non-destructive samples, providing the first insight for biomonitoring studies. Further studies, including toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics, are recommended to assess the risk for these species. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Genetic differentiation among Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis) subspecies has been established in prior studies. These investigations also provided evidence for introgression and hybridization among taxa but were limited by a lack of samples from geographic regions where subspecies came into close contact. We analyzed new sets of samples from Northern Spotted Owls (NSO: S. o. caurina) and California Spotted Owls (CSO: S. o. occidentalis) in northern California using mitochondrial DNA sequences (mtDNA) and 10 nuclear microsatellite loci to obtain a clearer depiction of genetic differentiation and hybridization in the region. Our analyses revealed that a NSO population close to the northern edge of the CSO range in northern California (the NSO Contact Zone population) is highly differentiated relative to other NSO populations throughout the remainder of their range. Phylogenetic analyses identified a unique lineage of mtDNA in the NSO Contact Zone, and Bayesian clustering analyses of the microsatellite data identified the Contact Zone as a third distinct population that is differentiated from CSO and NSO found in the remainder of the subspecies' range. Hybridization between NSO and CSO was readily detected in the NSO Contact Zone, with over 50% of individuals showing evidence of hybrid ancestry. Hybridization was also identified among 14% of CSO samples, which were dispersed across the subspecies' range in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The asymmetry of hybridization suggested that the hybrid zone may be dynamic and moving. Although evidence of hybridization existed, we identified no F1 generation hybrid individuals. We instead found evidence for F2 or backcrossed individuals among our samples. The absence of F1 hybrids may indicate that (1) our 10 microsatellites were unable to distinguish hybrid types, (2) primary interactions between subspecies are occurring elsewhere on the landscape, or (3) dispersal between the subspecies' ranges is reduced relative to historical levels, potentially as a consequence of recent regional fires. © 2017 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: We diagnosed renal coccidiosis in two of five Great-horned Owls (Bubo virginianus) examined in eastern Tennessee, US, 2007–13. Histopathologic examination of the kidneys revealed multifocal mild-to-moderate dilation and epithelial hyperplasia of collecting ducts. Renal collecting duct epithelial cells contained intracytoplasmic microgametocytes, macrogametocytes, and sporulating and sporulated oocysts. Renal coccidiosis in affected birds did not result in significant inflammation. Sequence analysis of the amplified partial 18S short subunit ribosomal RNA coding region from examination of formalin fixed tissue by using PCR disclosed a 93% identity to Eimeria reichenowi in GenBank, suggesting a novel Eimeria sp. © Wildlife Disease Association 2017.

ABSTRACT: Using existing information from museum collections, field studies, and bibliography regarding barn owls and typical owls of Panama, we have succeeded in documenting the status and ecology of at least 13 of the 15 species of the order Strigiformes across the country. In Panama, the order Strigiformes is represented by 15 species (1 barn owl and 14 typical owls), two of which are considered uncertain (Bubo virginianus and Athene cunicularia) because of scarce evidence. The first species has been reported in at least two protected areas and the second in none, thence the importance of further research studies in order to confirm the existence of these species in those areas. In terms of conservation, one species (Bubo virginianus) is considered endangered and the rest are considered vulnerable under the Panamanian laws of conservation. Megascops clarkii, Glaucidium costaricanum, and Aegolius ridgwayi are species restricted to the cloud forests of Panama, which are protected habitats in the eastern and western regions of Panama (reported in seven, six, and two areas, respectively). In contrast, species like Megascops choliba and M. guatemalae, Lophostrix cristata, Pulsatrix perspicillata, Ciccaba virgata, and C. nigrolineata are widely distributed in lowlands and foothills and are reported in at least 25 protected areas. Others, such as Pseudoscops clamator, Tyto alba, Glaucidium griseiceps, and G. brasilianum, are also widely distributed in lowlands and foothills of both Pacific and Atlantic slopes; these species are reported in at least 17, 14, 20, and 7 protected areas, respectively. None of the management plans reviewed presented conservation measures for the Strigiformes, thus making evident the need to implement research studies with objectives that underpin programs for conservation and reasonable use of the national and private forest areas throughout the country, consequentially protecting the associated biodiversity, particularly avifauna. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

ABSTRACT: Temporal variation in physical activity is mainly determined by the day–night cycle. While this may be true for diurnal species whose vision at night is often poor, the situation might be more complex in nocturnal animals as many such species can see both in the dark and in the daylight. We examined in Barn Owl (Tyto alba) nestlings whether temporal variation of behavioural activities and sleep is shaped by parental feeding visits occurring during the first part of the night and the extent to which they also occur during daylight hours. We measured several behaviours in 280 individuals from 90 broods recorded in 4 years. Parental feeding visits progressively declined in frequency from the beginning to the end of the night, and a number of offspring behaviours followed the same pattern of activity (feeding, vocalization and self-preening). Surprisingly, nestlings were awake not only at sunset, but also at sunrise. Several behaviours (locomotion, wing flapping and sibling interactions, such as pecking and allopreening among nestlings) showed peaks of activity at sunset and sunrise, suggesting that they were performed for other reasons than to interact with parents. Allopreening was performed more often during the day than at night. We conclude that although adult Barn Owls are nocturnal, nestlings display a complex temporal pattern of activity that is governed not only by feeding but also by other unknown factors. © 2017, Dt.

ABSTRACT: Although birds belong to the best known animal groups, their systematics has not been fully resolved yet. Among the approximately 80 Neotropical owl species, there are monotypic genera such as Lophostrix, complex and diverse genera such as Megascops or Glaucidium, as well as widespread and variable taxa such as Bubo virginianus and Tyto furcata. Based on a literature review, we provide here an overview of the current taxonomy and nomenclature of Neotropical owls, and indicate knowledge gaps as focus points for future research. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

ABSTRACT: The snowy owl is an elusive arctic predator known for its nomadic behaviour. Satellite tracking has revealed that some adult snowy owls could make an extensive use of the marine environment during the non-breeding season. However, the relative contribution of marine resources to their diet is unknown. Stable isotope analyses can be useful to document the diet of mobile animals during periods of the year when individuals are less accessible. This study aimed to assess variation in isotopic values (δ13C and δ15N) of various feather types, and the usefulness of feathers to determine the contribution of the marine environment to the winter diet of snowy owls captured in summer. We sampled feathers coming from 6 body regions of 18 breeding females at two sites in the eastern Canadian Arctic in 2013 and 2014. Prior to analyses, diet-tissue discrimination factors of snowy owl feathers were established in captivity. Variability in isotopic values among feather types was relatively low and pairwise correlations in isotopic values between feathers on the same individual were variable and often low, which suggests differences in the diet at the time when various feathers were synthesized. Diet reconstruction models detected a contribution of marine sources to snowy owl feathers ranging from 4 to 19% among feather types. However, the marine contribution was highly variable when single feathers were examined within individuals, ranging from 3 to 71%. This indicated that no single feather type could be used alone to reliably infer the contribution of marine resources to the winter diet of owls, possibly due to a high variability in the timing and sequence of molt. For asynchronous molters like snowy owls, we recommend sampling multiple feathers from various body regions, excluding wing feathers, to investigate winter diet or habitat use. © 2017 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The European fossil record of eagle owls, genus Bubo Duméril 1806, is thought to extend back into the Miocene, but records of Bubo before the Middle Pleistocene are scarce and mainly constituted by non-diagnostic or fragmentary specimens. Apart from a number of fossil species of Bubo of uncertain validity, i.e. Bubo? florianae Kretzoi 1957, Bubo lignitum Giebel 1860, and Bubo perpastus (Ballman 1976), most fossil Bubo material is unassigned to species or assigned to the extant Bubo bubo (Linnaeus 1758) on the basis of size, especially for Early Pleistocene records. Given the ambiguity about the validity of the earliest records, here we revise the pre-Middle Pleistocene fossil record of Bubo in Europe. Our results indicate that, in Europe, Bubo is first recorded in the Late Pliocene/Early Pleistocene of Italy. By the Early Pleistocene, three taxa can be distinguished: Bubo ibericus sp. nov. from Cal Guardiola (Spain), Bubo sp. nov. indet. from Soave Cava Sud (Italy) and Bubo sp. from various sites across Europe. By the Middle Pleistocene, Eurasian environments experienced a substantial increase in severity and duration of glacial periods which might have led to the replacement of extinct species of Bubo by the recent B. bubo and Bubo scandiacus. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Pair-living and socially monogamous primates typically do not reproduce before dispersing. It is currently unclear whether this reproductive suppression is due to endocrine or behavioral mechanisms. Cooperatively breeding taxa, like callitrichids, may forego reproduction in natal groups because they reap inclusive fitness benefits and/or they are avoiding inbreeding. However, neither of these benefits of delayed reproduction appear to adequately explain the lack of reproduction prior to leaving the natal group in pair-living monogamous species. In this study, we determined whether wild Azara's owl monkeys (Aotus azarae) in the Argentinean Chaco establish reproductive maturity prior to dispersing. We utilized 635 fecal extracts to characterize reproductive hormone profiles of 11 wild juvenile and subadult females using enzyme immunoassays. Subadult females showed hormone profiles indicative of ovulatory cycling and had mean PdG and E1G concentrations approximately five times higher than juveniles. Contrary to expectations from the inbreeding avoidance hypothesis, female owl monkeys do not delay puberty, but rather commence ovarian cycling while residing in their natal group. Still, subadults appear to have a period during which they experience irregular, non-conceptive cycles prior to reproducing. Commencing these irregular cycles in the natal group may allow them to develop a state of suspended readiness, which could be essential to securing a mate, while avoiding costs of ranging solitarily. Our results indicate that reproductive suppression in female owl monkeys is not due to endocrine suppression. We suggest that adults likely use behavioral mechanisms to prevent subadults from reproducing with unrelated adult males in their natal group. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The possession of a rhythm is usually described as an important adaptation to regular changing environmental conditions such as the light-dark cycle. However, recent studies have suggested plasticity in the expression of a rhythm depending on life history and environmental factors. Barn owl (Tyto alba) nestlings show variations in behavior and physiology in relation to the size of black feather spots, a trait associated with many behavioral and physiological phenotypes including the circadian expression of corticosterone and the regulation of body mass. This raises the possibility that individual spottiness could be associated with rhythmicity in sleep-wakefulness. Owlets showed ultradian rhythms in sleep-wakefulness, with a period length of 4.5 to 4.9 h. The period length of wakefulness and non-REM sleep was shorter in heavily compared to lightly spotted female nestlings, whereas in males, the opposite result was found. Furthermore, male and female nestlings displaying small black spots showed strong rhythmicity levels in wakefulness and REM sleep. This might be an advantage in a stable environment with predictable periodic changes in light, temperature, or social interactions. Heavily spotted nestlings displayed weak rhythms in wakefulness and REM sleep, which might enable them to be more flexible in reactions to unexpected events such as predation or might be a mechanism to save energy. These findings are consistent with previous findings showing that large-spotted nestlings switch more frequently between wakefulness and sleep, resulting in higher levels of vigilance compared to small-spotted conspecifics. Thus, nestlings with larger black feather spots might differently handle the trade-off between wakefulness and sleep, attention, and social interactions compared to nestlings with smaller black spots. © 2017, © 2017 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Capsule: Diet composition of Boreal Owls Aegolius funereus was not affected by habitat cover, but it changed along the elevational gradient. Aims: To assess the effect of elevation and habitat cover on nest box occupancy and diet composition of a central European population of Boreal Owls. Methods: A Boreal Owl population was studied in the Šumava Mountains, Czech Republic, at elevations from 500 to 1300 m above sea level (asl), during 1984–2005. Results: Boreal Owls occupied more frequently nest boxes above 600 m asl, but they did not clearly prefer any elevational band. Habitat cover did not affect the number of nesting attempts. There was also no relationship between habitat cover and diet composition. However, diet composition significantly changed along the elevational gradient. In particular, the proportion of alternative prey of Boreal Owls, i.e. birds and shrews Sorex sp., rose with increasing elevation. The proportion of voles Myodes and mice Apodemus in the diet decreased with increasing elevation. Among bird prey, the proportion of finches Fringillidae positively correlated with elevation. Conclusions: Central European Boreal Owls did not show a clear preference for any habitat cover or elevational band, but the quality of the owls’ diet significantly decreased with increasing elevation. © 2017 British Trust for Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: In many bird species, parents adjust their home-ranges during chick-rearing to the availability and distribution of food resources, balancing the benefits of energy intake against the costs of travelling. Over recent decades, European agricultural landscapes have changed radically, resulting in the degradation of habitats and reductions in food resources for farmland birds. Lower foraging success and longer foraging trip distances that result from these changes are often assumed to reduce the reproductive performance of parents, although the mechanisms are not well understood. We tested the behavioural response of chick-rearing Little Owls Athene noctua to variation in habitat diversity in an agricultural landscape. We equipped females with GPS loggers and received adequate range-use data for 19 individuals (6063–14 439 locations per bird). In habitats dominated by homogeneous cropland habitats, home-ranges were over 12 ha in size, whereas in highly diverse habitats they were below 2 ha. Large home-ranges were associated with increased flight activity (117% of that of birds in small home-ranges) and distances travelled per night (152%), increased duration of foraging trips (169%) covering larger distances (246%), and reduced nest visiting rates (81%). The study therefore provides strong correlative evidence that Little Owls breeding in monotonous farmland habitats expend more time and energy for a lower benefit in terms of feeding rates than do birds in more heterogeneous landscapes. As nestling food supply is the main determinant of chick survival, these results suggest a strong impact of farmland characteristics on local demographic rates. We suggest that preserving and creating islands of high habitat diversity within uniform open agricultural landscapes should be a key target in the conservation of Little Owl populations. © 2017 British Ornithologists' Union

ABSTRACT: Adult barn owl hearing is acute, but development of this sense is not well understood. We, therefore, measured auditory brainstem responses in barn owls from before the onset of hearing (posthatch day 2, or P2) to adulthood (P69). The first consistent responses were detected at P4 for 1 and 2 kHz, followed by responses to 0.5 and 4 kHz at P9, and 5 kHz at P13. Sensitivity to higher frequencies increased with age, with responses to 12 kHz appearing about 2 months after hatching, once the facial ruff was mature. Therefore, these altricial birds achieve their sensitivity to sound during a prolonged period of development, which coincides with maturation of the skull and facial ruff (Haresign and Moiseff in Auk 105:699–705, 1988). © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

ABSTRACT: This compilation of recent data on the distribution, ecology, and conservation status of owls (Strigiformes) in Guatemala is based on an extensive literature review and numerous unpublished observations. Twenty species of owls have been recorded in Guatemala, of which 18 are resident. Breeding has been reported for 17 species, and it is assumed for one species. Two species are considered rare or accidental nonbreeding visitors to Guatemala during the northern winter. Guatemala's region with the highest species richness in owls is the highlands, where 17 species have been recorded. Twelve species have been recorded in the Pacific slope lowlands and 13 species in the Atlantic slope lowlands. We analyzed the data in the presence and relative abundance of owls from 105 sites from 1989 to 2016. According to the weighted mean value of the relative abundance index across three ornithogeographic regions, the most common owls in the country are (abundance ranking in descending order): Mexican wood owl (Strix squamulata), Ridgway's pygmy owl (Glaucidium ridgwayi), Guatemalan screech owl (Megascops guatemalae), black-and-white owl (Strix nigrolineata), American barn owl (Tyto furcata), Central American pygmy owl (Glaucidium griseiceps), Guatemalan pygmy owl (Glaucidium cobanense), great horned owl (Bubo virginianus), fulvous owl (Strix fulvescens), unspotted saw-whet owl (Aegolius ridgwayi), whiskered screech owl (Megascops trichopsis), crested owl (Lophostrix cristata), and Pacific screech owl (Megascops cooperi). Guatemala has an adequate legal framework to protect owl species (32% of the country is legally protected), but the conservation is not efficient, causing threats to owl populations. Of 18 resident owl species, 12 are forest specialists. In a vulnerability assessment applying IUCN Red List criteria on a national level, one species has been evaluated as Critically Endangered (CR), one as Endangered (EN), nine as Vulnerable (VU), five as Near Threatened (NT), two as Least Concern (LC), and two as not applicable. Habitat alterations through agriculture, mining, and oil drilling are the main threats. Of the remaining forests, 14% (5500 km2) were lost from 2000 to 2010, and the pressure on natural habitat will further increase. In addition, owls in Guatemala are threatened by direct persecution because of popular superstitions. The network of 21 Important Bird Areas (IBA) in Guatemala includes populations of all owl species. Three species have been recorded in at least 10 IBAs, 12 species in 5-9 IBAs, 4 in 2-4 IBAs, and 1 species in only one IBA. We consider the increase of the education level among the Guatemalan society the main key to protect habitats within the IBAs. A higher level of education would help to slow down population growth, increase environmental awareness, and consequently diminish pressure on natural areas. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

ABSTRACT: Owls are known for the development of a silent flight. One conspicuous specialization of owl wings that has been implied in noise reduction and that has been demonstrated to change the aerodynamic behavior of the wing is a soft dorsal wing surface. The soft surface is a result of changes in the shape of feather barbs and barbules in owls compared with other bird species. We hypothesized that as the aerodynamic characteristics of a wing change along its chordwise and spanwise direction, so may the shape of the barbs and barbules. Therefore, we examined in detail the shapes of the barbs and barbules in chordwise and spanwise directions. The results showed changes in the shapes of barbs and barbules at the anterior and distal parts of the wing, but not at more posterior parts. The increased density of hook radiates at the distalmost wing position could serve to stiffen that vane part that is subject to the highest forces. The change of pennulum length in the anterior part of the wing and the uniformity further back could mean that a soft surface may be especially important in regions where flow separation may occur. © 2017 Anatomical Society

ABSTRACT: Birds and mammals use the interaural time difference (ITD) for azimuthal sound localization. While barn owls can use the ITD of the stimulus carrier frequency over nearly their entire hearing range, mammals have to utilize the ITD of the stimulus envelope to extend the upper frequency limit of ITD-based sound localization. ITD is computed and processed in a dedicated neural circuit that consists of two pathways. In the barn owl, ITD representation is more complex in the forebrain than in the midbrain pathway because of the combination of two inputs that represent different ITDs. We speculated that one of the two inputs includes an envelope contribution. To estimate the envelope contribution, we recorded ITD response functions for correlated and anticorrelated noise stimuli in the barn owl’s auditory arcopallium. Our findings indicate that barn owls, like mammals, represent both carrier and envelope ITDs of overlapping frequency ranges, supporting the hypothesis that carrier and envelope ITD-based localization are complementary beyond a mere extension of the upper frequency limit. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The results presented in this study show for the first time that the barn owl is able to extract and represent the interaural time difference (ITD) information conveyed by the envelope of a broadband acoustic signal. Like mammals, the barn owl extracts the ITD of the envelope and the carrier of a signal from the same frequency range. These results are of general interest, since they reinforce a trend found in neural signal processing across different species. © 2017 the American Physiological Society.

ABSTRACT: Evidence of increasing fire extent and severity in the western US in recent decades has raised concern over the effects of fire on threatened species such as the spotted owl (Strix occidentalis Xantus de Vesey), which nests in forests with large trees and high canopy cover that are vulnerable to high-severity wildfire. A dichotomy of views exists on the impact of high-severity wildfire on the spotted owl. One view holds that reduction in the extent of forests with large trees and high canopy cover due to high-severity wildfire is a primary threat to spotted owls, and that fuels reduction treatments that successfully reduce the risk of high-severity wildfire can aid in sustaining desired conditions for this owl. A conflicting view maintains that high-severity wildfire was relatively common in many forest types occupied by spotted owls and does not pose an immediate threat to spotted owls, and that fuels reduction treatments are misguided because they degrade owl habitat and do not reduce the extent of high-severity fire. Based on the existing literature, we argue that considerable uncertainty remains regarding the response of spotted owls to high-severity wildfire, especially over longer time frames and across the three subspecies (California [Strix occidentalis occidentalis Xantus de Vesey], Mexican [S. o. lucida Nelson], and northern [S. o. caurina Merriam]) of spotted owls. The considerable extent of high-severity wildfire within the ranges of these subspecies over recent years, coupled with the trend toward increasing extent and severity of megafires, suggests that the cumulative effects of these fires could be significant throughout the range of this owl. Forest restoration or fuels reduction treatments may aid in reducing habitat loss, particularly when strategically located to optimize reduction of fire risk, but also may locally impact spotted owl habitat. We advocate further evaluation of both the impacts of such treatments to spotted owls and the effectiveness of such treatments in mitigating fire behavior. We also advocate wider use of managed fire to reduce risk of high-severity wildfire. Finally, given the paucity of long-term data on this topic, we recommend targeted research aimed at a decade or longer time periods after fires. These studies should include measures of demographic performance, and should be designed to elucidate differences in those metrics related to landscape pattern, forest type, and subspecies ecology. Such information would inform the debate over how to integrate the conservation of spotted owls and their habitat with fuels reduction and forest restoration objectives. © 2017 Association for Fire Ecology.

ABSTRACT: The effects of population bottlenecks, from both the population and conservation genetics point of view, have attracted great interest. Heterozygosity and allelic diversity are basic components of the evolutionary potential of populations. Many endangered species go through bottlenecks from time to time. The consequences are important because in the resulting small populations the stochastic processes are more pronounced and, by strengthening each other, they can lead to extinction. Within the framework of the global climate change the question emerges of how the different species, primarily susceptible ones and those depending on protection measures, react to the climate extremities. It is well known that a large proportion of Barn Owl Tyto alba populations die following an unfavourable period. In the study reported here we genotyped 24 microsatellite loci of 58 unrelated Barn Owl individuals originating from a continuous population of three neighbouring Hungarian counties. We then performed the Wilcoxon sign-rank test, the L test and Monte Carlo simulation of the loss of alleles and heterozygosity. We also attempted to infer past population dynamics using two likelihood-based Bayesian methods. Although a 74% reduction of this population is well documented following the harsh winter of 2002/2003 and the sampling and resolution of the methods used are standard and considered to be commonly satisfactory, none of the tests showed pronounced signs of a recent bottleneck. These results are discussed in terms of the imminent and apparent drawbacks of the models and methods used, the roles of absolute numbers of survivors versus genotype percentages and the conservation biological viewpoint. © 2017, Dt.

ABSTRACT: Species geographic limits can be shaped by unfavorable conditions beyond range edges, and observations from peripheral habitats provide opportunities to assess individuals' capacity to tolerate environmental change. I monitored an extralimital breeding pair of Western burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia hypogea) in an eastern Kansas tallgrass prairie in 2013 using still and video photography. I quantified (1) the relative importance of different prey types in their diet, and (2) the timing and prevalence of a novel sunbathing behavior and discuss its possible adaptive significance. Owls in tallgrass prairie consumed more arthropods than vertebrates, with the latter contributing the most biomass in their diet. However, arthropods contributed more biomass than reported in studies that used indirect prey remains analyses. Owls sunbathed during midday when conditions were hot and dry, but never during cool periods or following rain events. I suggest owls in tallgrass prairie may sunbathe to shed ectoparasites. © 2017 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Previous research has demonstrated a clear link between late chronotype and depression. The vulnerability factors underpinning this link, however, are unclear. Here the relationship between two specific emotion regulation strategies, cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression, and chronotype was investigated using multiple regression. Two hundred and forty participants (age range 18-80, 189 females) completed validated self-report questionnaires assaying chronotype, neuroticism, depressive symptomatology, sleep quality, and emotion regulation. Eveningness was associated with increased expressive suppression, and morningness was associated with increased cognitive reappraisal after controlling for age, gender, depressive symptomatology, neuroticism, and sleep quality. Trait expressive suppression and reduced cognitive reappraisal are known to increase depression risk. Our results suggest that eveningness is associated with impaired emotion regulation, which may confer risk for future depression. These findings suggest modifiable markers that could be therapeutically targeted to prevent the onset of depression in late chronotype individuals. © 2017 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Anthropogenic environmental changes are leading to habitat loss and degradation, driving many species to extinction. In this context, habitat models become increasingly important for effective species management and conservation. However, most habitat studies lack replicated study areas and do not properly address the role of nonstationarity and spatial scales in determining factors that limit species occurrence under different environmental settings. Here we provide an optimized multi-scale framework for analyzing habitat selection of the threatened Mexican Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis lucida) between 2 meta-replicated study areas: the Sacramento Mountains, New Mexico, and the Mogollon Plateau, Arizona. The optimized scales of habitat variables strongly differed between the 2 study areas. Percent cover of mixed-conifer was more strongly associated with the relative likelihood of Mexican Spotted Owl occurrence in the Sacramento Mountains than in the Mogollon Plateau. Topographic covariates strongly explained variance in the habitat model in the Mogollon Plateau, but not in the Sacramento Mountains. Topographically constrained habitat availability may be affecting the relative likelihood of owl occurrence in the Mogollon Plateau, but not in the Sacramento Mountains. In the Sacramento Mountains, suitable habitat and owl distributions show dissimilar spatial autocorrelation patterns, indicating that the relative likelihood of occurrence may be influenced by factors in addition to habitat. Owl distribution shows a periodic spatial pattern, suggesting that the relative likelihood of owl occurrence in the Sacramento Mountains might be influenced by territoriality. Differences in habitat relationships between the 2 study areas suggest that management strategies should be tailored to local conditions. This study underscores the advantage of scale optimization and replicated studies in analyzing nonstationary habitat selection. Q 2017 American Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Columbid herpesvirus-1 (CoHV-1) is widespread in feral pigeons in North America and Europe. We used a PCR assay to detect CoHV-1 DNA in oral and cloacal tissues and oral swabs from naturally infected pigeons. Fifty-three feral pigeons from five flocks in Australia (n=3 from south-central Victoria and n=2 from Sydney) were examined for CoHV-1 DNA. We detected CoHV-1 DNA in oral mucosa and cloacal mucosa, with higher concentrations in the oral mucosa. The sensitivity of testing oral swabs was the same as testing the tissue, indicating that testing of oral swabs from live birds is an effective means of screening flocks for CoHV-1 infection. Infection was found in all five of the flocks examined and the prevalence of infection ranged from 70% to100%. Most positive birds could be detected with a single-amplification PCR, but a nested amplification was required to detect others. Oral swabs from Australian native doves and pigeons (n=18) and the introduced Collared Dove (Streptopelia chinensis; n=2) were also tested by the nested PCR and all were negative for CoHV-1 DNA. We describe a fatal infection of CoHV-1 in a wild Powerful Owl (Ninox strenua) that was observed feeding on feral pigeons. This is the first known case of CoHV-1 causing death in a wild bird of prey in Australia. Our data suggest that CoHV-1 is widespread in feral pigeon flocks in Australia but we did not find it in native doves and pigeons. Spillover into native avian predator species may be occurring. © Wildlife Disease Association 2017.

ABSTRACT: Behavioural laterality is a commonly observed phenomenon in many species suggesting there might be an advantage of using dominantly one side over the other for certain tasks. Indeed, lateralized individuals were often shown to be more successful in cognitive tasks compared to non-lateralized conspecifics. However, stressed individuals are also often, but not always, more strongly lateralized. Because barn owl (Tyto alba) females displaying larger black spots on the tip of their ventral feathers produce offspring that are more resistant to a variety of environmental stressful factors, we examined whether laterality is associated with melanin-based coloration. We recorded whether nestlings use more often the right or left foot to scratch their body and whether they preen more often one side of the body or the other using their bills. We found that the strength of lateralization of preening and scratching was less pronounced in individuals born from heavily spotted mothers. This result might be explained by plumage-related variation in the ability to resist stressful rearing conditions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Despite being the largest country in Central America and having approximately 700 species of birds, Nicaragua's avifauna is probably the least known. Consensually, 14 owl species have been registered for the country, with representatives of both Nearctic and Neotropical avifauna. In addition to the incomplete knowledge of their distribution, nothing is known about the biology and ecology of the species in the country. Most owls in Nicaragua are typical of the forested areas that cover more than 40% of the total land area. This is the most threatened habitat due to the expansion of the agricultural frontier and pressure from human displacement into forested areas. In order to conserve biodiversity in general, Nicaragua has a system of protected areas (SINAP), including three important biosphere reserves. No species of owl found in Nicaragua is endemic or classified as globally at risk. However, we feel that an assessment of the conservation status of each species at a local level is needed. This requires a more detailed study of their distribution, but also an estimation of their abundance and the status of their populations, and habitat requirements and other aspects of their biology. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

ABSTRACT: From 2010-2012, I studied nesting success and causes of nest failure at a colony of Barn Swallows (Hirundo rustica) where anecdotal evidence suggested the colony was declining in size. In 2010, many nests were destroyed, and indirect evidence suggested breeding adults were being depredated by a raptor. Using trail cameras, I captured video evidence of Barred Owls (Strix varia) depredating two nests, one containing chicks and the other eggs. During the study period, 72% (32/44; 2010), 51% (16/31; 2011), and 85% (17/20; 2012) of nests were depredated, and the number of nesting attempts declined by more than 50% over 3 years. The video evidence and plucked adult feathers suggests that Barred Owls were responsible for at least some of the predation. Barred Owls did not breed historically on the southern British Columbia coast but first appeared in 1966 and have become common breeders, while Barn Swallows have decreased in the same region by 5.64% per year since 1970. There may be many causes of local and regional population declines of Barn Swallows, but given their conspicuous nests, predation in less well protected nesting sites may be a localized cause of colony decline.

ABSTRACT: Between 18 and 24 Strigiformes species have been registered in Argentina, with some variations due to the different taxonomic criteria and to take as valid or not some uncertain records. Strigiformes are distributed in all the territory (including islands), although the largest number of species is found in the subtropical forest regions: Paraná rainforest (15 species), Chaco (11 species), and Yungas (9 species). The species are associated with three types of habitat: subtropical forest, temperate forests, and grasslands. There are no endemic species recorded in Argentina. The conservation status has been reconsidered recently-five species have been classified as threatened and four as vulnerable. Alteration and destruction of habitats (especially deforestation and agricultural expansion on natural grasslands) and toxicology are considered the main threats. We reviewed 456 publications, 44% of them are about distribution status, 32% about foraging, 12% about breeding ecology, and 5% about taxonomy and nomenclature. The distribution of those species for which there is better information suggests that studies have focused on the Pampa and northern Patagonia Regions (mainly Patagonian). There is at least minimum knowledge of different biological aspects for all the species, and they are categorized as nonthreatened. Of the nine endangered species, six exclusively inhabit the Paraná rainforest, one species (Strix chacoensis) is in the Chaco subtropical dry forest, one (S. rufipes) is in the forested Patagonian Andes, and one species is found in the Paraná rainforest, Chaco, and Yungas (Asio stygius). © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

ABSTRACT: Capsule: Early nesting Barn Owls Tyto alba and those that switched nest sites fledged most chicks overall because they could fit two, more productive, nesting attempts into a breeding season. Aims: To determine the frequency and productivity of double broods in Barn Owls, and for double brooders, to determine what affects the probability of nest switching and how that affects productivity. Methods: We monitored the first egg date of each nesting attempt, whether it was in a ‘vole year’, whether a breeding attempt was first or a second annual attempt, the number of chicks fledged from each attempt, and whether a pair switched nest sites, if breeding twice, from 602 Barn Owl breeding attempts in an area of lowland England from 1996 to 2007. General linear models were used to determine predictors of the probability that a pair had a second brood and the number of chicks fledged in each nesting attempt, and then for those owls that double brooded, which variables best predicted the probability of switching, and the number of chicks fledged from the second nest. Finally, we tested whether switching resulted in a shorter laying interval and higher annual productivity. Results: Early nesting birds were more likely to double brood, although this was relaxed in vole years when later nesting birds also double brooded. Productivity (through increased numbers of chicks fledged or reduced chick loss) was higher the earlier a nest occurred, and there were more chicks fledged in good vole years and in second nesting attempts. Productivity, brood depletion, first clutch date and vole years did not determine whether a double brooding pair switched nesting sites. Productivity in the second nest did not change with a switch but productivity increased for early first nests and second nests with a shorter interval between the first and second nest. Switching however decreased nesting interval and nesting interval was also shorter if there were fewer fledglings from the first nest. Overall productivity was higher for pairs that switched. Conclusions: Double brooding in Barn Owls increased seasonal productivity substantially and its occurrence depended on vole abundance or early nesting. Nest switching between broods may be a strategy for earlier laying of the second brood. Provision of alternative nest sites, close together in a Barn Owl’s home range, may allow earlier re-nesting and so increase productivity. © 2017 British Trust for Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: Studies with individual rodents have revealed that they display protean (unpredictable) behavior when attacked by an owl. Other studies have revealed that voles in groups reduce behavioral variability a short time after owl attack, as if adopting the behavior of the higher-mass and perhaps older and more experienced, individuals. Here, we tested groups of rodents under owl attack in order to track the behavior of individuals within the group and compare between the behaviors of social and non-social species. We found differential behavior between species, between groups of the same species, among individuals in the same group, and among the various phases of the owl attack. We also found that upon being exposed to an owl, social rodents tended to huddle together whereas solitary rodents tended to scatter across the available space. Other non-social but perhaps not necessarily solitary rodent species displayed a mixed spacing, with some huddling and some scattering. The findings of the present study shed light on the defensive dynamics of small groups of social and non-social rodent species when they were under owl attack. Significance statement: Freezing and fleeing are defensive responses that span the animal kingdom, and rodents display various combinations of these in order to prevent predators from predicting their response. Groups of six voles or six spiny mice that were attacked by a barn owl differentially displayed these responses during various phases of the owl attack. Responses also varied among individuals of the same group and among different groups. Finally, we show that when exposed to an owl and displayed freeze response, individuals of social species tended to huddle together, whereas individuals of solitary species scattered over the arena. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

ABSTRACT: Capsule: The use of call-broadcasting significantly increases the number of Tawny Owls Strix aluco detected in winter point counts, but requires careful survey design to avoid introducing potential sources of bias into population estimates. Aims: To examine Tawny Owl response to call-broadcasting to aid survey design in national monitoring efforts. Methods: A nocturnal survey was undertaken at 36 survey points over three nights in winter in Thetford Forest, England. Each survey consisted of four consecutive five-minute segments: a passive count, followed by three counts with the use of call-broadcasting. Results: Few (4%) Tawny Owls were recorded during passive surveys, whereas the greatest response was during the first and second call-broadcast segments (49% and 36%, respectively). New detections declined to 11% in the final segment. Response was fastest at dusk, although time of night did not significantly affect the number of individuals detected. Male owls accounted for 79% of detections. Conclusion: Our results show that ten minutes of call-broadcast surveying will detect 85% of responsive Tawny Owls, thus vastly improving detection compared to passive listening alone. However, simultaneous counts of geographically separated detections should be used to provide a minimum count and reduce potential double-counting of mobile individuals. © 2017 British Trust for Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: Five non-paired-Translocated wild caught barn owl (Tyto alba javanica) transferred from Jerantut, Pahang in Peninsular to Lahad Datu in Sabah, Malaysia were tested for diet preference by size, and species and fecundity in captivity. Testing was done in flight cages where owls were free to select from a combination of three local rodent species distinguished into two size categories; large and small. Jacobs' index confirmed that smaller rats were taken in greater numbers and took the shortest number of days to 100% consumption at Day 5 than larger ones. Preference for body parts consumed varied according to diet size and species. In the same period as the prey preference study, two females reproduced twice ranging from intervals of 44 to 63 days with an average clutch size of 6.8 eggs. Hatching rates ranged from 0% to 83% and fledging rates ranged from 0% to 75%. These results may have practical importance in the propagation of barn owls in their new environment as they will be exposed to different prey in terms of species and size range.

ABSTRACT: Neodiplostomum americanum Chandler and Rausch, 1947 has been reported from six species of owls in North America. At present, there are no molecular data for this species and gene sequence data from Neodiplostomum Railliet, 1919 are limited. A freshly deceased specimen of the Great Horned Owl Bubo virginianus Gmelin, 1788 and a freshly deceased specimen of the Eastern Screech Owl Megascops asio Linnaeus, 1758 were collected in Oktibbeha County, Mississippi in 2014 and 2016, respectively. Neodiplostomum americanum were recovered from both hosts. Herein, updated morphological descriptions are supplemented with gene sequence data from conserved (18S, ITS1-5.8S, ITS2, and 28S rRNA) and fast-evolving (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 mtDNA) regions. Preliminary phylogenetic analysis of the genus based on cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene sequence data supports the placement of N. americanum within a discrete phylogroup of the family Diplostomidae. The life history of N. americanum is unknown and currently limited to the description of the adult stage in avian hosts. The molecular data generated in this study offer insight into the phylogenetic placement of N. americanum within the Diplostomatidae and will aid in identifying different life stages in putative intermediate hosts. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia) are increasingly moving into human-altered landscapes, yet it is not well-understood how these environments affect movements and survival. We studied postfledging juvenile burrowing owls (n = 42) in urban, greenspace, and agricultural environments in New Mexico, USA, during 2012 and 2013. Agriculture was divided into heterogeneous and homogenous blocks (up to 1,000-m radius from nest) based on land-cover continuity. Postfledging movement distance (n = 31) was not influenced by year, sex, or landscape metrics within 600 m of the nest. Landscape metrics, however, did not account for visual barriers to movement including pecan orchards and residential areas within the agricultural landscape. Movement distances did vary by dominant environment, with owls in urban landscapes (80.9 m ± 20.1 SE, n = 4) moving shorter distances than owls in greenspace (552.7 m ± 117.0 SE, n = 7), homogenous agriculture (497.8 m ± 140.6 SE, n = 7), and heterogeneous agriculture (206.7 m ± 36.3 SE, n = 13). Juvenile postfledging survival was greater in landscapes with a greater percentage of agriculture (β = 0.017, 95% CL = 0.017–0.018). Survival was greatest in heterogeneous and homogeneous agriculture (93% and 89%, respectively) followed by urban (67%) and greenspace (50%) environments. Greenspace had the greatest mortality rate, but was negatively correlated with agriculture, making it difficult to ascertain whether one of these metrics had a stronger influence on survival. Increased mortality in greenspace suggests urban parks and patches of native vegetation adjacent to urban development do not protect young owls. Owls in larger expanses of continuous cover had greater movements and utilized more satellite burrows. Programs managing for burrowing owls in human-altered landscapes should avoid establishing artificial burrows and translocation sites in greenspace adjacent to urban areas, and, in the southwestern United States, should focus on agricultural areas. © 2017 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2017

ABSTRACT: Barn owls (Tyto alba) have the potential to remove significant numbers of rodent pests in vineyards, which has prompted viticulturists in California to erect artificial nest boxes to attract owls. This study examined the habitat factors influencing barn owl nest box occupancy as well as farmers’ perceptions of barn owls in vineyards in Napa Valley, CA. Nest boxes of variable design and placement were distributed across 65 vineyards that varied in local and landscape habitat composition. We monitored 297 nest boxes in 2015 to develop an occupancy model. We evaluated the performance of the 2015 model by revisiting 150 boxes in 2016 and comparing observed occupancy to the predicted probability of occupancy for each nest box. Barn owls occupied approximately one third of the nest boxes we monitored each year. We used variance decomposition to address cross scale correlations among three nested spatial scales and to analyze the variation in nest box occupancy explained uniquely by predictors at each spatial scale. The home range and nest box scales were the most important spatial scales. At the home range scale, barn owls selected nest boxes surrounded by more hectares of grassland, riparian and mixed forest, and fewer hectares of oak scrub within 1 km of the box. Owls were more likely to occupy nest boxes if they were constructed of wood, facing north and positioned higher off the ground. The model developed in 2015 performed well in 2016, correctly classifying 81.3% of the boxes, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.86. In addition, we surveyed farmers to gauge their perceptions of the utility of barn owls as a component of an integrated pest management scheme in winegrape vineyards. The majority of farmers surveyed installed barn owl nest boxes for the perceived pest management services instead of the potential positive public appeal of improving barn owl habitat. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: In this chapter, we have compiled the literature for the 23 Brazilian owl species, which represent almost one-third of all Neotropical owls. Our main objective here was to review the taxonomy, distribution, ecology, and conservation of each species, both revealing gaps in our knowledge and supplying directions to promote more research on Brazilian owls. Even though in the last 15 years there was an impressive increasing number of specific publications on owls in Brazil, particularly on food habits, we have detected that other essential data about distribution, taxonomy, population density, habitat requirements, reproductive biology, and anthropogenic effect on owl populations are needed for most owl species. Probably the lack of basic biological information on most species is responsible for the relative absence of owls in the Brazilian official lists of threatened fauna in regional and national scales. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

ABSTRACT: Capsule: Tawny Owls Strix aluco occupying nest boxes preferred habitats which were positively associated with the probability of nesting success. Aims: We aimed to determine whether or not: (1) Tawny Owls showed habitat preferences when occupying nest boxes; (2) nesting performance was related to the habitats around occupied nest boxes and (3) habitat availability had changed around available and occupied nest boxes between 1995–2004 and 2005–14. Methods: Tawny Owls were studied using nest boxes erected in a commercial forest. During nest boxes checks (724 cases), data on occupancy and nesting performance (88 cases) were recorded, and habitat within a 0.4 km radius around nest boxes was analysed. Results: Tawny Owls had preferences for clearings within forests, mature forests and grasslands but avoided young forests. We found a positive relationship between nesting success and abundance of clearings within the forest, and a negative relationship between nesting success and abundance of young forests. A change in habitat preferences over the two decades was evident, but habitat availabilities remained similar. Conclusions: Findings indicate adaptive habitat selection in Tawny Owls because preferred habitats were associated with higher fitness and this type of habitat became more frequently selected over time. © 2017 British Trust for Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: Parasites are expected to exert long-term costs on host fecundity and longevity. Understanding the consequences of heritable polymorphic variation in disease defence in wild populations is essential in order to predict evolutionary responses to changes in disease risk. Telomeres have been found to shorten faster in malaria-diseased individuals compared with healthy ones with negative effects on longevity and thereby fitness. Here, we study the impact of haemosporidian blood parasites on telomere dynamics in tawny owls, which display a highly heritable plumage colour polymorphism. Previously, it has been shown that blood parasites have morph-specific impact on body mass maintenance. Here, we show that telomeres shortened faster in individuals with shorter breeding lifespan. Telomere length was negatively associated with the degree of pheomelanic brown coloration and shorter in infected than uninfected individuals. The rate of telomere shortening between breeding seasons was faster in darker pheomelanic individuals and suppression of parasite intensity between seasons was associated with faster telomere shortening in the paler individuals but not in darker ones. We propose that morph-specific physiological profiles cause differential telomere shortening and that this is likely to be a mechanism involved in previously documented environment-driven survival selection against the pheomelanic morph in this population. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Human disturbance may have several negative impacts on bird biology. Although some species may habituate to human presence, other species do not show any signs of habituation, and may even be sensitized or affected by human disturbance. Furthermore, anthropogenic effects on bird behaviour rarely have been explored to address the alteration of frequencies of aggressive and fear-associated behaviours. Such behavioural approaches may provide substantial data for bird conservation and management. Therefore, we assessed whether human disturbance disrupts the normal behaviour of Burrowing Owls Athene cunicularia. Specifically, we assessed whether guarding parents exhibited aggressive and fearful behaviours differentially in areas where human contact was more common. Burrowing Owls showed increased frequencies of threat displays in sites with more people walking by the nests, but not fear behaviours. These results suggest that different domains of behaviour (aggression vs. fear) may respond differently to human disturbance. We highlight the importance of quantifying a wide range of behavioural acts as indicators of bird stress in studies of anthropogenic impact. © 2017 British Ornithologists' Union

ABSTRACT: We describe an unusual case of proventriculitis associated with Cryptosporidium baileyi in a 7-wk-old snowy owl (Bubo scandiacus) chick kept at a zoo. Necropsy of this animal revealed diffuse mucosal thickening of the proventriculus. Subsequent histopathological examinations of the proventriculus showed marked ductal epithelial hyperplasia with intestinal metaplasia and severe inflammatory cell infiltration in the lamina propria and submucosa. These lesions were associated with numerous periodic-acid-Schiff-positive cryptosporidia-like protozoan parasites. Moreover, oocysts found within the lamina propria had a noticeably thicker wall and displayed Ziehl-Neelsen-positive test results. PCR sequencing analyses of the 18S rDNA, actin, and 70 kDa heat shock protein gene loci identified the protozoan to be C. baileyi, of which two novel sets of primers were designed for use with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. An epidemiological survey was carried out at the zoo to investigate the source of infection, but all owl species surveyed proved negative for cryptosporidiosis. It is most likely that small animal vectors such as wild birds or rodents were responsible for this particular lethal case. This is the first report of C. baileyi associated with proventriculitis and also the first report of cryptosporidiosis in a raptor species in Asia. © American Society of Parasitologists 2017.

ABSTRACT: The results of the study of the Ural Owl feeding spectrum are presented. In Russia the Ural owl eats over twenty species of mammals, thirty bird species and a number of animals of other classes. The research tasks included the identification of the species of the victims of a large owl in Mordovia, their quantitative data and the characteristics of osteological material from pellets. It was found out that mammals, in particular rodents, are the basis for the Ural owl food. The Ural Owl's diet consists mainly of gray voles (47.7 %). On the second place there is a red vole (31.4 %). The share of mice is only 7.3 %. Th e predator hunts for the forest mouse most oft en. In pellets the mass fraction of bone remains varies in the range from 3.4 to 44.8 %. Th e average proportion of bone remains is, as a rule, up to 25 %, with the content of only one or two small rodents in pellets; the remains of three to six individuals - up to 45 % of the weight of dry pellet. Among all the bones of mammals, the lower jaws, femoral and tibia bones give the greatest information about the number and composition of victims of the Ural owl. In pellets the brachial and nameless bones of the victims are presented in smaller numbers. © by A. Andreychev 2017.

ABSTRACT: The fate and behaviour of animals that leave their natal group (‘floaters’) is usually poorly understood, which can limit the understanding of a species' population dynamics. Attempted immigrations can have serious negative effects on residents who therefore may forcibly reject intruders. Consequently, floaters face a dilemma: they need to leave their natal range to find a breeding territory while trying to avoid potentially lethal rejections from established groups. To examine the hypothesis that floating Azara's owl monkeys avoid established groups temporally, we compared time-matched locations of floaters and groups with randomly selected distances. To examine the hypothesis that floaters avoid established groups spatially, we compared the utilization distribution overlap indices (UDOIs) for core areas of floaters and groups with randomly expected UDOIs. Based on average home range sizes and areas of overlap between floaters, we estimated the floater density in the study area to be 0.2–0.5 per group. The temporal avoidance hypothesis was not supported, since time-matched distances were smaller than distances of random locations, and not larger as predicted under this hypothesis. The spatial avoidance hypothesis, in contrast, was supported, with smaller UDOIs for core ranges than predicted. In conclusion, solitary owl monkeys seem to solve the floater's dilemma by trying to stay in relatively close proximity to groups while still avoiding their core ranges. Floaters thus maximize the number of groups with which they have contact, while being able to leave a group's territory quickly if detected by residents. While no marked sex differences in patterns were detected, there was a strong stochastic element to the number of floaters of a particular sex, thus resulting in a locally uneven operational sex ratio. This, in turn, can have important consequences for various aspects of the population dynamics. © 2017 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Agonistic behaviors are common in many group-living taxa and may serve a variety of functions, ranging from regulating conflicts over reproduction to defending food resources. However, high rates of agonism are not expected to occur among close relatives or individuals in established mating relationships, which are characteristics of monogamous groups. To contribute to our understanding of agonism within socially monogamous groups, we collected behavioral and demographic data from Azara's owl monkeys (Aotus azarae) in the Gran Chaco of Argentina over 14 years. We examined factors related to age, sex, kinship, and behavioral context to evaluate predictions of the hypotheses that agonism functions to regulate dispersal and that it mediates competition for food and/or mates. Intragroup agonism was relatively rare: the group rate was approximately one event every three and a half hours. Rates of agonism were generally similar for both sexes, but there were marked differences among age categories. Agonism performed by adults was more frequently directed at subadults than at younger offspring. In contrast, agonistic interactions involving infants were very rare. Among interactions between adults and subadults, adults were much more frequently the actors than the recipients, suggesting that agonism from adults may influence natal dispersal of subadults. Agonistic events were most frequent during foraging, but also occurred more frequently than expected during bouts of social behavior. Overall, our results suggest that agonism in owl monkeys serves as a mechanism for regulating dispersal, and also likely plays a role in mediating mating and feeding competition. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Species richness of owls (Strigiformes) in Ecuador is remarkably high (28 species) despite its small territory (c. 280,000 km2). This diversity is not evenly distributed across mainland Ecuador, with higher species richness in tropical areas, humid forests, and pristine habitats. Only two species occur in the Galapagos Islands. Although there are no species endemic to Ecuador, the distribution ranges of at least five are primarily confined to Ecuador. The knowledge about Ecuadorian Strigiformes is insufficient. The natural history and distribution of the two Galapagos endemic taxa (Tyto alba punctatissima and Asio flammeus galapagoensis) have been fairly accurately documented. In contrast, little has been published on continental owl species. Currently, only two species are considered as globally threatened or near threatened and five as threatened at a national level. Nonetheless, poor knowledge about populations, habitat use, natural history, distribution, and vulnerability to extinction might have precluded accurate assessments of the conservation status of several species. We suggest further investigating the basic ecology, distribution, populations, and relationships with human of Ecuadorian owls, in order to better understand their current conservation status. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

ABSTRACT: Even though the Barn Owl (Tyto alba) is distributed worldwide, little information is available on how weather affects Barn Owl breeding outside of Europe and North America. For instance, if cold temperatures can negatively influence population dynamics in temperate regions, heat could have a similar negative effect in arid regions. We have studied a breeding population of Barn Owls in a semi-arid agricultural environment over 13 years in Israel in order to determine whether lack of rain and hot ambient temperatures impair Barn Owl reproductive success. The percentage of nest boxes occupied by Barn Owls was not related to any of the weather variables, whereas the number of nestlings per Barn Owl pair and the percentage of pairs that succeeded to fledge young was lower in years when it started to rain later in the season and when the minimum daily temperature was higher during the breeding season. In comparison to temperate regions, heat is detrimental to Barn Owl breeding and early precipitation is probably important in boosting vegetation and, in turn, the abundance of small mammals, the Barn Owl's staple food.

ABSTRACT: Studying HIV-1 replication in the presence of functionally related proteins from different species has helped define host determinants of HIV-1 infection. Humans and owl monkeys, but not macaques, encode a CD4 receptor that permits entry of transmissible HIV-1 variants due to a single residue difference. However, little is known about whether divergent CCR5 receptor proteins act as determinants of host-range. Here we show that both owl monkey (Aotus vociferans) CD4 and CCR5 receptors are functional for the entry of transmitted HIV-1 when paired with human versions of the other receptor. By contrast, the owl monkey CD4/CCR5 pair is generally a suboptimal receptor combination, although there is virus-specific variation in infection with owl monkey receptors. Introduction of the human residues 15Y and 16T within a sulfation motif into owl monkey CCR5 resulted in a gain of function. These findings suggest there is cross-talk between CD4 and CCR5 involving the sulfation motif. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Apex predators are critical to ecological function, however their life history traits are often not conducive to survival in urban environments. While this can result in the loss of some apex predators, others are able to inhabit and utilize urban environments. Understanding predator resource requirements and the factors driving their distribution is often difficult due to their cryptic nature, however, this understanding is essential, given the current rate of urban expansion. In this research we use a threatened apex predator, the powerful owl (Ninox strenua) as a case study. Specifically, we aim to (1) develop a Species Distribution Model (SDM) to ascertain environmental variables driving habitat suitability across an urban gradient (2) determine fine scale spatial movements of powerful owls using GPS telemetry; (3) validate the SDM against collected GPS movement data; and (4) evaluate habitat predicted by the SDM against current reserve systems to establish whether they are adequate for the future protection of this species. We used MaxEnt and citizen science data to produce SDMs that predicted habitat suitability for powerful owls and identified the environmental variables driving habitat across the landscape. Fine-scale spatial movements for urban powerful owls, gained via GPS telemetry, were used to establish home-range sizes, validate models and assess the fit of telemetry data against SDM predictions. Rivers, vegetation (particularly dense tree cover) and distance to riparian areas were the ecological variables driving predicted habitat for powerful owls across the urban gradient. There was a strong relationship between habitat predicted by the SDM and the fine scale movements of powerful owls in urbanized environments. Home-ranges within this urban study were notably smaller than previous estimates established for forested environments. The powerful owls in our study were also shown to utilize considerable amounts of habitat outside of the reserve system. This has severe conservation implications because it is often the space outside of reserves that are at most risk from urban intensification. Conservation of the powerful owl in urban environments, therefore, needs to focus on both habitat management within existing reserves, and on establishing clear vegetation management strategies in the surrounding urban matrix. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: We compiled existing information on the 28 owl species found in Colombia and evaluated information gaps. We found 23 species in the Andes and inter-Andean valleys, 15 in the Caribbean, 10 in the Pacific, 10 in the Orinoco region, 10 in the Amazon, and 4 in the isolated Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountain system, including one undescribed species. With regard to conservation status, and following the BirdLife International, one species (Megascops colombianus) is considered as Near Threatened (NT) and another (Glaucidium nubicola) as Vulnerable (VU), while the remaining owl species are considered as Least Concern (LC). There are no speciesspecific management or conservation plans for any owl in Colombia, but most species are present in areas with some degree of governmental or private protection. According to our analysis, knowledge of the Strigiformes in the country is very limited, which posits the necessity of developing research and understanding about such basic aspects as geographical variability, population status, reproductive ecology, and behavior, among others. Indeed, without this information, it will be very difficult to discern the current status, population trends, or ecological requirements of owls in Colombia in particular and in the Neotropical region in general. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

ABSTRACT: Owls are widely known for silent flight, achieving remarkably low noise gliding and flapping flights owing to their unique wing morphologies, which are normally characterized by leading-edge serrations, trailing-edge fringes and velvet-like surfaces. How these morphological features affect aerodynamic force production and sound suppression or noise reduction, however, is still not well known. Here we address an integrated study of owl-inspired single feather wing models with and without leading-edge serrations by combining large-eddy simulations (LES) with particle-image velocimetry (PIV) and force measurements in a low-speed wind tunnel. With velocity and pressure spectra analysis, we demonstrate that leading-edge serrations can passively control the laminar-turbulent transition over the upper wing surface, i.e. the suction surface at all angles of attack (0° < AoA < 20°), and hence play a crucial role in aerodynamic force and sound production. We find that there exists a tradeoff between force production and sound suppression: serrated leading-edges reduce aerodynamic performance at lower AoAs < 15° compared to clean leading-edges but are capable of achieving both noise reduction and aerodynamic performance at higher AoAs > 15° where owl wings often reach in flight. Our results indicate that the owl-inspired leading-edge serrations may be a useful device for aero-acoustic control in biomimetic rotor designs for wind turbines, aircrafts, multi-rotor drones as well as other fluid machinery. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Among the range of determinants of post-fledging survival in altricial birds, the energy supply to the growing juveniles is likely to play a central role. However, the exact mechanisms shaping post-fledging survival are poorly understood. Using a food supplementation experiment, we determined the effect of variation in food supply on the survival of juvenile Little Owls Athene noctua from hatching to 2 months post-fledging. Experimental broods were food-supplemented for 36 days during the nestling and the early post-fledging period. The fate of 307 juveniles (95 of them provided with extra food) was determined by nest monitoring and radiotelemetry. In unsupplemented birds, the rates of survival measured at 5-day intervals were lowest during the nestling stage, remained low during the early post-fledging stage and steadily increased after about 2 weeks post-fledging. Food supplementation substantially increased nestling survival, but we detected no direct treatment effect on post-fledging survival. Instead, we found a strong indirect effect of food supplementation, in that fledglings of good physical condition had markedly higher chances of surviving the post-fledging period compared with those in poor condition. Experimental food supplementation increased survival over the first 3 months from 45% to 64.6%. This suggests that energy reserves built up during the nestling stage influence post-fledging survival and ultimately parental reproductive output. The low nestling and post-fledging survival shows that the early life-history stages constitute a crucial bottleneck of reproductive ecology in Little Owls. The strong treatment effects on the number of independent offspring indicate that natural variation in food supply is an important determinant of spatio-temporal patterns in Little Owl demography. © 2017 British Ornithologists’ Union

ABSTRACT: A juvenile to young adult, male, great horned owl (Bubo virginianus,GHOW) was presented to the wildlife rehabilitation hospital at Lindsay Wildlife Museum (WRHLWM) due to trauma to the right patagium from barbed wire entanglement. On presentation, both corneas were irregular, dry, and no movement of the third eyelid was noted. A severe corneal enlargement/globoid appearance was the predominant ophthalmic feature. The fundus was normal in both eyes (OU). Over the course of several days, both corneas developed edema combined with further dessication at the ocular surface associated with diffuse dorsal fluorescein stain uptake. Repeated ophthalmic examinations found normal intraocular pressures and an inability to move the third eyelid over the enlarged corneas. The bird was deemed nonreleasable due to severe wing damage and poor prognosis associated with eye abnormalities and was humanely euthanized. Postmortem CT, enucleation, and histopathology were performed to evaluate the ocular anatomical abnormality and confirm the suspected diagnosis of keratoglobus. This GHOW represents the first reported case of presumptive keratoglobus in a raptor. © 2016 American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists

ABSTRACT: The little owl Athene noctua (Scopoli, 1769) is a small raptor that is widely distributed from northern to southern Portugal and several other countries in Europe, Asia and North Africa, and which has been introduced into New Zealand. In the current study, 18 fecal samples were collected from little owls kept at the Lisbon Center for Wild Animal Recovery, which is located in Monsanto Forest Park, Lisbon, Portugal. Twelve (67%) of them were found to be passing an undescribed species of Avispora in their feces. The oocysts of Avispora mochogalegoi n. sp. were ellipsoidal with a bilayered wall and measured 38.9 × 32.9 μm, with a shape index of 1.18. No micropyle, oocyst residuum or polar granule was present. The sporocysts were subspherical, measuring 21.1 × 20.1 μm. Stieda, sub-Stieda and para-Stieda bodies were absent. The sporocyst residuum was composed of a compact subspherical mass of granules. This is the fourth species of Avispora reported in Strigiformes. © 2017, Brazilain Coll Veterinary Parasitology. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Hundreds of species of wild-caught birds are offered for sale in the bird markets of Java and Bali, Indonesia, to meet the demand for the largely-domestic pet and songbird trade. In the past, owls were offered only in very small numbers in these bird markets but since the release of the Harry Potter series in Indonesia in the early 2000s their popularity as pets has increased. Whereas in the past owls were collective known as Burung Hantu (“Ghost birds”), in the bird markets they are now commonly referred to as Burung Harry Potter (“Harry Potter birds”). We made a retrospective quantitative assessment of the abundance of owls in the bird markets (1979–2010) and conducted 109 surveys in 20 bird markets in 2012–2016 to quantify owls in trade. In the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s owls were rarely recorded in Indonesia's bird markets, typically one or two and up to five per survey, and frequently no owls were recorded at all. The trade was largely confined to small scops owls. In the late 2000s more species were offered for sale, including barn and bay owls, and larger owl species such as wood-owls, eagle-owls and fish-owls; typically 10 + owls were observed per survey. In recent years, the number of owl species increased even more, and on average we recorded 17 owls per survey, yielding a total of 1810 owls, and in >90% of the surveys owls were present. In the larger bird markets in Jakarta and Bandung typically 30 to 60 owls are on offer of up to 8 species at a time. The number of owls as a proportion of all birds in the markets increased from <0.06% prior to 2002 to >0.43% post 2008, suggesting a delayed Harry Potter effect. Over this period, common species have become cheaper and less common ones have become more expensive. The owls are largely, if not exclusively, wild-caught and are sold into the domestic pet market. The release of Harry Potter films and novels in Indonesia coincided with the rise of the Internet and social media and, with some delay, the emergence of pet owl interest groups on Java and Bali, thus preventing us to demonstrate a causal Harry Potter effect on the owl trade. The overall popularity of owls as pets in Indonesia has risen to such an extent that it may imperil the conservation of some of the less abundant species. Inclusion of owls on Indonesia's protected species list, alongside all diurnal raptors, may be a first step to mitigate the negative effects of this emerging trend. © 2017 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The agricultural scene has changed over the past decades, resulting in a declining population trend in many species. It is therefore important to determine the factors that the individual species depend on in order to understand their decline. The landscape changes have also resulted in habitat fragmentation, turning once continuous populations into metapopulations. It is thus increasingly important to estimate both the number of individuals it takes to create a genetically viable population and the population trend. Here, population viability analysis and habitat suitability modeling were used to estimate population viability and future prospects across Europe of the Little Owl Athene noctua, a widespread species associated with agricultural landscapes. The results show a high risk of population declines over the coming 100 years, especially toward the north of Europe, whereas populations toward the southeastern part of Europe have a greater probability of persistence. In order to be considered genetically viable, individual populations must count 1,000–30,000 individuals. As Little Owl populations of several countries count <30,000, and many isolated populations in northern Europe count <1,000 individuals, management actions resulting in exchange of individuals between populations or even countries are probably necessary to prevent losing <1% genetic diversity over a 100-year period. At a continental scale, a habitat suitability analysis suggested Little Owl to be affected positively by increasing temperatures and urban areas, whereas an increased tree cover, an increasing annual rainfall, grassland, and sparsely vegetated areas affect the presence of the owl negatively. However, the low predictive power of the habitat suitability model suggests that habitat suitability might be better explained at a smaller scale. © 2017 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Contrast imaging studies are routinely performed in avian patients when an underlying abnormality of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is suspected. Fluoroscopy offers several advantages over traditional radiography and can be performed in conscious animals with minimal stress and restraint. Although birds of prey are commonly encountered as patients, little is known about GI transit times and contrast imaging studies in these species, especially owls. Owls are commonly encountered in zoological, educational, and wildlife settings. In this study, 12 adult barred owls (Strix varia) were gavage fed a 30% weight-by-volume barium suspension (25 mL/kg body weight). Fluoroscopic exposures were recorded at 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, and 300 minutes after administration. Overall GI transit time and transit times of various GI organs were recorded. Median (interquartile range [IQR]) overall GI transit time was 60 minutes (IQR: 19-60 minutes) and ranged from 5-120 minutes. Ventricular and small intestinal contrast filling was rapid. Ventricular emptying was complete by a median of 60 minutes (IQR: 30-120 minutes; range: 30-240 minutes), whereas small intestinal emptying was not complete in 9/12 birds by 300 minutes. Median small intestinal contraction rate was 15 per minute (IQR: 13-16 minutes; range: 10-19 minutes). Median overall GI transit time in barred owls is more rapid than mean transit times reported for psittacine birds and red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis). Fluoroscopy is a safe, suitable method for investigating GI motility and transit in this species. © 2017 by the Association of Avian Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: We know little about the breeding behavior of most nocturnal raptors. Nest attendance and prey delivery rates can be used as indices of relative habitat quality or extent of parental care. We used video cameras to document and observe prey delivery rates, nest attendance and bout durations at two northern saw-whet owl (Aegolius acadicus) nests in two artificial nest boxes in north-central Oregon. We collected 858 hours of video surveillance between 21 March and 01 June 2014. The number of prey deliveries per night increased as the nesting season progressed: 1.25 during laying, 1.33 during incubation, and 4.0 during the nestling phase. Prey was delivered most often between 2100 and 2200. Nest attendance by females was high during pre-laying (97.8%), laying (97.9%) and incubation (98.2%), but decreased during the nestling phase (55.7%). Nest attendance was higher during diurnal hours than nocturnal hours across all nesting phases. Duration of off bouts (recesses) was similar during pre-laying and laying (26 min), decreased during incubation (19 min), then increased during the nestling phase (55 min). One of the nesting attempts was successful and the female abandoned the other clutch 22 days after initiation. The incubation and nestling periods were 30 days each.

ABSTRACT: The mean phenotypic effects of a discovered variant help to predict major aspects of the evolution and inheritance of a phenotype. However, differences in the phenotypic variance associated to distinct genotypes are often overlooked despite being suggestive of processes that largely influence phenotypic evolution, such as interactions between the genotypes with the environment or the genetic background. We present empirical evidence for a mutation at the melanocortin-1-receptor gene, a major vertebrate coloration gene, affecting phenotypic variance in the barn owl, Tyto alba. The white MC1R allele, which associates with whiter plumage coloration, also associates with a pronounced phenotypic and additive genetic variance for distinct color traits. Contrarily, the rufous allele, associated with a rufous coloration, relates to a lower phenotypic and additive genetic variance, suggesting that this allele may be epistatic over other color loci. Variance differences between genotypes entailed differences in the strength of phenotypic and genetic associations between color traits, suggesting that differences in variance also alter the level of integration between traits. This study highlights that addressing variance differences of genotypes in wild populations provides interesting new insights into the evolutionary mechanisms and the genetic architecture underlying the phenotype. © 2017 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Hispaniola is the second largest island in the Caribbean that includes the countries of Dominican Republic and Haiti and has five resident owl species inhabiting open landscapes, rainforests, human-modified areas, and cities. The five species are the barn owl (Tyto alba), the endemic ashy-faced owl (T. glaucops), burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia), stygian owl (Asio stygius), and short-eared owl (A. flammeus). The stygian owl is the most threatened and least known of the five species. Puerto Rico represents the smallest and easternmost of the Greater Antilles, and it has a total of three species of owls inhabiting forest, open landscapes, and human-modified areas. The status of the barn owl on the island is not well known as the first breeding pair was documented in 2015, the short-eared owl is mostly restricted to lowlands and low montane open areas, and the Puerto Rican screech owl (Megascops nudipes) is the most common and widespread owl on the island. The Virgin Island race of the Puerto Rican screech owl (M. nudipes newtoni) that formerly inhabited a forested area of the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico's satellite island of Vieques is apparently extinct. These owls are suffering from changing landscapes and loss of natural habitat, especially in Haiti where natural resources and forests are nearly gone. Natural habitat remaining on Hispaniola is mainly confined to protected areas and the majority lack enforcement and protection. On the other hand, in Puerto Rico, the abandonment of forested areas such as shade coffee plantations, mainly in the highlands, has resulted in forest regeneration benefitting the Puerto Rican screech owl, and the abandonment of sugar cane plantations in the lowlands has favored the local subspecies of short-eared owl and most likely the colonization by barn owls. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

ABSTRACT: Costa Rica is known worldwide for its high biodiversity concentrated in a rather small area, and the Strigiformes form no exception to this diversity. A total of 17 species have been recorded in the country during more than 150 years of ornithological research. Since 1964, owl species richness has not increased, and one species (Asio stygius) is considered in the category of "expected occurrence." Costa Rican owl species are classified in 11 genera, Megascops and Glaucidium being the more diverse in terms of species numbers. There are no endemic species, but two species are considered regional endemics, Glaucidium costaricanum and Megascops clarkii. Fourteen species are residents and three are accidental. For the Pacific slope, 13 species have been recorded, while ten species have been recorded for the Caribbean slope, and ten species are shared between them. One species is restricted to the Caribbean slope, while three species, previously considered as Pacific lowlands only, have recently been reported from the Caribbean slope. Three species are exclusively found in the highlands over 2000 m. All of the owl species are included in CITES, Appendix II. We have documented 58 existing published documents that include the 17 species of Costa Rican owls (37 corresponding to Strigidae, one to Tytonidae, and 20 in the order Strigiformes). Costa Rica's owls remain poorly studied, and there are considerable knowledge gaps for many species. It is essential to generate biological and ecological baseline data to know the actual status and population trends of Costa Rican owls, providing the Region with information that allows us to take conservation actions and further directions for these taxa. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

ABSTRACT: A total of 13 owl species, 1 Tytonidae and 12 Strigidae, have been recorded in French Guiana. Twelve of them are resident species, and one, the short-eared owl Asio flammeus, is a rare vagrant, probably from north-western South America. Two species have been recorded for the first time in recent years: the Roraiman (vermiculated) screech owl Megascops guatemalae roraimae probably remained undetected before due to its rarity and to lack of knowledge of its voice. On the contrary, the burrowing owl Athene cunicularia is a recent addition to the French Guianan avifauna, benefiting from local deforestation for agricultural projects. Seven owl species are forest species, and four of them are restricted to primary or old contiguous secondary forest. The remaining six species live in semiopen to open habitats and forest edges. At present, French Guianan owl populations do not seem at risk, although destruction of coastal natural habitats may constitute a danger in future. For that reason and because of the small size of populations, three species are listed as Vulnerable and one as Endangered at the national level. Our knowledge of the distribution and biology of many owl species is greatly deficient and needs urgent research for conservation purposes. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

ABSTRACT: Fire is a dynamic ecosystem process of mixed-conifer forests of the Sierra Nevada, but there is limited scientific information addressing wildlife habitat use in burned landscapes. Recent studies have presented contradictory information regarding the effects of stand-replacing wildfires on Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis) and their habitat. While fire promotes heterogeneous forest landscapes shown to be favored by owls, high severity fire may create large canopy gaps that can fragment the closed-canopy habitat preferred by Spotted Owls. We used radio-telemetry to determine whether foraging California Spotted Owls (S. o. occidentalis) in Yosemite National Park, California, USA, showed selection for particular fire severity patch types within their home ranges. Our results suggested that Spotted Owls exhibited strong habitat selection within their home ranges for locations near the roost and edge habitats, and weak selection for lower fire severity patch types. Although owls selected high contrast edges with greater relative probabilities than low contrast edges, we did not detect a statistical difference between these probabilities. Protecting forests from stand-replacing fires via mechanical thinning or prescribed fire is a priority for management agencies, and our results suggest that fires of low to moderate severity can create habitat conditions within California Spotted Owls' home ranges that are favored for foraging. © 2017 American Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: The Choco Screech-Owl (Megascops guatemalae centralis) is one of the rarest birds in Ecuador and its taxonomy remains poorly understood. Here, we describe the nest, owlet morphology, prey items, defensive behaviors, a newly discovered locality for the species, and the occurrence of parasitism, caused by Philornis sp. of the owlets.

ABSTRACT: Capsule: Short-eared Owls Asio flammeus showed a female-biased sex ratio in their southernmost wintering grounds in Oriental Asia. This is the first description of a nomadic movement pattern in this area. Aims: To investigate the sex ratio, movement patterns, home range size and habitat preference of non-breeding Short-eared Owls in subtropical Taiwan. Methods: Eleven Short-eared Owls were radio tracked following trapping and transportation away from an airport as part of the management of bird-strike risk for aeroplanes. Results: Our results indicated a female-skewed (75%) sex ratio for Short-eared Owls wintering in Taiwan. The owls demonstrated a nomadic behaviour by showing a repetitive pattern of high roosting site fidelity in the short term, followed by a long-distance movement to a different discrete area. Grasslands were commonly used as day-roosting sites but agricultural habitats were favoured at night. Conclusion: Compared to on the breeding ground, the wintering owls exhibited a much larger home range size and exploit more dispersed patches of suitable habitats. These results revealed a notable conservation issue for the wintering owls, especially in the degraded and partially developed landscapes in subtropical countries. © 2017 British Trust for Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: Counts of avian fledglings, nestlings, or clutch size that are bounded below by zero and above by some small integer form a discrete random variable distribution that is not approximated well by conventional parametric count distributions such as the Poisson or negative binomial. We developed a logistic quantile regression model to provide estimates of the empirical conditional distribution of a bounded discrete random variable. The logistic quantile regression model requires that counts are randomly jittered to a continuous random variable, logit transformed to bound them between specified lower and upper values, then estimated in conventional linear quantile regression, repeating the 3 steps and averaging estimates. Back-transformation to the original discrete scale relies on the fact that quantiles are equivariant to monotonic transformations. We demonstrate this statistical procedure by modeling 20 years of California Spotted Owl fledgling production (0-3 per territory) on the Lassen National Forest, California, USA, as related to climate, demographic, and landscape habitat characteristics at territories. Spotted Owl fledgling counts increased nonlinearly with decreasing precipitation in the early nesting period, in the winter prior to nesting, and in the prior growing season; with increasing minimum temperatures in the early nesting period; with adult compared to subadult parents; when there was no fledgling production in the prior year; and when percentage of the landscape surrounding nesting sites (202 ha) with trees ≥25 m height increased. Changes in production were primarily driven by changes in the proportion of territories with 2 or 3 fledglings. Average variances of the discrete cumulative distributions of the estimated fledgling counts indicated that temporal changes in climate and parent age class explained 18% of the annual variance in owl fledgling production, which was 34% of the total variance. Prior fledgling production explained as much of the variance in the fledgling counts as climate, parent age class, and landscape habitat predictors. Our logistic quantile regression model can be used for any discrete response variables with fixed upper and lower bounds. © 2017 American Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Owls are known for their outstanding neck mobility: these birds can rotate their heads more than 270°. The anatomical basis of this extraordinary neck rotation ability is not well understood. We used X-ray fluoroscopy of living owls as well as forced neck rotations in dead specimens and computer tomographic (CT) reconstructions to study how the individual cervical joints contribute to head rotation in barn owls (Tyto furcata pratincola). The X-ray data showed the natural posture of the neck, and the reconstructions of the CT-scans provided the shapes of the individual vertebrae. Joint mobility was analyzed in a spherical coordinate system. The rotational capability was described as rotation about the yaw and roll axes. The analyses suggest a functional division of the cervical spine into several regions. Most importantly, an upper region shows high rolling and yawing capabilities. The mobility of the lower, more horizontally oriented joints of the cervical spine is restricted mainly to the roll axis. These rolling movements lead to lateral bending, effectively resulting in a side shift of the head compared with the trunk during large rotations. The joints in the middle of the cervical spine proved to contribute less to head rotation. The analysis of joint mobility demonstrated how owls might maximize horizontal head rotation by a specific and variable combination of yawing and rolling in functionally diverse regions of the neck. © 2017 Anatomical Society

ABSTRACT: In animal communication, signal loudness is often ignored and seldom measured. We used a playback experiment to examine the role of vocal loudness (i.e., sound pressure level) in sibling to sibling communication of nestling barn owls Tyto alba. In this species, siblings vocally negotiate among each other for priority access to parental food resources. Call rate and call duration play key roles in this vocal communication system, with the most vocal nestlings deterring their siblings from competing for access to the food item next delivered by parents. Here, we broadcast calls at different loudness levels and call rate to live nestlings. The loudness of playback calls did not affect owlets' investment in call rate, call duration or call loudness. The rate at which playback calls were broadcast affected owlets' call rate but did not influence their response in terms of loudness. This suggests that selection for producing loud signals may be weak in this species, as loud calls may attract predators. Moreover, given that owlets do not overlap their calls and that they communicate to nearby siblings in the silence of the night, loud signals may not be necessary to convey reliable information about food need. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

ABSTRACT: Long-term population decline of the little owl has been recorded in Western Europe and available evidence also suggests severe range restriction in many Central European regions. Using two nationwide volunteer-based monitoring programmes during the years 2009-2016, we investigated distribution, population density and breeding associations of the little owl in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Across the two countries combined, the average population density of the little owl was 0.19 calling males/10 km2. However, the population density was markedly higher in Slovakia (0.36 calling males/10 km2) than in the Czech Republic (0.09 calling males/10 km2). The overall breeding population of the little owl was estimated at 130 breeding pairs in the Czech Republic and 550 in Slovakia. Compared to the situation two decades ago, those estimates represented a 87-94 % decline in the breeding population in the Czech Republic and a 31-45 % reduction in Slovakia. Our data also revealed marked distributional range contraction of the little owl, indicating rapid local extinctions over the last two decades. The analysis of expected breeding places of the little owl confirmed a strong preference for man-made objects over the original breeding sites in tree cavities. In the light of our present results, we propose urgent preparation and implementation of a species action plan with conservation measures to halt the little owl’s steep decline in Central Europe. © 2017, Czech Academy of Sciences.

ABSTRACT: In the framework of the biodiversity initiative and barcoding project "Austrian Barcode of Life" (ABOL) post mortem examinations of the gastro-intestinal tracts of different species of wild birds were carried out and several adult helminths were retrieved. In the gizzard of two barn owls (Tyto alba) and one common kestrel (Falco tinnuculus) acuariid nematodes belonging to the species Synhimantus (Synhimantus) laticeps (Rudolphi, 1819) were discovered. This report illustrates the identification of this parasitic nematode by morphometric comparison and scanning electron microscopic photographs. Furthermore, genetic identification of individual parasites based on a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene and the nuclear 18S ribosomal RNA gene was carried out. This report constitutes the first COI-based DNA barcoding of S. (S.) laticeps and its first record in the barn owl (Tyto alba) in Austria. © 2017 D. Ebmer et al., published by De Gruyter Open 2017.

ABSTRACT: The present study was conducted to record the diet composition of Barn Owl, Tyto alba through regurgitated pellet analysis as determinant for its potential as biocontrol agent of rodent pests in Punjab, India. Analysis of 390 regurgitated pellets of Bam Owl collected from six different locations revealed their average weight, length, breadth and thickness to be 4.7 g, 3.9 cm, 2.7 cm and 2.0 cm, respectively. Remains of total 843 prey individuals .includes 44.1, 43.9 and 11.4 per cent rats, mice, and shrews. Diet of Bam Owl consisted only of vertebrates, 99.6 per cent of which were small mammals and 88 per cent were rodents alone. Based on skeletal remains, average number of rats and mice consumed per pellet of Bam Owl were 1.1 and 2.3, respectively with maximum capacity of consuming 4 rats and 9 mice per night. Rodent species consumed by Bam Owl were the lesser bandicoot rat, Bandicota bengalensis; Indian gerbil, Tafera indica; the soft furred field rat, Millardia meltada; Indian bush rat, Golunda ellioti and field mouse, Mus booduga. Total active rodent burrows were highest at the radius of 1001-2000m from the nesting or roosting sites of Bam Owl with highest number of burrows of B. bengalensis at all the three locations. Study suggests the use of Bam Owl in biological control of rodents as one of the components in integrated pest management.

ABSTRACT: Paraguay is located at the center of South America at the confluence of several biomes: Atlantic Forest, Cerrado, Mesopotamian Grasslands, Chaco, and Pantanal. Some 719 bird species are documented for the country, of which 16 are owls. No owls are endemic to Paraguay, but one species is endemic to the Chaco biome and three species and one subspecies are endemic to the Atlantic Forest. In Paraguay, ornithological research has experienced productive periods and other long periods without advances; currently there are no studies underway that focus on the ecology or conservation of owls, although some studies on diet and behavior have been published. Only one species, Rusty-barred Owl (Strix hylophila), is considered at risk internationally, but seven species are considered at risk at the national level. The principal threats to the owls of Paraguay are habitat destruction, lack of protected areas or poor implementation of existing areas, popular beliefs that nocturnal birds bring bad luck, forest management incompatible with owl conservation, and lack of information about the basic biology of these birds. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

ABSTRACT: Knowledge of how and why secondary sexual characters are associated with sex hormones is important to understand their signalling function. Such a link can occur if i) testosterone participates in the elaboration of sex-traits, ii) the display of an ornament triggers behavioural response in conspecifics that induce a rise in testosterone, or iii) genes implicated in the elaboration of a sex-trait pleiotropically regulate testosterone physiology. To evaluate the origin of the co-variation between melanism and testosterone, we measured this hormone and the expression of enzymes involved in its metabolism in feathers of barn owl (Tyto alba) nestlings at the time of melanogenesis and in adults outside the period of melanogenesis. Male nestlings displaying smaller black feather spots had higher levels of circulating testosterone, potentially suggesting that testosterone could block the production of eumelanin pigments, or that genes involved in the production of small spots pleiotropically regulate testosterone production. In contrast, the enzyme 5α-reductase, that metabolizes testosterone to DHT, was more expressed in feathers of reddish-brown than light-reddish nestlings. This is consistent with the hypothesis that testosterone might be involved in the expression of reddish-brown pheomelanic pigments. In breeding adults, male barn owls displaying smaller black spots had higher levels of circulating testosterone, whereas in females the opposite result was detected during the rearing period, but not during incubation. The observed sex- and age-specific co-variations between black spottiness and testosterone in nestling and adult barn owls may not result from testosterone-dependent melanogenesis, but from melanogenic genes pleiotropically regulating testosterone, or from colour-specific life history strategies that influence testosterone levels. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Abstract: In animal societies, individuals should optimize the way they behave in relation to the behavior displayed by their conspecifics. This social competence, i.e., the ability to adjust behavior to the social context, can vary between individuals, but also improve with age and experience. This aspect, although important, has rarely been studied. We tested whether the ability to adjust behavior to siblings develops with age in barn owl nestlings (Tyto alba). In this species, young siblings show intense social interactions referred to as “sibling negotiation.” Indeed, because parents bring a single indivisible food item at each visit to the nest, all the effort invested in sibling competition is only paid back in the nestling that is able to monopolize the food item. Therefore, before the arrival of parents, siblings vocally inform each other about their relative hunger level so that they can optimally invest in sibling competition, with the most vocal, and hence hungry, nestling momentarily deterring its siblings from competing. This process implies that siblings have the ability to adjust their behavior in relation to the behavior of their siblings, a process that could change with age. In a series of experiments, we examined how nestlings of different ages respond to the vocal behavior of siblings. We show here that older nestlings adjusted their vocal behavior more finely than younger nestlings in relation to the behavior of their siblings. Elders also more readily refrained from eating in front of a hungry sibling. These patterns could arise because owlets’ social competence develops with age or because they adopt different competitive and cooperative strategies according to their age. Significance statement: In sibling barn owls, competition for food brought by parents is settled by vocalization. Highly vocal owlets induce their siblings to call less and to let them eat in priority once parents are back with a prey item, a process referred to as “sibling negotiation.” Nestling barn owls adjust their investment in sibling competition according to two parameters: their hunger level and the vocal behavior of their siblings. We analyzed the relative importance of these two parameters in differently aged owlets. Younger owlets adjusted the intensity of vocalizing primarily in relation to their own hunger level, which was efficient in modifying older nestlings’ behavior, as older nestlings readily withdrew from vocal contest and refrained from eating in front of highly vocal siblings. Hence, social adjustment changed with age in owlets, older ones being more sensitive to the signals of need of their siblings. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

ABSTRACT: We measured the auditory sensitivity of the barn owl (Tyto alba), using a behavioural Go/NoGo paradigm in two different age groups, one younger than 2 years (n = 4) and another more than 13 years of age (n = 3). In addition, we obtained thresholds from one individual aged 23 years, three times during its lifetime. For computing audiograms, we presented test frequencies of between 0.5 and 12 kHz, covering the hearing range of the barn owl. Average thresholds in quiet were below 0 dB sound pressure level (SPL) for frequencies between 1 and 10 kHz. The lowest mean threshold was –12.6 dB SPL at 8 kHz. Thresholds were the highest at 12 kHz, with a mean of 31.7 dB SPL. Test frequency had a significant effect on auditory threshold but age group had no significant effect. There was no significant interaction between age group and test frequency. Repeated threshold estimates over 21 years from a single individual showed only a slight increase in thresholds. We discuss the auditory sensitivity of barn owls with respect to other species and suggest that birds, which generally show a remarkable capacity for regeneration of hair cells in the basilar papilla, are naturally protected from presbycusis. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: Northern Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) is a medium-sized forest owl of conservation concern in the Pacific Northwest of North America. We report two sightings of previously unreported parental behaviour: A Northern Spotted Owl feeding avian nestlings to its young and a Northern Spotted Owl defending a fledgling against a Black Bear (Ursus americanus). Further research may be warranted on the influence of brood size and habitat quality on dietary breadth. Although Black Bears have not been previously documented as Northern Spotted Owl predators, we suggest that they should be considered potential predators of nestling and fledgling owls. © This work is made available under the Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication (CC0 1.0) 2017.

ABSTRACT: To achieve a better understanding of the life histories of Chilean owls and to generate a useful source of information for future studies, we undertook an exhaustive review of all available information relating to their taxonomy, natural history, ecology, genetic and conservation biology. Studying these topics we gathered information on morphology, morphometrics, distribution, abundance, habitat, reproduction, longevity, behaviour, diet, feeding ecology, population ecology, community ecology, functional ecology, ecophysiology, endemism, conservation status, threats, human perception, legislation, education and outreach, physical rehabilitation, and habitat management. During our review, we rediscovered and retrieved naturalist's observations that had remained totally unknown to contemporary ornithologists. Some of the challenges that must be addressed to achieve a clearer understanding of the biology of Chilean owls and strengthen conservation strategies are (i) to definitively determine the validity of Bubo magellanicus as a separate species and establish the true extent of its distributional hiatus; (ii) to determine the geographic boundaries for Glaucidium nana and G. peruanum; (iii) to detect the ocurrence of population size variations and to identify possible causal factors; (iv) to identify variables that promote the use of, and preference for, habitats; (v) to ascertain, in detail, their reproductive characteristics, home ranges, and dynamic movements; (vi) to assess their diets in poorly studied ecosystems; (vii) to determine their relevance in local food webs and roles in ecosystems; (viii) to evaluate the genetic structure of owls in highly fragmented landscape; and (ix) to promote much more education about their natural history. We think that our review will be useful both in guiding new conservation efforts and opening new research perspectives that will help fill information gaps. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

ABSTRACT: Belize is one of the smallest countries in Central America and has one of the lowest human population densities of any country in the world. More than 40% of its land is in protected open space. Of its eleven resident owl species, Ciccaba virgata, a woodland species, is the most common and widespread, followed roughly in order by Megascops guatemalae of woodland habitats; Tyto alba, an inhabitant of open areas; and the more locally distributed Glaucidium brasilianum of open woodlands and edges. Pulsatrix perspicillata, C. nigrolineata, G. griseiceps, and Lophostrix cristata are confined largely to mature broadleaf forests in the interior. Asio stygius is confined to pine woodlands; Bubo virginianus to a variety of habitats on the Ambergris peninsula, and along the northern coastal strip where it is rare; and Pseudoscops clamator to open meadows and savannas on the coastal plain south of Belize City. Athene cunicularia and Asio flammeus have been recorded in Belize as vagrants. The percentage of each owl species' distributional range that lies within designated protected areas is examined, and the extent to which these lands are managed for protection of their natural resources is explored. The most serious current anthropogenic threats to owls and their habitats are discussed, as are potential impacts on owls from global climate change. In light of these documented and perceived threats, A. stygius and B. virginianus mayensis are the most vulnerable, the former from potential forest fires, bark beetle infestations, timber extraction, and land clearing for milpas, and the latter because of its very limited distribution in Belize, its small world population, and uncertainties about the viability of its source population in the Yucatan Peninsula. Protection of owl habitats through improved management and patrolling of the country's vast network of protected areas, better enforcement of its environmental laws and regulations, and expanded environmental education programs appears at this time to be the most effective conservation strategies for owls in Belize. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

ABSTRACT: This paper describes an ontology-based system to inventory and model various involved aircraft resources (e.g. sensors, airborne platform, computing components, etc.) needed to perform ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance & Reconnaissance) missions in a semantic manner on-board airborne surveillance aircrafts. For this Web Ontology Language (OWL) was used as knowledge representation language. The goal is to determine, based on available capabilities, which combination of resources should be applied to fulfill given ISR tasks. There for a matchmaking approach is applied to match capabilities provided by the system's resources to the mission's requirements (e.g. vehicle detection) during mission. Semantic reasoning is finally used to derive a recommendation for appropriate resource selection. The workflow is demonstrated using representative use cases. © 2017 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Land-use management, human impacts, and wildlife population processes taking place outside protected areas may affect the conservation of species within protected areas. While many studies have evaluated the effectiveness of protected areas for conserving biodiversity, the contribution of non-protected areas in this respect has seldom been assessed. Here, we assess the suitability of non-protected areas for a Eurasian Eagle-owl population using long-term monitoring data of 127 territories, together with survival and home range data from 30 radio-tracked individuals, in order to investigate whether the demographic parameters estimated and home range size differed inside and outside protected areas. The results showed that the number of breeding territories was higher inside the protected areas and that the average home range was significantly smaller for individuals nesting inside the protected areas. However, no significant differences in survival or in the breeding performance were observed between individuals nesting in territories inside and outside the protected areas. We conclude that although protected areas are effective for maintaining breeding populations of Eurasian Eagle-owls and their size can be considered sufficient to offer suitable protection of the foraging habitat, non-protected areas also deliver positive outcomes for these populations. © 2017 Leon-Ortega et al.

ABSTRACT: In Bolivia there are 25 owl species within 12 genera, representing 33% of the neotropical owl species. In each of the 12 ecoregions of the country, there are at least three owl species, the Yungas being the most diverse ecoregion, with 15 species. Most of the owls in Bolivia (15 species) have a distribution that ranges from moderately restricted to widely distributed, while ten species have a restricted range. Information on the biology and ecology of owls from Bolivia is scarce or nonexistent. One species, Megascops marshalli, is currently classified as vulnerable at a national level. The main threats to these owls are habitat loss and human persecution. Although all species are found in at least one protected area, there are no specific conservation measures for them. Systematic studies on all aspects of owl biology and ecology are needed, in order to fill information gaps and promote their conservation. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

ABSTRACT: Only ten owl species and two more subspecies are known to live in Uruguay. Knowledge of actual populations of all species is extremely limited as only food of some species has been studied. It is important to carry out more studies on owls and their habitats, in order to understand how they tolerate numerous changes in the environment. The National Institute for Agricultural Research (INIA) has started in 2014 an interesting experiment by putting up nest boxes for the owls. Preliminary results indicate that at least American barn owl (Tyto furcata) and tropical screech owl (Megascops choliba uruguaiensis) have started to accept the boxes for breeding and roosting. It is awaited that INIA will soon publish some photos and more detailed results on this experiment. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

ABSTRACT: Restoration of western dry forests in the USA often focuses on reducing fuel loads. In the range of the spotted owl, these treatments may reduce canopy cover and tree density, which could reduce preferred habitat conditions for the owl and other sensitive species. In particular, high canopy cover (≥70%) has been widely reported to be an important feature of spotted owl habitat, but averages of stand-level forest cover do not provide important information on foliage height and gap structure. To provide better quantification of canopy structure, we used airborne LiDAR imagery to identify canopy cover in different height strata and the size and frequency of gaps that were associated with owl nest sites, protected activity centers (PACs), and territories within four study areas and 316 owl territories. Although total canopy cover was high in nest stands and PAC areas, the cover in tall (>48 m) trees was the canopy structure most highly selected for, while cover in lower strata (2–16 m) was avoided compared to availability in the surrounding landscape. Tall tree cover gradually decreased and lower strata cover increased as distance increased from the nest. Large (>1000 m2) gaps were not found near nests, but otherwise there was no difference in gap frequencies and sizes between PACs and territories and the surrounding landscape. Using cluster analysis we classified canopy conditions into 5 structural classes and 4 levels of canopy cover to assess the relationship between total canopy cover and tree size within nest sites, PACs, and territories. High canopy cover (≥70%) mostly occurs when large tree cover is high, indicating the two variables are often confounded. Our results suggest that the cover of tall trees may be a better predictor of owl habitat than total canopy cover because the latter can include cover in the 2–16 m strata – conditions that owls actually avoid. Management strategies designed to preserve and facilitate the growth of tall trees while reducing the cover and density of understory trees may improve forest resilience to drought and wildfire while also maintaining or promoting the characteristics of owl habitat. © 2017

ABSTRACT: This study focused on the clutch size and age-specific apparent survival rate of the Little Owl (Athene noctua) population in Upper-Kiskunság, Hungary. Between May 2005 and April 2017, 640 individuals were captured and ringed in a total of 746 capture-recapture occasions. Artificial nest boxes were installed in the study area, breeding birds and pulli were captured for ringing/recaptured in these boxes (from March to May), or at the close neighbourhood of those (max. 168 m). Jolly-Seber’s open population method was applied to model the survival rate. The candidate model set included models incorporating age, year-effect, and the combination of those. AICc value was used to compare models in a selection approach. The final model was constructed via model averaging based on the models with significant explanatory power. The average number and SD of pullus/breeding pair was 3.78 ± 0.76. The average apparent annual survival rate (which does not differentiate between mortality and permanent emigration) for the period between pullus stage and the time of the first breeding was estimated as 9.47% ± 2.99% SE, whereas the annual survival rate of adults was 82.74% ± 8.46% SE. The effect of sex on the survival rate of adults was not investigated due to female-biased sample, as the probability of capturing females is significantly higher in late spring months. Our experience reveals that during February and March it is possible to capture both sexes in the nest boxes, and it does not influence negatively the breeding success. Based on our results, the population of the Little Owl is stable in Upper-Kiskunság. A slight increase in estimated population size is observable even if we make no difference between mortality and permanent emigration. The high occupancy rate of the installed nest boxes reveals that nest site availability is an important limiting factor in the studied population. © 2017, BirdLife Hungary. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The amount of high-quality habitat patches, their distribution, and the resource accessibility therein play a key role in regulating habitat effects on reproductive success. Heterogeneous habitats offer non-substitutable resources (e.g. nest sites and food) and substitutable resources (e.g. different types of food) in close proximity, thereby facilitating landscape complementation and supplementation. However, it remains poorly understood how spatial resource separation in homogeneous agricultural landscapes affects reproductive success. To fill this gap, we investigated the relationships between farmland heterogeneity and little owl (Athene noctua) reproductive success, including potential indirect effects of the heterogeneity-dependent home-range size on reproduction. Little owl home-ranges were related to field heterogeneity in summer and to structural heterogeneity in winter. Clutch size was correlated with the amount of food-rich habitat close to the nest irrespective of female home-range size, suggesting importance of landscape complementation. Nestling survival was positively correlated with male home-range size, suggesting importance of landscape supplementation. At the same time, fledgling condition was negatively correlated with male home-range size. We conclude that decreasing farmland heterogeneity constrains population productivity by two processes: increasing separation of food resources from nest or roost sites results in low landscape complementation, and reduction of alternative food resources limits landscape supplementation. Our results suggest that structural heterogeneity affects landscape complementation, whereas the heterogeneity and management of farmland fields affect landscape supplementation. Thus, to what extent a reduction of the heterogeneity within agricultural landscapes results in species-specific habitat degradation depends on the ecological processes (i.e. landscape complementation or supplementation) which are affected. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Bubo magellanicus is a nocturnal raptor with a wide distribution in the southern cone of South America. The diet of B. magellanicus in central Chile was analysed, using the pellet analysis method. Bubo magellanicus was found to consume mainly rodents (44.8%), lagomorphs (22.0%) and birds (23.6%). The most frequent rodents were Abrocoma bennetti (18.2%) and Abrothrix longipilis (7.3%). On the other hand, a comparison of the diet of B. magellanicus with previous studies showed that the main prey species were small mammals and that the proportion of birds and insects was higher in sites located in central Chile. In addition, the geometric mean weight of prey captured decreased in sites located in southern Chile; however, the trophic niche breadth showed no clear change in the five locations analysed. Finally, the prey diversity in the diet of the B. magellanicus between sites located in three eco-regions of Chile showed significant differences. © 2016 The Royal Society of New Zealand.

ABSTRACT: The taxonomic affinities of the monotypic owl genus Sceloglaux Kaup, 1848 have been widely debated. Here, we present a high-coverage mitogenome for the sole member of the genus, New Zealand's extinct laughing owl (Sceloglaux albifacies Gray, 1845), and assess its phylogenetic relationships. Our results provide strong support for Sceloglaux being nested within Ninox Hodgson, 1837, as sister taxon to the clade containing the barking owl (Ninox connivens Latham, 1801), Sumba boobook (Ninox rudolfi Meyer, 1882), and morepork (Ninox novaeseelandiae Gmelin, 1788). Accordingly, we synonymize Sceloglaux with Ninox, and recommend that the laughing owl hereafter be referred to as Ninox albifacies. Osteological analyses and a comparison of the wing and leg proportions of the laughing owl with those of other owls supports Gould's (1865) contention that it was largely a terrestrial owl, and predominantly caught prey on the ground. This is further supported by the relatively high abundance of terrestrial prey remains preserved in sediment deposits at former laughing owl nest sites. © 2016 The Linnean Society of London.

ABSTRACT: A western burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia hypugaea) found dead in southern California had many light-colored lesions visible grossly on its liver, and histopathology revealed extensive necrosis throughout the hepatic parenchyma. Single-celled organisms were seen in clear spaces within the areas of necrosis. The owl was diagnosed with protozoal hepatitis.

ABSTRACT: Ceratopsids ("horned dinosaurs") are known from western North America and Asia, a distribution reflecting an inferred subaerial link between the two landmasses during the Late Cretaceous. However, this clade was previously unknown from eastern North America, presumably due to limited outcrop of the appropriate age and depositional environment as well as the separation of eastern and western North America by the Western Interior Seaway during much of the Late Cretaceous. A dentary tooth from the Owl Creek Formation (late Maastrichtian) of Union County, Mississippi, represents the first reported occurrence of Ceratopsidae from eastern North America. This tooth shows a combination of features typical of Ceratopsidae, including a double root and a prominent, blade-like carina. Based on the age of the fossil, we hypothesize that it is consistent with a dispersal of ceratopsids into eastern North America during the very latest Cretaceous, presumably after the two halves of North America were reunited following the retreat of the Western Interior Seaway. © 2017 Farke and Phillips.

ABSTRACT: Habitat modifications have led many bird species to occupy areas with different characteristics, including human-altered landscapes. In this study, we analyzed how land use influences the nest-site selection at the microscale level by Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia) breeding in vegetated sand dunes, periurban areas, and agroecosystems in the Pampas of Argentina. We compared the characteristics of the nest site (percentage of open space) and the nest patch (distance to conspecific nests, tall vegetation and perches and number of perches) within and among the three land-cover types. In addition, we evaluated the breeding performance (nesting success and productivity) of owls nesting in these land-cover types. We found that nest microsite variables did not vary between owl-occupied and owl-unoccupied sites within nest patches, but they differed among land-cover types. Although nest patches differed in their availability of perches at each land-cover type, distance from the nest to the nearest perch did not vary between them. Distances to tall vegetation and to conspecific nests were highly variable and did not differ among land-cover types. Our results indicate that Burrowing Owls that inhabit the Pampas used a variety of land-cover types for nesting and showed little selectivity of nest sites and nest patches, thus reinforcing the idea that they are habitat generalists.

ABSTRACT: Between 2008 and 2015 we collected pellets of the Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo) in the Trøndelag region of central Norway and identified the food remains in these samples. We collected material at 45 sites with samples from a total of 76 nests. Some of the samples were from older and already abandoned nests, but at several sites we also found and collected fresh B. bubo pellets. In total 40,766 items of prey were identified from the osteological material. The most dominant food components were mammals (Mammalia, 25 species, 63.5%). The species representation of birds was very diverse (Aves, more than 150 species, 19.4%). Of amphibians (Amphibia, 16.8%), the well-represented species were Rana temporaria. Fish (Pisces, 0.3%) were represented rarely, while invertebrates were represented only sporadically (Invertebrata, 0.05%). A special composition was found in the diet spectra of the mammals and birds in the mountainous areas at altitudes between 220-780 m above sea level. The highest proportion of frogs was found in areas in the proximity of the mainland shore. On the northern islands located near the coast a significant proportion of the B. bubo diet consisted of rodents (Rodentia). On the more isolated southern islands of Frøya, Hitra and Storfosna the main prey was sea birds, and of the mammals there were also hedgehogs and rats. © 2016 Raptor Protection of Slovakia (RPS).

ABSTRACT: Strix (Strigidae) is a worldwide genus of 17 owl species typical of forested habitats, including Rusty-barred Owls (S. hylophila), Chaco Owls (S. chacoensis), and Rufous-legged Owls (S. rufipes) in South America. These species are distributed allopatrically, but the ecological traits that determine their distributions remain largely unknown and their phylogenetic relationships are unclear. We used species distribution models (SDMs) to identify variables explaining their distribution patterns and test hypotheses about ecological divergence and conservatism based on niche overlap analysis. For Rusty-barred Owls and Chaco Owls, climatic factors related to temperature played a major role, whereas a rainfall variable was more important for Rufous-legged Owls. When niche overlaps were compared, accounting for regional similarities in the habitat available to each species, an ecological niche divergence process was supported for Chaco Owl-Rusty-barred Owl and Chaco Owl-Rufous-legged Owl, whereas a niche conservatism process was supported for Rusty-barred Owl-Rufous-legged Owl. Different ecological requirements support current species delimitation, but they are in disagreement with the two main hypotheses currently envisaged about their phylogenetic relationships (Chaco Owls as the sister taxa of either Rufous-legged Owls or Rusty-barred Owls) and support a new phylogenetic hypothesis (Rufous-legged Owls as sister taxa of Rusty-barred Owls). Our findings suggest that speciation of Rusty-barred Owls and Rufous-legged Owls was a vicariant event resulting from Atlantic marine transgressions in southern South America in the Miocene, but their niche was conserved because habitat changed little in their respective ranges. In contrast, Chaco Owls diverged ecologically from the other two species as a result of their adaptations to the habitat they currently occupy. Ecological and historical approaches in biogeography can be embedded to explain distribution patterns, and results provided by SDMs can be used to infer historical and ecological processes in an integrative way. © 2017 Association of Field Ornithologists

ABSTRACT: The retinal layers of birds are the same as those of other vertebrates; however, some variations exist in morphology, areas of visual acuity, and retinal vascularisation. Moreover, as a result of the relationship between environment, visual perception and behaviour, some variations are observed between diurnal and nocturnal birds. In this study, we have investigated the retina of the Eurasian Eagle-owl (Bubo bubo hispanicus) by optical microscopy. The results indicate that the retina has features of both nocturnal and diurnal birds. The pigment epithelium cells have long prolongations filled with melanin granules. The rod is the dominant photoreceptor, but simple cones are abundant. Yellow and colourless oil droplets and paraboloid are present in the inner segment of cones. In the inner nuclear layer, the cell bodies of horizontal cells can easily be recognised by a large and pale cytoplasm. Bipolar cell perikarya are identified by their dark nuclei and the round and narrow cytoplasm. Amacrine cells, located in the inner border of the inner nuclear layer, have a round perikarya and lightly stained nuclei. Müller cells bodies, also located in this region, have an irregular shape. Finally, ganglion cells which are characterised by the prominent nuclei and nucleoli vary in size and abundance depending on different regions in the retina. The morphological characteristics of this retina indicate that B. b. hispanicus have a high light sensitivity, the capacity to discriminate colour, a complex visual processing in the inner retina in order to mediate contrast and motion and, possibly, an elevated acuity in areas of high photoreceptor and ganglion cell density.

ABSTRACT: The middle ears of birds are typically connected by interaural cavities that form a cranial canal. Eardrums coupled in this manner may function as pressure difference receivers rather than pressure receivers. Hereby, the eardrum vibrations become inherently directional. The barn owl also has a large interaural canal, but its role in barn owl hearing and specifically in sound localization has been controversial so far. We discuss here existing data and the role of the interaural canal in this species and add a new dataset obtained by laser Doppler vibrometry in a free-field setting. Significant sound transmission across the interaural canal occurred at low frequencies. The sound transmission induces considerable eardrum directionality in a narrow band from 1.5 to 3.5 kHz. This is below the frequency range used by the barn owl for locating prey, but may conceivably be used for locating conspecific callers. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: The study of haematocrit and biochemical parameters is considered a useful tool for diagnosis of health status in birds. However, an adequate interpretation requires reference values for each species. Moreover, factors such as age and sex should also be taken into account, as it is well known that they can also influence several parameters. For these reasons, serum biochemical parameters (albumin, calcium, phosphorus, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, cholesterol, triglycerides, creatine kinase, γ-glutamyltransferase, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase, total proteins and uric acid) were studied in 15 adults (6 males and 9 females) and 258 chicks of free-living Eurasian eagle owl (Bubo bubo), one of the owls with the largest distribution range worldwide. Most blood clinical parameters were higher in nestlings than in adults, but only significantly for alkaline phosphatase, phosphorus and uric acid. On the contrary, γ-glutamyltransferase was significantly lower in nestlings. In adults, sex differences were not significant. Haematocrit was studied in 13 adults (2 males and 11 females) and 162 nestlings, and levels were significantly higher in adults than in nestlings. Because samples were obtained from healthy free-living individuals and the values fall within the range of levels considered physiological for similar species, we suggest that can be used as reference values for Eurasian eagle owls. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: The remains of a recently consumed Powerful Owl Ninox strenua nestling were discovered in two locations near an active nest: at a feeding perch frequently used by the breeding pair of adults, and beneath the long-term roost of the adult male. Given the positioning of the nestling remains under two sites used by the adults, it appears likely that an adult consumed the nestling in a case of cannibalism. Powerful Owls rarely scavenge, meaning that infanticide was the most plausible cause of the nestling's death.

ABSTRACT: Context Due to their important ecological roles, predators are increasingly being suggested as targets for biodiversity studies investigating how they respond to landscape change and transformation. But there is limited literature investigating our capacity to accurately monitor changes in their occupancy. Aims To test the efficacy of playback surveys for monitoring owls as a basis for investigating change in owl occupancy over time. We ask whether playback is an effective tool, and whether it can be optimised to improve its utility. Methods Using the urban-forest interface of Melbourne, Australia, as a case study, we used playback techniques to survey for the presence of three owl species: the powerful owl (Ninox strenua); southern boobook (Ninox boobook); and eastern barn owl (Tyto javanica). Sites were repeat surveyed at least 16 times throughout the year and occupancy models were developed to establish how season and temperature influence nightly detection probabilities of owls. Key results All three species of owl were detected through playback survey approaches, but the detection probabilities varied greatly between species and across seasons and temperature conditions. Eastern barn owls are poor candidates for playback surveys due to their low detection probabilities. The southern boobook and powerful owl are responsive to playback, but detection probabilities are influenced by season and/or temperature conditions. To optimise survey approaches, southern boobooks should be surveyed during spring and summer and the powerful owl should be surveyed on nights where the minimum temperature is near 20°C. Conclusions Although there is considerable interest in using predators such as owls to monitor biodiversity impacts associated with landscape change, poor detection rates can limit their utility. However, optimising survey approaches that consider shifting detection probabilities under different conditions such as time of year or temperature may improve the utility of predators as surrogates in biodiversity monitoring. Implications Optimising survey approaches for owls considerably reduces the window of opportunity in which to conduct surveys. To counter this, the intensity of survey effort needs to be increased during key periods. The use of highly trained citizen science teams may be one effective way of delivering such an approach. © CSIRO 2017.

ABSTRACT: Eight subspecies have been proposed within the Tawny Owl (Strix aluco) species. However, recent molecular data have challenged this view, encouraging further work in this species complex. Here we reevaluated the taxonomic status between the North-Western African Tawny Owl, S. a. mauritanica, and its closest Iberian Tawny Owl population (from the S. a. sylvatica to S. a. aluco clade) separated by the Strait of Gibraltar. The Tawny Owl is a non-migratory and territorial species, and juvenile dispersal is restricted to a few kilometers around the natal site. This limited dispersal and the barrier imposed by the Strait of Gibraltar predicted a strong differentiation between the two populations. We tested this using DNA barcoding, Bayesian phylogenetic and species delimitation analysis. We found that an 81.1% of variation is due to the intergroups variation. In addition, the inter–intraspecific distances distribution revealed a barcoding gap among the two subspecies. Also, posterior probabilities and the PAB value allowed to reject the hypothesis that observed degree of distinctiveness is due to random coalescence processes. These findings clearly support the Strait of Gibraltar as an isolating barrier for this species. The subspecific status is confirmed and species status is even suggested for S. a. mauritanica. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

ABSTRACT: Surface coatings of the polysaccharide dextran and its derivatives are key ingredients especially in label-free biosensors for the suppression of non-specific binding and for receptor immobilization. Nevertheless, the nanostructure of these ultrathin coatings and its tailoring by the variation of the preparation conditions have not been profoundly characterized and understood. In this work carboxymethylated dextran (CMD) was prepared and used for fabricating ultrathin surface coatings. A grafting method based on covalent coupling to aminosilane- and epoxysilane-functionalized surfaces was applied to obtain thin CMD layers. The carboxyl moiety of the CMD was coupled to the aminated surface by EDC-NHS reagents, while CMD coupling through epoxysilane molecules was performed without any additional reagents. The surface analysis following the grafting procedures consisted of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR), spectroscopic ellipsometry, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and optical waveguide lightmode spectroscopy (OWLS). The XPS and AFM measurements showed that the grafting resulted in a very thin dextran layer of a few nanometers. The OWLS method allowed devising the structure of the interfacial dextran layers by the evaluation of the optogeometrical parameters. The alteration in the nanostructure of the CMD layer with the chemical composition of the silane coverage and the pH of the grafting solution was revealed by in situ OWLS, specifically, lain down chains were found to be prevalent on the surface under neutral and basic conditions on epoxysilylated surfaces. The developed methodologies allowed to design and fabricate nanometer scale CMD layers with well-controlled surface structure, which are very difficult to characterize in aqueous environments using present instrumentations and highly hydrated surface layers. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Between 1995 and 2017 we carried out surveys on the Little Owl (Athene noctua) in Battonya town and Kevermes village in southern Békés county. In 2007 and 2017 we have surveyed nesting sites in the village and the outer areas of Kevermes. The population of the species was estimated at the beginning of the breeding season and in early summer with field observations. Between 1995 and 2017 we collected road-kill data within the entire administrative area of Battonya. We registered each fiund road-killed Little Owl. We found 64 road-kills in Battonya. The number of casualties of the species has increased unambiguously over the studied 23 years. Most of the road-killed Little Owls (53 individuals, 82.81% of the total) were found in summer (June–August). 51 road-killed individuals (79.69%) were noted in the outer areas of Battonya, and 13 specimens (20.31%) in the town. Our results highlight that vehicle traffic is an important mortality factor for the population. The Little Owl has a large population in this landscape, and the population size has increased over the last decade. In the background of this increase is most likely the rise in the number of abandoned houses because of the unfavourable economic and social situation in the region. The local pairs nested only on attics and roof structures in Kevermes, often in residential buildings. The buildings of modern agriculture do not meet the needs of the species. A large part of the population breeds in the village, because with the disappearance of the farms the breeding pairs of the outer areas of Kevermes have disappeared. However, in Battonya the species regularly breeds in the outer areas of the town. Finally, we also collected some ethnoecological data on how local people relate to the species. © 2017, BirdLife Hungary. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Western Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia hypugaea) frequently occupy periurban areas, where they may be exposed to pest control agents. This short communication describes necropsy findings and detected brodifacoum rodenticide levels for four Western Burrowing Owls in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, US, 2013–15. Levels detected ranged from 0.077 mg/kg to 0.497 mg/kg. Brodifacoum, one of several second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides recently removed from the general consumer market, is still available for use by licensed pesticide applicators. Despite recent regulatory actions, second-generation anticoagulant pesticides continue to threaten predatory species in periurban areas. © Wildlife Disease Association 2017.

ABSTRACT: Established taxa within the Enterobacteriaceae wereisolated from cloacal swabs of Strix aluco chicks in nest boxes located at five research sites. ChromID ESBL medium (bioMerieux) was used to select a pool of Enterobacteriaceae strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. Drug sensitivity of the chosen strains was determined from the full pool of Enterobacteriaceae to 6 chemotherapeutics of different mechanisms of action. The study evaluated the sensitivity of ESBL-synthesizing isolates to substances belonging to penicillins, cephalosporins, cephamycins, clavams, carbapenems and monobactams. Analysis of the results indicated a potential role of Strix aluco in the dissemination of epidemiologically-relevant Enterobacteriaceae, and, importantly, pose health risks to forest service workers, nature protection service and ornithologists. The results can also serve as the basis for further environmental studies. © 2017, Institute of Agricultural Medicine. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Capsule: The analysis of 815 papers about the diet of the European Barn Owl Tyto alba showed that the consumption of small mammals that are insectivorous (shrews and moles) declined between 1860 and 2014. This suggests that the impoverished invertebrate communities due to global changes affected a large range of animals up to top predators. © 2016 British Trust for Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: Owls are an order of birds of prey that are known for the development of a silent flight. We review here the morphological adaptations of owls leading to silent flight and discuss also aerodynamic properties of owl wings. We start with early observations (until 2005), and then turn to recent advances. The large wings of these birds, resulting in low wing loading and a low aspect ratio, contribute to noise reduction by allowing slow flight. The serrations on the leading edge of the wing and the velvet-like surface have an effect on noise reduction and also lead to an improvement of aerodynamic performance. The fringes at the inner feather vanes reduce noise by gliding into the grooves at the lower wing surface that are formed by barb shafts. The fringed trailing edge of the wing has been shown to reduce trailing edge noise. These adaptations to silent flight have been an inspiration for biologists and engineers for the development of devices with reduced noise production. Today several biomimetic applications such as a serrated pantograph or a fringed ventilator are available. Finally, we discuss unresolved questions and possible future directions. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Manual restraint is commonly necessary when working with avian species in medical, laboratory, and field settings. Despite their prevalence, little is known about the stress response in raptorial bird species. To further understand the effect of restraint on the stress response in birds of prey, 12 barred owls (Strix varia) were manually restrained for 15 minutes. Physiological parameters (cloacal temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate) were followed over time and recorded at defined points during the restraint period. Heart rate decreased significantly over the restraint period by a mean ± SD of -73 ± 46 beats/min. Respiratory rate also decreased significantly (median: -11 breaths/min, interquartile range: -8 to -18). Cloacal temperature increased significantly over time in manually restrained owls (median: +1.5°C [+2.7°F], interquartile range: 1.3°C-2.1°C [2.3°F-3.8°F]). This study is the first to document stress hyperthermia in an owl species. Similar to another raptorial bird, the red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), both heart rate and respiratory rate decreased and cloacal temperature increased over time in restrained barred owls. Barred owls appear to cope differently to restraint stress when compared to psittacine species. © 2017 by the Association of Avian Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Although, in many organisms, genotypes are adapted to specific environmental conditions, the identification of the ecological factors explaining patterns of local adaptation is not a trivial task. In relation to the cosmopolitan barn owl (Tyto alba), its plumage varies from white to dark pheomelanic and shows a difference in the number and size of black spots located at the tip of ventral feathers. The expression of these traits is strongly heritable and weakly sensitive to variation in body condition. Therefore, if owls located in cold or rainy regions are differently plumaged compared to owls living in warm or dry regions, this may not be a result of climate affecting the expression of plumage traits. Instead, different plumages might be selected under different environmental conditions. We have found that, on the British Isles, comparatively larger spots are present on barn owls found in regions that are cooler in summer. This is similar to the findings of a previous study performed in North America and on continental Europe, raising the possibility that larger-spotted barn owls better cope in cold temperatures during the rearing period or that they are better adapted to some environmental factors prevailing in cooler summers. © 2016 The Linnean Society of London

ABSTRACT: The spatiotemporal aspects of sleeping behavior are indicative of the ecological pressures that primate species face. We investigated the potential influence of predation and thermoregulatory constraints on sleeping site choice and sleep-related behaviors in a population of cathemeral owl monkeys (Aotus azarae azarae) in Formosa, Argentina. During 10 mo, we recorded data on 153 diurnal sleeping bouts (N = 5 groups), sleeping tree physical characteristics (diameter at breast height [DBH], height, foliage), sleeping sites within the tree, and grouping and positional behavior while sleeping. We also conducted a vegetation survey of potential sleeping trees. Our study groups used only 17 of 58 available tree species, slept in the top fifth of trees, and slept at sites midway between the trunk and crown exterior. Tree DBH, height, and sleeping site height varied among groups according to the forest subtypes within their home ranges. Group members slept in a huddle when temperatures were between 5° and 35°C, and slept separately only with temperatures >20°C. During the wet, hot summer, they slept more frequently under dense foliage; in the dry, cold winter, they preferred sites with light foliage and direct sun exposure, potentially to facilitate sunbathing, which occurred almost exclusively during the winter. While several sleeping site characteristics were consistent with minimizing predation risk, our results also suggest a tradeoff between predator exposure and warmer conditions at sleeping sites, especially during winter. Our results support the predation avoidance and thermoregulatory constraint hypotheses, furthering the possibility that these pressures were also contributing factors in the evolution of their cathemeral activity pattern. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: The neuronal representation of luminance contrast has not been thoroughly studied in birds. Here we present a detailed quantitative analysis of the contrast response of 120 individual neurons recorded from the visual wulst of awake burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia). Stimuli were sine-wave gratings presented within the cell classical receptive field and optimized in terms of eye preference, direction of drift, and spatiotemporal frequency. As contrast intensity was increased from zero to near 100%, most cells exhibited a monotonic response profile with a compressive, at times saturating, nonlinearity at higher contrasts. However, contrast response functions were found to have a highly variable shape across cells. With the view to capture a systematic trend in the data, we assessed the performance of four plausible models (linear, power, logarithmic, and hyperbolic ratio) using classical goodness-of-fit measures and more rigorous statistical tools for multimodel inferences based on the Akaike information criterion. From this analysis, we conclude that a high degree of model uncertainty is present in our data, meaning that no single descriptor is able on its own to capture the heterogeneous nature of single-unit contrast responses in the wulst. We further show that the generalizability of the hyperbolic ratio model established, for example, in the primary visual cortex of cats and monkeys is not tenable in the owl wulst mainly because most neurons in this area have a much wider dynamic range that starts at low contrast. The challenge for future research will be to understand the functional implications of these findings. © 2016 the American Physiological Society.

ABSTRACT: The main purpose of this paper is to demonstrate a bionic design for the airfoil of wind turbines inspired by the morphology of Long-eared Owl's wings. Glauert Model was adopted to design the standard blade and the bionic blade, respectively. Numerical analysis method was utilized to study the aerodynamic characteristics of the airfoils as well as the blades. Results show that the bionic airfoil inspired by the airfoil at the 50% aspect ratio of the Long-eared Owl's wing gives rise to a superior lift coefficient and stalling performance and thus can be beneficial to improving the performance of the wind turbine blade. Also, the efficiency of the bionic blade in wind turbine blades tests increases by 12% or above (up to 44%) compared to that of the standard blade. The reason lies in the bigger pressure difference between the upper and lower surface which can provide stronger lift. © 2017 Weijun Tian et al.

ABSTRACT: Genetic methods enable to reveal cryptic parental contributions in reproduction, especially in socially monogamous species. The rate of extra-pair paternity is generally low in raptors and owls and its presence in some species is tightly associated with sequential polyandry which can rarely occur in years with high food availability. In this study we investigated the mating system of the Tengmalm’s owl (Aegolius funereus) in the Ore Mountains (Czech Republic). In this area, the species usually nests in high breeding densities which could increase an opportunity for extra-pair copulations. In total, 297 individuals (54 females, 47 males and 196 juveniles) from 46 nest boxes were genotyped at seven microsatellite loci. We present results of a five-year study and four extra-pair nestlings (2.3 %) were detected which did not result from sequential polyandry. © 2017, Czech Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Natural selection typically constrains the evolution of sexually-selected characters. The evolution of naturally- and sexually-selected traits can be intertwined if they share part of their genetic machinery or if sex traits impair foraging success or increase the risk of depredation. The present study investigated phenotypic correlations between naturally- and sexually-selected plumage traits in the Tytonidae (barn owls, grass owls, and masked owls). Phenotypic correlations indicate the extent to which selection on one trait will indirectly influence the evolution of another trait. In this group of birds, the ventral body side varies from white to dark reddish, a naturally-selected pheomelanin-based colour trait with important roles in predator–prey interactions. Owls also exhibit eumelanin-based black spots, for which number and size signal different aspects of individual quality and are used in mate choice. These three plumage traits are strongly heritable and sexually dimorphic, with females being on average darker reddish and more spotted than males. Phenotypic correlations were measured between these three plumage traits in 3958 free-living barn owls in Switzerland and 10 670 skin specimens from 34 Tyto taxa preserved in museums. Across Tyto taxa, the sexually-selected plumage spottiness was positively correlated with the naturally-selected reddish coloration, with redder birds being more heavily spotted. This suggests that they are genetically constrained or that natural and sexual selection are not antagonistically exerted on plumage traits. In a large sample of Swiss nestlings and within 34 Tyto taxa, the three plumage traits were positively correlated. The production of melanin pigments for one plumage trait is therefore not traded off against the production of melanin pigments for another plumage trait. Only in the most heavily-spotted Tyto taxa do larger-spotted individuals display fewer spots. This indicates that, at some threshold value, the evolution of many spots constrains the evolution of large spots. These analyses raise the possibility that different combinations of melanin-based plumage traits may not be selectively equivalent. © 2016 The Linnean Society of London

ABSTRACT: This study was carried out to reveal the formation of the sacral plexus in the Eurasian Eagle Owls (Bubo bubo) and the nerves originating from this plexus. Five EEOs, three of them were male and two were female, were provided from Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation Center of Kafkas University and used as materials. Following the euthanizing of the animals, abdominal cavity was opened. The nerves of plexus sacrales were dissected and photographed. It was detected that the sacral plexus was formed by the ventral ramus of five synsacral nerves. Moreover, it was determined that the roots of the sacral plexus formed three trunks: the truncus cranialis, the truncus medius and the truncus caudalis in fossa renalis. The availability of the n. ischiofemoralis and the availability of n. parafibularis were detected in the EEOs. Five branches were specified as having segregated from the sacral plexus: the n. cutaneus femoralis caudalis, the mutual root of n. fibularis with n. tibialis (n. ischiadicus), the rami musculares, the n. coxalis caudalis and the ramus muscularis. It was observed that the sacral plexus was linked to the lumbar plexus by the n. furcalis, to the pudendus plexus via the n. bigeminus. Consequently, the anatomic structure of the EEO's sacral plexus, the participating synsacral nerves to plexus and the innervation areas of these nerves were revealed. © 2015 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

ABSTRACT: Restoration to increase resilience to current and projected drought and fire in historically open-canopy forests in fire-prone environments may be constrained by concern for species that favor dense forest conditions. To assist the recovery of a threatened species, the Northern Spotted Owl (NSO), in dry forest environments, the US Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) recommends embedding NSO conservation and recovery in restoration efforts that enable ecosystem recovery from past management actions and increase resilience to changing climate. In this study, we assessed changes between historical and current (1) forest structure and composition and (2) extent of NSO nesting and roosting (NR) or foraging (F) forest cover on 39,000 ha at the eastern edge of the current designation of the range of the NSO. Historical records depict a predominantly open-canopy landscape dominated by large ponderosa pine. Current conditions include more than a 600% increase in trees 15–53 cm dbh, substantial decline in trees ⩾81 cm dbh, loss of the widespread distribution of trees ⩾53 cm dbh, and loss of the dominance of ponderosa pine on mixed conifer sites. NSO habitat assessment involves a suite of attributes including: landscape context; species composition; canopy cover; basal area; average tree diameter; diameter diversity; and abundance of large trees, snags, canopy layers, coarse woody debris, and mistletoe. We tested for the presence of forest that met USFWS threshold values for two of these variables, canopy cover and basal area. Historically none of the area met the 60% canopy cover threshold for NR or F forest cover and almost none meets it currently. However, several NSO nesting pairs and individual birds have been observed in the study area over the last 20 years, and studies in other frequent-fire forests show that canopy cover as low as 50% may be functional for NSO. To assess the implications of lower threshold values, we tested for NR or F forest cover presence at half the recommended thresholds, considerably below published estimates. Only five percent of the area exceeded 30% canopy cover historically; much of the current forest exceeds it today. Increase in canopy cover comes at the expense of increasing vulnerability to fire and drought and loss of historical functions and processes. Conflicting objectives of forest restoration and maintenance of spotted owl habitat on this site – isolated habitat in the dry margin of the range of the NSO – raises questions about how to achieve forest restoration in altered landscapes where existing, novel conditions favor at-risk species. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Differences between the so-called larks and owls representing the opposite poles of morningness-eveningness dimension are widely known. However, scientific consensus has not yet been reached on the methodology for ranking and typing people along other dimensions of individual variation in their sleep-wake pattern. This review focused on the history and state-of-the-art of the methodology for self-assessment of individual differences in more than one trait or adaptability of the human sleep-wake cycle. The differences between this and other methodologies for the self-assessment of trait- and state-like variation in the perceived characteristics of daily rhythms were discussed and the critical issues that remained to be addressed in future studies were highlighted. These issues include a) a failure to develop a unidimensional scale for scoring chronotypological differences, b) the inconclusive results of the long-lasting search for objective markers of chronotype, c) a disagreement on both number and content of scales required for multidimensional self-assessment of chronobiological differences, d) a lack of evidence for the reliability and/or external validity of most of the proposed scales and e) an insufficient development of conceptualizations, models and model-based quantitative simulations linking the differences between people in their sleep-wake pattern with the differences in the basic parameters of underlying chronoregulatory processes. It seems that, in the nearest future, the wide implementation of portable actigraphic and somnographic devices might lead to the development of objective methodologies for multidimensional assessment and classification of sleep-wake traits and adaptabilities. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

ABSTRACT: We analyzed seasonal changes in Tawny Owl (Strix aluco) diet in a broadleaved forest in Eastern Ukraine over 6 years (2007– 2012). Annual seasons were divided as follows: December–mid-April, April–June, July–early October, and late October–November. In total, 1648 pellets were analyzed. The most important prey was the bank vole (Myodes glareolus) (41.9%), but the yellow-necked mouse (Apodemus flavicollis) (17.8%) dominated in some seasons. According to trapping results, the bank vole was the most abundant rodent species in the study region. The most diverse diet was in late spring and early summer. Small forest mammals constituted the dominant group in all seasons, but in spring and summer their share fell due to the inclusion of birds and the common spadefoot (Pelobates fuscus). Diet was similar in late autumn, before the establishment of snow cover, and in winter. The relative representation of species associated with open spaces increased in winter, especially in years with deep snow cover, which may indicate seasonal changes in the hunting habitats of the Tawny Owl. © TÜBİTAK.

ABSTRACT: We completed data on the diet of the barn owl (Tyto alba) predominately from pellets for the period of the last 50 years from Slovakia. We analyzed material from 251 locations and 16 territorial units. The aggregate represents 119,231 pieces of prey from 47 species of mammals (Mammalia, 95.7%) and 58 species of birds (Aves, 3.9%), with a small representation of amphibians, reptiles (Amphibia and Reptilia, 0.2%) and invertebrates (Invertebrata, 0.2%). The obtaining of food among the owls is limited to synanthropic environments and the surrounding agricultural landscape, and the centre of its distribution in the recent period (i.e. the past 50 years: 1965-2015) has been concentrated mainly on the southern parts of Slovakia. In this environment the common vole (Microtus arvalis, 59.6%) is the primary prey. Additional prey are rodents of the family Muridae: Mus musculus (5.6%), Micromys minutus (2.2%), Apodemus microps (2.2%), A. flavicollis (2.0%), A. sylvaticus (1.6%) and A. agrarius (1.5%); insectivores of the family Soricidae: Sorex araneus (6.2%), S. minutus (2.4%), Crocidura leucodon (4.8%) and C. suaveolens (2.8%); and the house sparrow Passer domesticus (2.9%). In the higher situated Turcianska kotlina Basin the species M. arvalis (74.3%) has higher domination, and instead of the white-toothed shrews the water shrews Neomys anomalus (2.8%) and N. fodiens (1.3%) are more abundantly represented. In 3 localities owls focused on hunting bats; for example, in the church in Ratková the order Chiroptera made up 35.2% of prey. From the subrecent period (i.e. from before more than 50 years ago) we evaluate 4 samples from the territory of Slovakia with 15,601 pieces of prey of T. alba. Before more than 50 years ago owls were also more abundantly represented at higher elevations in Slovakia, evidence of which is Weisz's collection of pellets from 16 localities in the Ondavská vrchovina Upland in the years 1945 to 1963, but also a registry of data from the 19th and 20th centuries from higher located basins. In 4 samples of food from the subrecent period diversity in the representation of owl prey is higher, accompanied by low domination of M. arvalis and a more abundant representation of murids from the genera Mus and Apodemus. The oldest sample, dated to the 16th century, is from a church in Žilina-Rudiny. © 2016 Raptor Protection of Slovakia (RPS).

ABSTRACT: The feeding of Little Owl (Athene noctua) was studied in a farmland area of Kiskunság, Central Hungary. For the analyses, a total of 661 Little Owl pellets were collected between February and September 2005 from three locations, corresponding known Little Owl territories situated nearby the settlements Apaj, Kunpeszér and Ladánybene. The aim of the present study was to explore the diet composition of Little Owl and to give a detailed evaluation of the arthropod diversity based on the pellet analysis. The identified prey items represented 15 vertebrate and 39 invertebrate species/taxa. In terms of prey number, dominance of small mammals was observed in two sites (Apaj – 55%, Kunpeszér – 68%), while birds and mammals shared almost equal dominance (~25%) in Ladánybene. The most numerous mammal species was the Common Vole (Microtus arvalis), while the Starling (Sturnus vulgaris) played key role among the birds. Contribution of amphibian Common Spadefoot (Pelobates fuscus) was considerable, while share of reptiles was marginal. Vertebrates also played a predominant role by contributing over 99% of the overall prey biomass in all study sites. Invertebrate prey dominance ranged from 24.8–30.0% while their contribution to the overall biomass was very low (0.14–0.34%). Large sized beetles (Pentodon idiota, Melolontha hippocastani) and orthopterans (Tettigonia viridissima, Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa) were preferred. Arthropod species richness and diversity were the highest in Kunpeszér, supposedly owing to the rich mosaic habitat structure. © 2017, BirdLife Hungary. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: California spotted owls (CSOs) (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) have received significant conservation attention beginning with the U.S. Forest Service interim management guidelines in 1992. The most commonly reported forest habitat feature for successful nesting habitat of CSO is canopy cover > 70%. Loss and degradation of Sierra Nevada CSO habitat, however, has been a growing concern, initially from commercial tree harvesting and, more recently, from wildfire. This study examined trends in wildfire impacts on potential nesting habitat of the CSO and discusses different management approaches that might lead to the conservation of CSO in fire-dependent forests. A total of 85,046 ha of CSO potential nesting habitat was burned by fire that resulted in ge; 50% tree basal area (BA) mortality, reducing canopy cover on average to < 25%, during 2000-2014; this included 2.7%, 12.3%, and 7.6% of dense red fir (Abies magnifica), eastside pine, and westside forests, respectively. Based on regression predictions, within the next 75 yr, the cumulative amount of nesting habitat burned at ge; 50% tree basal area mortality will exceed the total existing habitat. Four management strategies are discussed that could enhance the conservation of the CSO: (1) increased fire suppression, (2) strategically reducing fire hazards using mechanical treatments and/or prescribed fire, (3) increasing the amount of managed wildfire in CSO habitat, and (4) developing a landscape strategy that uses historical forest structure information to identify areas where high-canopy cover forests are more sustainable. Our estimates of how moderate-and high-severity fire may affect forests into the future poise a substantial threat to CSO persistence. More comprehensive forest restoration activities may be needed in CSO habitat to avoid significant losses of older forests. © 2016 Stephens et al.

ABSTRACT: In generalist predators the energy needed for reproduction is derived from various prey categories, the profitability of which may vary according to the biomass or accessibility of the prey items. We examined the relationships between the diet and production of young in two Tawny Owl (Strix aluco) populations in southern Finland. We found a positive correlation between the amount of remnants of different prey in samples of litter collected from the nest bottoms after breeding and the production of young. Three important prey categories in the diet of owls during the nestling period, i.e. Water Voles, Field Voles and thrush-sized birds, seemed to be significantly related to the number of fledglings. However, only thrush-sized birds showed a significant relationship to the number of fledglings when all prey variables were analysed together in one model. The total prey mass was the best predictor of owl brood size. There were no significant local differences between the effects of different prey categories on the production of Tawny Owl young. Our results, combined with some earlier findings, outline the relationship between food supply and the production of Tawny Owl young in southern Finland. With regards to the Tawny Owl this outline can be generalized to other areas with other kinds of food supply within the distribution range of the species. Similar outlines are probably applicable also to many other generalist predators. © 2016, Dt. Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.

ABSTRACT: The Magellanic Horned Owl (Bubo magellanicus) is one of the most common nocturnal raptors in Patagonia. The aim of this note was to analyze the food habits of this species in a small island from the Patagonian Atlantic coast. Four nesting areas and eight adults of Bubo magellanicus were found; 217 pellets plus disaggregated material were collected. We identified 2774 individual prey items. Insects were the most consumed prey (63.56%), followed by reptiles (13.73%), arachnids (10.92%), mammals (10.42%), and birds (1.37%). Our study show B. magellanicus feeding mainly on arthropods and introduced species, a fact that was not previously reported for this species in Patagonia. © The Neotropical Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: The use of tracking devices to monitor birds is extensive, but the effects of such instruments on equipped individuals are still insufficiently taken into account. Here we evaluate potential effects of backpack-mounted satellite transmitters (platform terminal transmitters; PTTs) on survival of 28 Snowy Owls Bubo scandiacus. Six confirmed deaths were all probably related to natural and human-induced causes. Although PTT operational time was significantly shorter than expected lifetime of Snowy Owls, five owls were observed alive after transmissions ceased. Additionally four PTTs stopped due to low battery levels, indicating end of transmitter life and not owl mortality. We found no evidence of mortality caused by PTTs, but sample sizes are relatively low and detrimental effects on equipped Snowy Owls cannot be excluded. We recommend caution when instrumenting large owls. © 2017 Norwegian Ornithological Society. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Boreal Owls (Aegolius funereus) rely on mature forests and, consequently, are negatively affected by timber harvesting strategies that alter the composition and structure of these forests. We tested an existing Boreal Owl habitat suitability index (HSI) model created using data from across the species' North American breeding distribution, plus a modified Newfoundland version that incorporated local data. We assessed the applicability of these models to a population on the periphery of the species' North American range in Newfoundland, Canada. We also conducted habitat composition analyses and evaluated the Boreal Owl HSI model values associated with forest cover projections under three different forest harvesting scenarios. Overall output from both HSI models indicated low levels of suitability for locations across the study area. Long-term persistence in Newfoundland demonstrates that suitable habitat for Boreal Owls exists, but what constitutes suitable habitat for populations in other parts of North America may differ from that in our study area. Boreal Owls in Newfoundland occupied locations with a greater proportion of disturbed cover, and lesser proportions of deciduous and mixed coniferous and deciduous stands ≥60 yr old, compared to what was available in the surrounding region, as measured in randomly selected plots. Whereas Boreal Owl habitat use in Newfoundland was similar to that described for other populations, the limited use of deciduous and mixed stands was distinct. Forward projection modeling of forest cover indicated that there were no differences in the overall suitability of habitat available to Boreal Owls under the three harvesting scenarios. Our study highlights the importance of adjusting forest management strategies to account for differences in habitat use among populations. © 2016 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: A free-ranging powerful owl (Ninox strenua) presented in a dull state with extensive bruising of the skin overlying the skull, due to suspected trauma. Supportive care was provided, which resulted in the return to a normal state, although intermittent subtle neurologic abnormalities remained. One month from original presentation, intermittent episodes of head turning and a possible seizure were noted, but behavior and appetite were otherwise normal. The owl was referred to Taronga Wildlife Hospital for evaluation. On presentation, the owl exhibited severe neurologic abnormalities, prompting euthanasia. At necropsy the dorsum of the skull exhibited marked osseous proliferation, extending ventrally and compressing the cerebrum. The skull was radiographed and submitted for histopathology. A diagnosis of osteoblastic osteosarcoma was made. This is the first report of a calvarial osteosarcoma in a powerful owl. Copyright © 2017 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Known for their rich biodiversity and high level of endemism, the islands of Wallacea serve as natural laboratories for the study of spatio-temporal evolution and patterns of species diversification. Our study focuses on the owl genus Ninox, particularly the Southern Boobook (N. novaeseelandiae) and Moluccan Boobook (N. squamipila) complexes, which are widely distributed across Australasia. We conducted bioacoustic and multi-locus DNA analyses of 24 Ninox owl taxa to evaluate relationships and levels of divergence within the two complexes and ultimately assess the relationship between patterns of taxonomic differentiation and bioclimatic factors. We found that taxa that are vocally and/or genetically distinct from populations on the Australian mainland are found on islands that are significantly larger and higher in altitude than taxa that are vocally and/or genetically indistinct from populations on the Australian mainland. This pattern suggests that taxa occurring on small, low-lying Wallacean islands are likely to be recent colonisers that have dispersed from Australia. Overall, our observations demonstrate that the genus Ninox is likely to have colonised the Wallacean region multiple times as small, low-lying islands undergo frequent extinction, whereas populations on large and high-altitude islands are more resilient. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The prey composition of the Barn Owl (Tyto alba) can be monitored indirectly by pellet analysis and we used this method to investigate less known small mammal species of Zala County. The number and abundance of small mammal species depend on the structure of the landscape of Barn Owls’ hunting area, therefore we analysed landscape features in the surrounding circles with 2 km radius around the sampling sites. In 2016 we collected 1106 pellets from 13 sampling localities. From the pellets we identified 21 species of 3022 individuals of small mammals (more than 98% of prey). Among the 21 species there was the rare Parti-colured Bat (Vespertilio murinus) and a new species for the county the Steppe Mouse (Mus spicilegus). Positive correlation was found between the diversity of the small mammal fauna of each sampling site and the landscape complexity (number of the landscape patches) of the Barn Owl hunting area. Relative abundance of the Wood Mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) showed positive correlation with the number of landscape patches, while the abundance of the Lesser White-toothed Shrew (Crocidura suaveolens), the Miller’s Water Shrew (Neomys anomalus), the Striped Field Mouse (Apodemus agrarius) and the Harvest Mouse (Micromys minutus) was higher in hunting areas with more homogenous landscapes. Significant correlations were found between the relative abundance of some small mammal species and the landscape structure of the potential hunting area of owls that confirmed the consistency in habitat preference of some species. Our results proved that the prey-composition of Barn Owls reflects the land use through the distribution and abundance of small mammal species, therefore this method is suitable for ecological analyses of landscape. © 2017, BirdLife Hungary.

ABSTRACT: Few cases of adoption have been reported in solitary breeding raptors, and in owls adoption has only been reported in two species. Here we report four cases of brood-switching of juvenile Tengmalm’s Owls (Aegolius funereus), recorded during and after the post-fledging dependence period using radio-telemetry, and a case of three orphaned siblings (one nestling and two fledglings) originally from one nestbox successfully fostered to another one. A possible evolutionary context of the brood-switching is discussed. © 2016, Dt. Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.

ABSTRACT: The recent increase interest on the research of various aspects related to the barn owls (Tyto alba) is due to the unique features of the bird in keeping down rodent pests. By identifying the prey fragments in the pellets of indigestible matter that the bird regurgitates it is easy to tell of the diet it consumed to maintain its energy demand. This work seeks to fill the gap on information concerning the gross morphology and morphometric of the alimentary canal of the barn owl (Tyto alba) found in North-central Nigeria. Fifteen apparently healthy Barn Owls of different age groups were used for this work. The live body weight of birds were taken and then euthanized by lethal injection. Dissection was done to gain access to different cavities of the bird for gross anatomic studies of the alimentary canal. The alimentary canal of the three age groups of birds studied presented similar morphological findings. The tongue appeared elongated and triangularly shaped with a pointed tip and a downward projection from the body with a cleft at the middle of the body. There was no crop. The stomach was cone shaped consisting of a cranial glandular compartment and a caudal muscular compartment. A 'U' shaped duodenum was clearly visible towards the right side of abdominal cavity, whereas the duodenal loop partly covered the jejunum and ileum. The vitelline diverticulum marks the end of the jejunum and the beginning of the ileum which is the shortest segment of the small intestine. The large intestine consists of two caeca (left and right) and a colorectum. The proximal parts of both caeca were ovoid in shape while the distal part is straight and tiny giving it a microphone or match stick shape. Morphometric measurements of the alimentary canal of the barn owl in the three age groups studied showed a significant difference at P < 0.05 on the tongue; stomach and duodenum with emphasis on the adults and owlets. In summary, the decreasing order in length of the different segments of the gastrointestinal tract of the common barn owl studied was found to be: jejunum > duodenum > oesophagus > tongue > ileum > stomach > caecum > colorectum. © 2017 IJVS.

ABSTRACT: In the present study, we used 37-year long dataset on Tawny Owls from the annual monitoring of nestboxes at a sample plot in Central Lithuania. We expected that Tawny Owls responded to changes in land use practices, stemming from a change in both political and economic system, which may affect prey abundance and composition, breeding performance and demography. To analyze temporal changes in monitored parameters, we divided the study period into three phases (1978-1989, 1990-2001 and 2002-2014), corresponding to different socio-economic conditions. The number of nesting pairs of Tawny Owls decreased significantly in the last 13 years of the study, but the number of successful pairs fluctuated without any trend. The clutch size and number of nestlings varied without significant trends, but nesting success improved over the last 13 years. Annual apparent survival probability of the female Tawny Owls did not vary significantly over the study period (model averaged values between 0.71 and 0.73). Owls occupied nestboxes irrespective to the distance from the agricultural land during the first two study periods, but since early 2000s, owls tended to occupy nestboxes located deeper in the forest. Birds and small mammals were similarly important as prey items by biomass. Since the 1990s, the share of Microtus voles significantly decreased in the diet, while that of birds increased. In summary, changes in the diet, improved nesting success of the Tawny Owl and tendency of nesting in forest interior may indicate ongoing complex responses to the changes in environmental conditions.

ABSTRACT: The post-fledging dependency period (PFDP: from fledging to cessation of parental care) is a critical yet poorly studied life history transition phase during which juveniles mature and develop skills for independence. We studied the spatial and vocal behaviour of radio-tagged juvenile Tawny Owls in 41 broods from fledging to independence (56–84 days) in 6 years of contrasting food conditions. Dispersion and nocturnal movements increased during the first 20–30 days post-fledging, after which the young roamed the entire natal territory, indicating fully or almost fully developed flying skills. During the entire PFDP, siblings were strongly associated both during the day (mean inter-sibling distances decreased from 11 to 0.6 m from the first to the 30th day after fledging) and at night (mean distances decreased from 32 to 6 m during the same period), and rarely moved outside the borders of the parental home range. The probability of begging per 20-min nocturnal observation period increased from 21 % at fledging to 80 % at independence during years of good food supply, but remained high (>82 %) in years of poor food supply. No change was observed in nocturnal movement distances or begging rates during the last 5 days before juvenile independence. Hence, juvenile Tawny Owls old enough to survive on their own invested heavily in begging, with no noticeable signs of increased hunting or exploration of potential settling areas outside the natal range, until they were no longer fed by their parents. © 2016, Dt.

ABSTRACT: The optical wide-field patrol network (OWL-Net) is a Korean optical surveillance system that tracks and monitors domestic satellites. In this study, a batch least squares algorithm was developed for optical measurements and verified by Monte Carlo simulation and covariance analysis. Potential error sources of OWL-Net, such as noise, bias, and clock errors, were analyzed. There is a linear relation between the estimation accuracy and the noise level, and the accuracy significantly depends on the declination bias. In addition, the time-tagging error significantly degrades the observation accuracy, while the time-synchronization offset corresponds to the orbital motion. The Cartesian state vector and measurement bias were determined using the OWL-Net tracking data of the KOMPSAT-1 and Cryosat-2 satellites. The comparison with known orbital information based on two-line elements (TLE) and the consolidated prediction format (CPF) shows that the orbit determination accuracy is similar to that of TLE. Furthermore, the precision and accuracy of OWL-Net observation data were determined to be tens of arcsec and sub-degree level, respectively. © The Korean Space Science Society.

ABSTRACT: Owl monkeys (Aotus nancymaae) are New World NHP that serve an important role in vaccine development and as a model for human disease conditions such as malaria. Despite the past contributions of this animal model, limited information is available about the phenotype and functional properties of peripheral blood lymphocytes in reference to sex and age. Using a panel of human antibodies and a set of standardized human immune assays, we identified and characterized various peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets, evaluated the immune functions of T cells, and analyzed cytokines relative to sex and age in healthy owl monkeys. We noted age-And sex-dependent changes in CD28+ (an essential T cell costimulatory molecule) and CD95+ (an apoptotic surface marker) T cells and various levels of cytokines in the plasma. In immune assays of freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, IFNγ and perforin responses were significantly higher in female than in male monkeys and in young adults than in juvenile and geriatric groups, despite similar lymphocyte (particularly T cell) populations in these groups. Our current findings may be useful in exploring Aotus monkeys as a model system for the study of aging, susceptibility to infectious diseases, and age-Associated differences in vaccine efficacy, and other challenges particular to pediatric and geriatric patients.

ABSTRACT: Predators affect prey directly by predation and indirectly by triggering behavioral responses that aim at reducing predation risk. In this paper, I present a method for training an avian predator which can allow separating between its direct and indirect effects on prey in various experimental setups. Barn owls are found to be a valuable tool for empirically testing different hypotheses related to predator-prey interactions, population dynamics, and inter-specific competition, all performed in the field using authentic rodent prey and their natural predators. Barn owls are raised and trained to participate in field experiments using classical conditioning, and are trained either to catch rodents or only to fly above a certain area without making any attempt to attack the prey, simulating solely predation risk. Body mass is a crucial factor in the training procedure, and I thus define five body mass ranges that characterize different behavioral stages in the training of owls. A logistic model is used to calculate and to predict changes in the body mass during the growth and training periods of owls. Finally, I discuss several possible implications of the usage of trained barn owls in empirical studies. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Social housing has often been recommended as one-way to address the psychological well-being of captive non-human primates. Published reports have examined methods to socialize compatible animals by forming pairs or groups. Successful socialization rates vary depending on the species, gender, and environment. This study presents a retrospective look at pairing attempts in two species of owl monkeys, Aotus nancymaae and A. azarae, which live in monogamous pairs in the wild. The results of 477 pairing attempt conducted with captive, laboratory housed owl monkeys and 61 hr of behavioral observations are reported here. The greatest success pairing these owl monkeys occurred with opposite sex pairs, with an 82% success rate. Opposite sex pairs were more successful when females were older than males. Female–female pairs were more successful than male–male (MM) pairs (62% vs 40%). Successful pairs stayed together between 3 and 7 years before the animals were separated due to social incompatibility. Vigilance, eating, and sleeping during introductions significantly predicted success, as did the performance of the same behavior in both animals. The results of this analysis show that it is possible to give captive owl monkeys a social alternative even if species appropriate social partners (i.e., opposite sex partners) are not available. The focus of this report is a description of one potential way to enhance the welfare of a specific new world primate, the owl monkey, under laboratory conditions. More important is how the species typical social structure of owl monkeys in nature affects the captive management of this genus. Am. J.

ABSTRACT: Data obtained from wildlife rescue centres are a useful means of understanding threats posed to wild animal populations. Aims of the present study were to investigate the causes of admission and outcomes of Long-eared Owls (Asio otus) hospitalised in rescue centres in Italy. Data were collected from 13 centres form January 2010 to October 2014 using a web form. The following variables were considered: estimated age at admission; date of admission; habitat at finding location; main cause of admission; and outcome. Major causes of admissions were related to human activities, mainly consisting of collision trauma and collection of uninjured fledglings. Despite nocturnal habits of owls and their protection status, according to European Union Directive 2009/147/CE and to national Italian laws, gunshot wounds were also represented as an admission cause in adult animals. Overall mortality rate was 47.3%. Considering age classes, the majority of adult animals died while the majority of pulli survived and were later released. Both collisions and gunshot wounds contributed to the higher mortality in adult animals. We suggest that anatomopathological and toxicological investigation of dead casualties, along with post release monitoring of rehabilitated owls, would contribute to a better understanding of mortality causes and to the implementation of more successful rehabilitation techniques.

ABSTRACT: Individuals of the same population with differing melanin plumage colouration can respond differently through fitness to environmental stressors. In a local population of Tawny Owls (Strix aluco), we collected individual-based data on nesting attempts of this well-known colour polymorphic species between 1985 and 2014. We studied whether body size, condition, demographic parameters and habitat around occupied nest sites differ among grey, intermediate and brown coloured females. The proportions of females belonging to each of the three colour morphs in the local population changed during the study period, withintermediate individuals becoming more frequent in the last decade. Females were similar in body size and achieved similar body condition during breeding irrespective of plumage colouration. Although most of the analysed demographic parameters were not statistically significantly related to the colour morph, the intermediate owls raised more nestlings in a lifetime and tended to have higher recapture probability. We found little support for habitat and morph associations. In summary, we propose that the increase in intermediate Tawny Owl colour morphs in this local population is associated with their better reproductive performance compared to the other morphs.

ABSTRACT: A previous investigation suggested that a surface bearing a rinsing-resistant depot (nanocoating) of albumin is more protein-repulsive than the same surface physically pegylated by a poly(D,L-lactic acid)-poly(ethylene oxide) diblock copolymer. To complement the study, Optical Waveguide Lightmode Spectroscopy was used to compare the mass and the thickness of protein depots from different systems, namely albumin alone at different concentrations, a mixture of albumin + fibrinogen + γ-globulin at their physiological concentrations, and sheep serum. The same standard OWLS protocol was applied to compare data for bare sensor chips, for chips covered by an albumin nanocoating, and for chips physically pegylated using poly(D,L-lactic acid)-poly(ethylene oxide) diblock copolymers with different compositions and block lengths. The strategy and the conditions being rather different from those generally used to study pegylation-related antifouling properties; the literature was first reviewed critically. Then full coverage of sensor chips by albumin was demonstrated. The comparative study confirmed that albumin was more protein-repulsive than any of the diblock copolymers, irrespective of the protein system. Furthermore, it was found that pegylated surfaces were albumin-repulsive only when the concentration of the protein solution flowing over the surface was very low (0.1 g/L). It was not possible to correlate the copolymer data to PEO chain density, chain length and existence of brush. The in vitro repulsive activity of albumin was not affected by drying and rehydration, a feature of interest for storage of albumin-coated surfaces. All these observations confirmed our preliminary findings and showed that considering model proteins individually or in mixtures at concentrations far from physiological concentrations are not suitable to reflect the reality of full blood-surface interactions. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Avian trichomonosis, caused by the flagellated protozoan parasite Trichomonas gallinae, has variable pathogenicity among bird species ranging from asymptomatic infections to severe disease periodically manifesting in epidemic mortality. Traditionally, columbids are identified as highly susceptible to infection with occasional spillover into raptors that prey on infected birds. We identified avian trichomonosis in two dead California spotted owls (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) and three dead northern spotted owls (S. o. caurina) in California during 2011–2015; infection was confirmed in four owls by PCR. Pathologic lesions associated with trichomonosis in the owls included caseonecrotic lesions of the upper palate accompanied by oropharyngitis, cellulitis, myositis, and/or sinusitis. Spotted owls are known to mainly feed on small mammals; therefore, the source of infection as well as the significance of the disease in spotted owls is unclear. These owl trichomonosis cases coincided temporally and spatially with three trichomonosis epidemics in band-tailed pigeons (Patagioenas fasciata monilis). The same parasite, T. gallinae subtype A2, was isolated from the spotted owls and band-tailed pigeons, suggesting the owls became infected when opportunistically feeding on pigeons during mortality events. Avian trichomonosis is an important factor in the decline of the Pacific Coast band-tailed pigeon population with near-annual mortality events during the last 10 years and could have conservation implications for raptor species at risk, particularly those that are facing multiple threats. © 2016 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The prey selection of short-eared owl (Asio flammeus) was studied based on pellet analysis. The owls consumed primarily mammals (99.4%), with the most important prey species being Microtus arvalis (94.7%) followed by Mus spicilegus, Crocidura suaveolens and Melanocorypha calandra. The selected prey species are common food components of this species; the food niche breadth was similar to the one in most studies in Central and Southern Europe and highlights the high food specialisation of short-eared owls.

ABSTRACT: New avian remains from the early Eocene Nanjemoy Formation in Virginia (USA) are described. The material stems from the Fisher/Sullivan site and consists of isolated bones. These belong to at least 13 species, most of which have not yet been reported from the Nanjemoy Formation. The fossil material includes the oldest unambiguous record of a charadriiform bird and a new species of protostrigid owl, which represents the smallest known owl species. Other specimens are tentatively assigned to the Procellariiformes, the suliform Fregatidae, the gruiform Messelornithidae, and the apodiform Eocypselidae. A complete and well-preserved tarsometatarsus of the psittacopasserine Halcyornithidae provides new data on the osteology of these enigmatic birds, and a distal tibiotarsus is tentatively assigned to the Trogoniformes. The identification of a number of fossils is uncertain, with the bones showing similarities to Threskiornithidae and extinct taxa from the early Eocene of Europe (Microena, Morsoravis). All bird fossils from the Nanjemoy Formation are three-dimensionally preserved and, therefore, allow a detailed assessment of osteological features, which complements studies of compression fossils from lagerstätten-type fossil sites. © 2016, Paläontologische Gesellschaft.

ABSTRACT: Like many owl species, Sunda Scops-Owls (Otus lempiji) are difficult to monitor using traditional survey techniques, because of their nocturnal habits, secretive nature, and cryptic coloration. Individual variation in vocalizations could potentially be used to distinguish individuals of this owl species, as has been demonstrated for many bird species. The objectives of this study were to describe the territorial call of Sunda Scops-Owls, to determine whether the calls can be distinguished individually, and to examine whether the calls from the same individuals were stable over time. We analyzed 75 recordings collected from 12 owls from December 2014 to June 2015 in a lowland forest and oil palm smallholdings in Selangor State, Peninsular Malaysia. Using two temporal parameters and six frequency parameters derived from spectrogram, we employed ANOVA tests and found significant differences for all parameters among individual owls. Discriminant function analysis correctly classified 97.1% of the owl calls to the correct individuals. Based on the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, all vocal parameters did not vary significantly for the six birds that were vocally active over two predetermined survey sessions within the breeding period. Our results demonstrated that Sunda Scops-Owls can be identified individually by their vocalizations. This implies that assessing vocal individuality can be useful as a noninvasive method for surveying the Sunda Scops-Owls and the method should be further tested for other little-known owl species in the tropics. © 2016 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: This study was carried out to investigate the structural properties of pecten oculi in the common barn owl (Tyto alba) by light and electron microscope. Fourteen eyeballs from seven owls were studied. The pecten oculi was located postero-anteriorly in the retina layer where the optic nerve enters the eye. The pecten oculi that was dark brown and pleated type consisted of 7 (n=4) or 8 (n=10) vascularised pectineal pleats. Histologically, there were numerous vessels of different size and melanocytes in the area of the pleats. Melanocytes were more frequently observed in the periphery of the pecten oculi’s pleats. Scanning electron microscopy showed hyalocytes on the surface of the pecten oculi. The results of the study indicated that the pecten oculi of the common barn owl was morphologically similar to that of other nocturnal birds. © 2017, Veteriner Fakultesi Dergisi.

ABSTRACT: On the Farallon Islands, 48 km west of the coast of central California, Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia) are a native migrant and a predator of the nonnative house mouse (Mus musculus) and the native Ashy Storm-Petrel (Oceanodroma homochroa). Previous research showed that Burrowing Owl predation on Ashy Storm-Petrels is likely unnaturally exacerbated by the abundance of house mouse prey in the fall, which may encourage more owls to overwinter. When the cyclic mouse population crashes in winter, the owls switch to preying upon the storm-petrels, a species of conservation concern. From September 2010 to May 2011, we conducted daily owl surveys and a diet study of Burrowing Owls on Southeast Farallon Island. One goal was to document seasonal changes in Burrowing Owl diet composition through collection and assessment of pellets. During our study period, 12 banded owls overwintered for an average of 118 d and contributed 64% of the 679 analyzed owl pellets. Insects were the most numerous prey item detected in pellets, but mice and storm-petrels made up 98.5% of the total prey biomass in the diet. Mouse consumption correlated positively with mouse abundance, and owls exhibited seasonal prey-switching behavior from mice to storm-petrels, when mouse abundance declined during the winter. Our findings suggest that a mouse eradication program on the Farallon Islands would result in fewer owls overwintering and subsequently reduce negative effects on the storm-petrel population. © 2016 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Some studies suggest that mild winters decrease overwinter survival of small mammals or coincide with decreased cyclicity in vole numbers, whereas other studies suggest non-significant or positive relationships between mild winter conditions and vole population dynamics. We expect for the number of voles to be higher in the rich and low-lying habitats of the coastal areas than in the less fertile areas inland. We assume that this geographical difference in vole abundances is diminished by mild winters especially in low-lying habitats. We examine these relationships by generalized linear mixed models using prey remains of breeding tawny owls Strix aluco as a proxy for the abundance of voles. The higher number of small voles in the coastal area than in the inland area suggest that vole populations were denser in the coastal area. Vole populations of both areas were affected by winter weather conditions particularly in March, but these relationships differed between areas. The mild ends of winter with frequent fluctuations of the ambient temperature around the freezing point (“frost seesaw”) constrained significantly the coastal vole populations, while deep snow cover, in general after hard winters, was followed by significantly lowered number of voles only in the inland populations. Our results suggest that coastal vole populations are more vulnerable to mild winters than inland ones. We also show that tawny owl prey remains can be used in a meaningful way to study vole population dynamics. © 2016, The Society of Population Ecology and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: We investigated the nest-site settlement of the forest-dwelling Tengmalm’s owl (Aegolius funereus) in the temperate zone of Central Europe (Czech Republic) over a 14-year period. We analysed the effect of changes in nest-site suitability (expressed as the proportion of deciduous forest) within the immediate surroundings of the nest boxes (a buffer radius of 25 m) in relation to nest box occupancy, the mean standardized laying date (further the laying date), occurrence of nest predation, and breeding density. In line with the predictions of the site dependence model, we found a positive relationship between the laying date and the proportion of deciduous trees in the nest box surrounding. Further, we found the interactive effect of the laying date and the proportion of deciduous forest surrounding a nest box on the occurrence of breeding attempts predated by pine martens. A higher proportion of deciduous forest was found in the surroundings of predated than non-predated breeding attempts, and a steeper positive relationship between the laying date and the proportion of deciduous forest was found in the surroundings of non-predated than predated breeding attempts. The change in the owls’ habitat utilization can be explained by the process of tree leafing which makes the deciduous forest a less suitable habitat with high risk of nest predation before tree foliage and a more suitable habitat with low risk of nest predation after tree foliage. We conclude that our results are in agreement with the site dependence model, and that the degree of foliage of deciduous forest in the nest surrounding of Tengmalm’s owl is a key factor determining site suitability due to predation risk from pine martens in Central Europe. © 2016, The Society of Population Ecology and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: Human-induced habitat changes have been typically linked to negative effects on native species, but an increasing number of studies show that many species are unaffected by these changes or even benefited from them. The Burrowing Owl Athene cunicularia is a raptor species that has deserved special attention in recent years due to its capacity to live in a variety of natural and modified habitats. In this study, we analyzed habitat characteristics that determine the habitat selection of the Burrowing Owl at the nest-patch, territory and landscape scales in the Pampas of Argentina. We performed broadcasting call surveys to evaluate presence-absence of owls at random points. In addition, we measured habitat variables in the field and used satellite imagery to obtain land-use information. We used Generalized Linear Models to explore the influence of habitat variables on the probability of occupancy by Burrowing Owls. Our results indicate that Burrowing Owls demonstrate good ability to live in a wide variety of habitat types and with different disturbance levels in the Pampas. At the nest-patch scale, which includes the nest-site and the surrounding patch around it, the presence of owls was positively associated with the horizontal visibility and was influenced by the land-cover type. At the territory scale, the occurrence of owls was positively associated with the presence of active (non-vegetated) dunes and negatively with croplands. At the landscape scale, the presence of owls was negatively associated with the disturbance level and positively with the amount of borders between habitats. A unique multi-scale model containing variables of the three spatial scales was more robust to explain variation in Burrowing Owl occupancy patterns than any single-scale model. This would reveal the hierarchical nature of habitat selection by Burrowing Owls in the Pampas, comparable to that observed in North American populations.

ABSTRACT: Background: The long-eared owl (Asio otus) has a Holarctic distribution, including much of North America. This nocturnal species is considered to be extremely secretive, and poorly known in the Great Plains of the United States and Canada, as well as to México, where no previous studies on its diet have been conducted. Findings: We analyzed 120 pellets collected during January 2007 in roosts in a 2-3 m height mesquite scrub within a grassland area of Reserva Ecológica El Uno, located in the Natural Protected Area Janos. We registered and identified three orders, four families, eight genera and ten species of mammals and two orders and one family of insects. Winter diet is dominated by mammals, especially rodents in both frequency and biomass. Cricetidae and Perognathus flavus were the most frequent family and species, respectively. On the other hand, when analyzing biomass, Sigmodon species were dominant, achieving almost 70% of the consumed biomass. Levin's standardized niche breath based on frequency was calculated as 0.40, while based on biomass was 0.38. Also, two previously unrecorded rodent species were identified as long-eared owl prey. Conclusion: Although 18 different types of items were identified, the long-eared owl tends to be selective, with a single genera (Sigmodon) comprising almost 70% of its consumed biomass during winter. Perognathus flavus was also important in frequency (21%); however, it barely constitutes 2% of the consumed biomass. © The Author(s). 2017.

ABSTRACT: This study reports a successful reproductive event in Megascops choliba in eastern Acre, northern Brazil. An active M. choliba nest was monitored from the hatching of the eggs to the departure of the nestlings. Once hatched, the nestlings were weighed every two days to verify their weight gain over time. The nestlings remained in the nest for 30 days. The pattern of weight gain was similar to that found in other birds, presenting a rapid increase over the first 15 days, followed by a drastic reduction in the mean growth rate during the second half of the development period. Our observations indicate that the breeding season of M. choliba in southwestern Amazonia is similar as that reported for the species in the northern hemisphere. These are the first data on this species from this region, and contribute to the understanding of its reproductive biology within its geographic range. © 2017 Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia.

ABSTRACT: The Japanese scops owl (Otus semitorques) and Ural owl (Strix uralensis), found in the forests of northeastern China, differ in body size and foraging tactics, and are thus expected to prey on different rodent species. We hypothesized that the Japanese scops owl, an active predator, would prey on smaller and younger individuals than the Ural owl, a sit-and-wait predator. We used pellet analyses to evaluate selection of rodents by the two owls in relation to prey species, age, and size. Although the two owl species consumed a wide range of food items, rodents constituted the most common prey with the greatest biomass in the Japanese scops owl. The Japanese scops owl also foraged on insects and birds, whereas the Ural owl complemented its diet of rodents with spiders, scorpions and snakes. The Japanese scops owl selected smaller and younger rodents and the Ural owl preyed on larger and older individuals. Morphology and behaviour of both prey and predators may explain this differential predation between the two species. © 2016, Czech Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: A total of 166 prey items of the Indian Eagle Owl Bubo bengalensis were identified from pellets, pellet remains and prey remains-84 from Arunachala Hill and 82 from Pondicherry University campus. The total biomass encountered from pellet and prey remains was 22,620g; of which, 11,241g was from Arunachala and 11,380g was from Pondicherry University. Out of the 166 prey items 102 were non-volant small mammals accounting for a biomass of 13,974g; of which 5,617g (49.94%) was from Arunachala and 8,357g (73.42%) was from Pondicherry University. Even among these, murid rodents dominated with 44.99% in Arunachala and 70.13% in Pondy University. Thirteen birds of three species were predated upon and only partly consumed; hence biomass could not be inferred as the amount ingested was not determinable. Of these 10 were Mlivus migrans, a raptor co-inhabiting the same area. Anurans occurred for a combined biomass of 12.87% in both areas. The rest, viz., Coleoptera, Orthoptera and Paratelphusa sp. accounted for a paltry biomass of 0.51%. In Arunachala the constant food of the owls were the field rodents Millardia meltada (15.47%), Bandicota bengalensis (8.74%) and Tatera indica (11.65%), and a single Bandicota indica (6.07%), which is a species found around rural habitations. The first two species were conspicuous by their absence in Pondicherry University and the Tatera indica was encountered in very small quantities (3.70%). Uniquely enough, the terrestrial and fossorial forms of urban rodents formed the basic food of Bubo bengalensis in Pondicherry University - Rattus rattus (20.64%) and Bandicota indica (43.94%). We have compared non-volant small mammal prey of the regions we studied with those of Maharastra and the results are discussed. © Ramanujam & Singh 2017.

ABSTRACT: The diet of the Eurasian eagle owl (Bubo bubo) was studied in Wadi Al Makhrour, Bethlehem, Palestinian Territories in 2015 with fresh and several year old pellets. Three species of arthropods, one reptile species, at least four bird species, and six species of mammals were recovered from the studied pellets. Black rat (Rattus rattus) was the most common prey (37.0%), followed by the southern white-breasted hedgehog (Erinaceus concolor) (29.4%) and birds (21.8%). Comparison of recent and older pellets showed change in diet composition. Recent pellets contained more Rattus rattus compared to older ones. Older pellets included more naturally-occurring species such as Meriones tristrami, Microtus guentheri, and Rousettus aegyptiacus, which were absent in newer pellets. © 2016 Raptor Protection of Slovakia (RPS).

ABSTRACT: We assessed the occupancy dynamics of 275 California Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) territories in 4 study areas in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA, from 1993 to 2011. We used Landsat data to develop maps of canopy cover for each study area, which we then used to quantify annual territory-specific habitat covariates. We modeled the relationships between territory extinction and colonization using predictor variables of habitat, disturbance (logging, fire), climate, and elevation. We found that forests with medium (40-69%) and high (≥70%) canopy cover were the most important predictors of territory occupancy in all study areas, and that both canopy cover categories were positively correlated with occupancy. We used analysis of deviance to estimate the amount of variation explained by the habitat covariates (primarily medium and high canopy cover) and found that these covariates explained from 35% to 67% of the variation in occupancy. Climatic covariates were not correlated with occupancy dynamics and explained little of the variation in occupancy. We also conducted a post hoc analysis in which we partitioned canopy cover into 10% classes, because our original partitioning into 3 classes may have lacked sufficient resolution to identify canopy cover levels where occupancy changed abruptly. In this post hoc analysis, occupancy declined sharply when territories contained more area with <40% canopy cover, and the amount of 50-59% and 60-69% canopy cover had a more positive association with occupancy than did 40-49% canopy cover. Our results suggest that some fuels treatments intended to reduce fire risk and improve forest resilience could be located within Spotted Owl territories without adversely impacting territory occupancy if such treatments do not consistently reduce canopy cover below 50%. We suggest that future work quantify components of forest structure (e.g., large tree density, vertical complexity) known to be selected by owls and relate these characteristics to occupancy and fitness metrics. © 2016 Cooper Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Forest managers are challenged with meeting numerous demands that often include wildlife habitat and carbon (C) sequestration. We used a probabilistic framework of wildfire occurrence to (1) estimate the potential for fuel treatments to reduce fire risk and hazard across the landscape and within protected California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) habitat and (2) evaluate the consequences of treatments with respect to terrestrial C stocks and burning emissions. Silvicultural and prescribed fire treatments were simulated on 20% of a northern Sierra Nevada landscape in three treatment scenarios that varied in the land area eligible for treatment. Treatment prescriptions varied with topography, vegetation characteristics, and ownership. We then simulated many wildfires in the treated and untreated landscapes. Additional simulations allowed us to consider the influence of wildfire size on estimated emissions. Treatments constrained to the land area outside of spotted owl activity centers reduced the probability of burning and potential fire intensity within owl habitat and across the landscape relative to no-treatment scenarios. Allowing treatment of the activity centers achieved even greater fire hazard reductions within the activity centers. Treatments also reduced estimated wildfire emissions of C by 45-61%. However, emissions from prescribed burning exceeded simulated reductions in wildfire emissions. Consequently, all treatment scenarios resulted in higher C emissions than the no-treatment scenarios. Further, for wildfires of moderate size (714-2133 ha), the treatment scenarios reduced the C contained in live tree biomass following simulated wildfire. When large wildfires (8070-10,757 ha) were simulated, however, the treatment scenario retained more live tree C than the no-treatment scenario. Our approach, which estimated terrestrial C immediately following wildfire, did not account for long-term C dynamics, such as emissions associated with post-wildfire decay, C sequestration by future forest growth, or longer-term C sequestration in structural wood products. While simulated landscape fuel treatments in the present study reduced the risk of uncharacteristically severe wildfire across the landscape and within protected habitat, the C costs of treatment generally exceeded the C benefits. © 2017 Chiono et al.

ABSTRACT: Owls represent typical nocturnal avian predators. They are known since the beginning of the Tertiary. Thirteen species live in Europe, but the number of extinct fossil species is only slightly above twice that number. The present genera appeared in the Neogene period. They also have a major significance regarding palaeoecology, since most of the fossilized remains of small-medium sized vertebrates are available from owl pellets. The author wishes to describe the occurrence and evolution of owls in Europe from the Cretaceous to current times, as well as to provide an osteological guide of recent species. The text is supplemented by 16 plates, 4 size charts, and extensive bibliography. © 2017, BirdLife Hungary. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: We report here the successful assembly of the complete mitochondrial genomes of the northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) and the barred owl (S. varia). We utilized sequence data from two sequencing methodologies, Illumina paired-end sequence data with insert lengths ranging from approximately 250 nucleotides (nt) to 9,600 nt and read lengths from 100-375 nt and Sanger-derived sequences.Weemployed multiple assemblers and alignment methods to generate the final assemblies. The circular genomes of S. o. caurina and S. varia are comprised of 19,948 nt and 18,975 nt, respectively. Both code for two rRNAs, twenty-two tRNAs, and thirteen polypeptides. They both have duplicated control region sequences with complex repeat structures. We were not able to assemble the control regions solely using Illumina paired-end sequence data. By fully spanning the control regions, Sanger-derived sequences enabled accurate and complete assembly of these mitochondrial genomes. These are the first complete mitochondrial genome sequences of owls (Aves: Strigiformes) possessing duplicated control regions. We searched the nuclear genome of S. o. caurina for copies of mitochondrial genes and found at least nine separate stretches of nuclear copies of gene sequences originating in the mitochondrial genome (Numts). The Numts ranged from 226-19,522 nt in length and included copies of all mitochondrial genes except tRNAPro, ND6, and tRNAGlu. Strix occidentalis caurina and S. varia exhibited an average of 10.74% (8.68% uncorrected p-distance) divergence across the non-tRNA mitochondrial genes. © 2017 Hanna et al.

ABSTRACT: Recoveries of marked animals hold long-term, large-scale information on survival and causes of mortality, but are prone to bias towards dead recoveries and casualties in the range of presence of potential finders. Thus, accounting for circumstance-related recovery probabilities is crucial in statistical approaches. For the little owl, a species of conservation concern in central Europe, raw ring recoveries suggested a strong human-related impact on survival. We analysed the proportions of the main causes of death using a large sample of radio-tracked birds as a reference. We compared ring recoveries in southern Germany collected 1950–2012 (n = 465 dead recoveries of 2007 recoveries of 30 623 ringed birds) with data from a radio-tracking study in the same region 2009–2012 (n = 177 dead recoveries of 377 tagged individuals). Two assumptions of multi-state ring recovery modelling were unrealistic. First, not all dispatched rings remained available to potential finders. Instead, 34% of tracked birds were displaced to sites where rings were irretrievable, resulting in biased estimates of recovery probability. Second, the proportions of irretrievable rings were disproportional, with 48% in predated birds and 5% in human-induced mortality. Consequently, the sample of rings from which recoveries were drawn differed from the sample of dispatched rings. Accounting for these biases in a multi-state model, we estimated the frequencies of main causes of mortality to 45% for predation, 20% for casualties due to traffic and at buildings and 34% for all other causes. In radio-tracked birds, predation was even more dominant (76%). Integrating mark–recapture data and telemetry observations allowed detecting and quantifying so far unknown recovery bias and resulted in improved estimates of key population parameters. The demography of little owls likely depends mainly on predator–prey relationships rather than on human-induced deaths. © 2016 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The survival rate is a key parameter for population management and the monitoring of populations. Thus, an analysis of survival rate variations and the factors influencing the same is essential for understanding population dynamics. Here, we study the factors determining the survival and the causes of mortality of the Eurasian eagle owl (Bubo bubo) in two Spanish Mediterranean populations (Murcia and Seville) where the species has a high population density and breeding success; yet its survival rates and the factors that affect them are unknown. Between 2003 and 2010, 63 breeding owls were captured and radio-tracked. Three monthly (quarterly) survival rates were estimated using known-fate models in the program MARK. The mean overall annual survival rate was 0.776 (95 % CI: 0.677, 0.875). We observed survival differences between sexes, and between the breeding and non-breeding periods, although no overwhelming support was found for any particular model. We concluded that (i) females have a lower survival rate than males, probably due to their larger home ranges, which increase the risk of mortality; (ii) the survival rates of both sexes were lower during the non-breeding period; and (iii) the causes of mortality differed significantly between the two populations, gunshot being the main cause in Seville and electrocution in Murcia. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: One of the largest known irruptions of Northern Hawk Owls Surnia ulula in southern Norway started in mid August 2016. During September-October I conducted 246 km surveys in boreal forests in Oslo and Akershus counties, southeastern Norway. A total of 16 owls was detected. Depending on assumptions regarding detectability, a density of 0.106-0.204 owls/km2 was estimated, corresponding to 371-714 individuals in boreal forests of the two counties in total. Southeastern Norway has about 55600 km2 boreal forest which implies a total of 5894-11342 owls in this habitat. According to the bird reporting websites www.artsobservasjoner.no and www.nofoa.no there were 1366 reports of Hawk Owls from all counties in southern Norway during September-October, representing 661 different sites. In Oslo and Akershus counties, estimates suggested that < 10% of all Hawk Owls were detected. A 5-10% detection rate suggests that there were 6610-13220 owls in southern Norway. However, in many counties Hawk Owl reporting rates measured as proportion of all bird reports that concerned Hawk Owl, were much higher than in Oslo and Akershus, which could imply higher density. By adjusting density (using the values 0.10-0.204 owls/km2 from boreal forest in Oslo and Akershus) for county-specific owl reporting rates, the number of Hawk Owls present only in boreal forest in southeastern Norway was estimated at 14466-27872 individuals. This number excludes additional owls in agricultural areas and owls in other parts of southern Norway. Overall, a total number of about 10000-20000 individuals is considered most likely. I review available evidence of the origin of these owls using number of reports and spatial distribution of Hawk Owls in northern Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia and Russia during 2015 and 2016. I conclude that the Hawk Owls came from northern Fennoscandia where large numbers bred in 2015, and not from more eastern areas such as Russia.

ABSTRACT: Little is known of owls in south-Western Australia compared with the owls of southern and eastern Australia. Surveys of forest owls in the south-west are almost completely lacking. This study sought to determine the abundance and detectability of owls immediately around the Peel-Harvey Estuary in south-Western Australia. The southern boobook (Ninox boobook) and the masked owl (Tyto novaehollandiae) were the only owls detected (n≤23 and n≤1 respectively), although the nocturnal tawny frogmouth (Podargus strigoides) was detected from unelicited calls on three occasions. Southern boobooks were found to be common in this area though they are reported to be in decline in south-eastern and inland Australia. Their detectability was significantly greater in August (late winter) than at other times through unelicited calls; otherwise, there were no detections in winter. A variety of small mammals were detected during the surveys, including: A little red flying-fox (Pteropus scapulatus), a western ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus occidentalis), 19 southern brown bandicoots (Isoodon obesulus), 4 common brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula), 21 rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), a black rat (Rattus rattus), 2 red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and 22 microbats. © 2017 CSIRO.

ABSTRACT: Between April and June 2016, we observed a pair of Strix varia (Barred Owl) rearing 2 chicks in a wooded, streamside city park in Valdosta, GA, and we observed 1 instance of an adult feeding a bat to a fledgling. Thirteen of 20 owl pellets collected from the area contained 37 Myotis austroriparius (Southeastern Myotis). This species of bat was the most frequent and abundant food item during the chick-rearing period, especially before fledging and for at least 17 days after. Birds partially replaced bats in the diet during the middle of this period. Owls commonly ate crayfish and June bugs and less commonly ate fish and a variety of small vertebrates throughout the period. To our knowledge, this is the first report of bats comprising a major dietary item for Barred Owls, including food given to the chicks.

ABSTRACT: Although most owls exhibit biparental care, the relative contributions of males and females during critical life cycle stages are poorly understood. Further information could improve our understanding of the feeding ecology of owls and of mechanisms that govern natural and sexual selection, particularly as they relate to the evolution of reversed sexual dimorphism. The objective of our study was to assess possible intersexual differences in provisioning behavior (visit rate and prey size and type) of slightly dimorphic Eastern Screech-Owls (Megascops asio; females 17% greater mass than males) during the post-brooding period when both adults provision nestlings. Pairs of Eastern Screech-Owls provisioned young with 16 different types of prey in our study with insects and crayfish (Family Astacidae) being the most common. We found no differences between females and males in provisioning rate or in mean size of prey delivered. Our findings suggest Screech-Owls are opportunistic feeders in the post-brooding period and that food niche partitioning does not occur between the sexes. These findings are inconsistent with the Role Differentiation and Ecological Hypotheses made for the evolution of reversed sexual dimorphism but support the Rate Ingestion Hypothesis which predicts that both sexes may take smaller prey during the post-brooding period to increase ingestion rate and decrease handling time. In addition our results contribute to an understanding of the feeding ecology and life history of one of the most widespread and recognizable raptors in North America.

ABSTRACT: The existence of substantial morphological variation has resulted in the description of numerous subspecies of the cosmopolitan barn owl, Tyto alba. However, preliminary studies have revealed a high degree of genetic variation between Old and New World barn owls, suggesting that the T. alba complex may consist of several species. We present a comprehensive study of its taxonomy and propose a spatiotemporal framework to explain the origin and patterns of dispersal and diversification within these cosmopolitan owls. We used a Bayesian relaxed molecular clock approach to assess the timing of diversification. To evaluate the biogeographical pattern, we considered dispersal in addition to temporal connectivity between areas. Finally, we used ecological niche modelling to evaluate their ecological niches. Our phylogenetic analyses suggest that barn owls of the Old and New World show a high degree of genetic divergence, and the barn owls of South and South-east Asia (Tyto alba stertens and Tyto alba javanica) cluster with the Australian barn owl Tyto delicatula. We propose to treat the T. alba complex as three species: T. alba (Africa, Europe), Tyto furcata (New World), and Tyto javanica (Australasia). The dating analyses indicate that the early divergence among the species of the T. alba complex took place in the Middle Miocene and we hypothesize that a common ancestor of the T. alba complex lived in Africa. A potential scenario suggests that T. alba dispersed to Europe and south-western Asia during the interglacial periods of the Miocene/Pliocene, and dispersed into the New World either via an eastern Asian route or a western north Atlantic one. © 2016 The Linnean Society of London

ABSTRACT: This note reports the observation of an adult Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus) holding a Molina’s Hog-nosed Skunk (Conepatus chinga) in its claws. We assumed that it is a case of opportunistic predation because the skunk is larger than this owl’s regular preys. However, we could not exclude the possibility of opportunistic scavenging, despite this being an uncommon behavior for the Great Horned Owl. This is the first report of a Molina’s Hog-nosed Skunk preyed by a Great Horned Owl, an unusually large prey to an owl that preys mainly upon small mammals (e.g. rodents). Also, it is an uncommon report of consumption of mammal carnivores by owls in South America. © 2015, Sociedade Brasileira de Ornitologia. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Bar patterns on flight feathers of Great Gray Owls (Strix nebulosa) and Snowy Owls (Bubo scandiacus) are variable, and can be used to recognize individual birds. Here I illustrate a method for taking photos of wings of captured owls and describe a way to arrange images of flying birds for comparison with photos of birds in flight or in the hand. I report four examples. First, two Great Gray Owls photographed in flight on different days at the same site were shown to be the same individual, but differed from a dead owl found at that location a month later. Second, I compared eight photographs of wintering Snowy Owls in flight in Saskatchewan and determined that they portrayed seven different owls. Third, I examined photos of breeding male first-year Great Gray Owls at neighboring nest sites and established that they were different birds. Finally, I compared photos of breeding female Great Gray Owls at the same nest site in 2011 and 2013, and determined that they showed two individuals. I suggest that such photography may be used as a tool to census populations of Great Gray Owls and Snowy Owls. © 2016 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: A flightless female Eagle Owl Bubo bubo has survived for one year with food provided by its partner. The pair bred successfully and raised one owlet in 2015. The favourable combination of characteristics on the rocky slope nest site occupied by the pair provided the female different escape routes from potential enemies, natural protection of the nest and access to water during the time of laying, incubation period and hot summer weather. Voles (Microtus sp.) were the most numerous prey (55.8% by number, 15.3% by biomass) because of their population spike during the period with a flightless female in the pair. Rats (Rattus sp.; 16.2% by number, 31.2% by biomass), a key prey resource, also increased to a level several times greater than in previous years. The significant differences in diet during 2015 did not appear to cause any obvious changes in Eagle Owl breeding characteristics at the site. The increasing prey on voles and rats created the narrowest food niche and reduced food stress according to the rather lower value of superpredation (3.6% by number, 9.9% by biomass).

ABSTRACT: This study compares the winter diet of short-eared owls (Asio flammeus) and long-eared owls (Asio otus) around the Yedik?r Dam (Amasya, Northern Turkey). A total of 309 pellets containing remains of 557 individual prey items were found. The diet composition of both owls consisted of only six small mammals dominated by the east European voles (Microtus levis) in similar proportions (58.9% by number, 51.0% by biomass in A. flammeus and 55.9% by number, 63.3% by biomass in A. otus). Mus macedonicus was another important prey in the diet of short-eared and long-eared owls (F = 10.0% and F = 18.8%, respectively). Slightly preferred prey were the yellow necked mouse (Apodemus flavicollis), Turkish hamster (Mesocricetus brandti) and the grey dwarf hamster (Cricetulus migratorius). A. flammeus and A. otus had very similar diets in Northern Turkey. The food-niche breath (FNB) was low in the owl species. The studied owl species showed high level of niche overlap (Ro = 0.886). © 2017 Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Bubo scandiacus (Snowy Owl) is an irregular winter visitor in the northeastern US and southeastern Canada, where winter irruptions occur roughly every 4 years with varying intensity. The consecutive winters of 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 saw unusually large irruptions of Snowy Owls across eastern North American states and provinces and the Great Lakes region. We tracked 34 individuals equipped with high spatial- and temporalresolution GPS-GSM transmitters and obtained data that documented in detail the diverse suite of habitats used by irruptive Snowy Owls overwintering and migrating through the region, from heavily urbanized city centers to open agricultural areas, as well as ice floes drifting on the Great Lakes or concentrating along the shores of the Atlantic Ocean.

ABSTRACT: Based on pellets analysis from five localities in south western Slovakia (Malá Mužla, Malé Ripňany, Obid, Opatovský Sokolec and Tešedíkovo), we studied the diet composition of Barn Owl (Tyto alba) in intensively cultivated agricultural lands. A total of 6218 specimens of prey, 17 mammalian and 7 bird species were identified. The main prey species found in all food samples was the Common Vole (Microtus arvalis), varying between 56 % and 67 %. The proportion of synanthropic species (Rattus norvegicus, Passer domesticus) and species inhabiting agricultural landscapes (Crocidura leucodon, Crocidura suaveolens, Mus sp.) increases in localities with a lower ratio of the Common Vole. The results suggest land use affects the diet of Barn Owls, confirming conclusions which have been drawn in previous studies. From faunistic point of view, discovering the Pannonian Root Vole (Microtus oeconomus mehelyi) in the diet from Malá Mužla was important.

ABSTRACT: Birds that winter in cold northern climates experience harsh conditions, including reduced food availability and increased energy demands. In raptors, the ability to forage and maintain body condition may be related to age (hunting experience) or the ability to defend good-quality territories (dominance). We examined the effects of age and sex on body condition and various sources of mortality in wintering Snowy Owls (Bubo scandiacus) on the Canadian prairies. Because of reversed sexual size dimorphism, we predicted that females, the dominant sex, would be in better condition than males and that adults would be in better condition than juveniles. Consistent with these predictions, data from 537 live Snowy Owls trapped over 18 winter field seasons showed that adults were heavier than juveniles for a given body size and carried more fat reserves. We found that 56% of males lacked furcular and wing-pit fat, whereas only 31% of females lacked such fat; and females, but not males, tended to put on fat during the winter months. A comparison of the sex ratio of starving Snowy Owls turned in to rehabilitation centers (63% male) and that of living Snowy Owls observed in the wild (45% male) showed a male bias in starving and diseased individuals. Although most of the wild-trapped birds were above the starvation threshold, the proximate mechanisms by which sex-biased competitive dominance is manifested in differences in body condition and survival warrant further study. © 2016 American Ornithologists' Union.

ABSTRACT: Three cases of carrion–feeding with remains of artiodactyls (0.3%, n=1104 samples with food remains) have been documented in a long term diet study of Eurasian Eagle-owls (Bubo bubo) in 53 localities at Southeastern Bulgaria. Bone pieces of a sheep/goat (Ovis aries/Carpa hircus), a Fallow Deer (Dama dama) and a Domestic Pig (Sus scrofa dom.) in three Eurasian Eagle-owl breeding localities (5.7%) prove extremely rare feeding on carrion. Northern White–breasted Hedgehog (Erinaceus roumanicus), rats (Rattus sp.), waterbirds and gallinaceous birds (total 59.5–72.6% by biomass) constituted the main portion of the diets with carrion remains. The comparisons between food niche breadths, diet composition, average prey biomass and values of superpredation of the annual diets in the three localities have not supported the carrion–feeding of the Eurasian Eagle-owl as a result of food shortages. © 2017, BirdLife Hungary.

ABSTRACT: Recently, the barred owl (Strix varia) has expanded its range into the Pacific Northwest of the United States resulting in pronounced effects on the demography and behavior of the northern spotted owl (S. occidentalis caurina). The range expansion has brought together historically allopatric species, creating the potential for significant changes in the avian predator community with possible cascading effects on food-web dynamics. The adverse effects of the barred owl on the behavior and demography of the northern spotted owl are well-documented, but little is known about the immediate and long-term effects changes in the predator community may have on native species composition and ecosystem processes. Based on northern spotted owl and barred owl selection for diet and habitat resources, there is a potential for trophic cascades within the region's predator and prey communities, differing responses by their shared and unique prey species, and possible direct and indirect effects on ecosystem processes. We explored the possible ecological consequences of the barred owl range expansion to wildlife communities of the Pacific Northwest based on the theoretical underpinnings of predator–prey relationships, interspecific competition, intraguild predation, and potential cascading trophic interactions. Negative effects on fitness of northern spotted owls because of interspecific competition with barred owls are strong selection forces that may contribute to the regional extinction of the northern spotted owl. In addition, we posit that shared prey species and those uniquely consumed by barred owls, along with other competing native predators, may experience changes in behavior, abundance, and distribution as a result of increased rates of predation by rapidly expanding populations of barred owls. © 2016 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2016

ABSTRACT: The dependence of the breeding success of the eagle owl on the population dynamics of rodents, which are a staple of its diet in Mordovia, was traced. At peak numbers of rodents, large clutches and a high survival rate of fledglings were observed in the breeding pairs; after a year of depression of rodent populations, in the following year, the pairs do not nest at all or their breeding success is reduced to a minimum due to the death of the clutches. In 52% of the cases, the nesting pairs laid three eggs; in 31%, two eggs; in 9%, four eggs; in 4%, one egg or five eggs. The average clutch size was 2.78 ± 0.17. The average number of chicks grown from a successful nest was 2.41 ± 0.27. The nests in Mordovia were located at a distance of 1.1–3.7 km from residential areas. © 2016, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Determining patterns in annual movements of animals is an important component of population ecology, particularly for migratory birds where migration timing and routes, and wintering habitats have key bearing on population dynamics. From 2009 to 2011, we used light-level geolocators to document the migratory movements of Flammulated Owls (Psiloscops flammeolus). Four males departed from breeding areas in Colorado for fall migration between ≤5 and 21 October, arrived in wintering areas in Mexico between 11 October and 3 November, departed from wintering areas from ≤6 to 21 April, and returned to Colorado between 15 and 21 May. Core wintering areas for three males were located in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt Mountains in the states of Jalisco, Michoacán, and Puebla in central and east-central Mexico, and the core area for the other male was in the Sierra Madre Oriental Mountains in Tamaulipas. The mean distance from breeding to wintering centroids was 2057 ± 128 km (SE). During fall migration, two males took a southeastern path to eastern Mexico, and two males took a path due south to central Mexico. In contrast, during spring migration, all four males traveled north from Mexico along the Sierra Madre Oriental Mountains to the Rio Grande Valley and north through New Mexico. The first stopovers in fall and last stopovers in spring were the longest in duration for all males and located 300-400 km from breeding areas. Final spring stopovers may have allowed male Flammulated Owls to fine tune the timing of their return to high-elevation breeding areas where late snows are not uncommon. One male tracked in both years had similar migration routes, timing, and wintering areas each year. Core wintering and final stopover areas were located primarily in coniferous forests and woodlands, particularly pine-oak forests, suggesting that these are important habitats for Flammulated Owls throughout their annual cycle. © 2016 Association of Field Ornithologists.

ABSTRACT: 3073 Great Grey Owls were banded in Sweden in 1955- 2012. 416 were controlled at least once (54.6%) or recovered dead (45.4%).Three birds banded as nestlings were recovered in their 17th calendar year. Most birds were recovered during first year of life. Only 4 females were controlled breeding as 2CY birds. 91.3% of birds controlled as first time breeders were at least 4CY. Birds banded as nestlings and recovered dead between September and July moved 100.8 km (mean) with a median distance of 64 km. Juveniles controlled alive moved 45.9 km (mean) with a median distance of 23 km during first year of life. Maximum natal dispersal was 650 km. Median natal dispersal for females was 40 km, between 7 km and 115 km depending on longevity from hatching to control. Females at ages 2CY, 5CY, 8CY and 11CY had the lowest median natal dispersals. Median secondary dispersal distances (from one nest to a later nestsite) for females lay between 0 km and 9 km. For males both mean and median secondary dispersal distances were less than 3 km. © 2016, University of Lund. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: In 1993 and 1995, we detailed body mass growth rates, plumage development, and related behaviors of Snowy Owl (Bubo scandiacus) nestlings from Barrow, Alaska. We recorded data from 71 of 80 nestlings from 14 of 20 nests in 1993 and 154 of 161 nestlings from 33 of 54 nests in 1995. Only nestlings for which we had data from hatching to at least 25 d of age were included in the growth model. Nestlings hatched between 1-3 d after "pipping" (creating a hole in) the eggshell. The semi-altricial young were covered in white protoptile (first) down plumage at hatching and weighed about 44-45 g. For about the first 7 d, their eyes were closed and movement was limited; the nestlings were dependent on the female for thermoregulation, food, and protection. Growth was rapid and by 8-9 d, the dark gray mesoptile (second) down had begun replacing protoptile down. By about 9-11 d, eyes were open, and by about 14 d, the owls were dark gray in color, and primary flight feather quills emerged. Mass gains were greatest the week prior to pre-fledging nest departure. The owls gained about 56 g every d, between 16-22 d. Around 21 d, the primary flight feathers erupted from their quills, and at approximately 25 d, tail (rectrices) feather quills erupted. After pre-fledging nest departure at approximately 21 d, the young owls roamed the tundra on foot and were fed and protected by both parents. We did not observe voluntary brood reduction; however, some young died in nests. Mass growth slowed substantially by about 34 d, while plumage development, particularly flight feather growth, increased rapidly. Young within and between nests, and years, grew at similar rates. Around 36-43 d, the young began their first attempts at flying, by hopping and pumping their wings. Also at this age, differences in plumage between presumed males and females were noticeable. Between 44 and 55 d, the young fledged, coinciding with the time when primary flight feather P8 reached 16.5 cm, and tail feather T1 reached 11.0 cm. © 2016 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Endothermic animals vary in their physiological ability to maintain a constant body temperature. Since melanin-based coloration is related to thermoregulation and energy homeostasis, we predict that dark and pale melanic individuals adopt different behaviours to regulate their body temperature. Young animals are particularly sensitive to a decrease in ambient temperature because their physiological system is not yet mature and growth may be traded-off against thermoregulation. To reduce energy loss, offspring huddle during periods of cold weather. We investigated in nestling barn owls (Tyto alba) whether body temperature, oxygen consumption and huddling were associated with melanin-based coloration. Isolated owlets displaying more black feather spots had a lower body temperature and consumed more oxygen than those with fewer black spots. This suggests that highly melanic individuals display a different thermoregulation strategy. This interpretation is also supported by the finding that, at relatively low ambient temperature, owlets displaying more black spots huddled more rapidly and more often than those displaying fewer spots. Assuming that spot number is associated with the ability to thermoregulate not only in Swiss barn owls but also in other Tytonidae, our results could explain geographic variation in the degree of melanism. Indeed, in the northern hemisphere, barn owls and allies are less spotted polewards than close to the equator, and in the northern American continent, barn owls are also less spotted in colder regions. If melanic spots themselves helped thermoregulation, we would have expected the opposite results. We therefore suggest that some melanogenic genes pleiotropically regulate thermoregulatory processes. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: I investigated diet of migratory owls on Southeast Farallon Island (SEFI), California, United States, including how diet changed in response to time of year and prey availability. I analyzed 523 pellets collected at SEFI from at least four different owl species during 2000-2003 (as well as 99 pellets for other time periods) and quantified the proportion of mice, insects and birds within pellets. The non-native House Mouse Musmusculus was the most abundant diet item across all four years, followed by birds and then insects. Examination of diet composition within each year revealed that between November and February owls primarily consumed mice, while they ate more birds between March and June. Between July and October, consumption of mice and birds was about equal. Previous mouse-trapping studies have shown an abundant mouse population on SEFI during autumn, when owls arrive, while winter mouse populations decrease in response to rains that flood burrows and lower food supplies. My study indicates that, as wintering owls lose a primary food source, they shift their diet from mice to other prey. Included in the shift were storm-petrels (Ashy Oceanodroma homochroa and Leach’s O. leucorhoa), mostly consumed by Burrowing Owls Athene cunicularia, as well as Cassin’s Auklets Ptychoramphus aleuticus, mostly consumed by Barn Owls Tyto alba. The presence of mice on SEFI may be indirectly affecting seabird populations by keeping migrating owls on the islands longer than they would stay if mice were absent. © 2016, Marine Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: So far, the identity of Cyathostoma (Hovorkonema) nematodes collected from respiratory tracts of birds of prey (Accipitriformes, Falconiformes) and owls (Strigiformes) in Europe and North America is extremely inconsistent. Our results, based on analyses of ITS-2 sequences suggest that the Cyathostoma (Hovorkonema) nematodes found in the birds of prey and owls from Central Europe and North America probably belong to the same species, C. (Hovorkonema) americana Chapin, 1925. We are convinced, that described in recent literature high ITS-2 divergence among C. (Hovorkonema) nematodes collected from Europe, has occurred as a result of invalid synonimisation of some C. (Hovorkonema) species. In our opinion C. (Hovorkonema) americana (typically parasites of tracheae and air sacs of raptors) and C. (Hovorkonema) variegatum (Creplin, 1849) (typically parasites of tracheae of cranes and storks) are valid molecular and morphologically distinct species. © 2016 Institute of Parasitology, SAS, Kosice.

ABSTRACT: Habituation to humans was observed in a single breeding female Bubo bengalensis and the responses documented. It was observed that owls recognize threats, and differentiate between people. The data shows how 'familiarity' can result in reduced flight range and agonistic displays. It was found that the most familiar observers elucidated the least response to human intrusion whereas the role of unfamiliar intrusion had an adverse affect which prevented further studies of the subject. © 2016 M.

ABSTRACT: Summary Blakiston's Fish-owl Bubo blakistoni is classified as 'Endangered' by IUCN; this species is associated with riparian old-growth forests in north-east Asia, a landscape threatened by a variety of impacts (e.g. logging, agricultural development, human settlement). We examined a 20,213 km2 study area in Primorye, Russia, and assessed the ability of the protected area network to conserve Blakiston's Fish-owls by analysing resource selection of radio-marked individuals. Based on resource selection functions, we predicted that 60-65 Blakiston's fish-owl home ranges could occur within the study area. We found that the protected area network within our study area contained only 19% of optimal Blakiston's fish-owl habitat and contained only eight potential home ranges (five of these within a single protected area - Sikhote-Alin Biosphere Reserve). We also found that 43% of optimal Blakiston's Fish-owl habitat was within current logging leases; lands capable of supporting habitat equivalent to 24 home ranges. The remaining optimal habitat (38%) was on federal land and potentially contained 28-33 Blakiston's Fish-owl home ranges. The current protected area network, by itself, is not sufficient to conserve the species because relatively few home ranges are actually protected. Therefore, outside of protected areas, we recommend protecting specific locations within potential home ranges that likely contain suitable nest and foraging sites, maintaining integrity of riparian areas, modifying road construction methods, and closing old and unused logging roads to reduce anthropogenic disturbance to the owls and the landscape. © BirdLife International 2015.

ABSTRACT: Suggestions have been made for sexing Great Grey Owls Strix nebulosa using body measurements as criterion. Here we present measurement data from a long-term collection of 83 dead owls from western and northern Finland indicating that lengths of forearm, and claws 1, 2 and 4, are superior over traditional measurements of wing, tarsus, bill and body mass in determining sex of Great Grey Owls. Forearm of males ranged 123-148 mm, and was on average 138 mm (n = 31). In comparison, the forearm of females ranged 131-162 mm, with an average of 147 mm (n = 49). Based on a logistic regression analysis, the combination of forearm, second claw and wing length was the best predictor in correct sex determination of 95% of the Great Grey Owl specimens.

ABSTRACT: On agricultural landscapes of the Altai region the Strigidae are represented by 9 species. By distribution they may be divided into three groups: Migratory - 3 types (long-eared owl, short-eared owl, and scops-owl); Breeding and wintering in nesting areas - 5 species (eagle-owl, Ural owl, Great gray owl, pygmy owl, boreal owl); and Migratory and wintering, but not nesting -1 species (snowy owl). The populations of most species are characterized by uneven spatial distribution of nesting areas, which is associated with significant anthropogenic transformation of the territory and the gravity of many species to unplowed areas. Three owl species under special protection listed in the Red Books of different levels are nesting in the study area. These are the eagle-owl, great grey owl, and pygmy owl. The eagle-owl population is still in relatively good condition. The populations of great grey owl and pygmy owl need further detailed study. The most significant limiting human-induced factors for owl populations in the Altai region are the death on birds-dangerous lines, selective logging, and dependence on cattle, agricultural ground fires, and commercial development of placer gold mine in the river and streams valleys.

ABSTRACT: The level of PFAS (per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances) contamination in freshwater and terrestrial Swedish environments in 2013/2014 was assessed by analyzing a range of perfluorinated alkyl acids, fluorotelomer acids, sulfonamides, sulfonamidoethanols and polyfluoralkyl phosphate diesters (diPAPs) in predator bird eggs. Stable isotopes (13C and 15N) were analyzed to elucidate the dietary source. The tawny owl (Strix aluco, n=10) and common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus, n=40), two terrestrial species, and the osprey (Pandion haliaetus, n=30), a freshwater specie were included. In addition, a temporal trend (1997-2001, 2008-2009, 2013) in osprey was studied as well. The PFAS profile was dominated by perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) in eggs from osprey and tawny owl, while for common kestrel perfluorinated carboxylic acids (∑PFCA) exceeded the level of PFOS. PFOS concentration in osprey eggs remained at the same level between 1997 and 2001 and 2013. For the long-chained PFCAs, there were a significant increase in concentrations in osprey eggs between 1997 and 2001 and 2008-2009. The levels of PFOS and PFCAs were about 10 and five times higher, respectively, in osprey compared to tawny owl and common kestrel. Evidence of direct exposure from PFCA precursor compounds to birds in both freshwater and terrestrial environment was observed. Low levels of diPAPs were detected in a few samples of osprey (<0.02-2.4 ng/g) and common kestrel (<0.02-0.16 ng/g) eggs, and 6:2 FTSA was detected in a majority of the osprey eggs (<6.3-52 ng/g). One saturated telomer acid (7:3 FTCA), which is a transformation marker from precursor exposure, was detected in all species (<0.24-2.7 ng/g). The 15N data showed higher levels in osprey eggs compared to tawny owl and common kestrel, indicating that they feed on a 2-3 times higher trophic level. We conclude that ospreys are continuously exposed to PFAS at levels where adverse toxic effects have been observed in birds. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: How foraging behaviour of predators is influenced by prey abundance is often not clear. Predators may behave as generalist or specialist depending on the relationship between the predator feeding behaviour and prey abundance, known as functional response. The European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is a key species for most Iberian vertebrate predators, especially for large raptors such as the eagle owl (Bubo bubo). The eagle owl functional response was analysed in central Iberian Peninsula by fitting different models (null, linear, two asymptotic and two sigmoidal models) between rabbit abundance and rabbit consumption by the eagle owl. Rabbit consumption increased as did its abundance until reaching an asymptote. Rabbit-consumed biomass better fitted to a type II functional response (convex, typical of specialist predators), whereas rabbit frequency in eagle owl diet better fitted to a type III functional response (sigmoidal, typical of generalist predators). Trophic diversity increased as rabbit abundance decreased. The consumption of other prey, such as Iberian hare (Lepus granatensis) and medium-size birds (mainly galliformes and columbiformes), increased as rabbit abundance decreased. The eagle owl is highly dependent on rabbits in central Spain, even at low rabbit abundance. In this situation, the eagle owl diversifies its diet, making it difficult to define the eagle owl as a specialist or as a generalist predator. Therefore, the eagle owl in the centre of the Iberian Peninsula should be rather considered as a facultative predator on wild rabbits. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: The first Korean optical space surveillance system (Optical Wide-field patrol network, OWL-Net) has been developed by Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI) since 2010. KASI has a plan to establish an optical observation network with 5 abroad sites around the world. Until July 2015, 2 sites had been operated on a test procedure in Mongol and Morocco. The OWL-Net team will start a test operation with a completed system after January 2017. The main targets of the OWL-Net are Korean domestic LEO and GEO satellites. OWL-Net is using a chopper equipment to get dense observation data of over 100 points with 1 shot for the LEO space objects. Coordinate corrected metric data is provided with the time information. We have processed the test observation for system validation and data calibration. 2 LEO satellites with Laser Retro Reflector (LLR) were observed for measurements using the chopper system. We also tried to track high-altitude satellite for the calibration using a shutter system. With these angle-only measurements, orbit determination process will be done with a batch style estimator. We will estimate orbital and other needed parameters for Korean satellite orbit maintenance from 2017. © 2016, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Artificial sensory disturbances (sound and light) can extend far beyond the physical footprint of human development. Nocturnal predators such as owls may be influenced by artificial sound and light, as they depend on aural and visual cues when hunting. Owl nocturnal movements may also be altered by physical changes to the landscape, as these can affect prey availability. The burrowing owl population in Canada has declined by 90% and was classified as endangered in 1995. We tracked adult male burrowing owls Athene cunicularia with GPS dataloggers, and used resource selection models to examine their night-time movement patterns in relation to human infrastructure and associated artificial light and sound. The amount of sound and light from compressor stations, oil wells, traffic, towns and buildings was calculated for each owl and random location. We found that owl night-time space use was better predicted by distance to infrastructure on the landscape than by intensity of sensory disturbance. Burrowing owls did not show a pronounced avoidance of artificial sound. Infrastructure best predicts owl space use, perhaps because associated changes to vegetation alter prey abundance and availability. While human infrastructure most influenced owl nocturnal space use, the extent to which ecosystems are impacted by artificial sound and light is becoming clearer and needs to be considered when assessing the total effect of human development on species. ï¿½ The authors 2016.

ABSTRACT: The Powerful Owl Ninox strenua typically forages for arboreal prey; however, some authors have identified crustaceans in pellet material. This paper reports on an anecdotal observation of a juvenile Owl catching and consuming a fish. The observation was recorded at dusk in the upper reaches of tidal mangroves in one of the bushland remnants in Sydney, New South Wales, along the Georges River. The observation may constitute investigative 'play' behaviour by juvenile Owls. © 2016, Bird Observers Club of Australia (BOCA). All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Capsule The analysis of 616 papers about the diet of the European Barn Owl Tyto alba showed that 9678 invertebrates were captured out of 3.13 million prey items (0.31%). The consumption of invertebrates strongly decreased between 1860 and 2012. This further demonstrates that the Barn Owl diet changed to a large extent during the last 150 years. © 2016 British Trust for Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: The Indonesian island of Flores hosts a remarkable avifauna that is both highly endemic and highly threatened. Nevertheless, basic knowledge of these birds is incomplete. Here we present new distributional information for 18 of the island's bird species obtained during 2011; these include endemics such as Leaf Lorikeet Trichoglossus weberi and rarely recorded residents like Oriental Dwarf Kingfisher Ceyx erithaca. Our records of all Flores endemics are summarised, and we present new information on the habitat tolerance of two additional range-restricted species. Most significant is the discovery of the little-known and Endangered Flores Scops Owl Otus alfredi at three new localities in the hills of far-western Flores, more than doubling the known altitudinal range of this endemic, which was previously considered to be strictly montane. We report new information regarding the owl's habitat preferences, vocalisations and sympatric occurrence with the other two Otus scops owls on Flores. © 2016 The Authors; Journal compilation © 2016 British Ornithologists' Club.

ABSTRACT: Investigation into the predation of a pair of Indian Eagle Owls on anurans disclosed the fact that the greatest success (52.17%) was when the owls pounced from a height of less than 2m and the lowest (12.5%) was from a height of 5-6 m. No success was recorded when the owls pounced from over a height of 6m or when they tried wading in water to catch their prey. Overall, 146 pounces were observed and the strike success was 28.7%. © 2016 Eric Ramanujam.

ABSTRACT: Given their central role in mercury (Hg) excretion and suitability as reservoirs, bird feathers are useful Hg biomonitors. Nevertheless, the interpretation of Hg concentrations is still questioned as a result of a poor knowledge of feather physiology and mechanisms affecting Hg deposition. Given the constraints of feather availability to ecotoxicological studies, we tested the effect of intra-individual differences in Hg concentrations according to feather type (body vs. flight feathers), position in the wing and size (mass and length) in order to understand how these factors could affect Hg estimates. We measured Hg concentration of 154 feathers from 28 un-moulted barn owls (Tyto alba), collected dead on roadsides. Median Hg concentration was 0.45 (0.076–4.5) mg kg−1 in body feathers, 0.44 (0.040–4.9) mg kg−1 in primary and 0.60 (0.042–4.7) mg kg−1 in secondary feathers, and we found a poor effect of feather type on intra-individual Hg levels. We also found a negative effect of wing feather mass on Hg concentration but not of feather length and of its position in the wing. We hypothesize that differences in feather growth rate may be the main driver of between-feather differences in Hg concentrations, which can have implications in the interpretation of Hg concentrations in feathers. Finally, we recommend that, whenever possible, several feathers from the same individual should be analysed. The five innermost primaries have lowest mean deviations to both between-feather and intra-individual mean Hg concentration and thus should be selected under restrictive sampling scenarios. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: This study investigated the effects of the first generation anti-coagulant rodenticide, chlorophacinone and the second generation rodenticide, bromadiolone on nestling growth of barn owl, Tyto alba javanica in oil palm plantations. Forty-two nestlings were selected from rodenticide-free, chlorophacinone and bromadiolone treated plots. Growth rates of nestlings were measured by taking body weight, culmen length, tarsus length and wing length on a periodic basis. Dead nestlings were collected during daily observations. Autopsies were carried out to determine cause of mortality and internal organ (livers) were harvested for analysis of residue by using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Rodenticide-free plot scored the highest fledging success, i.e. 71.4% (n = 14) at 52 days after hatching. In chlorophacinone treated plot, six out of 14 nestlings or 42.85% successfully grew to fledging age of 52 days. In bromadiolone treated plot, only five or 35.75% (n = 14) of nestlings survived to fledging age. Three out of nine nestling carcasses found in bromadiolone treated area were collected for the analysis. Of these, two were detected with bromadiolone residue measuring 0.33 μg g-1 and 0.41 μg g-1 wet weight, respectively. In chlorophacinone treated plot, three out of eight carcasses were collected for analysis. The residue of chlorophacinone detected ranged from 0.18 μg g-1 to 0.21 μg g-1. Nestlings that survived in the rodenticide-free area showed higher measurements for body weight, tarsus, culmen and wing length compared to bromadiolone and chlorophacinone treated plots.

ABSTRACT: The Sunda scops owl Otus lempiji is commonly found in many wooded habitat types in Malaysia. However, as with other owl species in Southeast Asia, there is a lack of published ecological studies. We examined the home range and activity patterns of six adult Sunda scops owls based on radio-telemetry in an isolated forest, namely Ayer Hitam Forest Reserve, Selangor, Peninsular Malaysia from December 2012 to June 2013. Mean minimum convex polygon and harmonic mean home range areas of the owls were 2.40 ± 0.28 SD ha and 4.00 ± 0.78 SD ha, respectively. The birds exhibited territorial behaviour with little overlapping of home ranges. Movements (the means of inter-fix speed) were not associated with lunar illumination nor with time. This study provided baseline information on the spatial requirements of the Sunda scops owl in a lowland forest. © National University of Singapore.

ABSTRACT: Urban areas expose wildlife to an array of novel predators, amongst which, humans and dogs are highly frequent. Thus, wild animals living in urban areas are forced to invest more time and energy in defence behaviours, which depend on how the risk is perceived and assessed. We experimentally tested whether Burrowing owls coming from rural and urban habitats showed differences in behavioural responses when facing humans and domestic dogs. We measured flight initiation distances (FIDs), nest returning, and aggressiveness level when owls faced a human and a human with a dog walking towards them. Our results showed that urban owls recognise a human with a dog as a greater threat than a human alone, thus indicating that fear of domestic animals should be considered as affecting owls' settlement in cities and towns. On the other hand, rural owls perceived human and dogs as similar threats, but showed higher FIDs, less aggressiveness, and lower tendency to return to the nest than urban owls in both treatments. These findings emphasize the importance of modified habitats in modelling the response of urban and rural owls to predators and represent another step in the explanation of how wild animals assess and respond to threats associated with living in urbanized environments. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The behaviour of birds in urban habitats often differs from that of birds in surrounding natural and rural habitats, with the attenuation of fear responses to humans a primary behavioural adaptation to urban life. In breeding birds, fear responses and nest-defence have been linked to reproductive success. We studied the nest-defence behaviour of male Burrowing Owls in rural and urban habitats by measuring flight-initiation distance (FID), time to return to the nest following disturbance and aggressiveness of nest-defence in response to a person walking towards them during three stages of their breeding period: during incubation and during two nestling stages. Male Burrowing Owls breeding in rural habitat had longer FID than Owls breeding in urban habitat, but FID did not decrease over the breeding season whereas it did decrease over the breeding season in urban habitat. Male Owls in rural habitat were less likely to return to their nests within 10min of disturbance than Owls in urban habitat. Lastly, aggressiveness of nest-defence of Owls breeding in rural and urban habitats was similar and increased throughout the breeding season in both habitats. Our results highlight the role of behaviour in explaining the ability of Burrowing Owls to live in a range of habitats, including successfully breeding in urban areas, and emphasise the importance of breeding stage on behavioural traits. © BirdLife Australia 2016.

ABSTRACT: Most species of owls lack distinctive sexual color dimorphism, and plumage is not considered reliable for distinguishing sex. In North America, Long-eared Owls Asio otus are generally considered monomorphic in color, although there are subtle color differences between the sexes. From 1987 to 2015, we investigated differences in plumage coloration of male and female Long-eared Owls in western Montana. We initially used an observational method 1987-1993, followed by a quantitative method 1994-1999, and then a simplified method 2000-2015. When we used the observational method, we correctly sexed all 22 Long-eared Owls. For the quantitative method, we used a Munsell Soil Color Chart to score underwing coverts, tarsometatarsus, and facial disc of breeding males and females and museum specimens purportedly sexed correctly. We found significant sex-specific color differences: underwing coverts G = 136.77, df = 5, P < 0.01, tarsometatarsus G = 44.50, df = 4, P < 0.01, and facial disc G = 50.62, df = 7, P < 0.01. Underwing coverts differed the most between sexes. Based on these plumage color differences, we then correctly sexed all 19 owls captured during fall and winter and later recaptured as breeding birds. Using the simplified method, we correctly predicted the sex of 55 of 58 93% owls captured during fall and winter and later recaptured as breeders. Overall, we correctly predicted sex of 96 of 99 96.9% Long-eared Owls in Montana. We suggest that plumage coloration differences should be investigated in other study areas outside of Montana. © 2016 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The Mexican spotted owl (Strix occidentalis lucida) was listed as a threatened species in 1993, primarily because of concerns over the loss of late seral forest habitat to timber harvest and wildfire. A recovery plan prepared for this owl subspecies explicitly assumed that nesting (and/or roosting) habitat was a primary factor limiting distribution of Mexican spotted owls and provided four desired conditions for identifying and managing potential owl nesting/roosting habitat in forested habitat. We used data collected at nest sites of Mexican spotted owls in the Sacramento Mountains, New Mexico, to evaluate how well these desired conditions and associated forest structural attributes described nesting habitat in this area. All nest sites included in our analyses successfully fledged young during the study. These nest sites generally featured higher levels of the structural attributes included in the desired conditions (total basal area, density of trees >46 cm in dbh, percentage of basal area in trees 30–46 cm dbh, percentage of basal area in trees >46 cm dbh) than the surrounding stand, yet only 46–87% of sampled nest sites met single desired conditions and only 22% met all four conditions simultaneously. The best generalized linear models using combinations of these four structural attributes plus canopy cover to distinguish between nest sites and random sites within owl home ranges all contained canopy cover and percentage of basal area in trees >46 cm dbh. Relative importance values were high for both of these attributes (1.000 and 0.983, respectively), confidence intervals around parameter estimates included zero for all other attributes. The present combination of four desired conditions did not consistently identify nesting habitat in this area, required managing for levels of structural attributes that were greater than levels typically observed at successful owl nest sites, did not include canopy cover, which was the single best predictor in the Sacramento Mountains. We recommend revising the desired conditions in the Sacramento Mountains to emphasize canopy cover and some attribute measuring the large tree component. We also recommend repeating this assessment in other geographic areas to determine how well the desired conditions for those areas describe nesting habitat for owls. © 2016 Society of American Foresters.

ABSTRACT: The Croatian population of the eagle owl Bubo bubo (Linnaeus, 1758) is estimated at 800–1200 breeding pairs with the majority of population breeding in the Mediterranean region, along the eastern Adriatic coast. The main aims of this work were two-fold: (1) to determine the eagle owl territorial densities in the central part of Mediterranean Croatia; and (2) to examine landscape composition and configuration of the study plots and consider possible reasons for differences in recorded densities. The abundance of the eagle owl was surveyed from 2001 to 2006 within three plots of similar size (a total survey area of 246km2): two plots were on the mainland and one on the archipelago at about 16km from the coast. The playback method was used to stimulate eagle owl territorial behaviour and to determine the locations of their territories. Territorial densities ranged from 4.5 to 26.2 pairs/100km2, with the highest density being recorded on islands. We suggest that this high density is a result of good foraging conditions, especially year-round availability and high abundance of the yellow-legged gull Larus michahellis J. F. Naumann, 1840 and the brown rat Rattus rattus (Linnaeus, 1758), together with low risk of human-induced mortality. © 2016 Unione Zoologica Italiana.

ABSTRACT: Barn owl (Tyto alba) siblings preen and offer food items to one another, behaviours that can be considered prosocial because they benefit a conspecific by relieving distress or need. In experimental broods, we analysed whether such behaviours were reciprocated, preferentially exchanged between specific phenotypes, performed to avoid harassment and food theft or signals of hierarchy status. Three of the results are consistent with the hypothesis of direct reciprocity. First, food sharing was reciprocated in three-chick broods but not in pairs of siblings, that is when nestlings could choose a partner with whom to develop a reciprocating interaction. Second, a nestling was more likely to give a prey item to its sibling if the latter individual had preened the former. Third, siblings matched their investment in preening each other. Manipulation of age hierarchy showed that food stealing was directed towards older siblings but was not performed to compensate for a low level of cooperation received. Social behaviours were related to melanin-based coloration, suggesting that animals may signal their propensity to interact socially. The most prosocial phenotype (darker reddish) was also the phenotype that stole more food, and the effect of coloration on prosocial behaviour depended upon rank and sex, suggesting that colour-related prosociality is state dependent. © 2016 European Society for Evolutionary Biology.

ABSTRACT: Forest fire is one of the most important ecological disturbances affecting habitat of the declining California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) population in southern California. We analyzed foraging location data collected 3 and 4 years post-fire, from 8 radio-tagged California spotted owls whose home ranges included forest burned in the 5,176-ha Slide Fire in the San Bernardino Mountains, California, USA. We analyzed foraging habitat selection with sensitivity analysis using 3 different spatial extents to define available resource area: utilization distribution, minimum convex polygon, and capture radius. At all 3 extents of available habitat these spotted owls selected foraging sites close to their territory centers and riparian areas. Resource selection functions indicated burned forests were generally used in proportion to their availability, with the exception of significant selection for moderate-severity burned forests farther from territory centers at the largest available habitat extent (capture radius). Riparian habitats should be preserved for California spotted owls in southern California, and forests burned by high-severity fire should be considered potentially suitable foraging habitat. We suggest researchers perform habitat selection analyses at multiple spatial extents of availability and describe the sensitivity of their results. © 2016 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2016

ABSTRACT: Competitive intraguild interactions can modify the spatial and temporal territory use of predators, e.g., this phenomenon was reported among species of owls (Strigidae). This study made use of owl guild present in fragmented forests in southern Poland to investigate how the occurrence of the dominant Ural owl affects the territory distribution of subordinate (in descending order): tawny owl, boreal owl and pygmy owl. Surveys carried out in 2014-2015 showed that the tawny owl decreases in density and the distances between its territories increase in sympatry with Ural owl. The tawny owl increases in abundance during the non-breeding season, in particular in sympatry with the Ural owl, where young tawny owls try to settle within territories of the Ural owl. The distribution of the boreal owl territories was found to be random with respect to the tawny owl, but territories were clustered in space with the Ural owl territories, which suggests that the boreal owl distribution tends to follow the availability of suitable nesting places rather than the avoidance of the tawny owl. The distribution of the pygmy owl territories was random with respect to the Ural owl, but clumped with respect to the tawny owl, as both species occupied fir-spruce stands avoided by the Ural owl. In summary, this study broadens the basic knowledge about spatio-temporal relations within the owl guild by showing that the occurrence of the dominant Ural owl is a substantial factor in shaping the distribution of owls in fragmented forests. © Finnish Zoological and Botanical Publishing Board 2016.

ABSTRACT: Great Gray Owls (Strix nebulosa) in the Sierra Nevada were once believed to nest strictly within mid-elevation conifer forests in close proximity to montane meadows. However, recent observations of Great Gray Owls nesting at lower elevations suggest the lower-montane zone of the Sierra Nevada, where oak-dominated woodlands transition to conifer-dominated forests, may also provide habitat for this California-listed endangered species. We describe the reproductive success, apparent occupancy rate, and habitat associated with eight Great Gray Owl nests monitored between 2006-2014 on commercial timberlands in the lower-montane zone of the central Sierra Nevada, California. Reproductive success was high, with several breeding attempts producing three fledglings, and an average of 1.9 ± 0.9 young fledged during 21 breeding attempts. Apparent occupancy rates were also high (87.5% ± 20.9%) in the years following the discovery of a territory. Nests were in large-diameter (x=102.5 cm) trees, but smaller-diameter (25.4-50.7 cm) trees dominated the surrounding landscape, which was composed primarily of dense mixed conifer and hardwood forest interspersed with annual grasslands. Our results suggest that the lower-montane zone of the Sierra Nevada, though at the geographic limit of Great Gray Owl's elevational range, can provide suitable nesting habitat. We used Maxent to identify potential Great Gray Owl nesting habitat throughout the lower-montane zone of the Sierra Nevada based on conditions around the nests we studied. Our model identified areas within 10 counties of the central and northern Sierra Nevada that we recommend be surveyed for Great Gray Owls. Identifying such locations could focus survey efforts to determine if this cryptic species is nesting in the identified areas, perhaps in numbers that may be a significant component of the very small statewide population. © 2016 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: During the last half of century, agricultural intensification within European farmlands caused the deprivation of farmland biodiversity, including farmland birds. Since then different conservation measures have been introduced to reverse declining trends of these birds. Yet, variable success of these measures suggests that habitat management requires planning at appropriate spatial scales. In this study, we examine habitat associations of the Little Owl, a rapidly declining farmland bird, within the context of Central European farmland. We collected presence/absence data from three different countries (the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary) and examined habitat associations within and between regions at three different spatial scales: nest site, home range and landscape. We show that certain habitat associations are shared across all study regions, namely those involving grasslands and farm buildings that are used for foraging and nesting, respectively. Inter-regional analysis reveals that grasslands, gardens/orchards and farm buildings are most important habitats at small spatial scales, whereas at large spatial scales, the owl is positively associated with open habitats in terms of arable fields. We suggest that conservation planning should take into account both regional and inter-regional aspects of a species' habitat associations to distinguish between common habitat requirements and local species-environment relationships. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: A total of 287 dietary items and 19 roosting sites of the Sooty Owl were identified from coastal habitats at Cape Conran, East Gippsland, Victoria. One male Sooty Owl roosted exclusively within foliage of Scented Paperbark and Saw Banksia, while three females roosted exclusively within eucalypt hollows. Dietary remains collected predominantly from the male Sooty Owl included nine mammal species, with the Common Ringtail Possum and Bush Rat being the dominant species, supporting the view that Sooty Owls take prey from arboreal and terrestrial locations. © 2016, Field Naturalists Club of Victoria.

ABSTRACT: To establish a management plan that does not contribute to species loss, it is essential to fully understand the response by organisms to human impacts. Forests on floodplain of rivers face several threats. One of them is intensive forestry. Along the Danube River, forests are changing rapidly, which affects the composition of species. Due to short rotation logging, cavity-nesting birds are restricted by the lack of old trees. Thus, in our study we intended to identify the habitat preferences of the Tawny Owl, in areas with populous plantations and fragments of natural softwood forest. We measured 28 environmental parameters (type of forest, age, perimeter of trees, height and coverage of herbaceous layer, shrub and trees in proper categories) in Tawny owl territories as well as outside these territories. By using discriminant analysis with forward stepwise method we found significant difference in overall vegetation structure inside and outside the territories. The Tawny owl remains close to the oldest (older than 26 years) and largest trees (with perimeter greater than 161 cm), which are common for patches of natural forest. However, the owl seems to avoid monocultures with small trees and larger cover of tall grass and shrubs. Hence we concluded that the natural forests should be maintained as a fundamental element in the floodplain areas. Furthermore, based on our results, the priority of managing the populous plantations should be in a way that at least few old trees would remain in logging units. © 2016 CISO - Centro Italiano Studi Ornitologici.

ABSTRACT: As described in the previous paper (Park et al. 2013), the detector subsystem of optical wide-field patrol (OWL) provides many observational data points of a single artificial satellite or space debris in the form of small streaks, using a chopper system and a time tagger. The position and the corresponding time data are matched assuming that the length of a streak on the CCD frame is proportional to the time duration of the exposure during which the chopper blades do not obscure the CCD window. In the previous study, however, the length was measured using the diagonal of the rectangle of the image area containing the streak; the results were quite ambiguous and inaccurate, allowing possible matching error of positions and time data. Furthermore, because only one (position, time) data point is created from one streak, the efficiency of the observation decreases. To define the length of a streak correctly, it is important to locate the endpoints of a streak. In this paper, a method using a differential convolution mask pattern is tested. This method can be used to obtain the positions where the pixel values are changed sharply. These endpoints can be regarded as directly detected positional data, and the number of data points is doubled by this result. © The Korean Space Science Society.

ABSTRACT: The diet of the Omani Owl, Strix butleri, was studied for the first time based on re- cently collected pellets. A total of 22 individual prey items represented three mam- mals (all rodents), at least two undetermined gecko species and one scorpion. By fre- quency, Acomys cahirinus constituted 31.8% and lizards 27.3%, while Gerbillus nanus and G. dasyurus were the least consumed prey items (4.5% each). © 2016 Taylor & Francis.

ABSTRACT: Pellets were collected under an active Long-eared Owl (Asio otus) nest in the city centre of Denizli, Turkey. The nest was located in a conifer tree in a 5.7 ha urban park, centrally-located in the city of Denizli, with a human population of 577,000 people. During April-June 2014, a total of 64 pellets containing remains of 86 individual prey items was found. All prey were Passeriformes and consisted of two species belonging to Passeridae and Hirundinidae. 78 of the 86 prey items (90.7%) were House Sparrow (Passer domesticus) and the other eight (9.3%) were House Martin (Delichon urbicum). This is one of the first studies to indicate that the Long-eared Owl's nesting season diet consists entirely of birds. The main factor affecting this result is probably the fact that the owls live in an urbanised setting. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.

ABSTRACT: Diet composition of birds is important to determine nutritional performance in their living areas. In this study, nutrional properties of the diet of little owl (Athene noctua) controlling the proliferation of some animal populations were investigated in Isparta centrum and its surroundings during the period December 2012 to November 2013. The analysis of identification of 2336 prey items in 378 pellets collected shows that the species feeds on mainly invertabrates of the orders Insecta (92%), Pulmonata (1%), Haplotaxida (1%) and Scolopendromorpha (0.1%) and partly on vertebrates of the orders Rodentia (4%), Insectivora (1.3%) and Passeriformes (0.6%). Vertebrate prey items were generally observed in the bigger pellets while invertebrates were dominant in the smaller ones. The ratio of insects in the diet significantly increased during summer months. The determination of diet features of this species would be important to control some species considered harmful in agricultural areas and to provide fundamental base for biological control programmes.

ABSTRACT: Emerging evidence indicates that anthropogenic noise has highly detrimental impacts on natural communities; however, the effects of noise on acoustically specialized predators has received less attention. We demonstrate experimentally that natural gas compressor station noise impairs the hunting behavior of northern saw-whet owls (Aegolius acadius). We presented 31 wild-caught owls with prey inside a field-placed flight tent under acoustic conditions found 50-800 m (46-73 dBA) from a compressor station. To assess how noise affected hunting, we postulated two hypotheses. First, hunting deficits might increase with increasing noise-the dose-response hypothesis. Secondly, the noise levels used in this experiment might equally impair hunting, or produce no impact-the threshold hypothesis. Using a model selection framework, we tested these hypotheses for multiple dependent variables-including overall hunting success and each step in the attack sequence (prey detection, strike, and capture). The dose-response hypothesis was supported for overall hunting success, prey detection, and strike behavior. For each decibel increase in noise, the odds of hunting success decreased by 8% (CI 4.5%-11.0%). The odds of prey detection and strike behavior also decreased with increasing noise, falling 11% (CI 7%-16%) and 5% (CI 5%-6%), respectively. These results suggest that unmitigated noise has the potential to decrease habitat suitability for acoustically specialized predators, impacts that can reverberate through ecosystems. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: As a small nocturnal migrant, the Northern Saw-whet Owl (Aegolius acadicus) is hypothesized to reduce predation risk by avoiding migration during the full moon. However, small-scale studies have given mixed results on whether there is a relationship between capture rate of Northern Saw-whet Owls and the lunar cycle during fall migration. We used 50 years of data from the U.S. Bird Banding Laboratory to examine capture rates of Northern Saw-whet Owls throughout North America in relation to lunar illumination. A logistic regression of 156,794 fall captures compared to random dates in the fall showed that captures are significantly less likely as lunar illumination increases. Captures at high illumination were 22% less likely than captures on moonless nights during the waning half of the lunar cycle and 41% less likely during the waxing half of the lunar cycle. Modification of the lunar illumination index to correct for the duration of the night that the moon is in the sky gave similar results. Owls were also most likely to be captured on a Sunday or Monday, perhaps reflecting higher weekend capture effort. The relationship of captures to lunar illumination and wax/wane phase is consistent with an ultimate explanation of predator risk avoidance, but a proximate mechanism of altered owl movement is not demonstrated and alternative explanations such as variable human capture effort and changes in owls' ability to detect and avoid nets may also be responsible. Neither of our logistic models had much power, probably because local habitat and weather are strong modifiers of the lunar cycle effect on capture probability of Northern Saw-whet Owls. The average reductions calculated here may still underestimate the decrease in owl captures under local conditions of bright moonlight.

ABSTRACT: Many bird species produce two annual broods during a single breeding season. However, not all individuals reproduce twice in the same year suggesting that double brooding is condition-dependent. In contrast to most raptors and owls, the barn owl Tyto alba produces two annual clutches in most worldwide distributed populations. Nevertheless, the determinants of double brooding are still poorly studied. We performed such a study in a Swiss barn owl population monitored between 1990 and 2014. The annual frequency of double brooding varied from 0 to 14% for males and 0 to 59% for females. The likelihood of double brooding was higher when individuals initiated their first clutch early rather than late in the season and when males had few rather than many offspring at the first nest. Despite the reproductive benefits of double brooding (single- and double-brooded individuals produced 3.97 ± 0.11 and 7.07 ± 0.24 fledglings, respectively), double brooding appears to be traded off against offspring quality because at the first nest double-brooded males produced poorer quality offspring than single-brooded males. This might explain why females desert their first mate to produce a second brood with another male without jeopardizing reproductive success at the first nest. Furthermore, the reproductive cycle being very long in the barn owl (120 d from start of laying to offspring independence), selection may have favoured behaviours that accelerate the initiation of a second annual brood. Accordingly, half of the double-brooded females abandoned their young offspring to look for a new partner in order to initiate the second breeding attempt, 9.48 d earlier than when producing the second brood with the same partner. We conclude that male and female barn owls adopt different reproductive strategies. Females have more opportunities to reproduce twice in a single season than males because mothers are not strictly required during the entire rearing period in contrast to fathers. A high proportion of male floaters may also encourage females to desert their first brood to re-nest with a new male who is free of parental care duties.

ABSTRACT: We piloted a roadside survey technique for detecting short-eared owls (Asio flammeus) during the courtship period in western Montana, USA. We conducted 33 surveys between 2009 and 2012 and timed surveys to coincide with courtship behavior. Short-eared owls perform courtship flights and vocalizations that can be observed and heard during the crepuscular and nocturnal periods. We designed surveys to compare visual and audio survey techniques. Visual surveys occurred during the crepuscular period and were immediately followed by a nocturnal audio-playback survey. Visual survey techniques accounted for >91% (n = 237) of all detections. Detections associated with audio survey techniques were almost always associated with survey points where ≥1 owl was detected during visual survey. Nearly three-quarters of visual survey detections (n = 217) occurred between 30 min and 70 min before the end of civil twilight. Greater than 75% of visual survey detections and 90% of audio survey detections occurred in areas where vegetation was uncut, ungrazed, and most frequently associated with vegetation heights greater than approximately 60 cm. We never detected short-eared owls in areas where livestock was present. We recommend visual surveys during the courtship period as a useful and applicable method for monitoring breeding populations of short-eared owls. © 2016 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2016

ABSTRACT: Context: Organisms commonly respond to their environment across a range of scales, however many habitat selection studies still conduct selection analyses using a single-scale framework. The adoption of multi-scale modeling frameworks in habitat selection studies can improve the effectiveness of these studies and provide greater insights into scale-dependent relationships between species and specific habitat components. Objectives: Our study assessed multi-scale nest/roost habitat selection of the federally “Threatened” Mexican spotted owl (Strix occidentalis lucida) in northern Arizona, USA in an effort to provide improved conservation and management strategies for this subspecies. Methods: We conducted multi-scale habitat modeling to assess habitat selection by Mexican spotted owls using survey data collected by the USFS. Each selected covariate was included in multi-scale models at their “characteristic scale” and we used an all-subsets approach and model selection framework to assess habitat selection. Results: The “characteristic scale” identified for each covariate varied considerably among covariates and results from multi-scale models indicated that percent canopy cover and slope were the most important covariates with respect to habitat selection by Mexican spotted owls. Multi-scale models consistently outperformed their analogous single-scale counterparts with respect to the proportion of deviance explained and model predictive performance. Conclusions: Efficacy of future habitat selection studies will benefit by taking a multi-scale approach. In addition to potentially providing increased explanatory power and predictive capacity, multi-scale habitat models enhance our understanding of the scales at which species respond to their environment, which is critical knowledge required to implement effective conservation and management strategies. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

ABSTRACT: Using published and new data from a population of monogamous owl monkeys in the Argentinean Chaco, I examine the hypothesis that social monogamy is a default social system imposed upon males because the spatial and/or temporal distribution of resources and females makes it difficult for a single male to defend access to more than one mate. First, I examine a set of predictions on ranging patterns, use of space, and population density. This first section is followed by a second one considering predictions related to the abundance and distribution of food. Finally, I conclude with a section attempting to link the ranging and ecological data to demographic and life-history parameters as proxies for reproductive success. In support of the hypothesis, owl monkey species do live at densities (7-64ind/km2) that are predicted for monogamous species, but groups occupy home ranges and core areas that vary substantially in size, with pronounced overlap of home ranges, but not of core areas. There are strong indications that the availability of food sources in the core areas during the dry season may be of substantial importance for regulating social monogamy in owl monkeys. Finally, none of the proxies for the success of groups were strongly related to the size of the home range or core area. The results I present do not support conclusively any single explanation for the evolution of social monogamy in owl monkeys, but they help us to better understand how it may function. Moreover, the absence of conclusive answers linking ranging, ecology, and reproductive success with the evolution of social monogamy in primates, offer renewed motivation for continuing to explore the evolution of monogamy in owl monkeys.

ABSTRACT: The Ural owl (Strix uralensis) is the biggest forest-living owl in Austria; however, it became extinct in Austria through poaching and habitat loss more than half a century ago. The birds examined in the present study were breeding pairs from the reintroduction project with the aim of determining exploratory plasma biochemistry reference intervals in Ural owls and evaluating the amount of biological variation between seasons, sexes, and ages. A total of 45 birds were sampled, including 13 adult males, 14 adult females, and 18 juvenile birds. Remarkably, almost all of the analytes showed significant differences between the subgroups, primarily between seasons, followed by age and sex. Only creatinkinase, glucose, lactatdehydrogenase, and triglycerides did not show any significant variations. Despite partitioning of reference values into subgroups according to biological variation diminishing the number of reference individuals in the respective groups, the resulting smaller reference intervals will improve medical assessment. The results of the present study once again demonstrate that significant seasonal fluctuations must be expected and considered in the interpretation. It can be assumed that these differences are probably even greater in free-range birds with considerable changes in food quantity and quality during and between years. © Copyright 2016 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: All of the published studies but one about the diet of the Eurasian scops owl Otus scops, a nocturnal raptor of conservation concern, were carried out during the breeding period, just before or immediately after the chicks fledged. The species is a trans-Saharian migrant with few resident populations in Europe. Orthoptera make up the staple of its diet in summer. In this study, we investigated the diet of scops owls on the island of Pianosa after the breeding period through the analysis of pellets. A total of 327 fragments belonging to at least 14 taxa were identified from 56 pellets collected after the breeding period, between late August and March. By frequency, invertebrates constituted 80.00% of the diet, with Coleoptera being the most represented order (62.35% of the total diet) and Orthoptera poorly represented (8.24%). Vertebrates included two bird species, three small mammals and the Moorish gecko. Although the meal-to-pellet interval for scops owls is unknown, we suggest that the bank vole, which is not recorded on any Italian island, and possibly the wild mice, may have been preyed upon in nearby areas, before a migratory movement towards a warm area (e.g. Pianosa) occurred. © 2016 Unione Zoologica Italiana.

ABSTRACT: Large numbers of Western Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia hypugaea) nest in black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) colonies in the southern high plains of Texas. Because the Western Burrowing Owl is a species of concern with an uncertain future due to widespread extirpation of prairie dogs, we examined the roles of prairie dog colony size, burrow density, proxies of prey availability, and vegetative composition and structure on owl abundance and reproductive rate. The number of nesting Burrowing Owl pairs was positively correlated to colony area (r2 = 0.550, P = 0.006) and to number of prairie dog burrows in a colony (r2 = 0.733, P = 0.0230). Burrowing Owl numbers and reproductive rate (maximum number of young seen per successful pair) were not related to our measures of vegetative composition and structure in prairie dog colonies, nor to indices of prey availability. © 2016 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: In June 2008, I discovered a single jumping mouse (Zapus) cranium in a Barn Owl (Tyto alba) pellet from below an active nest along Cerrososo Creek, Colfax County, northeastern New Mexico. Although the cranium could not be identified to species, this specimen could potentially represent a previously unknown population of the endangered New Mexico meadow jumping mouse (Z. hudsonius luteus). In 2009 and 2010, I collected pellets at 8 Barn Owl nesting or roosting sites along streams in my study area with the following objectives: (1) determine whether Barn Owl pellets could be used to gain information about the abundance and distribution of this Zapus population, (2) use pellets to acquire additional Zapus specimens to aid in positive identification of the jumping mouse species present, and (3) potentially document a previously unknown population of the endangered New Mexico meadow jumping mouse. Focusing only on pellets produced during the Zapus active (nonhibernation) summer period, I dissected 298 pellets containing 487 individual mammalian prey items from 12 genera but did not locate any additional Zapus remains. Examination of owl pellets appears to be a poor survey tool for Zapus, perhaps due to the jumping mouse's short summer active period, natural low population density, and preference for tall, dense riparian vegetation.

ABSTRACT: Sex ratios of rodents in samples of owl pellets have been interpreted to reflect predator selectivity, availability of prey on the landscape, and variable susceptibility of the sexes to predation. Metric distinction of male from female innominates of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) and voles (Microtus spp.) extracted from ∼120 pellets cast by barn owls (Tyto alba) in southeastern Washington state revealed more females than males. The sex ratio did not change from pellets cast when much of the landscape was productive agricultural land to pellets cast when a portion of the land was taken out of production and placed in soil bank. Barn owls are opportunistic foragers that have greater success at prey capture when vegetation cover is discontinuous. Barn owls likely captured more young females than males of both rodent taxa because the former are more subject than the latter to intra- and inter-specific displacement into more open habitats, whether agricultural land or soil bank land, therefore are more susceptible to predation.

ABSTRACT: Low-speed aerodynamics has gained increasing interest due to its relevance for the design process of small flying air vehicles. These small aircraft operate at similar aerodynamic conditions as, e.g. birds which therefore can serve as rolemodels of howto overcome the well-known problems of low Reynolds number flight. The flight of the barn owl is characterized by a very low flight velocity in conjunction with a low noise emission and a high level ofmaneuverability at stable flight conditions. To investigate the complex three-dimensional flow field and the corresponding local structural deformation in combination with their influence on the resulting aerodynamic forces, time-resolved stereoscopic particle-image velocimetry and force and moment measurements are performed on a prepared natural barn owl wing. Several spanwise positions are measured via PIV in a range of angles of attack 0 ;° ≤ a ≤6 ;° and Reynolds numbers 40 000≤ Rec ≤ 120 000 based on the chord length. Additionally, the resulting forces andmoments are recorded for -10 ;° ≤ α ≤ 15 ;° at the same Reynolds numbers.Depending on the spanwise position, the angle of attack, and the Reynolds number, the flow field on the wings pressure side is characterized by either a region of flow separation, causing large-scale vortical structures which lead to a timedependent deflection of the flexible wing structure or wing regions showing no instantaneous deflection but a reduction of the time-averagedmean wing curvature. Based on the force measurements the three-dimensional fluidstructure interaction is assumed to considerably impact the aerodynamic forces acting on the wing leading to a strongmechanical loading of the interface between the wing and body. These time-depending loads which result from the flexibility of the wing should be taken into consideration for the design of future small flying air vehicles using flexible wing structures. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Bird species, including raptors, can often be categorized into two groups depending upon their response to alterations in clutch size while laying. For some, clutch size is predetermined prior to the start of laying i.e., determinate species. In contrast, the clutch size of indeterminate layers can be influenced by external factors present at the time of laying. Using field experiments, our objective was to examine the egg-laying responses of female Western Burrowing Owls Athene cunicularia hypugaea to manipulations of clutch size. To assess whether Burrowing Owls are determinate or indeterminate egg-layers, we altered female clutch size by removing or adding one egg during the laying period. At the time of egg removal or addition, the resident female had 1-5 of her own eggs present in her clutch. We compared the size of completed clutches of both removal and addition nests to the size of completed clutches at control nests. Mean clutch size at removal nests x = 8.3 eggs, SE = 0.44, n = 9 did not differ from controls x = 8.8 eggs, SE = 0.18, n = 17, whereas mean clutch size at addition nests x = 10.7 eggs, SE = 0.66, n = 9 was significantly larger than that of control nests. These findings demonstrate that female Burrowing Owls responded to the removal of an egg by laying a replacement, yet they did not curtail laying in response to the addition of an egg to their nest. Thus, female Burrowing Owls may be described as removal indeterminate and addition determinate. These results have implications for understanding aspects of Burrowing Owl nesting biology, such as selective advantage following the partial or total loss of a clutch of eggs, and they also may provide insight into how this behavior could facilitate conspecific brood parasitism or mitigate its costs in this species. © 2016 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: In the present study, the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of Bubo bubo using PCR amplification, sequencing and assembling has been obtained for the first time. The total length of the mitochondrial genome was 16,250 bp, with the base composition of 29.88% A, 34.16% C, 14.35% G, and 21.58% T. It contained 37 genes (2 ribosomal RNA genes, 13 protein-coding genes and 22 transfer RNA genes) and a major non-coding control region (D-loop region). The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of Bubo bubo provides an important data set for further investigation on the phylogenetic relationships within Strigiformes. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Context: Testing the influence of edges on animal distributions depends on our capacity to quantify ‘edge’, particularly in heterogeneous landscapes. Habitat quality is likely to differ in instances where edges are abrupt and anthropogenic in origin, versus diffuse, disturbance-created edges. Objectives: We tested whether or not structurally distinct edge types influence northern spotted owl habitat selection and whether the relationship between edge type and use varied across spatial scales relevant to owl foraging (<3 ha) and home range selection (50–800 ha). Methods: We used remotely sensed disturbance severity data to define two distinct edge types, ‘hard’ and ‘diffuse’, following a 11,000 ha fire and subsequent salvage logging in southern Oregon. The approach quantifies the steepness of gradients directly by measuring the ‘slope’ of change in disturbance severity. We tested the degree to which 23 radio-collared spotted owls responded to edge characteristics caused by fire and logging. Results: Spotted owls showed a strong negative association with hard edge, even after accounting for habitat suitability and other confounding variables. However, this negative relationship was highly scale-dependent; spotted owls were resilient to hard edges at broad scales, but avoided the same feature at fine scales. On the other hand, spotted owls showed a positive association with diffuse edge, especially at broader scales. Conclusions: Differential use of edge types indicates that owls favor disturbances that create diffuse edge habitat (e.g. low and mixed-severity fire) and rather than abrupt boundaries created by high severity disturbance. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

ABSTRACT: Irruptive migration is mostly observed in species specialized on pulsed resources and is thought to be a response to unpredictable changes in food supply. We assessed two alternative hypotheses to explain the periodic winter irruptions of snowy owls Bubo scandiacus every 3–5 years in temperate North America: (a) the lack-of-food hypothesis, which states that a crash in small mammal abundance on the Arctic breeding grounds forces owls to move out of the tundra massively to search for food in winter; (b) the breeding-success hypothesis, which states that high abundance of tundra small mammals during the summer allows for high production of young, thus increasing the pool of migrants moving south the following winter. We modeled winter irruptions of snowy owls in relation to summer food resources and geographic location. Winter abundance of owls was obtained from citizen-based surveys from 1994 to 2011 and summer abundance of small mammals was collected in summer at two distant sites in Canada: Bylot Island, NU (eastern High Arctic) and Daring Lake, NWT (central Low Arctic). Winter owl abundance was positively related to prey abundance during the previous summer at both sites and tended to decrease from western to eastern temperate North America. Irruptive migration of snowy owls was therefore best explained by the breeding success hypothesis and was apparently caused by large-scale summer variations in food. Our results, combined with previous findings, suggest that the main determinants of irruptive migration may be species specific even in a guild of apparently similar species. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Coexistence of predator species often depends on behaviours or preferences that result in spatiotemporal reduction of competition. In this study, the diets of coexisting barn owls (Tyto alba) and eagle owls (Bubo bubo) in an agricultural landscape of SE Bulgaria were compared. White-toothed shrews (Crocidura spp.), voles (Microtus spp.) and mice (Mus spp.) were the main prey of barn owl (86.3% by number, 81.2% by biomass) with significantly different frequencies in annual diets. The principle biomass (64.8 ± 6.2%) of the significantly different eagle owl annual diets comprised much heavier prey such as white-breasted hedgehog (Erinaceus roumanicus), European hare (Lepus europaeus) and non-passerine birds of wetlands and open habitats. The two owl species preferred and hunted on different prey size groups in the same territory, and this difference explained the low level of food competition (6.0 ± 3.6% diet overlap according to prey biomass). Voles were the only prey of the two owls with significantly different frequencies for the annual diets in intraspecies comparisons. The proportions of voles in both diets showed similar trends during the study. Eagle owl predation on barn owls was slightly affected by their coexisting breeding despite the high levels of food stress of eagle owl. These findings provide insight into how preying habits can predict successful coexistence of potentially competing predator species. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2016.

ABSTRACT: It has been suggested that predators may protect human health through reducing disease-host densities or selectively preying on infected individuals from the population. However, this has not been tested empirically. We hypothesized that Tengmalm’s owl (Aegolius funereus) selectively preys on hantavirus-infected individuals of its staple prey, the bank vole (Myodes glareolus). Bank voles are hosts of Puumala hantavirus, which causes a form of hemorrhagic fever in humans. Selective predation by owls on infected voles may reduce human disease risk. We compared the prevalence of anti-Puumala hantavirus antibodies (seroprevalence), in bank voles cached by owls in nest boxes to seroprevalence in voles trapped in closed-canopy forest around each nest box. We found no general difference in seroprevalence. Forest landscape structure could partly account for the observed patterns in seroprevalence. Only in more connected forest patches was seroprevalence in bank voles cached in nest boxes higher than seroprevalence in trapped voles. This effect disappeared with increasing forest patch isolation, as seroprevalence in trapped voles increased with forest patch isolation, but did not in cached voles. Our results suggest a complex relationship between zoonotic disease prevalence in hosts, their predators, and landscape structure. Some mechanisms that may have caused the seroprevalence patterns in our results include higher bank vole density in isolated forest patches. This study offers future research potential to shed further light on the contribution of predators and landscape properties to human health. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: The Short-eared Owl (Asio flammeus) is an open-country species breeding in the northern United States and Canada, and has likely experienced a long-term, range-wide, and substantial decline. However, the cause and magnitude of the decline is not well understood. We set forth to address the first two of six previously proposed conservation priorities to be addressed for this species: (1) better define habitat use and (2) improve population monitoring. We recruited 131 volunteers to survey over 6.2 million ha within the state of Idaho for Short-eared Owls during the 2015 breeding season. We surveyed 75 transects, 71 of which were surveyed twice, and detected Short-eared Owls on 27 transects. We performed multiscale occupancy modeling to identify habitat associations, and performed multiscale abundance modeling to generate a state-wide population estimate. Our results suggest that within the state of Idaho, Short-eared Owls are more often found in areas with marshland or riparian habitat or areas with greater amounts of sagebrush habitat at the 1750 ha transect scale. At the 50 ha point scale, Short-eared Owls tend to associate positively with fallow and bare dirt agricultural land and negatively with grassland. Cropland was not chosen at the broader transect scale suggesting that Short-eared Owls may prefer more heterogeneous landscapes. On the surface our results may seem contradictory to the presumed land use by a “grassland” species; however, the grasslands of the Intermountain West, consisting largely of invasive cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), lack the complex structure shown to be preferred by these owls. We suggest the local adaptation to agriculture represents the next best habitat to their historical native habitat preferences. Regardless, we have confirmed regional differences that should be considered in conservation planning for this species. Last, our results demonstrate the feasibility, efficiency, and effectiveness of utilizing public participation in scientific research to achieve a robust sampling methodology across the broad geography of the Intermountain West. © 2016 by the author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: Do evolutionary specializations lead to evolutionary constraint? This appears plausible, particularly when specialization leads to loss of complex adaptations. In the owl monkey lineage, nocturnality clearly arose from a diurnal ancestor. This behavioural shift was accompanied by morphological changes in the eye and orbit and complete loss of colour vision via missense mutations in the gene encoding the short-wave sensitive visual pigment (SWS opsin). Interestingly, at least one subspecies of owl monkey, Azara's owl monkey (Aotus azarae azarae), has regained activity in daylight. Given that all primate species that are active in daylight, including primarily diurnal species and species that are active during both day and night, have at least dichromatic colour vision, it seems reasonable to propose that dichromacy would be adaptive in A. a. azarae. With a disabled SWS opsin, the main avenue available for Azara's owl monkeys to re-evolve colour vision is via a polymorphism in the intact X-linked opsin locus, which commonly occurs in other New World monkeys. To examine this possibility we assayed variation in the X-linked opsin of A. a. azarae, focusing on the three exons (3, 4 and 5) that control spectral sensitivity. Results: We found low opsin genetic variation on a population level, and no differences at the three main sites that lead to variation in spectral sensitivity in the opsins of other New World monkeys. Two rare alleles with single amino acid variants are segregating in the population, but previous functional studies indicate that these are unlikely to affect spectral sensitivity. Conclusions: Genetic constraint on the re-evolution of colour vision is likely operating in Azara's owl monkey, which may affect the niche that this subspecies is able to occupy. © 2016 Mundy et al.

ABSTRACT: Genetic analysis has shown to be an important and efficient method for monitoring species, but the lack of genetic markers constrains such monitoring for many species. Here, we cross-amplified microsatellite loci in the snowy owl (Bubo scandiacus) using primers previously characterized in other species. Among polymorphic loci, we selected 12 loci that amplified relatively short fragments (<250 base pairs) to facilitate genotyping of moulted feathers and other non-invasively collected samples. These 12 loci, and a sex-typing marker, were amplified in two multiplex PCR sets and used to screen 49 snowy owls from a northern European population. The number of alleles observed at single loci was 2 to 17. Expected and observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.12 to 0.91 and from 0.12 to 0.96, respectively. The combined probability of identity for the 12 loci was 5.7 × 10−11. Our multiplex PCR assays are expected to be useful for genetic monitoring, parentage analysis, and population genetic studies of the snowy owl. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016.

ABSTRACT: This study established ophthalmic reference values and characterized ocular lesions in two captive populations of boreal owls, including 46 eyes of 23 great grey owls (Strix nebulosa) and 38 eyes from 19 snowy owls (Bubo scandiacus). A complete ophthalmologic exam was conducted, including neuro-ophthalmic reflexes, Schirmer tear test I (STT-I), intraocular pressure (IOP) using rebound tonometry, fluorescein staining, horizontal corneal measurements using Jameson calipers, direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy, and ocular ultrasound biometry. Eyes with an STT of <5 mm/min, outliers, and eyes with severe diseases were excluded from reference value analysis. No statistically significant differences were found between right or left eyes in either species or among individuals in different age groups and sexes. Mean intraocular pressures and Schirmer tear tests were also not statistically significantly different between great grey owls and snowy owls (IOP: 9.6 ± 2.6 mm Hg and 9.1 ± 1.9 mm Hg, respectively, and STT-I: 9.8 ± 2.8 mm/min and 9.8 ± 2.4 mm/min, respectively). However, snowy owls overall had a significantly larger eye than did great grey owls, reflected in corneal diameters (23.4 ± 1 vs. 20.0 ± 0.8 mm, respectively) and sonographic biometry. In both species, the most common ocular lesions included keratitis, cataracts, chorioretinal lesions, and abnormal pecten. Establishment of reference ocular parameters will help wildlife veterinarians and rehabilitators determine an appropriate treatment plan and will aid in correctly identifying the presence of ocular disease. © Copyright 2016 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Owls (Strigiformes) have been a source of fascination for wildlife rehabbers, zookeepers, falconers, and many others throughout history. They can be slow to learn and difficult to work with. Their behavior is quite different from diurnal raptors because of their unique nocturnal adaptations. Given their popularity as education and flight demonstration birds, captive owls offer researchers and observers a chance to observe how these animals interact with the world around them. Enrichment is an important component of keeping any animal mentally and physically healthy in captivity, but devising enrichment for owls can be challenging. A survey (Appendix A) was sent to 622 wildlife rehabilitation centers, raptor centers, nature centers, zoos, falconers, and similar institutions across the United States in an effort to determine the success and failure of various methods of enrichment for various owl genera, as well as imprints versus non-imprints. Significant findings suggest distinct correlations between imprints and non-imprints for both successful and failed enrichment among Bubo and Tyto species, respectively. Additionally, significant correlations were measured between imprints and non-imprints among all owl genera for successful and failed enrichment. © 2016 International Wildlife Rehabilitation Council.

ABSTRACT: Observed movement patterns are the response of the interaction between environmental variables and the animal internal state. Therefore, even individuals of the same species experiencing similar environmental conditions can exhibit different behavioural responses, as these responses can be highly repeatable within individuals. Here, we investigated the nocturnal movement behaviour of a territorial species, by radiotracking 26 eagle owls Bubo bubo in order to analyze within and between individual variation with respect to movement parameters and route choice. Owls showed a considerable individual consistency in all movement parameters and made repeated use of similar routes while moving within fixed home ranges. Thus, movement parameters varied much less between repeated nightly trajectories than between different individuals. Furthermore, when we compared different individuals inhabiting the same territory in different years, within-group repeatability was low or non-significant suggesting that the spatial configuration of habitat does not always represents one of the main drivers in animal movement behaviour. Similarly, male individuals appeared to exhibit greater repeatability than females. The overall pattern of repeatability we found seems to identify such consistent movement behaviour not only as the expression of individual response to external/internal inputs but also as an additional trait to include in the broad definition of animal personality. © 2016 The Zoological Society of London.

ABSTRACT: The first Korean optical space surveillance system (Optical Wide-field patrol network, OWL-Net) has been developed by Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI) since 2010. KASI has a plan to establish an optical observation network with 5 abroad sites around the world. Until July 2015, 2 sites had been operated on a test procedure in Mongol and Morocco. The OWL-Net team will start a test operation with a completed system after January 2017. The main targets of the OWL-Net are Korean domestic LEO and GEO satellites. OWL-Net is using a chopper equipment to get dense observation data of over 100 points with 1 shot for the LEO space objects. Coordinate corrected metric data is provided with the time information. We have processed the test observation for system validation and data calibration. 2 LEO satellites with Laser Retro Reflector (LLR) were observed for measurements using the chopper system. We also tried to track high-altitude satellite for the calibration using a shutter system. With these angle-only measurements, orbit determination process will be done with a batch style estimator. We will estimate orbital and other needed parameters for Korean satellite orbit maintenance from 2017. © 2016 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Barn owls are keen hunters of moving prey. They have evolved an auditory system with impressive anatomical and physiological specializations for localizing their prey. Here we present behavioural data on the owl’s sensitivity for discriminating acoustic motion direction in azimuth that, for the first time, allow a direct comparison of neuronal and perceptual sensitivity for acoustic motion in the same model species. We trained two birds to report a change in motion direction within a series of repeating wideband noise stimuli. For any trial the starting point, motion direction, velocity (53–2400°/s), duration (30–225 ms) and angular range (12–72°) of the noise sweeps were randomized. Each test stimulus had a motion direction being opposite to that of the reference stimuli. Stimuli were presented in the frontal or the lateral auditory space. The angular extent of the motion had a large effect on the owl’s discrimination sensitivity allowing a better discrimination for a larger angular range of the motion. In contrast, stimulus velocity or stimulus duration had a smaller, although significant effect. Overall there was no difference in the owls’ behavioural performance between “inward” noise sweeps (moving from lateral to frontal) compared to “outward” noise sweeps (moving from frontal to lateral). The owls did, however, respond more often to stimuli with changing motion direction in the frontal compared to the lateral space. The results of the behavioural experiments are discussed in relation to the neuronal representation of motion cues in the barn owl auditory midbrain. © The Author(s) 2016.

ABSTRACT: Barn owls (Tyto alba) are the most widespread raptor species on Earth, and because they are thought to provide natural vertebrate pest control services, farmers in some agricultural regions have encouraged barn owls to breed and hunt on their farms by installing artificial nest boxes. However, barn owl populations are declining in some agricultural regions, which may be a result of changes in land use and agricultural intensification. We studied barn owl diet and nest box occupancy in an intensive agricultural landscape in the Central Valley of California to measure whether agricultural land use affected barn owl diet. We collected 415 viable pellets from 25 active nest boxes over two breeding seasons and compared these results with agricultural land use types within a 1-km radius of each nest. Mice (Mus musculus and Reithrodontomys megalotis) were the most numerous prey and the most important by biomass, but their importance in barn owl diet declined with higher proportions of perennial crops in the surrounding landscape. California voles (Microtus californicus) were less important by number, but still represented a significant proportion of the biomass consumed by owls in our study area. Pocket gophers (Thomomys spp.) were consumed less often but were also an important source of biomass. Furthermore, barn owls nesting in areas with higher proportions of perennial crops consumed more gophers and fewer voles, many of which were juveniles, suggesting that gophers are more abundant and a more important part of barn owl diet in perennial crop areas. Over 99.5% of prey items in barn owl diet were agricultural pests and owls are therefore likely to provide valuable pest control services for growers in our area, although the species consumed may vary with crop types with implications for pest-control. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Maintaining or restoring old-growth stand structures in mountain forests, including deadwood and snags provided by natural disturbances, is considered critical for the conservation of secondary cavity-nesting birds. Under current climate warming, old-growth mountain forests might become increasingly important for boreoalpine species living in the southern part of their ranges. Here, we focused on hierarchical habitat selection by Eurasian Pygmy Owls Glaucidium passerinum in mixed mountain forests at their low latitude range limit in the southern French Prealps. We quantified Pygmy Owl habitat use at complementary hierarchical levels, from the local population to individual home ranges, by combining systematic playback counts and radio-telemetry. Mean home range sizes for breeding adult males covered 0.67 km2, ranging between 0.46 and 0.98 km2. We found evidence for Pygmy Owl habitat selection being a consistently hierarchical process, with (1) fir-dominated forests selected as the main habitat at the population level; (2) old-growth fir-dominated forest stands including edges with grassland gaps and karstic eroded areas selected at the home range level; and (3) amount of surrounding dead or decaying spruces increasing the occurrence probability of owl nesting cavities. Conserving Pygmy Owls at their low latitude range limit therefore requires the maintenance of old-growth mixed forests dominated by firs that provide these critical habitat features within a complex and heterogeneous landscape mosaic. © Dt.

ABSTRACT: The correlation between meteorological data collected at the optical wide-field patrol network (OWL-Net) Station No. 1 and the seeing of satellite optical observation data was analyzed. Meteorological data and satellite optical observation data from June 2014 to November 2015 were analyzed. The analyzed meteorological data were the outdoor air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and cloud index data, and the analyzed satellite optical observation data were the seeing full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) data. The annual meteorological pattern for Mongolia was analyzed by collecting meteorological data over four seasons, with data collection beginning after the installation and initial set-up of the OWL-Net Station No. 1 in Mongolia. A comparison of the meteorological data and the seeing of the satellite optical observation data showed that the seeing degrades as the wind strength increases and as the cloud cover decreases. This finding is explained by the bias effect, which is caused by the fact that the number of images taken on the less cloudy days was relatively small. The seeing FWHM showed no clear correlation with either temperature or relative humidity. © 2016, The Korean Space Science Society.

ABSTRACT: Among many anthropogenic drivers of population decline, continual rapid urbanization and industrialization pose major challenges for the survival of wildlife species. Barn owls (Tyto alba) in southwestern British Columbia (BC) face a multitude of threats ranging from habitat fragmentation to vehicle strikes. They are also at risk from secondary poisoning of second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides (SGARs), a suite of toxic compounds which at high doses results in a depletion of blood clotting factors leading to internal bleeding and death. Here, using long-term data (N = 119) for the hepatic residue levels of SGAR, we assessed the risk of toxicosis from SGAR for the BC barn owl population over the past two decades. We also investigated whether sensitivity to SGAR is associated with genetic factors, namely Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) found in the CYP2C45 gene of barn owls. We found that residue concentration for total SGAR was significantly higher in 2006–2013 (141 ng/g) relative to 1992–2003 (57 ng/g). The proportion of owls exposed to multiple SGAR types was also significantly higher in 2006–2013. Those measures accordingly translate directly into an increase in toxicosis risk level. We also detected demographic differences, where adult females showed on average lower concentration of total SGAR (64 ng/g) when compared to adult males (106 ng/g). Juveniles were overall more likely to show signs of toxicosis than adults (33.3 and 6.9 %, respectively), and those symptoms were positively predicted by SGAR concentrations. We found no evidence that SNPs in the CYP2C45 gene of barn owls were associated with intraspecific variation in SGAR sensitivity. We recommend several preventative measures be taken to minimize wildlife exposure to SGAR. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: Nesting Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia) in the Cerrado of northeastern Paraguay were observed to show increased vigilance in response to Curl-crested Jay (Cyanocorax cristatellus) calls. To test whether this reaction was species specific, a playback experiment was conducted using jay calls, a native passerine and three exotic passerines, and responses of the owls to the recordings were measured. The results indicated that the owls responded with increased vigilance only to calls of the Curl-crested Jay. It is hypothesized that the interaction between the two species may be related to competition for dietary resources initiating a greater aggressive response in the diurnal jay due to its more limited foraging time, compared to the nocturnal and diurnal owls. The vigilant response of the owls may thus be related to avoidance of potentially costly aggressive interactions with jays. © 2016, Sociedade Brasileira de Ornitologia. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The population of Little Owls in Denmark is close to extinction. The main cause is food limitation during the breeding season. Efforts to improve breeding success include providing breeding pairs with supplementary food and attempts to improve foraging habitats by creating short grass areas near the nests. In addition to increasing the reproductive output, feeding and habitat management may cause parents to work less hard improving their future reproductive value. We studied working efforts of five radio-tagged Little Owl pairs in years of absence and presence of food provisioning, and/or access to short sward vegetation areas near to the nest. We quantified movement as the minimum flight distance hour-1 (MFD), using the mean distance from the nest (DN) as a supplementary index. Under unmanipulated conditions, males had higher MFD and DN than females. If provided with food and/or areas with short sward vegetation, males but not females reduced their MFD and DN significantly. If MFD was adjusted for DN (the two measures correlated positively), both sexes reduced their DN-adjusted MFD as response to food provisioning but not to habitat provisioning. Food provisioning therefore had similar proximate effects on the foraging effort of males and females, whereas provisioning of short sward habitats had an indirect effect on male but not female MFD, because of decreased commuting distances between nest and foraging sites. The results indicate that food provisioning not only leads to increased reproductive output in an endangered raptor, but also to decreased working effort, which in turn may improve adult survival.

ABSTRACT: Federally listed as threatened in 1990 primarily because of habitat loss, the northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) has continued to decline despite conservation efforts resulting in forested habitat being reserved throughout its range. Recently, there is growing evidence the congeneric invasive barred owl (Strix varia) may be responsible for the continued decline primarily by excluding spotted owls from their preferred habitat. We used a long-term demographic study for spotted owls in coastal northern California as the basis for a pilot barred owl removal experiment. Our demography study used capture-recapture, reproductive output, and territory occupancy data collected from 1990 to 2013 to evaluate trends in vital rates and populations. We used a classic before-after-control-impact (BACI) experimental design to investigate the demographic response of northern spotted owls to the lethal removal of barred owls. According to the best 2-species dynamic occupancy model, there was no evidence of differences in barred or northern spotted owl occupancy prior to the initiation of the treatment (barred owl removal). After treatment, barred owl occupancy was lower in the treated relative to the untreated areas and spotted owl occupancy was higher relative to the untreated areas. Barred owl removal decreased spotted owl territory extinction rates but did not affect territory colonization rates. As a result, spotted owl occupancy increased in the treated area and continued to decline in the untreated areas. Prior to and after barred owl removal, there was no evidence that average fecundity differed on the 2 study areas. However, the greater number of occupied spotted owl sites on the treated areas resulted in greater productivity in the treated areas based on empirical counts of fledged young. Prior to removal, survival was declining at a rate of approximately 0.2% per year for treated and untreated areas. Following treatment, estimated survival was 0.859 for the treated areas and 0.822 for the untreated areas. Derived estimates of population change on both study areas showed the same general decline before removal with an estimated slope of -0.0036 per year. Following removal, the rate of population change on the treated areas increased to an average of 1.029 but decreased to an average of 0.870 on the untreated areas. The results from this first experiment demonstrated that lethal removal of barred owls allowed the recovery of northern spotted owl populations in the treated portions of our study area. If additional federally funded barred owl removal experiments provide similar results, this could be the foundation for development of a long-term conservation strategy for northern spotted owls. © 2016 The Wildlife Society.

ABSTRACT: The barn owl (Tyto alba) is a non-migratory species widely distributed across much of North America in areas with extensive old-field and grassland habitat and without extensive winter snow cover. We investigated the genetic diversity and phylogeographic patterns of barn owl populations in western North America, ranging from British Columbia (BC) to southern California, and one eastern population from Pennsylvania. We also determined the genetic distinctiveness of a population off the coast of southern California, Santa Barbara Island, as management plans to control the local owl population are being considered to decrease predation rate on the now threatened Scripps’s Murrelet (Synthliboramphus scrippsi). Using 8 polymorphic microsatellite markers (N = 126) and ND2 mitochondrial sequences (N = 37), we found little to no genetic structure among all sampled regions, with the exception of Santa Barbara Island. The BC mainland population, despite its northwestern geographically peripheral location and ongoing habitat degradation, is not genetically depauperate. However, individuals from Vancouver Island, likewise a peripheral population in BC, exhibited the lowest genetic diversity of all sampled locations. The low global FST value (0.028) estimated from our study suggests that old-field agricultural habitats are well connected in North America. Since the BC population has declined by about 50 % within the last three decades, it is vital to focus on preserving the remaining barn owl habitats in BC to allow successful establishment from neighbouring populations. Additionally, our microsatellite data revealed that the population on Santa Barbara Island showed genetic divergence from its continental counterpart. Mitochondrial data, however, demonstrated that this island population is not a monophyletic lineage containing unique haplotypes, and hence cannot be designated as an Evolutionarily Significant Unit. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

ABSTRACT: Background: Corynebacterium ulcerans is a pathogen causing diphtheria-like illness to humans. In contrast to diphtheria by Corynebacterium diphtheriae circulating mostly among humans, C. ulcerans infection is zoonotic. The present study aimed to clarify how a zoonotic pathogen C. ulcerans circulates among wild birds and animals. Results: By screening 380 birds, a single strain of toxigenic C. ulcerans was isolated from a carnivorous bird, ural owl (Strix uralensis). The bacterium was also isolated from two individuals of Japanese shrew-mole (Urotrichus talpoides), a food preference of the owl. Analysis by ribotyping showed that the owl and mole isolates were classified in a group, suggesting that C. ulcerans can be transmissible among wild birds and their prey animals. Moreover, our isolates were found to belong to a group of previously reported C. ulcerans isolates from dogs and a cat, which are known to serve as sources for human infection. Conclusion: The findings suggest that the shrew-mole may be a potential reservoir of a zoonotic pathogen C. ulcerans. © 2016 Katsukawa et al.

ABSTRACT: Features of the breeding population and temporary settlement area influence the behaviour of Eagle Owls Bubo bubo prospecting for breeding sites during natal dispersal.Aims To understand how prospecting behaviour during natal dispersal is affected by (i) the main characteristics of the breeding and dispersing portions of the population and (ii) main prey availability.Methods We explored the ten-year dynamics and characteristics of radio-tagged breeders and dispersers of an Eagle Owl population. Results During the first years following natal dispersal there was little prospecting behaviour of nesting sites and birds remained mainly within non-breeding settlement areas, bordering the sector occupied by the breeding population. Settlement areas had an abundant food supply, and low intraspecific competition and mortality. We suggest that these features of the settlement areas may reduce the willingness of individuals to search for breeding sites and may have the potential to impact on the viability of breeding populations.Conclusion From a conservation perspective, the lengthy use of the temporary settlement areas by juvenile Eagle Owls suggests that the sites should be considered as important as the breeding areas when planning conservation strategies. Reducing juvenile mortality in settlement areas may represent an overlooked conservation strategy for long-lived species and may have a crucial effect on the viability some animal populations. © 2016 British Trust for Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: We explored the possibility of employing intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), involving oocytes and sperm of owl monkeys, to increase the availability of this species for investigations relating to malaria, etc., by increasing the number of animals in our laboratory. Methods: Two owl monkeys (a female and a male), raised at the Amami Laboratory of the University of Tokyo, were used. Follicular oocytes surrounded with cumulus cells were cultured in vitro for approximately 25 h and cumulus cells were removed with 0.1 % hyaluronidase. Because of the poor motility of caudal epididymal sperm, sperm were injected without adding polyvinylpyrrolidone to immobilize them. The ICSI procedure was performed by an individual with considerable experience of human ICSI. Results: We were able to produce two owl monkey embryos using ICSI of oocytes that matured to MII stage. Both embryos reached the 10-cell stage at 98 h after ICSI and showed signs of compaction, but failed to cleave further. Conclusions: Although we successfully produced owl monkey embryos after ICSI, the embryos did not develop to the blastocyst stage. Many parameters need to be studied further, including superovulation, selection of culture media, and selection of good quality sperm in order to achieve successful ICSI in the owl monkey. © 2015, Japan Society for Reproductive Medicine.

ABSTRACT: In this paper, the complete mitochondrial genome of an Endangered Ninox strenua is sequenced and reported for the first time. The mitogenome of N. strenua is a circular molecule of 16,206 bp in length, consisting of 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 tRNA, 2 rRNA, and a control region (D-loop). All the genes in N. strenua are distributed on the H-strand, except for the ND6 subunit gene and eight tRNA genes, which are encoded on the L-strand. Phylogenetic analysis using an available mitogenome of Strigidae family revealed a close evolutionary relationship of N. strenua with N. novaeseelandiae, a Tasmanian spotted owl found throughout the Australasia. © 2016 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: ABSTRACT: Capsule: Playback is effective at improving detectability of Little Owls. Aims: To trial a playback survey methodology for Little Owls in the UK to determine detectability and practicalities which could inform potential future national monitoring efforts. Methods: Nocturnal playback surveys were carried out in an open landscape in the east of England in spring 2015. Twelve 2 × 2 km survey squares were each visited four times. Little Owl calls were broadcast from three locations within each square along a linear transect and spaced 500 m apart. The responses of owls of any species were recorded. Little Owl occupancy was later confirmed through existing nest monitoring efforts. Results: Little Owls were detected responding to playback in all survey squares and were confirmed to be breeding in 8 of the 12. Detection and response rates were greater when combining data from multiple broadcast locations. The likelihood of Little Owls responding decreased with greater distance of broadcast location to known nest site, but no relationships were identified with time of evening or the presence of other owl species. Conclusion: Playback methodology proved to be effective at increasing detectability of Little Owls and this study provides an estimated response rate to inform future efforts. © 2016 British Trust for Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: On agricultural landscapes of the Altai region the Strigidae are represented by 9 species. By distribution they may be divided into three groups: Migratory - 3 types (long-eared owl, short-eared owl, and scopsowl); Breeding and wintering in nesting areas - 5 species (eagle-owl, Ural owl, Great gray owl, pygmy owl, boreal owl); and Migratory and wintering, but not nesting - 1 species (snowy owl). The populations of most species are characterized by uneven spatial distribution of nesting areas, which is associated with significant anthropogenic transformation of the territory and the gravity of many species to unplowed areas. Three owl species under special protection listed in the Red Books of different levels are nesting in the study area. These are the eagle-owl, great grey owl, and pygmy owl. The eagle-owl population is still in relatively good condition. The populations of great grey owl and pygmy owl need further detailed study. The most significant limiting human-induced factors for owl populations in the Altai region are the death on birdsdangerous lines, selective logging, and dependence on cattle, agricultural ground fires, and commercial development of placer gold mine in the river and streams valleys. © EM International.

ABSTRACT: The breeding success of raptors is strongly affected by food supply. We examined the reproductive success of Eurasian Eagle-Owls (Bubo bubo) and assessed the effects of landscape and diet on reproductive success at 44 nest sites in wetland and non-wetland (mostly agricultural lands, forests, and human settlements) habitats in west-central Korea. We found that eagle-owl reproductive success was significantly higher in wetland than in non-wetland habitats (mean of 1.9 vs. 1.3 fledglings per breeding pair, respectively). Although the average number of fledglings per successful pair was similar in the two habitats (2.0 vs. 1.8), the average numbers of fledglings per hatchling (0.9 vs. 0.7) and per egg (0.8 vs. 0.5) were both higher in wetland habitats. Further, for the wetland habitats, birds (mostly Anatidae, Columbidae, and Phasianidae) were the most important prey group by both number and biomass (67% and 84%, respectively) in the breeding period. However, in non-wetland habitats, both mammals (59% by number) and birds (67% by biomass) were important prey in the breeding period. The amount of Phasianidae in the diet (by biomass) and the date of the onset of egg-laying were positively and negatively (respectively) significant determinants of the number of fledglings per egg, whereas the percentage of wetland in the habitat was the only significant determinant for the number of fledglings per hatchling. © 2016 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Background: The western burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia hypugaea) occurs throughout western North America in various habitats such as desert, short-grass prairie and shrub-steppe, among others, where the main threat for this species is habitat loss. Range-wide declines have prompted a need for reliable estimates of its populations in Mexico, where the size of resident and migratory populations remain unknown. Results: Our objective was to estimate the abundance and density of breeding western burrowing owl populations in Mexican prairie dog (Cynomys mexicanus) colonies in two sites located within the Chihuahuan Desert ecoregion in the states of Nuevo Leon and San Luis Potosi, Mexico. Line transect surveys were conducted from February to April of 2010 and 2011. Fifty 60 ha transects were analyzed using distance sampling to estimate owl and Mexican prairie dog populations. We estimated a population of 2026 owls (95 % CI 1756-2336) in 2010 and 2015 owls (95 % CI 1573-2317) in 2011 across 50 Mexican prairie dog colonies (20,529 ha). Conclusions: The results represent the first systematic attempt to provide reliable evidence related to the size of the adult owl populations, within the largest and best preserved Mexican prairie dog colonies in Mexico. © 2016 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: This paper reviews the literature on survival estimates for different species of raptors and owls, examines the methods used to obtain the estimates, and draws out some general patterns arising. Estimating survival usually involves the marking of birds so that they can be recognized as individuals on subsequent encounters. Annual survival can then be estimated from: (1) birds ringed at known age (usually as nestlings) and subsequently reported by members of the public (usually as found dead), the ratio of recoveries at different ages being used to calculate annual survival; (2) marked breeding adults, trapped or re-sighted in subsequent years in particular study areas, with the proportion re-trapped (or re-sighted) in each year being taken as the minimum annual survival; (3) live encounter (trapped or re-sighted) of birds marked either as nestlings or breeding adults analysed using the capture-mark-recapture (or re-sighting) methods to estimate annual survival; (4) a combination of reports of known-age dead birds and re-trapping/re-sighting of live birds; (5) use of radio- or satellite-tracking to follow the fates of individuals; and (6) the integration of these methods with other information, such as change in numbers between years, to derive estimates of survival and other demographic parameters. Studies confined to particular areas usually give estimates of 'apparent annual survival', because they take no account of birds that leave the area. However, radio- or satellite-tracking makes it possible to estimate true survival, including survival of prebreeders that have low natal-site fidelity (this usually requires satellite telemetry). As in other birds, the preferred method for estimating survival has changed over time, as new and more robust methods of estimation have been developed. Methods 1 and 2 were the first to be developed, but without statistical underpinning, while methods 3-6 were developed later on the basis of formal statistical models. This difference has to be borne in mind in comparing older with newer estimates for particular species. Published survival estimates were found for three species of Cathartidae, one of Pandionidae, 29 of Accipitridae, 12 of Falconidae, one of Tytonidae and nine of Strigidae, almost all from temperate Northern Hemisphere species. In most of these species more than one estimate was available, and in some separate estimates for different age or sex groups. The main patterns to emerge included: (1) a significant tendency for annual adult survival to increase with body weight, smaller species having annual survival rates mainly of 60-70%, medium-sized species having rates mainly in the range 70-90% and the largest having rates of > 90%, in the absence of obvious human-caused losses; (2) a lower survival in the first or prebreeding years of life than in subsequent years; (3) a lack of obvious or consistent differences in survival between the sexes, where these could be distinguished; and (4) in the few species for which enough data were available, a decline in annual survival rates in the later years of life. © 2016 British Ornithologists' Union.

ABSTRACT: Concentrations of organochlorine pesticides were quantified in samples of feathers (n = 17) and blood (n = 15) of the ferruginous pygmy owl (Glaucidium brasilianum). The individuals were captured near the Protected Natural Area Cerro Sonsonate, Chiapas, Mexico, between February and June 2014. In both tissues, pesticides belonging to seven organochlorine chemical families were detected. However, the organochlorine pesticide concentrations differed between feathers and blood. The highest concentrations of hexachlorocyclohexanes were found in feathers (0.63 ± 0.89 μg/g), whereas the highest concentrations of ΣDrines were found in blood (0.31 ± 0.47 μg/mL). By using the summed concentrations for each of the seven families of pesticides found in feathers, we did not find any significant correlation between the pesticides and pectoral muscle or body weight (p > 0.15). The ΣDDT group was the only pesticide family that showed a positive correlation with owl body weight (r = 0.60, p = 0.05); the concentrations of these pesticides were also high in feather and blood tissues (r = 0.87, p = 0.02). Our results confirm that ferruginous pygmy owls in the study area are exposed to these pesticides. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: The diet of the Short-eared Owl Asio flammeus was analysed in an arid environment in Hassi El Gara located in the southeast of El Golea (Ghardaia, Algeria). The diet was determined by analysing 138 pellets. Our data showed that the diet was dominated by mammals (Chiroptera and Rodentia). Based on relative biomass, birds were the main prey species. Mammals were the second most important prey. Mammals were the major food item throughout the seasons and their contribution to the diet ranged from 50.7% in spring to 73.6% in summer. Birds were the second numerous prey with 8.1% in summer and 29.6% in spring. The dominant prey species was Myotis sp., making up 37.8%. It was followed by Gerbillus nanus (5.4%), Columba livia (4.3%) and Bufo mauritanicus (4.1%). © 2016 Nature Research Centre.

ABSTRACT: We provide the first detailed description of the diet of Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia) for Ecuador, based on an analysis of 408 pellets collected from one locality in the north and one in the south of the central dry Andean Valley. Our results are consistent with previous studies in the Neotropics that document the importance of insects in the diet. Rodents made up 78.8% of the biomass in our sample. Additionally, we highlight the first record of the Andean eared mouse Phyllotis andium in a xeric environment, which was identified in the pellets. © 2016, Sociedade Brasileira de Ornitologia.

ABSTRACT: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are becoming the most utilized markers in population genetics studies. Reduced representation genome techniques, as genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), allow identifying great numbers of polymorphisms that are useful to analyze genetic diversity in non-model organisms. In this investigation, we implemented a GBS protocol and different bioinformatics tools to identify a novel SNP panel and investigate the genetic structure and variability in populations of little owl (Athene noctua) sampled from seven geographical regions in Europe (Balkans, north-west Europe, north, central and south Italy, Spain and Portugal). We obtained a total of 22,185 putative SNPs and 1306 indels. After the filtering procedure, 7175 SNP loci and 53 individuals met the stringent quality control measures. Neutrality test identified 281 candidate loci under positive selection, which were used for population genetic analyses. The selected SNP panel allowed an accurate description of the genetic structure of the little owl. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

ABSTRACT: Raptors are important predators of various species of small mammals, which renders them of economic importance since their prey may be either disease vectors or reservoirs which represent health problems, or economically important through the damage they cause to crops and stocks. The long-tailed rice rat Oligoryzomys longicaudatus is a reservoir and vector of Hantavirus, a disease of increasing importance in various Latin American countries. The nocturnal Barn Owl (Tyto alba) and the diurnal White-tailed Kite (Elanus leucurus) appear to be the most significant predators of this species. Here, we characterize the diet of these two raptors and analyze their trophic specialization and dietary selectivity using published information, pellet analysis, and field abundances of small mammals. Both raptor species positively selected O. longicaudatus in their diets to suggest that they could be potential controllers of the Hantavirus reservoir in Chile, both in natural and agricultural ecosystems. Predation on O. longicaudatus by these two raptors is interesting because they have complementary activity periods, a condition which enables them to share the same prey without having strong interference. © 2016 The Wilson Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: The hunting of small game in the Upper Palaeolithic is a practice that hides a still underestimated complexity. This article provides an overview of the exploitation of a fast-moving, low-turnover small game: the snowy owl in the Magdalenian. This overview is based on the existing literature as well as unpublished taphonomic and zooarchaeological data. The data are unevenly distributed over the cultural territory of the Magdalenian, being concentrated in the Aquitaine Basin and its vicinity. Greater local availability on the wintering ground and contexts in which the bones have been well preserved could explain this distribution. Between 21 and 14 ka cal BP, the hunting of the snowy owl appears to have been a discontinuous phenomenon, no reliable data currently existing for the late Middle Magdalenian (18–16 ka cal BP). In both the Lower and Upper Magdalenian, the carcasses have undergone thorough treatment. A variety of products were sought—meat, long bones, phalanges, claws and feathers—relating to different spheres of hunter–gatherer activity. Only a technique for segmenting the bones by sawing appears specific to the Upper Magdalenian. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA

ABSTRACT: Winter diet of long eared owls in a communal roost was studied by pellet analysis containing 3,151 prey specimens. Rodents formed the majority of the food (97.0% N, 97.2% B; N = number, B = biomass), while shrews, birds and beetles constituted a negligible portion of the diet (3.0% N, 2.8% B). The staple prey consisted of inhabitants of mainly open areas like voles Microtus spp. (45.6% N, 50.8% B) and mice Apodemus spp. (20.2% N, 22.2% B) and Mus spicilegus (11.5% N, 8.2% B). The proportion pattern of the preyed taxa in pellets reflected the dominant position of the prey in the diet in combination with habitat preferences of the hunted species according to the results of principal component analysis. More frequent catch on forest and bush birds at the expense of urban birds including sparrows Passer spp. distinguished significantly the present diet from the other Bulgarian long eared owl diets. © 2016 Institute of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Research - BAS.

ABSTRACT: Biodiversity ecosystem services in agroecosystems are negatively affected by farmland homogenisation due to intensive agriculture. The Pampas, an important worldwide region producing commodity crops, have been greatly homogenised with the expansion no-tillage and herbicide-tolerant transgenic soybeans since the 1990s. Here, we tested the hypothesis of that dietary changes in barn owls will be associated with the loss of semi-natural habitats derived from farming intensification. We characterised the dietary habits of western barn owls by analysing their pellets between two sampling periods (2004-2005 and 2010-2012). We also assessed the habitat loss due to cropping intensification through fencerow removal and pasture conversion to annual crops during the same period. We observed that barn owls shifted from eating mostly rodents in the first sampling period to eating a higher proportion of anurans in the second sampling period. Between sampling, rodent proportion in pellets decreased from 80% to 61.6%, while anuran proportion increased from 20% to 37.7%. A rapid farming intensification occurred on the farm between both sampling periods. Pastures were ploughed to grow annual crops. Thus, the annually cropped area increased by 60% from 2004 to 2012, while the area with pastures was reduced in about 80%. During the same period, nearly two-thirds of fences on the farm were removed to enlarge the cropped area. Our findings suggest that dietary habits of barn owls may shift to consume more anurans when rodent availability declines in association with the loss of semi-natural habitats, which resulted from rapid farming intensification on the studied farm. We suggest monitoring the population size and diet of barn owls for evaluating environmental changes produced in agroecosystems by farming intensification, as well as the adaptive responses of different rodent and anuran species to such changes. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Worldwide, small rodents are main prey items for many mammalian and avian predators. Some rodent species have pest potential and are managed with anticoagulant rodenticides (ARs). ARs are consumed by target and non-target small mammals and can lead to secondary exposure of predators. The development of appropriate risk mitigation strategies is important and requires detailed knowledge of AR residue pathways. From July 2011 to October 2013 we collected 2397 regurgitated barn owl (Tyto alba) pellets to analyze diet composition of owls on livestock farms in western Germany. 256 of them were fresh pellets that were collected during brodifacoum baiting. Fresh pellets and 742 liver samples of small mammals that were trapped during baiting in the same area were analyzed for residues of ARs. We calculated exposure risk of barn owls to ARs by comparing seasonal diet composition of owls with AR residue patterns in prey species. Risk was highest in autumn, when barn owls increasingly preyed on Apodemus that regularly showed AR residues, sometimes at high concentrations. The major prey species (Microtus spp.) that was consumed most frequently in summer had less potential to contribute to secondary poisoning of owls. There was no effect of AR application on prey composition. We rarely detected ARs in pellets (2 of 256 samples) but 13% of 38 prey individuals in barn owl nests were AR positive and substantiated the expected pathway. AR residues were present in 55% of 11 barn owl carcasses. Fluctuation in non-target small mammal abundance and differences in AR residue exposure patterns in prey species drives exposure risk for barn owls and probably other predators of small mammals. Exposure risk could be minimized through spatial and temporal adaption of AR applications (avoiding long baiting and non-target hot spots at farms) and through selective bait access for target animals. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..

ABSTRACT: Mobbing is an anti-predator strategy in which prey animals, notably birds and mammals, aggravate a potential predator to either distract or drive them from the vicinity. The Powerful Owl Ninox strenua is a large forest owl endemic to eastern Australia that preys mainly on arboreal mammals and birds. We identified records of 30 species of birds and one mammal known to mob the Powerful Owl from scientific literature and unpublished studies. In our study in southern Sydney, Powerful Owls were most frequently mobbed by Noisy Miners Manorina melanocephala and Pied Currawongs Strepera graculina, followed by Grey Butcherbirds Cracticus torquatus and Australian Magpies Cracticus tibicen.We observed mobbing by three species of bird and one mammal that were not previously recorded as mobbing species, including agonistic responses by a Tawny Frogmouth Podargus strigoides and Common Brushtail Possum Trichosurus vulpecula during the time owls were active.

ABSTRACT: This report is the first characterization of the histology and ultrastructure of the barred owl conjunctiva. The inferior eyelid was dominated by a large disk-shaped plate covered by a non-keratinized stratified squamous or cuboidal epithelium of variable thickness. The apical surface of the plate epithelium varied from flat to long microvilli or even short cytoplasmic extensions similar to those seen in the third eyelid. All specimens had a few goblet cells filled with mucous secretory granules in the plate region. The underlying connective tissue was a dense fibroelastic stroma. Eosinophils were surprisingly common in the epithelial layer and underlying connective tissue in the plate and more distal orbital mucosal region. The orbital mucosa contained goblet cells with heterogeneous glycosylation patterns. The leading edge and marginal plait of the third eyelid are designed to collect fluid and particulate matter as they sweep across the surface of the eye. The palpebral conjunctival surface of the third eyelid was covered by an approximately five-cell-deep stratified squamous epithelium without goblet cells. The bulbar surface of the third eyelid was a bilayer of epithelial cells whose superficial cells have elaborate cytoplasmic tapering extensions reaching out 25 um. Narrow cytofilia radiated outwards up to an additional 15-20 um from the cytoplasmic extensions. Lectin labeling demonstrated heterogeneous glycosylation of the apical membrane specializations but only small amounts of glycoprotein-filled secretory granules in the third eyelid. © 2015 Jochems, Phillips.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.

ABSTRACT: The oxytocin (OT) hormone pathway is involved in numerous physiological processes, and one of its receptor genes (. OXTR) has been implicated in pair bonding behavior in mammalian lineages. This observation is important for understanding social monogamy in primates, which occurs in only a small subset of taxa, including Azara's owl monkey (. Aotus azarae). To examine the potential relationship between social monogamy and OXTR variation, we sequenced its 5' regulatory (4936. bp) and coding (1167. bp) regions in 25 owl monkeys from the Argentinean Gran Chaco, and examined OXTR sequences from 1092 humans from the 1000 Genomes Project. We also assessed interspecific variation of OXTR in 25 primate and rodent species that represent a set of phylogenetically and behaviorally disparate taxa. Our analysis revealed substantial variation in the putative 5' regulatory region of OXTR, with marked structural differences across primate taxa, particularly for humans and chimpanzees, which exhibited unique patterns of large motifs of dinucleotide A. +. T repeats upstream of the OXTR 5' UTR. In addition, we observed a large number of amino acid substitutions in the OXTR CDS region among New World primate taxa that distinguish them from Old World primates. Furthermore, primate taxa traditionally defined as socially monogamous (e.g., gibbons, owl monkeys, titi monkeys, and saki monkeys) all exhibited different amino acid motifs for their respective OXTR protein coding sequences. These findings support the notion that monogamy has evolved independently in Old World and New World primates, and that it has done so through different molecular mechanisms, not exclusively through the oxytocin pathway. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Studying the geographic variation of phenotypic traits can provide key information about the potential adaptive function of alternative phenotypes. Gloger's rule posits that animals should be dark-vs. light-colored in warm and humid vs. cold and dry habitats, respectively. The rule is based on the assumption that melanin pigments and/or dark coloration confer selective advantages in warm and humid regions. This rule may not apply, however, if genes for color are acting on other traits conferring fitness benefits in specific climes. Covariation between coloration and climate will therefore depend on the relative importance of coloration or melanin pigments and the genetically correlated physiological and behavioral processes that enable an animal to deal with climatic factors. The Barn Owl (Tyto alba) displays three melanin-based plumage traits, and we tested whether geographic variation in these traits at the scale of the North American continent supported Gloger's rule. An analysis of variation of pheomelanin-based reddish coloration and of the number and size of black feather spots in 1,369 museum skin specimens showed that geographic variation was correlated with ambient temperature and precipitation. Owls were darker red in color and displayed larger but fewer black feather spots in colder regions. Owls also exhibited more and larger black spots in regions where the climate was dry in winter. We propose that the associations between pigmentation and ambient temperature are of opposite sign for reddish coloration and spot size vs. the number of spots because selection exerted by climate (or a correlated variable) is plumage trait-specific or because plumage traits are genetically correlated with different adaptations. © 2015 American Ornithologists' Union.

ABSTRACT: Axons from the nucleus magnocellularis form a presynaptic map of interaural time differences (ITDs) in the nucleus laminaris (NL). These inputs generate a field potential that varies systematically with recording position and can be used to measure the map of ITDs. In the barn owl, the representation of best ITD shifts with mediolateral position in NL, so as to form continuous, smoothly overlapping maps of ITD with iso-ITD contours that are not parallel to the NL border. Frontal space (0°) is, however, represented throughout and thus overrepresented with respect to the periphery. Measurements of presynaptic conduction delay, combined with a model of delay line conduction velocity, reveal that conduction delays can account for the mediolateral shifts in the map of ITD. © 2015 the American Physiological Society.

ABSTRACT: Competitive interactions with Barred Owls (Strix varia) are an important factor contributing to the decline of the Northern Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) population. Understanding the degree of similarity in fine-scale habitat associations for Spotted Owls and Barred Owls will help land managers evaluate whether there are specific vegetation conditions that could favor Spotted Owls over Barred Owls. From March 2004 to September 2006, I tracked 14 radio-tagged Barred Owls in the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest in the eastern Cascade Range, Washington. I analyzed forest structure characteristics from 170 plots sampled within areas used by the radio-tagged owls. I identified three forest types present within the Barred Owl home ranges, including: (1) open ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), (2) simple-structure Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), and (3) complex-structure grand fir (Abies grandis). I compared individual forest structure characteristics and the three forest types to the intensity of Barred Owl use based on repeated measures of seasonal utilization distribution values at each plot using hierarchical mixed-effects models. Intensity of Barred Owl use during the breeding season was higher in areas with greater abundance of grand fir trees, taller and more diverse tree heights, more total trees per ha, more trees 12.7-22.9 cm dbh, more tree canopy >4.9 m, and less ground-cover vegetation <0.6 m. During the nonbreeding season, intensity of Barred Owl use was higher in areas with more trees 12.7-22.9 cm dbh, more total trees per ha, gentle slopes, and increased tree species diversity. Barred Owls used the structurally diverse grand fir forest type more intensively than the other two types during the breeding season. Intensity of use did not differ across the types during the nonbreeding season. Forest structure characteristics used by Barred Owls in this study were within the range of conditions reported to be used by Spotted Owls in the eastern Cascade Range. © 2015 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: As part of the economic and population growth of Patagonia, several dust/gravel roads crossing well preserved Andean forests are being converted into paved highways. The potential effects of these changes on forest wildlife have been little studied. The Rufous-legged Owl (Strix rufipes) was dominant among road-killed birds in our survey of a 27-km section of highway running through forests of Nahuel Huapi National Park, in Argentine Patagonia. Fatalities were not evenly distributed along the surveyed length of the road, so we investigated whether landscape features, roadside slope on both sides of the highway, demography, and/or season explained the aggregation pattern. Patterns of distribution of the road-killed owls were explained by owl abundance and age-class, time of year, and hour, and were weakly related to canopy closure; roadside slope on both sides was unrelated to abundance of fatalities. Traffic-related deaths were likely the primary cause of non-natural mortality of Rufous-legged Owls (especially for young individuals) in the study area. Examination of carcasses indicated that most owls were killed by turbulence behind large vehicles and that deaths occurred early in the night. Semitrailer trucks capable of carrying large loads, which peak in numbers between dusk and midnight, likely caused most fatalities. A way to reduce owl mortality could be to schedule truck traffic outside the hours when owls are most active at hunting around paved roads crossing natural forests, at least during late winter and spring seasons. Because transportation networks encourage future development that will affect the environment in a variety of ways, it is critical to retain roadless and near-roadless (i.e., having only dirt or gravel roads with slow-moving traffic) portions of the southern Andes to preserve their natural landscapes. © 2015 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: This study of the diet of Barn Owl Tyto alba analyzed pellets containing 18,810 prey specimens. Small mammals (98.2% by number, 97.5% by biomass) dominated, while birds, reptiles, amphibians, and insects constituted a negligible portion of the diet (1.8% by number, 2.5% by biomass). Voles (Microtus spp.) were the most numerous prey (35.3 ± 14.4%, range 14.6%–67.1%) in 9 localities (69.2%, n = 13 individually studied localities) and dominated the biomass in all diets (51.4 ± 14.1%, range 27.4%–78.2%). The lesser white-toothed shrew (Crocidura suaveolens) (20.8 ± 7.6%, range 7.3%–32.8%) was the most frequent prey in the other 4 localities (30.8%). The breeding localities with more similar proportions of habitats in their hunting territories had significantly higher diet overlaps (r = 0.336, P < 0.01). The amount of wetlands and the indices of habitat heterogeneity and topographic relief among the landscape characteristics of the hunting territories significantly influenced diet composition according to redundancy analysis. Larger areas of wetlands correlated with higher predation on wetland mammal species, as well as the European pine vole (Microtus subterraneus) and white-toothed shrews, and thus with broader food niche breadth. © TÜBİTAK.

ABSTRACT: Human activities can have a suite of positive and negative effects on animals and thus can affect various life history parameters. Human presence and agricultural practice can be perceived as stressors to which animals react with the secretion of glucocorticoids. The acute short-term secretion of glucocorticoids is considered beneficial and helps an animal to redirect energy and behaviour to cope with a critical situation. However, a long-term increase of glucocorticoids can impair e.g. growth and immune functions. We investigated how nestling barn owls (Tyto alba) are affected by the surrounding landscape and by human activities around their nest sites. We studied these effects on two response levels: (a) the physiological level of the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis, represented by baseline concentrations of corticosterone and the concentration attained by a standardized stressor; (b) fitness parameters: growth of the nestlings and breeding performance. Nestlings growing up in intensively cultivated areas showed increased baseline corticosterone levels late in the season and had an increased corticosterone release after a stressful event, while their body mass was decreased. Nestlings experiencing frequent anthropogenic disturbance had elevated baseline corticosterone levels, an increased corticosterone stress response and a lower body mass. Finally, breeding performance was better in structurally more diverse landscapes. In conclusion, anthropogenic disturbance affects offspring quality rather than quantity, whereas agricultural practices affect both life history traits. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Nocturnal species are challenging to monitor, but with advances in bioacoustic technology, acoustic monitoring is becoming a more affordable, efficient technique for monitoring cryptic species. We tested the suitability of acoustic monitoring as a potential national monitoring method for morepork/rūrū (Ninox novaeseelandiae), in beech forest within the Eglinton Valley, Fiordland, during spring 2009–2010. We used radio telemetry and an acoustic call study to address two questions to help managers make evidence-based decisions on the spacing of acoustic call count stations: (1) What are the sex-specific and seasonal home-range sizes of rūrū? (2) How does acoustic detection decrease with increasing distance? Home ranges were the largest recorded to date for rūrū in New Zealand (mean 100% MCP = 307 ha, mean 75% kernel = 43.5 ha) with an average range spread of 270 m (75% kernel). Significant attenuation of recorded calls occurred after 150 m in southern beech (Nothofagaceae) forest and no calls could be detected by the recorders beyond 250 m. Acoustic monitoring is a promising technique to monitor rūrū nationally, but the spacing of stations needs to vary depending on home-range, habitat and the microphones used in the acoustic detectors. © New Zealand Ecological Society.

ABSTRACT: We report the alignment and shape of dark matter, stellar, and hot gas distributions in the EAGLE (Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments) and cosmo-OWLS(Over- Whelmingly Large Simulations) simulations. The combination of these state-of-the-art hydrodynamical cosmological simulations enables us to span four orders of magnitude in halo mass (11 ≤ log10(M200/[h-1M⊙]) ≤ 15), a wide radial range (-2.3 ≤ log10(r/[h-1 Mpc]) ≤ 1.3) and redshifts 0 ≤ z ≤ 1. The shape parameters of the dark matter, stellar and hot gas distributions follow qualitatively similar trends: they become more aspherical (and triaxial) with increasing halo mass, radius, and redshift. We measure the misalignment of the baryonic components (hot gas and stars) of galaxies with their host halo as a function of halo mass, radius, redshift, and galaxy type (centrals versus satellites and early- versus late-type). Overall, galaxies align well with the local distribution of the total (mostly dark) matter. However, the stellar distributions on galactic scales exhibit a median misalignment of about 45-50 deg with respect to their host haloes. This misalignment is reduced to 25-30 deg in the most massive haloes (13 ≤ log10(M200/[h-1M⊙]) ≤ 15). Half of the disc galaxies in the EAGLE simulations have a misalignment angle with respect to their host haloes larger than 40 deg. We present fitting functions and tabulated values for the probability distribution of galaxy-halo misalignment to enable a straightforward inclusion of our results into models of galaxy formations based on purely collisionless N-body simulations. © 2015 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Capturing nature’s statistical structure in behavioral responses is at the core of the ability to function adaptively in the environment. Bayesian statistical inference describes how sensory and prior information can be combined optimally to guide behavior. An outstanding open question of how neural coding supports Bayesian inference includes how sensory cues are optimally integrated over time. Here we address what neural response properties allow a neural system to perform Bayesian prediction, i.e., predicting where a source will be in the near future given sensory information and prior assumptions. The work here shows that the population vector decoder will perform Bayesian prediction when the receptive fields of the neurons encode the target dynamics with shifting receptive fields. We test the model using the system that underlies sound localization in barn owls. Neurons in the owl’s midbrain show shifting receptive fields for moving sources that are consistent with the predictions of the model. We predict that neural populations can be specialized to represent the statistics of dynamic stimuli to allow for a vector read-out of Bayes-optimal predictions. © 2015 Cox, Fischer.

ABSTRACT: Pellets of raptors are an important source for the study of the taxonomy, phylogeography and ecological diversity of small vertebrates. Since birds of prey are efficient collecting agents for both rare species and those reluctant to enter traps, they offer an important complement to traditional trapping efforts in the field. The possibility of using bones and teeth recovered from pellets as a convenient alternative DNA source for genetic studies requires a more complete understanding of the DNA preservation of these partially digested remains. It is not yet clear, for example, to which degree DNA is preserved and how heterogeneous DNA preservation is in the different skeletal remains found in pellets since systematic quantitative analyses are missing. Here, we attempt to improve this knowledge by quantifying the degradation of DNA during the digestion process of raptors using 62 individual rodent bones and teeth from different pellets. We show a very high variability in DNA preservation between bones. Interestingly, variability between bones within the same pellet is much higher than that found between pellets, which has major consequences for genetic studies as it implies that bones from the same pellet that could belong to different individuals/species should be tested individually when multiple markers are analyzed. We find that neither the identity of the skeletal part nor microscopic observation of the degree of digestion are useful proxies for DNA preservation, and we thus recommend the use of screening strategies to identify the most suitable bones to include in analyses. We conclude that pellets of owls, whether freshly collected or from natural history collections, can be a practical noninvasive source for genetic studies of small vertebrates provided the design of the study takes into account the short DNA molecule length, the low quantity of DNA preserved and the heterogeneity in DNA preservation. © 2016 The Zoological Society of London.

ABSTRACT: The mapping of spatial inundation patterns during flood events is important for environmental management and disaster monitoring. Remote sensing technologies provide an affordable means of capturing flood extent with reasonable spatial and temporal coverage for flood monitoring. However, it is often difficult to provide an independent validation of the mapping algorithms with other remote sensing data since they can have similar issues. Hydrodynamic (HD) modelling tools are widely used for floodplain inundation modelling to a high accuracy, but they are resource intensive, making them impractical to use for large catchments. This paper looks at improving the mapping of flood events based on the daily MODIS Open Water Likelihood (OWL) algorithm (which provides the fraction of water within a pixel) by using information from HD modelling. It compares the MODIS OWL water fraction maps (500 m pixel size) with Landsat water maps (30 m pixel size) as well as those derived from two-dimensional HD modelling (at 150 m pixel size) to determine the best water fraction threshold at which a MODIS OWL pixel is identified as flooded. Comparison with Landsat water maps shows the best MODIS OWL water fraction threshold to vary depending on the spatial distribution of water. When compared to the HD model for water fraction thresholds of 0.1 (or 10 %) and below, our results show that values of 0.05–0.1 (or 5–10 %) were best. The overall cell-to-cell match is better when the 0.1 water fraction threshold is used; however, the total number of flooded pixels better matches with the 0.05 water fraction threshold. This study has shown that the simulated floods from calibrated two-dimensional HD models can be used to reduce the uncertainty in selecting a water fraction threshold in MODIS OWL images for producing regional-scale maps of flood events. The daily MODIS water maps (of 0.1 water fraction) were used to produce catchment-wide annual flood maps showing the maximum number of days that each pixel is inundated. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

ABSTRACT: The EU Habitats Directive prescribes the monitoring of several small mammals on a national scale. A cost-effective way of monitoring these species is by using owl pellet data. Unfortunately, owl pellet data suffer from several methodological difficulties, all associated with the imperfect detection of the presence of prey species. Occupancy models can overcome the difficulties by taking detection into account, but they require temporal replicates. To supply these, we created replicates by splitting each pellet batch into two equal parts. A pellet batch consists of a number of pellets collected together in the field.Here we show how occupancy models can be applied to derive trend estimates from owl pellet data using such half batches as temporal replicates. We justify this approach by showing that the results from occupancy models treating half batches as temporal replicates in a test dataset were similar to the results of treating individual pellets as temporal replicates.The owl species and the number of prey individuals examined were included in the occupancy model applied to all data. We studied eleven small mammal species, two of which showed positive trends in occupancy. The confidence intervals of the trend estimates were satisfactorily small. Our methodological innovations reinforce the usefulness of pellet data for trend estimation in small mammals and increase the feasibility of large-scale monitoring of such species under the Habitats Directive. © 2015 Deutsche Gesellschaft für Süugetierkunde.

ABSTRACT: The endemic Cyprus Scops Owl Otus (scops) cyprius has been treated as a subspecies of the widespread Eurasian Scops Owl O. scops since at least the 1940s. However, its song is distinct from that of all other subspecies of O. scops in being double-noted, rather than single-noted. Its plumage also differs, most obviously in being consistently darker than other subspecies and in lacking a rufous morph. However, it shows no biometric differences from O. s. cycladum and southern populations of O. s. scops. It is also unusual among scops (s. l.) populations in being at least partially resident, although two specimens showing characters of this taxon were collected in Israel in early spring, and the numbers of birds that are resident on Cyprus appear to vary, with few recent winter records. It differs from O. s. scops by one synapomorphic nu-cleotide exchange in the analysed mitochondrial marker, indicating a recent separation. Given that large numbers of O. s. scops and O. s. cycladum pass through Cyprus on spring migration, and that the latter breeds in adjacent countries, it seems probable that cycladum would colonize the island, but for the presence of cyprius. That it does not do so, and that cyprius retains its distinctive song and plumage, suggests that isolating mechanisms exist. We recommend that cyprius be consid-ered specifically distinct, as are other distinctively voiced insular Otus populations. Copyright © 2015 Magnolia Press.

ABSTRACT: Although birds are among the best studied taxa, many of the globally threatened species lack the information required to fully assess their conservation status and needs. One such species is the Anjouan Scops Owl Otus capnodes which was presumed extinct until its rediscovery to science in 1992. Based on the limited extent and decline of the moist forests in the highlands of Anjouan in the Comoro Islands, a population size of only 100-200 pairs was estimated and the species was classified as 'Critically Endangered'. The current study is the first comprehensive survey ever conducted on this species, and aimed to establish the current distribution and population size. Point counts with distance sampling were conducted across the agroforestry and forest zones of Anjouan in both a dry and wet season. A niche suitability model predicted the species distribution to be wider than expected with owls observed as low as 300 m altitude and in highly modified agroforestry habitats. However, the encounter rate in natural relatively undisturbed forest was significantly greater than in other habitats. The wider than expected geographic range of O. capnodes supports a possible downlisting of this species on the IUCN Red List to 'Endangered'. Population size was found to be far greater than previously thought, at approximately 3,450 individual owls in the dry season and 5,450 in the wet season. These results show the importance of investing in robust surveys of poorly known and cryptic bird species, and provide up to date and important information for landscape scale conservation planning in the Comoros Islands.

ABSTRACT: Management strategies intended to reduce the impacts of future climate change on montane species ought to consider fine-scale variation in microclimate (e.g. because of topography) and vegetation conditions that create climate refugia. Identifying potential refugia and quantifying their importance is facilitated by analytical approaches that explicitly model associations between dynamic population processes and environmental conditions. We developed a population model to project future site occupancy dynamics in spotted owls Strix occidentalis under climate change and forest-management scenarios. The model was parameterized with statistical relationships derived from dynamic occupancy analyses applied to 20 years of spotted owl presence/nondetection data in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA. This approach allowed us to link colonization and extinction processes with spatial and temporal variation in vegetation characteristics, microclimate and weather while accounting for imperfect detection. Occupancy analyses indicated that greater prevalence of closed-canopy forest in owl sites was associated with lower extinction and higher colonization rates. Both rates increased following consecutive warm summers, but warm summer temperatures had a greater effect on extinction than colonization. Following the warmest summers, extinction was most likely to occur in owl sites with cool microclimates and relatively little closed-canopy forest, but extinction became considerably less likely in cool microclimates when greater amounts of closed-canopy forest were present. By comparison, extinction probability was lower at owl sites with warmer microclimates and relatively invariant to the amount of closed-canopy forest present. Simulations of our population model suggested that managing for greater amounts of closed-canopy forest may ameliorate the potential negative effects of warm summer temperatures by the mid-century, especially at high elevations. The model also allowed us to identify sites where potential management efforts would be most effective. Synthesis and applications. By modelling environmental processes influencing site colonization and extinction dynamics, we were able to identify features of potential climate change refugia for a montane species of management interest that could be promoted by land managers to increase species persistence. We also provided a general, process-based population modelling approach for projecting changes in animal populations and developing habitat-based climate change adaptation strategies using presence/nondetection data. © 2016 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Artificial burrows are considered an important management and conservation tool for burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia). This species regularly adorns natural and artificial burrows with mammal dung and other materials, which remain between years so that previous use of a nest site is often obvious. Moreover, ectoparasites (fleas) potentially overwinter in accumulated material and infest subsequent occupants. How evidence of prior use affects burrowing owl nest-site decisions is not completely understood. We examined potential effects of the presence of old nest material on reuse of nests by burrowing owls in southwestern Idaho, USA, during 2004 and 2005. We manipulated artificial burrows that owls used for nesting in the prior year by; 1) removing material from the entrance, tunnel, and nesting chamber and replacing it with fresh soil; 2) microwaving old nest material to kill ectoparasites before returning it; or 3) removing and returning material without treatment to serve as a control. Relative to removal burrows, odds of burrowing owl reuse of 'control' and "microwave" burrows were 3.5 and 3.8 times greater, respectively. Removing ectoparasites by microwaving did not increase odds of reuse relative to control burrows, and fleas were present on nestlings in all 3 treatment groups. Presence of old material may help owls locate specific burrows when returning from migration or may provide physiological and feeding benefits. Thus, cleaning by removal of nest material from previously used artificial burrows may be counterproductive if maximizing reuse of nest sites by burrowing owls is a management objective. © 2015 The Wildlife Society.

ABSTRACT: Counting of calling males during territorial or nuptial displays is a method widely used for census of populations of wild vertebrates during the pre-breeding and breeding periods, particularly in relation to census of populations of wild birds. In principle, a similar method could be used for assessing numbers of surviving offspring, by monitoring of begging calls, but is used only rarely. We explored the possibility of assessing post-fledging survival of Tengmalm's Owl young by counting the number of individuals begging for food. This method did not however deliver satisfactory estimates of numbers of surviving fledglings and its accuracy depended on time of night, distance from the natal nestbox, and presence or absence of begging calls. We suggest that this method can be used in Tengmalm's Owls for rough estimates only and our finding could be applicable also for other, generally smaller, owl species whose fledglings exhibit quick dispersion from the nest site after the fledging. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The range of the barred owl (Strix varia) has expanded westward over the past century and now entirely overlaps the range of the federally threatened northern spotted owl (S. occidentalis caurina) in the Pacific Northwest. We compared Haemoproteus blood parasite assemblages among northern spotted owls in their native range and barred owls in both their native and invasive ranges to evaluate predictions of five hypotheses about parasites and biological invasions: (1) Enemy Release, where hosts benefit from a loss of parasites in their invasive range, (2) Enemy of My Enemy, where invasive hosts introduce parasites to naïve native hosts, (3) Parasite Spillback, where invasive hosts act as a new reservoir to native parasites, (4) Increased Susceptibility, where native hosts introduce parasites to naïve invasive hosts, and (5) Dilution Effect, where invasive species act as poor hosts to native parasites and decrease the density of potential hosts in their invasive range. We used haplotype network analyses to identify one haplotype common to both owl species throughout North America, three more haplotypes that appeared to be isolated to the barred owl’s historic range, and a fifth haplotype that was only found in California. Based on infection status and parasite diversity in eastern and western barred owl populations, we found strong support for the Enemy Release Hypothesis. Northern spotted owls had higher parasite diversity and probability of infection than sympatric barred owls, offering some support for the Parasite Spillback and Dilution Effect Hypotheses. Overall, this study demonstrates the complexity of host-parasite relationships and highlights some of the ways in which species’ range expansions may alter such relationships among both invasive and native hosts. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland (outside the USA).

ABSTRACT: Different ecological parameters are associated with the selection of nests and breeding sites in birds. Understanding nest-site selection and the subsequent consequences for reproductive success are critical to a full understanding of how natural selection shapes birds' nesting behavior. Between 2007 and 2008, we evaluated nest-site characteristics and nesting success of Tropical Screech-Owls (Megascops choliba) in an area of Cerrado interspersed with cultivated areas in central Brazil. We compared the characteristics of cavities used for nesting by owls and unused nesting cavities and modeled nest survival in MARK. Models were assessed using Akaike's Information Criterion for small sample sizes (AICc) and model averaging was used to infer model parameters. Tropical Screech-Owls nested in tree and termite-mound cavities. Nest success was 44.4%, with predation being the main cause of nest failure. We found that Tropical Screech-Owls nested in cavities with different orientations, and closer to the ground than unused cavities. Although the top-ranked models included nest height and nest concealment, multimodel inference showed that these variables had no clear effect on nest survival. Despite the lack of effect of these variables on nest survival, nest-site characteristics commonly associated with a cavity's microclimate (i.e., orientation of cavity entrance) may still have a stronger influence on nest-site selection. © 2015 The Wilson Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Spike rate adaptation (SRA) is a continuing change of responsiveness to ongoing stimuli, which is ubiquitous across species and levels of sensory systems. Under SRA, auditory responses to constant stimuli change over time, relaxing toward a long-term rate often over multiple timescales. With more variable stimuli, SRA causes the dependence of spike rate on sound pressure level to shift toward the mean level of recent stimulus history. A model based on subtractive adaptation (Benda J, Hennig RM. J Comput Neurosci 24: 113–136, 2008) shows that changes in spike rate and level dependence are mechanistically linked. Spacespecific neurons in the barn owl’s midbrain, when recorded under ketamine-diazepam anesthesia, showed these classical characteristics of SRA, while at the same time exhibiting changes in spike timing precision. Abrupt level increases of sinusoidally amplitude-modulated (SAM) noise initially led to spiking at higher rates with lower temporal precision. Spike rate and precision relaxed toward their long-term values with a time course similar to SRA, results that were also replicated by the subtractive model. Stimuli whose amplitude modulations (AMs) were not synchronous across carrier frequency evoked spikes in response to stimulus envelopes of a particular shape, characterized by the spectrotemporal receptive field (STRF). Again, abrupt stimulus level changes initially disrupted the temporal precision of spiking, which then relaxed along with SRA. We suggest that shifts in latency associated with stimulus level changes may differ between carrier frequency bands and underlie decreased spike precision. Thus SRA is manifest not simply as a change in spike rate but also as a change in the temporal precision of spiking. © 2015 the American Physiological Society.

ABSTRACT: Many organizations have installed artificial burrows to help bolster local Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia) populations. However, occupancy probability and reproductive success in artificial burrows varies within and among burrow installations. We evaluated the possibility that depth below ground might explain differences in occupancy probability and reproductive success by affecting the temperature of artificial burrows. We measured burrow temperatures from March to July 2010 in 27 artificial burrows in southern California that were buried 15-76 cm below the surface (measured between the surface and the top of the burrow chamber). Burrow depth was one of several characteristics that affected burrow temperature. Burrow temperature decreased by 0.03°C per cm of soil on top of the burrow. The percentage of time that artificial burrows provided a thermal refuge from above-ground temperature decreased with burrow depth and ranged between 50% and 58% among burrows. The percentage of time that burrow temperature was optimal for incubating females also decreased with burrow depth and ranged between 27% and 100% among burrows. However, the percentage of time that burrow temperature was optimal for unattended eggs increased with burrow depth and ranged between 11% and 95% among burrows. We found no effect of burrow depth on reproductive success across 21 nesting attempts. However, occupancy probability had a non-linear relationship with burrow depth. The shallowest burrows (15 cm) had a moderate probability of being occupied (0.46), burrows between 28 and 40 cm had the highest probability of being occupied (>0.80), and burrows >53 cm had the lowest probability of being occupied (<0.43). Burrowing Owls may prefer burrows at moderate depths because these burrows provide a thermal refuge from above-ground temperatures, and are often cool enough to allow females to leave eggs unattended before the onset of full-time incubation, but not too cool for incubating females that spend most of their time in the burrow during incubation. Our results suggest that depth is an important consideration when installing artificial burrows for Burrowing Owls. However, additional study is needed to determine the possible effects of burrow depth on reproductive success and on possible tradeoffs between the effects of burrow depth on optimal temperature and other factors, such as minimizing the risk of nest predation. © 2015 Association of Field Ornithologists.

ABSTRACT: For a quarter century, Tony Angell and his family shared the remarkable experience of closely observing pairs of western screech owls that occupied a nesting box outside their forest home. The journals the author recorded his observations in, and the captivating drawings he created, form the heart of this compelling book-a personal account of an artist-naturalist's life with owls. Angell's extensive illustrations show owls engaged in what owls do-hunting, courting, raising families, and exercising their inquisitive natures-and reveal his immeasurable respect for their secret lives and daunting challenges. Angell discusses the unique characteristics that distinguish owls from other bird species and provides a fascinating overview of the impact owls have had on human culture and thought. He also offers detailed scientific descriptions of the nineteen species of owls found in North America, as well as their close relatives elsewhere. Always emphasizing the interaction of humans and owls, the author affirms by his own example the power of these birds both to beguile and to inspire. © 2015 by Tony Angell. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Beak and feather disease virus (BFDV), which causes psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD), is known to infect a wide range of bird species, with all members of the Psittaciformes recognised as being susceptible. Across the world, genetically distinct circovirus species cause feather disease akin to PBFD in the Australian Raven (Corvus coronoides), as well as a wide range of columbids, anatids and lariids. Until recently, BFDV was thought to be restricted to Psittaciformes, with a rich viral genetic diversity present in parrots and their allies throughout Australia. The possibility of rare spill-over infection of BFDV into non-psittacine birds has the potential to reveal insights into the disease ecology of PBFD and the ontology of BFDV. In this paper we report evidence of BFDV infection in a Powerful Owl (Ninox strenua), which had feather lesions characteristic of PBFD. Analysis of the BFDV genome associated with the infection revealed lorikeets, which are known prey items of Powerful Owls, to be a likely source. © BirdLife Australia 2016.

ABSTRACT: Secondary sexual characters often signal qualities such as physiological processes associated with resistance to various sources of stress. When the expression of an ornament is not sex-limited, we can identify the costs and benefits of displaying a trait that is typical of its own sex or of the other sex. Indeed, the magnitude and sign of the covariation between physiology and the extent to which an ornament is expressed could differ between males and females if, for instance, the regulation of physiological processes is sensitive to sex hormones. Using data collected over 14 years in the nocturnal barn owl Tyto alba, we investigated how nestling body mass covaries with a heritable melanin-based sex-trait, females displaying on average larger black feather spots than males. Independently of nestling sex, year and time of the day large-spotted nestlings were heavier than small-spotted nestlings. In contrast, the magnitude and sign of the covariation between nestling body mass and the size of parental spots varied along the day in a way that depended on the year and parental gender. In poor years, offspring of smaller-spotted mothers were heavier throughout the resting period; in the morning, offspring sired by larger-spotted fathers were heavier than offspring of smaller-spotted fathers, while in the evening the opposite pattern was found. Thus, maternal and paternal coloration is differentially associated with behaviour or physiology, processes that are sensitive to time of the day and environmental factors. Interestingly, the covariation between offspring body mass and paternal coloration is more sensitive to these environmental factors than the covariation with maternal coloration. This indicates that the benefit of pairing with differently spotted males may depend on environmental conditions, which could help maintain genetic variation in the face of intense directional (sexual) selection. © 2015 The Linnean Society of London.

ABSTRACT: Capsule: The analysis of 635 papers about the diet of the European Barn Owl Tyto alba showed that 83751 birds were captured out of 3.44 million prey items (2.4%). Birds were more frequently captured on islands than mainland, in southern than northern Europe and in eastern than western Europe. Between 1860 and 2012, the consumption of birds decreased in northern and eastern Europe. Among avian prey, the House Sparrow Passer domesticus, the most frequently captured bird (65.7%), decreased in frequency during the last 150 years in eastern Europe. © 2015 British Trust for Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: Western Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia hypugaea) are small, ground-dwelling owls of western North America that frequent prairie dog (Cynomys spp.) towns and other grasslands. Because they rely on rodent prey and occupy burrows once or concurrently inhabited by fossorial mammals, the owls often harbor fleas. We examined the potential role of fleas found on burrowing owls in plague dynamics by evaluating prevalence of Yersinia pestis in fleas collected from burrowing owls and in owl blood. During 2012-2013, fleas and blood were collected from burrowing owls in portions of five states with endemic plague - Idaho, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, and South Dakota. Fleas were enumerated, taxonomically identified, pooled by nest, and assayed for Y. pestis using culturing and molecular (PCR) approaches. Owl blood underwent serological analysis for plague antibodies and nested PCR for detection of Y. pestis. Of more than 4750 fleas collected from owls, Pulex irritans, a known plague vector in portions of its range, comprised more than 99.4%. However, diagnostic tests for Y. pestis of flea pools (culturing and PCR) and owl blood (PCR and serology) were negative. Thus, even though fleas were prevalent on burrowing owls and the potential for a relationship with burrowing owls as a phoretic host of infected fleas exists, we found no evidence of Y. pestis in sampled fleas or in owls that harbored them. We suggest that studies similar to those reported here during plague epizootics will be especially useful for confirming these results. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015.

ABSTRACT: Based on 52 nesting attempts of Tengmalm's owl Aegolius funereus in the Šumava Mountains (South Bohemia, Czech Republic), in habitats comprised mainly of Norway spruce forests, we investigated the relationships between diet composition and fledgling productivity of this owl. We found that (i) owls feed mainly on Sorex shrews (39%), Microtus voles (19%), Apodemus mice (15%), bank voles Myodes glareolus (14%) and birds (6%), (ii) the percentage of Apodemus mice, as well as the percentage of Myodes glareolus, negatively correlated to the percentage of Sorex shrews and birds in the owls' diet, and (iii) the fledgling productivity of the owls positively correlated to the percentage of Apodemus mice in the diet. Finally, (iv) the percentage of Microtus voles, the second most common prey, exhibited no close relationships with other prey groups or fledgling productivity of the owls. These results suggest that Apodemus mice were an important prey in the diet of the Tengmalm's owl in our study area, and support the theory that, compared to their northern counterparts, nocturnal raptors in Central Europe may be less dependent on Microtus voles due to the increased diversity of available prey species.

ABSTRACT: The great gray owl (Strix nebulosa) is listed by the state of California as endangered, with a population estimate of fewer than 300 individuals in the state. Nest-site availability has been suggested as a limiting factor for population growth in California, but information on nest types and nesting habitat has been based on a small number of nests that may not fully represent the variety of conditions used by the species. We collated all known nesting records in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California since 1973 (n=56) and then visited 47 of the nest sites to characterize habitat and compare them with paired reference sites. Great gray owls used a diversity of trees (8 species) and nest types. Although great gray owls in California are considered conifer-forest specialists, 30% of nests were in oak trees and 21% were below 1,000m, which loosely corresponds to the lower conifer-zone limit. Across all elevations and tree species, degree of deterioration was the most important factor differentiating nest trees from paired reference trees at the same meadow, with nest trees being significantly more decayed. Nest trees (mean dbh=100.5±SD 30.3cm) were also significantly larger than reference trees. Canopy cover within 50m of nest trees (x¯=85.1±16.4%) was significantly greater at nest sites than at reference sites. At higher elevations, most nests were within 250m of a meadow edge, but at lower elevations, 31% of nests were >750m from the closest meadow. Based on these findings, we suggest that managers trying to promote great gray owl nesting maintain 4 or more large (100-cm dbh) snags per hectare in dense forests, especially near meadows. We also recommend increasing great gray owl survey effort in habitats and areas that may have been inadequately surveyed in the past. Published 2015.

ABSTRACT: This paper describes an account of combat between two Powerful Owls Ninox strenua in the St George area, Sydney, NSW. The breeding pair of this territory had been followed as part of a monitoring program since July 2012. Daily photographic records from February to May 2014 provided recognition of individual birds by observing their distinctive chest patterns. Two possible interpretations of the incident were generated. Based on the identity of the aggressor and a male changeover in the territory, the combat incident was believed to be a contest between rival males.

ABSTRACT: The little owl Athene noctua is a widespread species in Europe. This mainly sedentary owl experienced reduction in population sizes in some areas due to habitat loss and modification of the landscape. To assess the genetic structure of the populations of western and central Europe, we analysed 333 specimens from 15 geographical areas at 13 microsatellite loci. Statistical analyses and Bayesian clustering procedures detected two major genetically distinct clusters, the first distributed from Portugal to the Czech Republic and the second from the Balkans to Italy. The second cluster was further split into three groups, located in Italy, Sardinia and the Balkans. These groups match four previously-described mtDNA haplogroups, and probably originated from the isolation of little owl populations in Sardinia and in three glacial refugia (Iberia, south Italy and Balkans) during the ice ages. High genetic admixture was recorded in central and northern Europe, probably as a consequence of the expansion from the refugia during interglacial. The main colonization route originated from the Iberian Peninsula towards central and northern Europe. Contact zones with colonization events from Italy and the Balkans were detected respectively in northern Italy and central Europe. Genetic indices show the existence of moderate levels of genetic variability throughout Europe, although evidence of recent evolutionary bottlenecks was found in some populations. Estimation of migration rates and approximate Bayesian computations highlighted the most likely phylogeographical scenario for the current distribution of little owl populations. © 2015 Nordic Society Oikos.

ABSTRACT: The demographic performance of avian predators is influenced by climate variations. The Plant Area Index (PAI) is considered a key descriptor of the (evolving) vegetation sensitive to climate and soil aridity and drought stress. To assess if the increased aridity regime in the mediterranean region affects the reproduction of a forest predator, the breeding success of the Tawny Owl Strix aluco was studied over 7 years (1997–2003) in Castelporziano, central Italy. The inter-annual fluctuations in owl demographic output observed in neighbor forest and agricultural sites were compared with climatic variables (rainfall, minimum and maximum air temperature, aridity index) and changes in the PAI estimated by satellite imagery. Out of 326 breeding attempts, the percentage of successful pairs per year ranged between 4 and 28 %, the number of fledglings per successful pair ranged between 1.0 and 1.8 and breeding rate (i.e. the number of fledglings per breeding pair) ranged between 0.1 and 0.4. Demographic, climatic and remotely sensed indexes showed coherent variations among years. Rainfall and lower aridity index are associated with a higher breeding success. The relationship between PAI and breeding rate was found significant only in forest sites. Results suggest that Tawny Owls may positively respond to drier weather conditions by reducing the breeding rate. © 2015, Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei.

ABSTRACT: The effect of diet on barn owl (Tyto alba) breeding biology has been well studied in the temperate regions but not in the more arid Middle East. In temperate regions, barn owls are darker colored and mainly prey upon Cricetidae rodents, whereas in arid regions, they are lighter colored and prey to a larger degree upon Muridae rodents. In this study we analyzed the diet and breeding success of 261 barn owl pairs nesting in Israel. The reproductive success of barn owls declined from March to August, and fledged more young when they consumed a larger proportion of social voles (Microtus socialis guentheri). Although the diet of the lighter colored barn owls in Israel comprises more Muridae than that of the darker morphs in temperate regions, in both regions the number of barn owl young increases with an increased proportion of voles in the diet. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: In colour polymorphic species morphs are considered to be adaptations to different environments, where they have evolved and are maintained because of their differential sensitivity to the environment. In cold environments the plumage insulation capacity is essential for survival and it has been proposed that plumage colour is associated with feather structure and thereby the insulation capacity of the plumage. We studied the structure of contour feathers in the colour polymorphic tawny owl Strix aluco. A previous study of tawny owls in the same population has found strong selection against the brown morph in cold and snowy winters whereas this selection pressure is absent in mild winters. We predicted that grey morphs have a denser and more insulative plumage, enabling them to survive better in cold climate compared to brown ones. The insulative plumulaceous part of the dorsal contour feathers was larger and the fine structure of the plumulaceous part of the feather was denser in grey tawny owls than in brown ones. In the ventral contour feathers the plumulaceous part of the feather was denser in females than in males and in older birds without any differences between morphs. Our study suggests that insulative microscopical feather structures differ between colour morphs and we propose that feather structure may be a trait associated with morph-specific survival in cold environments. © 2016 Nordic Society Oikos.

ABSTRACT: Sedentary bird species are suitable model hosts for identifying potential vectors of avian blood parasites. We studied haemosporidian infections in the Tengmalm’s Owl (Aegolius funereus) in the Ore Mountains of the Czech Republic using molecular detection methods. Sex of owl nestlings was scored using molecular sexing based on fragment analysis of PCR-amplified CHD1 introns. Observed infection prevalences in nestlings and adult owls were 51 and 86 %, respectively. Five parasite lineages were detected. Most of the infections comprised the Leucocytozoon AEFUN02 and STOCC06 lineages that probably refer to distinct Leucocytozoon species. Other lineages were detected only sporadically. Mixed infections were found in 49 % of samples. The main factor affecting the probability of infection was host age. No effect of individual sex on infection probability was evidenced. The youngest infected nestling was 12 days old. High parasite prevalence in the Tengmalm’s Owl nestlings suggests that insect vectors must enter nest boxes to transmit parasites before fledging. Hence, we placed sticky insect traps into modified nest boxes, collected potential insect vectors, and examined them for the presence of haemosporidian parasites using molecular detection. We trapped 201 insects which were determined as biting midges from the Culicoides genus and two black fly species, Simulium (Nevermannia) vernum and Simulium (Eusimulium) angustipes. Six haemosporidian lineages were detected in the potential insect vectors, among which the Leucocytozoon lineage BT2 was common to the Tengmalm’s Owl and the trapped insects. However, we have not detected the most frequently encountered Tengmalm’s Owl Leucocytozoon lineages AEFUN02 and STOCC06 in insects. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Capsule: Although considered as a specialist predator of Microtus voles, the Long-eared Owl Asio otus may adapt its diet according to the local prey availability. We reviewed the diet of this nocturnal raptor in urban environments during the winter, using studies which reported the ingested biomass relating to different prey categories and so energy intake could be considered. The species was confirmed to feed mainly on Microtus, but in some area rats dominated the ingested biomass. © 2015 British Trust for Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: Owl pellets are a useful tool for inventorying small mammals and a robust complement to traditional trapping methods. Here we assessed if bone samples recovered from Barn owl pellets in the Neotropics represent a viable source of modern DNA. We used the upper incisor of rodents and jaws of marsupials of pellet material for DNA extraction and amplification. Extraction and amplification success depended on the type of bone element used, being much higher from rodent incisors. The amplification success of small (429 bp) and large (801 bp) mitochondrial cytochrome b fragments was relatively similar, suggesting that DNA was not severely degraded, probably because our pellet samples were less than 8 years old. Eleven species of small mammals were identified, from which two are new to the study area: Gracilinanus emiliae and Marmosops pinheiroi. These records represent the southeastern boundary of both species, and extended their geographic distribution 370 km (G. emiliae) and 700 km (M. pinheiroi) to the south. Moreover, two of three detected species of Oecomys occurring in sympatry may represent undescribed species. The use of molecular analysis as a complement to morphological analysis of pellet bones is very effective in species identification, especially considering poorly known and elusive species, such as those reported here. The search for owl pellets during fieldwork should be a common practice among mammalogists in the Neotropics because this material provides a valuable non-invasive source of DNA, often revealing previously undetected species and sometimes uncovering new species. © 2015 © The Trustees of the Natural History Museum, London 2015.

ABSTRACT: We used radiotelemetry to study space use and habitat selection of 16 Northern Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) on the eastern slope of the Cascade Mountains, Washington, U.S.A., in 1989-1990. We used a geographical information system (GIS) and aerial photo interpretation of digital orthophotos to assign owl locations a value for vegetation type, topographic position, amount of edge, and distance to water. We compared owl relocations and random locations within 95% fixed kernel (FK) home ranges to determine each owl's selection of cover types, using logistic regression and generalized estimating equations (GEE) to estimate an exponential resource selection function likelihood. Minimum convex polygon (MCP) home ranges (SE) averaged 2858 ha (712 ha) for males and 1883 ha (249 ha) for females. Individual 95% FK home ranges averaged 1980 ha (229 ha) for males and 1649 ha (163 ha) for females. Pair home ranges averaged 3419 ha (826 ha) for MCP and 2427 ha (243 ha) for 95% FK. Nonbreeding season home ranges averaged approximately 3.5 times larger than breeding season home ranges for both males and females. Our best habitat model indicated that owls selected closed-canopy forests with a component of large (≥50 cm dbh) trees for roosting and foraging. In a given cover type, owls foraged lower on the slope. Management circles centered on nest areas-commonly used as a surrogate for home ranges-can be relatively poor representations of actual ranges used by pairs. However, an alternative for managing Spotted Owl home ranges is not readily available. Maintaining sufficient closed-canopy forest to provide habitat for Spotted Owls in the dry, fire-prone forests on the eastern slope of the Washington Cascades will be a challenge because forestry methods used to reduce the risk or severity of fire generally reduce the prevalence of structural features that characterize good Spotted Owl habitat. © 2015 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: We monitored 37 Northern Saw-whet Owl (Aegolius acadicus) nesting attempts at the Boardman Tree Farm (BTF) in north-central Oregon from 2012 to 2015. Nests were initiated from early March to late June and contained an average of 5.7 eggs. Twenty-nine (78%) of the nesting attempts were successful and produced an average of 4.2 fledglings per successful attempt. One male paired with two females and produced 6 fledglings out of 10 eggs. We captured 59 unique nesting adults 61% of the males (17 of 28) and 58% of the females (18 of 31) were second-year (SY) birds. We captured both adults at 30 nests: both parents were SYs at eight nests, both were after-second-year (ASY) at five nests, the female was SY and the male ASY at eight nests, and the male was SY and the female ASY at nine nests. Considering clutch size and number of young fledged, we found no evidence that pairs composed of SY parents reproduced less successfully than those composed of ASY parents. Sample sizes were small, but neither mean clutch size nor the mean number of young fledged differed significantly among nests of the four combinations of parental ages. One male and two females nested in more than one year each obtained a new mate the second year. The first female had nested successfully in 2012 and settled in a box 3 km away in 2013 she abandoned her first clutch in 2013 and renested 15 d later in a different box with a male who also had nested successfully in 2012. The other female nested successfully in 2014 and settled in a box 3.7 km away in 2015. Of the 109 banded nestlings that fledged from 2012 to 2014, we encountered only one in a subsequent year through 2015. Our data suggest that breeding-site fidelity and natal philopatry are low in this population, as has been found elsewhere in western North America. © 2015 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: We investigated the variations in the diets of barn owls (Tyto alba) along a rural to urban gradient in the Lower Fraser Valley of southwestern British Columbia, Canada. Our objectives were to determine the food preferences of barn owls in different habitat types and to assess both seasonal and annual variations in their diets. In particular, given the increased incidences and concentrations of second generation anticoagulant rodenticide (SGAR) residues in barn owls, we were interested in determining whether there was any relationship between the degree of urbanization surrounding their nest/roost sites and the proportion of commensal rodents (Rattus norvegicus, Rattus rattus, Mus musculus) in their diet. In total, 8,941 individual prey remains were identified. The proportion of rats consumed increased significantly with the amount of urbanization within home ranges. However, voles (primarily field voles, Microtus townsendii) were the main prey item for all sites irrespective of surrounding land use within home ranges. Shrews were the second most consumed prey species (10.8 ± 8 %), and were found predominantly in the diet of barn owls nesting in more rural landscapes. The dominance of field voles in the diet was also reflected in the food-niche breadth, which was consistently low for all sites across the rural to urban gradient. Interestingly, barn owls were found nesting in highly urban environments (66–95 % urbanization), where bait stations containing SGARs were regularly used. This, combined with the increased consumption of rats in more urban environments, illustrates why the SGAR exposure rate in barn owls is substantial and rising. © 2014, Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.

ABSTRACT: Bubo bubo is the largest owl in the world, showing a wide geographical distribution throughout the Palaearctic region. It underwent a demographic decline in many European countries during the last century and was considered "vulnerable" (Annex II of the CITES). Nowadays, it is classified as "Least Concern" according to IUCN.Despite its ecological importance and conservation status, few polymorphic molecular markers are available to study its diversity and population genetics. We report on the isolation and development of 10 new microsatellites for the Eagle owl, B. bubo. All loci (10 tetra-nucleotide) are characterized by high polymorphism levels. Number of alleles ranged from 5 to 13 and expected heterozygosity varied from 0.733 to 0.840. These microsatellites would be very useful to assess the genetic diversity, connectivity patterns and parentage of B. bubo. This information will allow to establish new conservation strategies and improve the management of the species. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Breeding timing is one of the key life-history traits considered to be under strong stabilizing selection, such that offspring should be born when food resources are most abundant. Predation, however, may also affect the breeding timing because nest predation is a leading mortality for many species, although this possibility has been less considered. Here, we examined the possible effects of nest predation on breeding timing by comparing sympatric scops owls in a subtropical forest where only reptilian predators are present. The Japanese Scops Owl (Otus semitorques Temminck and Schlegel, 1844), a dietary generalist, bred one month earlier than the specialist Ryukyu Scops Owl (Otus elegans (Cassin, 1852)). The breeding timing of the Ryukyu Scops Owl matched with the emergence of their main prey species, but also matched with predator activity. Accordingly, the predation rate on eggs or nestlings was 7.5 times higher in the Ryukyu Scops Owl (13.9%; 21 out of 150 nests) than in the Japanese Scops Owl (1.9%; 1 out of 52 nests). Clutch size, on the other hand, was significantly larger in the Ryukyu Scops Owl than in the Japanese Scops Owl, possibly compensating loss from predation. Although alternative explanations still remain, our results suggest that the food generalist might have adjusted its breeding timing to avoid nest predation, whereas the breeding timing of the specialist might have been constrained by the availability of its main prey items. © 2015, National Research Council of Canada, All Rights Reserved.

ABSTRACT: This is the third in a series of periodic monitoring reports on northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) habitat status and trends on federally administered lands since implementation of the Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP) in 1994. The objective of this monitoring is to determine if the NWFP is providing for conservation and management of northern spotted owl (NSO) habitat as anticipated. This report focused on the amount, distribution, and spatial arrangement of NSO habitats across the NWFP area; and how these have changed as a result of disturbance and ingrowth starting with the year of the NWFP analyses in 1993. Results showed a net decrease from 9,089,700 ac to 8,954,000 ac (-1.5 percent) of nesting/roosting habitat on NWFP federal lands. This occurred despite gross losses from wildfire of 5.2 percent (474,300 ac), 1.3 percent from timber harvest (116,100 ac), and 0.7 percent from insects or other causes (59,800 ac), indicating that processes of forest succession have compensated for some of the losses resulting from disturbance. Dispersal habitat on NWFP federal lands increased by 2.2 percent (net change), but dispersal-capable landscapes experienced a 5 percent net decrease owing to habitat losses on the surrounding nonfederal lands. Large wildfires continue to be the leading cause for loss of NSO habitat on federal lands. Most of these losses occurred within the network of large reserves designed for NSO conservation. © 2016, USDA Forest Service. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The Long-eared Owl, Asio otus (Linnaeus, 1758), was known as a scarce wintering bird in Iran until 2010. There were altogether 25 records until the 1970s, but no data are available for the period between the 1970s and 1997. Between 1997 and 2014 there were at least 32 non-breeding and 17 breeding records available based on data of the Iran Bird Records Committee. Breeding was first confirmed in Nahavand (Hamedan Province) and has in the meantime been confirmed at 11 localities mainly in the western half of the country. The recent increase in records (from 25 records during 12 decades compared with 49 records during two decades) indicates that there has been a real increase in the numbers of Long-eared Owls occurring in Iran. © 2015 Taylor and Francis.

ABSTRACT: Small mammal community composition is almost universally estimated from conventional trapping, which is logistically difficult to scale up for landscape-level assessments. Owl pellets may be a more effective alternative for measuring small mammal community composition over large geographic areas due to the relative ease and low cost of field collections. However, owl pellets may introduce sampling biases that differ from those associated with conventional trapping. A thorough comparison to conventional traps is required before owl pellets can be widely adopted as an alternative research tool for small mammal studies. We conducted a literature review of owl diet-prey availability studies to: (i) compare small mammal community composition between owl pellets and trapping when the two methods were used simultaneously and (ii) assess the influence of owl genus and habitat type on community composition estimated by these two methods. We used data from 27 published studies, which allowed for 32 comparisons between owl pellets and trapping conducted simultaneously. These studies included 15 owl species from five common genera from different major habitats. Rarefied estimates showed that owls consistently sampled identical or higher species richness compared to conventional trapping. Richness estimates rarefied to the lowest sample size per study were not statistically identical (μΔrichness = 0·20 ± 0·09 SE, P = 0·30); on average, 0·95 ± 0·13 SE additional species were identified from pellets compared to trapping. Measures of species dominance and evenness estimated from both methods were statistically identical (μΔ1-D = 0·02 ± 0·03 SE; μΔPIE = 0·004 ± 0·04 SE). Species lists, relative species composition and species rank-order abundance were in moderate agreement between sampling methods (Jaccard = 0·62 ± 0·04 SE; Bray-Curtis = 0·53 ± 0·04 SE; Spearman rho = 0·41 ± 0·07 SE). Linear regression and AIC model selection showed that the performance of pellets versus traps did not differ based on owl genus or habitat type. Small mammal community composition estimated via pellets was better represented compared to estimates from conventional trapping. Composition metrics from the two methods were consistent and not affected by owl genera or habitat type. Thus, owls are an effective alternative for landscape-level assessments of small mammal communities. © 2016 British Ecological Society.

ABSTRACT: In large portions of their geographic range, Mexican Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis lucida) roost in forest-dominated environments, but in some areas the owls use relatively arid rocky canyonlands. We measured habitat characteristics at 133 male roosts (n = 20 males) during 1992-95, and 56 female roosts (n = 13 females) during 1994-95 in canyon environments of southern Utah. Across all years, 44% of Mexican Spotted Owls' roosts were located in small stands of mixed-conifer forest, 30% in desert scrub vegetation, 16% in pinyon-juniper woodlands, and 10% of roosts were in riparian habitat. Roost sites were located in canyons composed of cliff-forming geologic formations. The width of canyons measured at roosts averaged 68.6 m (8.2 SE), and ranged from 1-500 m. The mean height of cliffs at roost sites was 77 m (10.9 SE) and ranged from 6-411 m. Roosts were located at caves and ledges (46% of all roosts) or in various tree species (54%). Roost height above ground averaged 9.5 m overall (1.1 SE), with mean tree roost height of 3.7 m (0.2 SE), and cliff roost height equal to 17.2 m (2.2 SE). For both males and females, coniferous trees species were used most frequently (64%), primarily Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), white fir (Abies concolor), and Utah juniper; and 36% of roosts occurred in deciduous trees, including big-tooth maple (Acer grandidentatum), boxelder (A. negundo), and Utah serviceberry (Amelanchier uthaensis). Canopy cover of tress at roosts ranged from 44-71%, mean tree height of trees present was 9.5 m and mean diameter of trees was 25.4 cm. Upland habitats that were not used for roosting were warmer, not as steep, possessed fewer caves and ledges, and trees present were of smaller stature than trees present in roost habitat. © 2015 The Wilson Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Background: Studies on reproductive morphology are important to understand the reproductive cycle of non-human primates. Methods: This study describes the functional morphology of the adult female tubular genital organs in 41 Aotus (12.8 ± 6.8 years old, ranging from 3 to 25 years), with respect to reproductive status and number of parturitions. Results: In females with developing embryos, endometrial glands showed a higher secretion than other females, and the embryo implantation occupied this secretive endometrium. Changes in the thickening, number of layers, and keratinization in the vaginal epithelium suggest that vaginal cytology may be an indicator of the estrous cycle. Non-pregnant multiparous females had a larger uterine body than nulliparous females. Number of parturitions and reproductive state had an impact on tubular genital organs in female owl monkeys. Conclusions: These results can be useful for the development of biotechnologies of reproduction and for improvement of the management of this species. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

ABSTRACT: A sample of 251 pellets regurgitated by the barn owl in an old building located in Sinnamary (French Guiana) provided a rare opportunity to get a preliminary inventory of small rodents and opossums living in grassy savannas along the coastal non-forested landscapes of this Guianan region. From a total of 329 specimens of vertebrate remains, we focused on 259 small rodents and opossums that could be positively identified. Two species previously unknown in French Guiana were evidenced: a very small opossum of the genus Cryptonanus and the medium-sized terrestrial rodent Sigmodon alstoni. Although Cryptonanus was an unexpected finding so far away from its Amazonian distribution area, the presence of Sigmodon in French Guiana fills a gap between Suriname and Brazilian Amapa where this species is typical of grassy savannas. The species of small mammals most commonly preyed upon by the barn owls of Sinnamary was a large semi-aquatic rodent, Holochilus sciureus, followed in decreasing order by two sigmodontines typical of non-forested ecosystems: Oligoryzomys fulvescens and Zygodontomys brevicauda. © 2016 by De Gruyter.

ABSTRACT: Collision with vehicles is a major if not the dominant source of mortality for owls. Despite this, there has been no study to date on Barred Owl-vehicle collisions, a species that breeds in densely-populated suburban neighborhoods with high road density. We capitalized on the availability of a large dataset of the locations of Barred Owls hit by vehicles and brought to a rehabilitation center in Charlotte, North Carolina, USA to investigate the factors underlying collision incidence. Using autologistic regressions and multi-model inference, we found that the explanatory variables with the largest effects on the likelihood of a Barred Owl-vehicle collision were speed limit, road width, and habitat suitability within 825 m of roads, in that order. Speed limit and habitat suitability had positive effects whereas road width had a negative effect. Our results are in agreement with existing studies of birds that have investigated the relative effects of road features and landscape structure in demonstrating the greater importance of the former. Future research should include systematic Barred Owl roadkill surveys that account for sampling biases in order to determine the importance of roads as a source of mortality for the species and to gain a better understanding of the effects of roadway design on the incidence of Barred Owl-vehicle collisions. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: Understanding interactions among site occupancy, reproduction, vegetation, and disturbance for threatened species can improve conservation measures, because important aspects of vegetation and disturbances may be identified and managed. We used 9 yr of survey data collected at 168 sites to investigate dynamic site occupancy and reproduction in a declining population of California Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) in southern California, USA. We used multistate models to examine the relationship among owl site occupancy, reproduction, high-severity wildland fire, and postfire logging, while accounting for variation in vegetation characteristics and variation in detectability. Both occupancy and reproduction were positively correlated with successful reproduction in the previous year. Tree cover (ha) in a site's 203-ha core area also was positively correlated with both occupancy and reproduction. We detected no effect of disturbance covariates on reproduction, given that a site was occupied. Fire and logging covariates were both negatively correlated with the probability of site occupancy, and the effect sizes of these disturbances were large in sites that were occupied by owls that were nonreproductive the previous year (reduced 0.19 by fire and 0.26 by postfire logging), but small in sites that were occupied by owls that were reproductive the previous year (reduced 0.02 by fire and 0.03 by postfire logging). This study illustrates the important contribution of consistently occupied and productive breeding sites to this population of Spotted Owls, and demonstrates that both occupancy and reproduction at these productive sites exhibited negligible effects from disturbances. Our results suggest that sites with recent owl reproduction and sites with more tree cover in this study area should receive enhanced protection from management actions that modify vegetation utilized by Spotted Owls. © 2015 Cooper Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: We report results for the alignments of galaxies in the EAGLE and cosmo-OWLS hydrodynamical cosmological simulations as a function of galaxy separation (-1 ≤ log10(r/[h-1Mpc]) ≤ 2) and halo mass (10.7 ≤ log10(M200/[h-1M⊙]) ≤ 15). We focus on two classes of alignments: the orientations of galaxies with respect to either the directions to, or the orientations of, surrounding galaxies. We find that the strength of the alignment is a strongly decreasing function of the distance between galaxies. For galaxies hosted by the mostmassive haloes in our simulations the alignment can remain significant up to ~ 100Mpc. Galaxies hosted by more massive haloes show stronger alignment. At a fixed halo mass, more aspherical or prolate galaxies exhibit stronger alignments. The spatial distribution of satellites is anisotropic and significantly aligned with the major axis of the main host halo. The major axes of satellite galaxies, when all stars are considered, are preferentially aligned towards the centre of themain host halo. The predicted projected direction-orientation alignment, Εg+(rp), is in broad agreement with recent observations.We find that the orientation-orientation alignment is weaker than the orientation-direction alignment on all scales. Overall, the strength of galaxy alignments depends strongly on the subset of stars that are used to measure the orientations of galaxies and it is always weaker than the alignment of dark matter haloes. Thus, alignment models that use halo orientation as a direct proxy for galaxy orientation overestimate the impact of intrinsic galaxy alignments. © 2015 RAS.

ABSTRACT: In birds of prey, food availability affects the entire breeding process, including reproductive success. Sequential polyandry, sometimes documented in raptors and owls, has been observed occasionally in Tengmalm’s owl in years of high food availability. In this study, the effect of food supply on the reproductive strategy of the central European Tengmalm’s owl population has been investigated. The availability of the main prey of owls was significantly below average in the study year 2014 This resulted in low breeding density of owls, delayed egg laying, small clutch sizes, and low reproductive success. Nevertheless, successful sequential polyandry of one Tengmalm’s owl female was recorded during the breeding season. The polyandrous female laid four eggs in each nests, and 50 % and 75 % of four hatched nestlings left the nest during the first and second breeding, respectively. In both nesting attempts, the two-year old female was of a substandard body mass and she abandoned the fledglings before they left the nests. Prey delivered by males to both nests was comprised mainly of alternative prey (birds and shrews). The results of this study suggest that there are probably some other factors, in addition to food availability, that may play a role in Tengmalm’s owl’s decisions in matters of parental care. © 2015, Czech Academy of Sciences All Rights Reserved.

ABSTRACT: Oxidative stress, determined by the balance between the production of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant defences, is hypothesized to play an important role in shaping the cost of reproduction and life history trade-offs. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated reproductive effort in 94 breeding pairs of tawny owls (Strix aluco) to investigate the sex- and melanism-specific effects on markers of oxidative stress in red blood cells (RBCs). This colour polymorphic bird species shows sex-specific division of labour and melanism-specific history strategies. Brood sizes at hatching were experimentally enlarged or reduced to increase or decrease reproductive effort, respectively. We obtained an integrative measure of the oxidative balance by measuring ROS production by RBCs, intracellular antioxidant glutathione levels and membrane resistance to ROS. We found that light melanic males (the sex undertaking offspring food provisioning) produced more ROS than darker conspecifics, but only when rearing an enlarged brood. In both sexes, light melanic individuals had also a larger pool of intracellular antioxidant glutathione than darker owls under relaxed reproductive conditions (i.e. reduced brood), but not when investing substantial effort in current reproduction (enlarged brood). Finally, resistance to oxidative stress was differently affected by the brood size manipulation experiment in males and females independently of their plumage coloration. Altogether, our results support the hypothesis that reproductive effort can alter the oxidative balance in a sex-and colour-specific way. This further emphasizes the close link between melanin-based coloration and life history strategies. © 2016. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The increasing interest in the development of small flying air vehicles has given rise to a strong need to thoroughly understand low-speed aerodynamics. The barn owl is a well-known example of a biological system that possesses a high level of adaptation to its habitat and as such can inspire future small-scale air vehicle design. The combination of the owl-specific wing geometry and plumage adaptations with the flexibility of the wing structure yields a highly complex flow field, still enabling the owl to perform stable and at the same time silent low-speed gliding flight. To investigate the effects leading to such a characteristic flight, time-resolved stereoscopic particle-image velocimetry (TRSPIV) measurements are performed on a prepared natural owl wing in a range of angles of attack 0° ≤ α ≤ 6° and Reynolds numbers 40 000 ≤ Rec ≤ 120 000 based on the chord length at a position located at 30% of the halfspan from the owl's body. The flow field does not show any flow separation on the suction side, whereas flow separation is found on the pressure side for all investigated cases. The flow field on the pressure side is characterized by large-scale vortices which interact with the flexible wing structure. The good agreement of the shedding frequency of the pressure side vortices with the frequency of the trailing-edge deflection indicates that the structural deformation is induced by the flow field on the pressure side. Additionally, the reduction of the time-averaged mean wing curvature at high Reynolds numbers indicates a passive lift-control mechanism that provides constant lift in the entire flight envelope of the owl. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Dense retinotopy data sets were obtained by microelectrode visual receptive field mapping in dorsal and lateral visual cortex of anesthetized owl monkeys. The cortex was then physically flatmounted and stained for myelin or cytochrome oxidase. Retinotopic mapping data were digitized, interpolated to a uniform grid, analyzed using the visual field sign technique - which locally distinguishes mirror image from nonmirror image visual field representations - and correlated with the myelin or cytochrome oxidase patterns. The region between V2 (nonmirror) and MT (nonmirror) contains three areas - DLp (mirror), DLi (nonmirror), and DLa/MTc (mirror). DM (mirror) was thin anteroposteriorly, and its reduced upper field bent somewhat anteriorly away from V2. DI (nonmirror) directly adjoined V2 (nonmirror) and contained only an upper field representation that also adjoined upper field DM (mirror). Retinotopy was used to define area VPP (nonmirror), which adjoins DM anteriorly, area FSTd (mirror), which adjoins MT ventrolaterally, and TP (mirror), which adjoins MT and DLa/MTc dorsoanteriorly. There was additional retinotopic and architectonic evidence for five more subdivisions of dorsal and lateral extrastriate cortex - TA (nonmirror), MSTd (mirror), MSTv (nonmirror), FSTv (nonmirror), and PP (mirror). Our data appear quite similar to data from marmosets, though our field sign-based areal subdivisions are slightly different. The region immediately anterior to the superiorly located central lower visual field V2 varied substantially between individuals, but always contained upper fields immediately touching lower visual field V2. This region appears to vary even more between species. Though we provide a summary diagram, given within- and between-species variation, it should be regarded as a guide to parsing complex retinotopy rather than a literal representation of any individual, or as the only way to agglomerate the complex mosaic of partial upper and lower field, mirror- and nonmirror-image patches into areas. © 2015 Cambridge University Press.

ABSTRACT: Estimates of species' vital rates and an understanding of the factors affecting those parameters over time and space can provide crucial information for management and conservation. We used mark-recapture, reproductive output, and territory occupancy data collected during 1985-2013 to evaluate population processes of Northern Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) in 11 study areas in Washington, Oregon, and northern California, USA. We estimatedapparent survival, fecundity, recruitment, rate of population change, and local extinction and colonization rates, and investigated relationships between these parameters and the amount of suitable habitat, local and regional variationin meteorological conditions, and competition with Barred Owls (Strix varia). Data were analyzed for each area separately and in a meta-analysis of all areas combined, following a strict protocol for data collection, preparation, andanalysis. We used mixed effects linear models for analyses of fecundity, Cormack-Jolly-Seber open population models for analyses of apparent annual survival (φ), and a reparameterization of the Jolly-Seber capture-recapture model (i.e. reverse Jolly-Seber; RJS) to estimate annual rates of population change (λRJS) and recruitment. We also modeled territory occupancy dynamics of Northern Spotted Owls and Barred Owls in each study area using 2-species occupancymodels. Estimated mean annual rates of population change (λ) suggested that Spotted Owl populations declined from 1.2% to 8.4% per year depending on the study area. The weighted mean estimate of λ for all study areas was 0.962 (60.019 SE; 95% CI: 0.925-0.999), indicating an estimated range-wide decline of 3.8% per year from 1985 to 2013. Variation in recruitment rates across the range of the Spotted Owl was best explained by an interaction between total winter precipitation and mean minimum winter temperature. Thus, recruitment rates were highest when both totalprecipitation (29 cm) and minimum winter temperature (-9.58C) were lowest. Barred Owl presence was associated with increased local extinction rates of Spotted Owl pairs for all 11 study areas. Habitat covariates were related to extinctionrates for Spotted Owl pairs in 8 of 11 study areas, and a greater amount of suitable owl habitat was generally associated with decreased extinction rates. We observed negative effects of Barred Owl presence on colonization ratesof Spotted Owl pairs in 5 of 11 study areas. The total amount of suitable Spotted Owl habitat was positively associated with colonization rates in 5 areas, and more habitat disturbance was associated with lower colonization rates in 2areas. We observed strong declines in derived estimates of occupancy in all study areas. Mean fecundity of females was highest for adults (0.309 ± 0.027 SE), intermediate for 2-yr-olds (0.179 ± 0.040 SE), and lowest for 1-yr-olds (0.065 ± 0.022 SE). The presence of Barred Owls and habitat covariates explained little of the temporal variation in fecundity in most study areas. Climate covariates occurred in competitive fecundity models in 8 of 11 study areas, but supportfor these relationships was generally weak. The fecundity meta-analysis resulted in 6 competitive models, all of which included the additive effects of geographic region and annual time variation. The 2 top-ranked models also weaklysupported the additive negative effects of the amount of suitable core area habitat, Barred Owl presence, and the amount of edge habitat on fecundity. We found strong support for a negative effect of Barred Owl presence onapparent survival of Spotted Owls in 10 of 11 study areas, but found few strong effects of habitat on survival at the study area scale. Climate covariates occurred in top or competitive survival models for 10 of 11 study areas, and inmost cases the relationships were as predicted; however, there was little consistency among areas regarding the relative importance of specific climate covariates. In contrast, meta-analysis results suggested that Spotted Owlsurvival was higher across all study areas when the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) was in a warming phase and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) was negative, with a strongly negative SOI indicative of El Niño events. The best modelthat included the Barred Owl covariate (BO) was ranked 4th and also included the PDO covariate, but the BO effect was strongly negative. Our results indicated that Northern Spotted Owl populations were declining throughout the rangeof the subspecies and that annual rates of decline were accelerating in many areas. We observed strong evidence that Barred Owls negatively affected Spotted Owl populations, primarily by decreasing apparent survival and increasinglocal territory extinction rates. However, the amount of suitable owl habitat, local weather, and regional climatic patterns also were related to survival, occupancy (via colonization rate), recruitment, and, to a lesser extent, fecundity, although there was inconsistency in regard to which covariates were important for particular demographic parameters or across study areas. In the study areas where habitat was an important source of variation for Spotted Owldemographics, vital rates were generally positively associated with a greater amount of suitable owl habitat. However, Barred Owl densities may now be high enough across the range of the Northern Spotted Owl that, despite thecontinued management and conservation of suitable owl habitat on federal lands, the long-term prognosis for the persistence of Northern Spotted Owls may be in question without additional management intervention. Based on ourstudy, the removal of Barred Owls from the Green Diamond Resources (GDR) study area had rapid, positive effects on Northern Spotted Owl survival and the rate of population change, supporting the hypothesis that, along with habitatconservation and management, Barred Owl removal may be able to slow or reverse Northern Spotted Owl population declines on at least a localized scale. © 2016 Cooper Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Although population cycles of rodents are geographically widespread and occur in a number of rodent species, higher-order food web interactions mediated by predator-rodent dynamics have primarily been described from boreal and arctic biomes. During periods of low rodent abundance, predators may switch to alternative prey, which may affect other predators directly or indirectly. Using a long-term dataset, we assessed the frequency of Pine Marten Martes martes predation on the nests of Tengmalm's Owl Aegolius funereus during periods of fluctuating rodent abundance in Central Europe. The number of nests predated by Pine Martens was positively correlated with the annual number of nests available. The probability of predation by Pine Martens on Tengmalm's Owl nests decreased with increasing spring abundance index of Apodemus mice, but was not related to the abundance index of Myodes and Microtus voles, pooled rodent abundance or age of the nestbox. Additionally, we found no relationship between the breeding frequency (i.e. the number of nesting attempts per nestboxes available) and an abundance index of Microtus and Myodes voles, Apodemus mice or overall rodent abundance. Our results demonstrate, for the first time in a temperate area, that during periods of low Apodemus mouse abundance, the switching response of an opportunistic mammalian predator can lead to indirect food web interactions through an increase in nest predation on a sympatric avian predator. © 2015 British Ornithologists' Union.

ABSTRACT: Responses of resident owls to changes in forest structure associated with forest management in the Central Hardwood Forest Region of the United States have not been widely studied. We estimated the winter occupancy of Barred Owls (Strix varia) and Eastern Screech-Owls (Megascops asio) in forests with varying levels of timber harvest in southern Indiana. Surveys were conducted from 2009 to 2013 in two state forests undergoing active harvesting, a national forest unit with little recent harvesting, and a forested state park with no harvesting since about 1940. We hypothesized that 1) Barred Owl occupancy would vary inversely with harvesting intensity because they prefer mature forest, 2) Eastern Screech-Owl occupancy would be greatest in the actively managed forests given their affinity for edge habitat, and 3) Eastern Screech-Owls would avoid Barred Owl sampling areas and, thus, Barred Owl predation. Barred Owl occupancy was lowest in the non-harvested state park relative to other areas, and Eastern Screech-Owls were less likely to co-occur in Barred Owl sampling areas. We found no evidence that forest management was inversely related to Barred Owl occupancy or that active edge creation associated with forest management increased the magnitude of Eastern Screech-Owl occupancy. Reduced rates of Barred Owl occupancy in the state park may have resulted from high levels of recreational activity, whereas increased rates of Eastern Screech-Owl occupancy in the park may have resulted from ample hunting opportunities in an environment with fewer Barred Owl predators. Recreational activity, prey availability, and interspecific antagonism likely have greater influences than timber harvesting on winter site occupancy of these owls in our study areas. © 2015 Association of Field Ornithologists.

ABSTRACT: Recently the US Fish and Wildlife Service, as part of a critical habitat analysis for the northern spotted owl (. Strix occidentalis caurina), developed habitat suitability models based on thousands of owl nest sites distributed across 11 regions using the MaxEnt tool. Because these models formed the basis for critical habitat designations on millions of hectares of land, we undertook an independent evaluation of the FWS effort. We evaluated the accuracy of vegetation data used as input to develop the models, conducted out of sample analyses, correlated model output with owl reproductive success in two study areas, and developed alternate models using two different statistical methods. Vegetation data appeared accurate for only a few variables, and accuracy varied among model regions. Out of sample testing gave a high rate of classification errors and owl productivity was not correlated with MaxEnt model output in two study areas. Alternate statistical methods produced reasonable models with fewer variables. Critically, neither the models compared across regions nor the regions analyzed with different tools led to comparable use of variables. Thus biological interpretation of owl habitat selection models seemed ambiguous. In addition, for MaxEnt and one of the other tools, a highly significant trend by regression was found showing decreasing model accuracy as number of training nest sites increased. Together, these two results suggest that the generated models may be spurious to some unknown degree, perhaps because the underlying vegetation data, also derived from a model, are not sufficiently accurate to support the analysis and/or because the owls themselves affect habitat suitability by consuming their prey base. We suggest that the USFWS exercise caution in using MaxEnt models as a basis for regulatory purposes such as consultation, estimating likelihood of occupancy by owls, or evaluation of site-specific recovery actions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Many owl species use the same nesting and food resources, which causes strong interspecific competition and spatio-temporal niche separation. We made use of a recent colonisation of Ural Owls (Strix uralensis) in southern Poland to compare habitat preferences of Tawny Owls (Strix aluco) allopatry and sympatry with Ural Owls. We investigated spatial niche segregation of Ural Owl and the Tawny Owl in sympatry and compared habitat preferences of Tawny Owls breeding in allopatry and sympatry. Tawny Owls breeding in sympatry with Ural Owls occupied forests with higher canopy compactness, sites located closer to forest border and to built-up areas, as well as stands with a higher share of fir and spruce and a lower share of beech as compared to sites occupied by Ural Owls. Allopatric Tawny Owls occupied sites with lower canopy compactness and bred at sites located further from forest borders and in stands with lower share of fir and spruce and a higher share of deciduous as compared to sympatric Tawny Owls. As Ural owls are dominant in relation to Tawny Owls, this indicates that the presence of Ural Owls prevents Tawny Owls from occupying deciduous-dominated and old stands located in forest interior areas, far from buildings and forest edges. The results support habitat displacement between the two species when breeding in sympatry. We also show that protection of large forest patches is crucial for the Ural Owl, a species still rare in central Europe, while small patches are occupied by the abundant Tawny Owl. © 2015, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: This paper tested the hypothesis that the structural components of vegetation have impact over the distribution of owl species in a fragment of a semi-deciduous seasonal forest. This paper also determined which vegetation variables contributed to the spatial distribution of owl species. It was developed in the Perobas Biological Reserve (PBR) between September and December 2011. To conduct the owl census, a playback technique was applied at hearing points distributed to cover different vegetation types in the study area. A total of 56 individual owls of six species were recorded: Tropical Screech-Owl (Megascops choliba), Black-capped Screech-Owl (Megascops atricapilla), Tawny-browed Owl (Pulsatrix koeniswaldiana), Ferruginous Pygmy-Owl (Glaucidium brasilianum), Mottled Owl (Strix virgata) and Stygian Owl (Asio stygius). The results suggest that the variables of vegetation structure have impact on the occurrence of owls. The canopy height, the presence of hollow trees, fallen trees and glades are the most important structural components influencing owl distribution in the sampled area. © 2015, Instituto Internacional de Ecologia.

ABSTRACT: The fossiliferous Upper Varswater Formation at Langebaanweg (South Africa) produced remains of at least five species of owls (Strigiformes). Tyto richae sp. nov. is the first palaeospecies of Tytonidae described from an African fossil site, though indeterminate remains referable to the genus Tyto are known from the Middle Miocene of Morocco, the early Pliocene of Ethiopia, and the Pliocene of Tanzania. Athene inexpectata sp. nov. is not only the earliest documented fossil evidence for the genus worldwide, but also the first record of a species of Athene in Africa south of the Sahara. Proportions of its hind limb indicate that At. inexpectata sp. nov. probably has been as terrestrial as its modern relative At. cunicularia. A few additional remains represent the earliest fossil evidence for the genera Asio and Bubo on the African continent, though the poor preservation of these bones prevents more detailed identifications. A distal tibiotarsus of a small owl about the size of At. inexpectata sp. nov. indicates the presence of a fifth, as yet indeterminate, species of owl at Langebaanweg. Biogeographical and palaeoecological implications of this assemblage of owls are discussed. © 2015 M. Pavia et al.

ABSTRACT: Gabapentin (1-[aminomethyl] cyclohexane acetic acid) is a γ-aminobutyric acid analogue that has been shown to be efficacious for neuropathic pain control in humans. Plasma gabapentin concentrations >2 μg/ml are considered effective in treating epilepsy in humans and are suggested to provide analgesia for neuropathic pain. This study investigated the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of gabapentin suspension (11 mg/kg) in great horned owls (Bubo virginianus). Plasma gabapentin concentrations were determined in six healthy birds for 48 hr using high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection. Plasma gabapentin concentrations were estimated by noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis. The harmonic mean (±SD) maximum concentration (Cmax), time to maximum concentration (Tmax), and elimination half-life (tv2λZ) for gabapentin (11 mg/kg) were 6.17 ± 0.83 μg/ml, 51.43 ± 5.66 min, and 264.60 ± 69.35 min, respectively. In this study, plasma gabapentin concentrations were maintained above 2 μg/ml for 528 min (8.8 hr), suggesting that gabapentin administered orally every 8 hr may be appropriate in great horned owls. © 2015 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Opportunistic predator like the long-eared owl is able to respond to population fluctuations of its main prey. The composition of the winter diet of this owl species was investigated during the period of 13 winters (1992-2000, 2006-2011) in agricultural areas in Slovakia. In total, we found 23 mammal species and 33 bird species (H′ = 0.82) in pellets. The frequency of the dominant prey species, the common vole, varied from 57.7% to 92.4%. Our data show that the abundance of the common vole: (i) had biggest impact on the food niche breadth of the long-eared owl; (ii) when in decline, it was significantly compensated by the increase in the amount of 15 other accessory species (subject to the specific diet offered during the study winters); (iii) was positively correlated with the number of owls in the winter-roost, which varied during the 13 studied winters. © 2015 Institute of Zoology, Slovak Academy of Sciences.

ABSTRACT: The survival probability of adult Scops Owls was studied in NW Italy, near the northern limits of the European breeding range. The species reappeared in the study area at the beginning of this century, after more than 30 years of absence as a breeding bird. Scops Owls were captured at a bird-ringing station that operated continuously from 1990, and apart from three sporadic captures in the nineties, regular presence was detected only from 2002. Survival estimates were based on 190 captures of adult birds obtained in twelve years (2003-2014). After allowing for the presence of transients, the model with constant survival and constant recapture probabilities suggested an adult apparent survival probability of 0.58 ± 0.07 (SE), with no sex differences. This is the first Scops Owl survival estimate, and it puts the species within the lower range of owl survival estimates, as partially expected by its small size and its migratory habits.

ABSTRACT: Background: The Brown Hawk Owl complex is said to consist of three species, the Brown Boobook (Ninox scutulata), the Chocolate Boobook (Ninox randi) and the Northern Boobook (Ninox japonica), which includes the nominate migratory lineage Ninox japonica japonica and a mitochondrially distinct lineage of taxonomically uncertain status that has been recorded year-round at least in Taiwan. Overlap in ranges during migration and morphological similarity have led to difficulties in distinguishing the Brown Boobook from the Northern Boobook. Methods: PCR of cytochrome-b and Sanger sequencing of Ninox samples from Singapore and Brunei were used to determine sample identity. Results: Two out of four Singaporean samples and the Brunei sample were identified as Northern Boobooks. This is the first official record of this species in Singapore and represents a considerable range extension for the species. Further, the samples belong to the mitochondrially distinct lineage previously characterized in resident Taiwanese populations rather than to the well-known nominate migratory lineage. Conclusions: Our data show that the mitochondrial signature previously documented in resident Taiwanese populations of the Northern Boobook extends to migratory populations. This cryptic lineage may be more widespread in its breeding quarters, extending to the Chinese and Russian mainland, in which case the name florensis would apply to it. Further genetic and bioacoustic investigation is required to resolve the taxonomic status of this lineage. © 2015 Sadanandan et al.

ABSTRACT: Bell et al. (2015) and Dunk et al. (2015) comment on our appraisal (Loehle et al., 2015) of biological insights from the US Fish and Wildlife Service models for northern spotted owl critical habitat. We here respond to those comments. We argue that while the low predictability of vegetation plot data by the gradient nearest neighbor (GNN) models may average out at very large scales and thus be useful in that context, errors at the site-specific scale may confound the modeling used to develop critical habitat designations. We further found that GNN errors violate statistical assumptions and are not propagated through the modeling exercise. We found multiple lines of evidence for habitat model instability, which may result from GNN uncertainty. We believe our evidence for lack of demographic predictability from the MaxEnt RHS values remains relevant to judicious use of these models for conservation. We similarly respond to other particular concerns with our analysis and conclude with suggestions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..

ABSTRACT: We studied body size and sexual dimorphism in the southernmost subspecies of the Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia cunicularia) at the Pampas of Argentina, and we compared our data with those from other subspecies in the Americas. A total of 58 individuals were captured and their coloration pattern (plumage and bare parts), body linear measurements (wing chord, standard tail length, tarsus length and width, forearm length, exposed culmen length, and hallux claw length), and body mass were recorded. In addition, we banded each individual and took a blood sample from 44 individuals for molecular sex determination. In general, the body size measurements reported for A. c. cunicularia in this study agreed with previous reports based on museum specimens for the same subspecies, and were near the upper range for the species. In addition, tarsi of A. c. cunicularia were large in comparison to those of other subspecies. Sexes differed little in size, with tarsus length, tail length, and wing chord being slightly greater in males, and culmen length and mass slightly greater in females. However, mean values of these measurements did not differ statistically between sexes. The southernmost subspecies of Burrowing Owls, A. c. cunicularia, has a larger body size than the North American and Caribbean subspecies, which suggests geographical variation in body size of this species throughout its distributional range. © 2015 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Territorial calls (hooting) of two tawny owl subspecies, Strix aluco aluco (the eastern European subspecies) and Strix aluco willkonskii (the Caucasian subspecies), were recorded from October 2007 to February 2013, to study variation between individuals and subspecies. Calls of the eastern European subspecies were recorded in Moscow region (Russia) and "Gomolshanskie Lesa" National Park (Ukraine). Males of the Caucasian subspecies were recorded in "Bolshoi Utrish" Reserve and "Sochinskii" National Park (Russia). The territorial calls of the eastern European and Caucasian subspecies are compared for the first time. The discriminatory accuracy of individual calls reached 98% for S. a. aluco and 77% for S. a. willkonskii when accounting for six frequency and temporal parameters of their call. we found the call of the two subspecies to differ in half of the acoustic parameters considered, suggesting that macrogeographic variation between the Eastern European and Caucasian subspecies may have taken place.

ABSTRACT: Based on detection of hepatic residues, scavenging and predatory non-target raptors are widely exposed to second generation anticoagulant rodenticides (SGARs). A small proportion, generally <10 %, of tested birds are diagnosed as acutely poisoned. Little is known, however, of sub-lethal effects of SGARs, such as interaction of clotting capacity with traumatic injury. Assessment of coagulation function of birds submitted live to wildlife rehabilitators or veterinarians may provide a means of establishing the proportion of animals suffering sub-lethal coagulopathies, as well as identifying individuals requiring treatment. As a first step in exploring the potential of this approach, we dosed Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) with the SGAR, brodifacoum, at 0, 0.8, 1.4, 1.9, and 2.5 mg/kg and sampled birds at 1, 3, 5 and 7 days post-dosing. Prothrombin time (PT), which measures the extrinsic coagulation pathway, was significantly prolonged in 98 % of brodifacoum-exposed quail in a dose- and time-dependent manner. 50-fold prolongation of PT occurred at higher brodifacoum dosages and correlated to hemorrhage found at necropsy. Activated clotting time (ACT), a measure of the intrinsic pathway also increased with dose and time. Hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) decreased dose- and time-dependently at doses ≥1.4 mg/kg with no significant change at 0.8 mg/kg. Reference intervals for PT (10.0–16.2 s), ACT (30–180 s), Hb (9.6–18.4 g/dl), and Hct (34–55 %) were established in Japanese quail. Species-specific reference intervals are required as barn owl PT (17–29 s) and quail PT were different. The proportion of brodifacoum-exposed quail with hemorrhage was not correlated with liver residues, but was correlated with PT, suggesting that this assay is a useful indicator of avian anticoagulant rodenticide exposure. PTs measured in free-living barn owls sampled between April 2009 and August 2010 in the lower Fraser Valley of BC do not suggest significant exposure to SGARs. © 2015 Her Majesty the Queen in Rights of Canada

ABSTRACT: A carpometacarpus recovered during archaeological excavations in the town of Quaregnon is the westernmost find ever reported in Europe of a Ural Owl (Strix uralensis), and the first occurrence for Belgium. Both the morphology of the skeletal element and its measurements rule out an identification as any of the other Strigiformes from the Western Palearctic. The provenance of this specimen, that dates to the medieval period (10th-12th centuries AD), is discussed. It is hypothesized that the bird was a wild animal, but the available evidence does not unequivocally determine whether it belonged to a local, breeding population that went extinct or if it came from a more distant population. However, a survey of other zooarchaeological finds of Ural Owl in Europe shows that the species occurred farther west in the past, outside the present natural breeding range. This suggests that Ural Owl may have found suitable nesting biotopes in Belgium and northern France during the medieval period. © 2016, Societe Royale Zoologique de Belgique. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: In this study we aimed to investigate the utility of the barn owl diet as a tool for determining the spatial distribution and abundance of the yellow-necked mouse, a forest-dwelling small mammal species, in the Montseny mountains and surrounding plains (Barcelona, NE Spain). After validating the molar shape criterion for species discrimination (t9 of second upper molar), we classified a sample of 2,684 Apodemus spp. identified from 8,831 small mammals of 17 species from barn owl pellets collected in 18 roosting places. Almost all individuals were determined as A. sylvaticus (91.8%) and the remainder were considered as A. flavicollis (8.2%). Frequencies of occurrence of A. flavicollis were related to 11 environmental descriptors by means of Redundancy Analysis and partial constrained ordination. Frequencies of occurrence changed along a strong environmental gradient (increased towards rainy localities covered by deciduous forests), and this pattern coincided with that observed for other forest predator (Genetta genetta). The use of non-invasive sampling methods, like the barn owl diet analysis, can be more efficient in detecting the presence of the yellow-necked mouse than other conventional sampling methods, since accurate species determination of the binomial A. sylvaticus/A. flavicollis is difficult after live-trapping in NE Spain. © The Mammal Society of Japan.

ABSTRACT: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service recently revised the recovery plan (USFWS, 2011) and designated Critical Habitat (USFWS, 2012a) for the Northern Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis caurina). The Critical Habitat designation was based in part on a map of relative habitat suitability that was developed by USFWS (2011, 2012b) for this purpose. Loehle et al. (2015) critiqued the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's approach to modeling relative habitat suitability for the Northern Spotted Owl. Here, we respond to Loehle et al.'s assessment, and identify four major shortcomings within it. First, it mischaracterizes the literature on spotted owls and MaxEnt, the species distribution model used by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Second, it is predicated upon several logic errors that, when resolved, undermine Loehle et al.'s conclusions. Third, it fails to demonstrate that the nesting and roosting site location data used by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is a biased sample. Lastly, Loehle et al.'s claims of significant flaws in analytical methods and ecological inference by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are not convincing. We assert that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Northern Spotted Owl relative habitat suitability model was in fact scientifically rigorous, and that it met the intended goals that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service articulated for their models. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..

ABSTRACT: We studied breeding season home range characteristics and habitat of paired male Mexican Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis lucida) below the south rim of Grand Canyon National Park from 2004-2005. Adult male owls (n = 5) were captured and radio-tracked using tail-mounted VHF transmitters. We used minimum convex polygons and 90% fixed kernels to estimate breeding season home range size (mean = 355 ha and 372 ha, respectively). We also generated adaptive kernel home range estimates to describe areas of concentrated use within home ranges. Home ranges were located in the upper reaches of relatively narrow rocky canyons, and Spotted Owls showed limited use of adjacent forested plateaus. We conducted an analysis of habitat use and selection at two scales and found that owls selected (i.e., used disproportionate to availability) limestone cliffs present in their home ranges. Home ranges were approximately centered on nest and associated roost sites located on limestone cliffs within canyons. Our results contrasted with observations in Utah where spotted owls nested primarily on sandstone cliffs. In Grand Canyon, both sandstone and limestone cliffs were present in the home range, but limestone appeared to be the preferred substrate. At the landscape level, owls placed home ranges in areas dominated by piñon-juniper (Pinus edulis-Juniperus monosperma) woodland. We delineated 40 ha use-areas around nest sites and found that these conservation zones closely approximated adaptive kernel 30% isopleths, thus supporting core area designation of the Mexican Spotted Owl Recovery Plan. © 2015 The Wilson Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Context: Reconstructing historical habitat could help reverse declining animal populations, but detailed, spatially comprehensive data are rare. For example, habitat for the federally threatened Northern spotted owl (NSO; Strix occidentalis caurina) was thought historically rare because low-severity fires kept forests open and habitat restricted to fire refugia, but spatial historical data are lacking.
Objectives: Here I use public land-surveys to spatially reconstruct NSO habitat and old-growth forests in dry forests in Oregon’s Eastern Cascades in the late-1800s. I used reconstructions of forest structure across about 280,000 ha, including 9,605 tree records and 2,180 section-line descriptions. I was able to reconstruct likely NSO nest trees, nest stands, and foraging and roosting habitat, based on modern NSO habitat studies.
Conclusions: Mixed- and high-severity fires strongly shaped historical dry forests and produced important components of historical NSO habitat. Focus on short-term loss of nest sites and territories to these fires is mis-directed. Fuel treatments to reduce these natural fires, if successful, would reduce future habitat of the NSO in dry forests.
Results: Historical nest stands, including sufficient nest trees, were predicted across 22–39 % and foraging and roosting habitat across 11–68 % of the study area, thus neither were rare. More habitat than expected occurred in forests with preceding mixed-severity fires. Early post-fire succession produced foraging and roosting habitat. Mid- to late-succession produced nesting habitat. Late-succession after high-severity fires can also provide NSO habitat. Old-growth forests, covering 76 % of study-area forests, also likely link to preceding mixed-severity fires. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

ABSTRACT: Megascops screech-owls are endemic to the New World and range from southern Canada to the southern cone of South America. The 22 currently recognized Megascops species occupy a wide range of habitats and elevations, from desert to humid montane forest, and from sea level to the Andean tree line. Species and subspecies diagnoses of Megascops are notoriously difficult due to subtle plumage differences among taxa with frequent plumage polymorphism. Using three mitochondrial and three nuclear genes we estimated a phylogeny for all but one Megascops species. Phylogenies were estimated with Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference, and a Bayesian chronogram was reconstructed to assess the spatio-temporal context of Megascops diversification. Megascops was paraphyletic in the recovered tree topologies if the Puerto Rican endemic M. nudipes is included in the genus. However, the remaining taxa are monophyletic and form three major clades: (1) M. choliba, M. koepckeae, M. albogularis, M. clarkii, and M. trichopsis; (2) M. petersoni, M. marshalli, M. hoyi, M. ingens, and M. colombianus; and (3) M. asio, M. kennicottii, M. cooperi, M. barbarus, M. sanctaecatarinae, M. roboratus, M. watsonii, M. atricapilla, M. guatemalae, and M. vermiculatus. Megascops watsonii is paraphyletic with some individuals more closely related to M. atricapilla than to other members in that polytypic species. Also, allopatric populations of some other Megascops species were highly divergent, with levels of genetic differentiation greater than between some recognized species-pairs. Diversification within the genus is hypothesized to have taken place during the last 8 million years, with a likely origin in Central America. The genus later expanded over much of the Americas and then diversified via multiple dispersal events from the Andes into the Neotropical lowlands. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The integration of disturbance ecology and spotted owl habitat objectives is a significant issue in the fire-prone forests in eastern Oregon and Washington. To progress in our scientific understanding, we presented a summary of spotted owl habitat use, including interactions with barred owls; reiterated the importance of establishing a landscape context for where and how much habitat to retain, and where and how restoration treatment should occur; and we summarized key standlevel spotted owl habitat objectives to consider in the design of treatments and to use as working hypotheses in adaptive management. This provides a consistent set of habitat objectives so that treatment effects on spotted owl habitat structure and prey species, fuels and fire behavior, and vegetation structure and composition can be compared across ecological provinces. The design of specific monitoring or management studies based on the implementation of these treatments follows in chapter 5. © 2015, USDA Forest Service. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Background: Haemoproteus parasites are widespread, and several species cause diseases both in birds and blood-sucking insects. These pathogens are transmitted by dipterans belonging to the Ceratopogonidae and Hippoboscidae, however certain vector species remain unknown for the majority of Haemoproteus spp. Owls are often infected by Haemoproteus parasites, but experimental studies on vectors of these infections are lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate sporogonic development of two widespread Haemoproteus parasites of owls, H. noctuae and H. syrnii in experimentally infected biting midges Culicoides impunctatus and Culicoides nubeculosus. We also followed in vitro sporogonic development of these infections and determined their phylogenetic relationships with Haemoproteus spp., for which vectors have been identified. Methods: Wild-caught C. impunctatus and laboratory reared C. nubeculosus were infected experimentally by allowing them to take blood meals on one individual long-eared owl (Asio otus) and one tawny owl (Strix aluco) harbouring mature gametocytes of H. noctuae (lineage hCIRCUM01) and H. syrnii (hCULCIB01), respectively. The engorged insects were maintained in the laboratory at 16-18 °C, and dissected at intervals in order to follow the development of ookinetes, oocysts and sporozoites. We also observed in vitro development of sexual stages of both parasites by exposure of infected blood to air. The parasite lineages were determined by polymerase chain reaction-based methods. Bayesian phylogeny was constructed in order to determine the relationships of owl parasites with other avian Haemoproteus spp., for which vectors have been identified. Results: Both H. noctuae and H. syrnii completed sporogony in C. nubeculosus, and H. noctuae completed sporogony in C. impunctatus. Ookinetes, oocysts and sporozoites of these parasites were reported and described. Gametes and ookinetes of both species readily developed in vitro. In accordance with sporogony data, the phylogenetic analysis placed both parasite lineages in a clade of Culicoides spp.-transmitted avian Haemoproteus (Parahaemoproteus) spp. Conclusions: Culicoides nubeculosus and C. impunctatus are vectors of H. noctuae and H. syrnii. Phylogenies based on cytochrome b gene indicate parasite-vector relationships, and we recommend using them in predicting possible parasite-vector relationships and planning research on avian Haemoproteus spp. vectors in wildlife. © 2015 Bukauskaitė et al.

ABSTRACT: After reviewing the systematics and distribution of the extinct West Indian taxa of Tytonidae (Tyto) larger than the living barn owl Tyto alba (Scopoli), we reached the following conclusions: (1) the species T. ostologa Wetmore (1922) is the only giant barn owl known so far from Hispaniola; (2) T. pollens Wetmore (1937) was a somewhat larger and even more robust representative of T. ostologa known from the Great Bahama Bank and Cuba; (3) the very rare species T. riveroi Arredondo (1972b) is here synonymized with T. pollens; (4) the smallest taxon of these giant barn owls is T. noeli Arre-dondo (1972a), which is widespread and abundant in Quaternary deposits of Cuba and is here reported for the first time from two cave deposits in Jamaica; (5) the only large barn owl named so far from the Lesser Antilles is T. neddi Steadman & Hilgartner (1999), which is here synonymized with T. noeli; (6) a new taxon from Cuba, T. cravesae new species, which in size approached the linear dimensions of T. ostologa, is named and described herein.

ABSTRACT: High-severity forest fire often is presumed to adversely affect the occupancy of territories by California Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) because these owls are associated with mature and old-growth forests. We used single-season, multi-state occupancy statistics to estimate site occupancy probability for Spotted Owls at 45 historically occupied sites during the breeding season immediately following the 2013 Rim Fire, which was one of the largest forest fires on record in California. We quantified how occupancy probability was influenced by the amount of high-severity fire occurring in mature forested habitat within Protected Activity Centers (PACs). The model-averaged estimate of site-occupancy probability for at least a single owl was 0.922 (±SE=0.073), which was higher than other published occupancy probability estimates for this subspecies in either burned or long-unburned sites in the Sierra Nevada. Mean site-occupancy probability for pairs was 0.866 (±0.093), and most sites (33) were occupied by pairs. The amount of high-severity fire in the PAC did not affect pair occupancy. Occupancy probability by at least a single bird was negatively correlated with the amount of high severity fire in the PAC but remained >0.89 in 100% high-severity burned PACs. These data add to observations that California Spotted Owls continue to use post-fire landscapes, even when the fires were large and where large areas burned at high severity, suggesting that owls are not generally negatively impacted by high-severity fire. Based on this and other studies of Spotted Owls, fire, and logging, we suggest land managers consider burned forest within and surrounding PACs as potentially suitable California Spotted Owl foraging habitat when planning and implementing management activities, and we recommend against logging burned forest within at least 1.5 km of nests or roosts for the conservation and recovery of this declining subspecies.

ABSTRACT: Conservation planning for spotted owls (Strix occidentalis) hinges upon retaining late-successional and old-growth forests. This strategy is to be supplemented over time by creating structural conditions found in such forests using innovative silviculture in less well-developed forests. Recent research indicates that spotted owls often hunt for prey or may nest in relatively young or mid-seral forest stands that were thinned or partially harvested in previous decades, but little information has been available to evaluate short-term direct responses (<5year) by spotted owls to such practices. We used selection ratios to compare the frequency of nocturnal use by radio-tagged northern spotted owls (S.o. caurina) and California spotted owls (S.o. occidentalis) ≤2years before and ≤2years after 150 forest stands were thinned or partially harvested within 1200m of nest sites of 19 owl home ranges in 5 study areas in western Oregon and northern California. We used logistic regression to investigate habitat and environmental factors that distinguished between 89 stands that were used and 115 stands that were not found used by radio-tagged owls for up to 2years after treatment via a broad range of partial-harvest or thinning prescriptions within 2400m of nest sites. Before harvest, radio-tagged owls generally used stands scheduled for harvest treatment in proportions significantly less than availability. After harvesting, selection ratios increased (n=4), remained the same (n=4), or decreased (n=2) among 10 owl pairs for which we acquired sufficient telemetry data both before and after harvesting. Across all owls and all post-harvest conditions, the overall selection ratio increased after harvesting, suggesting that many of the harvests were benign or may have resulted in improved habitat. The probability of use of thinned or partially-harvested stands increased with harvest-unit size, decreased with distance from nest sites, and varied with the intensity of harvest and among forest types as represented by study areas. We found only limited evidence for a positive effect of retained basal area of large trees (≥66cm diameter at breast height [dbh]), probably because many treated stands contained no such large trees prior to harvest. We found a quadratic relationship with retained basal area of mid-story conifers (10-65cmdbh), such that harvested stands that contained 25-35m2/ha basal area of such mid-story trees were more likely to be used, holding other factors constant at their means. We also found evidence for a positive influence of proximity to riparian zones on probability of use of harvested stands. Although we did not obtain information on prey abundance or foraging efficiency, our study suggests that judicious applications of partial-harvest forestry, primarily commercial thinning, have the potential to improve foraging habitats for spotted owls. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: There is significant debate about restoration targets for ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and mixed-conifer forests in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA. On one side are recommendations to create both extensive open and park-like pine forests, and to reduce high-severity fire occurrence by mechanical thinning of forests. These recommendations drive current management. On the other side are recommendations to manage landscapes for both dense, old forest, and complex early-seral forest that is created by both high-severity and moderate-severity fires characteristic of historical fire regimes. Our research suggests that the latter approach may best maintain forest associated with two imperiled species that are top management concerns of federal agencies in the Sierra Nevada: the California Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) and the Pacific Fisher (Pekania pennanti). We used spatially extensive US Forest Service forest survey data from 1910 and 1911, and synthesized research from other parts of this region for comparison, to assess reference conditions in low/mid-elevation Sierra Nevada forests. We found that historical ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer forests had a mixed-severity fire regime, with an average of 26% high-severity fire effects, and varied more widely in species composition and density than suggested by previous research. Our findings are contrary to other reports using a very small subset (∼6%) of the available data from these same 1910 and 1911 surveys. Therefore, we suggest that historical reference conditions of forests in the Sierra Nevada range of these species are not like that reported previously in other studies, and that mixed-severity fire, and forests defined by strong contrasts and dynamic natural processes, were characteristic of historical ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer forests of the western Sierra Nevada. Our analysis indicates that managing for both dense, old forests, and protecting complex early-seral forest created by high-severity fire, will likely advance conservation and recovery of the Spotted Owl and Pacific Fisher, while current management direction may exacerbate threats.

ABSTRACT: We studied the response of the barn owl annual productivity to the common vole population numbers and variability to test the effects of environmental stochasticity on their life histories. Current theory predicts that temporal environmental variability can affect long-term nonlinear responses (e.g., production of young) both positively and negatively, depending on the shape of the relationship between the response and environmental variables. At the level of the Czech Republic, we examined the shape of the relationship between the annual sum of fledglings (annual productivity) and vole numbers in both non-detrended and detrended data. At the districts' level, we explored whether the degree of synchrony (measured by the correlation coefficient) and the strength of the productivity response increase (measured by the regression coefficient) in areas with higher vole population variability measured by the s-index. We found that the owls' annual productivity increased linearly with vole numbers in the Czech Republic. Furthermore, based on district data, we also found that synchrony between dynamics in owls' reproductive output and vole numbers increased with vole population variability. However, the strength of the response was not affected by the vole population variability. Additionally, we have shown that detrending remarkably increases the Taylor's exponent b relating variance to mean in vole time series, thereby reversing the relationship between the coefficient of variation and the mean. This shift was not responsible for the increased synchrony with vole population variability. Instead, we suggest that higher synchrony could result from high food specialization of owls on the common vole in areas with highly fluctuating vole populations. © 2015 Pavluvčík et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.

ABSTRACT: During the years 2010-2012, we observed the spatial activity of long-eared owls by the radio telemetry in an agricultural land. The average home range size of tracked long-eared owls for 100 and 95% minimum convex polygon (MCP) was 415.93 and 350 ha, respectively. Between the breeding and the non-breeding season, we did not record significant differences in the size of home ranges. Open land units (meadows and arable lands) belonged to the most abundant land units in the home ranges of tracked owls (mean for 100 and 95% MCP was 24.6 and 24.3%, respectively). Forest edges with their ecotone character also represented the abundant land unit (mean for 100 and 95% MCP was 11.4 and 10.6%, respectively). An amount of built-inhabited areas in home ranges (mean for 100 and 95% MCP was 8.2 and 10.1%, respectively) correlated positively with their size (Spearman rank correlation: for 100% MCP: rs = 0.83, p <0.05; for 95% MCP: rs = 0.91, p <0.05) that indicates long-eared owls to be avoiding built-inhabited areas as an area of the food getting. Two individuals of long-eared owl changed the winter roosts during one non-breeding season, which were at a distance of 650 m from each other. © 2015, Institute of Landscape Ecology of the Slovak Academy of Science.

ABSTRACT: Genetic and morphological analyses revealed that the type specimen of Hume's Owl Strix butleri, the geographical provenance of which is open to doubt, differs significantly from all other specimens previously ascribed to this species. Despite the absence of vocal data definitively linked to the same population as the type specimen, we consider that two specieslevel taxa are involved, principally because the degree of molecular differentiation is close to that seen in other taxa of Strix traditionally recognised as species. Partially complicating this otherwise straightforward issue is the recent description of "Omani Owl S. omanensis" from northern Oman based solely on photographs and sound-recordings. We consider that there is clear evidence of at least some morphological congruence between the butleri type and the phenotype described as "omanensis". As a result, we review the relative likelihood of three potential hypotheses: that "omanensis" is a synonym of butleri; that "omanensis" is a subspecies of butleri; or that "omanensis" and butleri both represent species taxa. Until such time as specimen material of "omanensis" becomes available for genetic and comparative morphological analyses, we recommend that this name be considered as a synonym of butleri, especially bearing in mind the possibility (not previously considered in detail) that the type of butleri could have originated in Arabia, specifically from Oman. We describe other populations heretofore ascribed to S. butleri as a new species. Copyright © 2015 Magnolia Press.

ABSTRACT: Theory states that genes on the sex chromosomes have stronger effects on sexual dimorphism than genes on the autosomes. Although empirical data are not necessarily consistent with this theory, this situation may prevail because the relative role of sex-linked and autosomally inherited genes on sexual dimorphism has rarely been evaluated. We estimated the quantitative genetics of three sexually dimorphic melanin-based traits in the barn owl (Tyto alba), in which females are on average darker reddish pheomelanic and display more and larger black eumelanic feather spots than males. The plumage traits with higher sex-linked inheritance showed lower heritability and genetic correlations, but contrary to prediction, these traits showed less pronounced sexual dimorphism. Strong offspring sexual dimorphism primarily resulted from daughters not expressing malelike melanin-based traits and from sons expressing femalelike traits to similar degrees as their sisters. We conclude that in the barn owl, polymorphism at autosomal genes rather than at sex-linked genes generate variation in sexual dimorphism in melanin-based traits. © 2015 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

ABSTRACT: Foraging at night imposes different challenges from those faced during daylight, including the reliability of sensory cues. Owl monkeys (Aotus spp.) are ideal models among anthropoids to study the information used during foraging at low light levels because they are unique by having a nocturnal lifestyle. Six Aotus nigriceps and four A. infulatus individuals distributed into five enclosures were studied for testing their ability to rely on olfactory, visual, auditory, or spatial and quantitative information for locating food rewards and for evaluating the use of routes to navigate among five visually similar artificial feeding boxes mounted in each enclosure. During most experiments only a single box was baited with a food reward in each session. The baited box changed randomly throughout the experiment. In the spatial and quantitative information experiment there were two baited boxes varying in the amount of food provided. These baited boxes remained the same throughout the experiment. A total of 45 sessions (three sessions per night during 15 consecutive nights) per enclosure was conducted in each experiment. Only one female showed a performance suggestive of learning of the usefulness of sight to locate the food reward in the visual information experiment. Subjects showed a chance performance in the remaining experiments. All owl monkeys showed a preference for one box or a subset of boxes to inspect upon the beginning of each experimental session and consistently followed individual routes among feeding boxes. © 2014 da Costa, Bicca-Marques.

ABSTRACT: Relations between climatic factors during the winter season (n days with frost 10oC and 10oC; n days with snow cover: >1 cm, >10 cm and >30 cm; maximum snow cover during season [cm]) and mortality in free-living ungulates (red deer Cervus elaphus Linnaeus, 1758, roe deer Capreolus capreolus Linnaeus, 1758 and mouflon Ovis aries musimon Linnaeus, 1758) in the Owl Mountains (Lower Silesia Poland) in years 1998 2010 were investigated. Significant effects of all analysed climatic factors on ungulates mortality were documented. Correlations (Pearson) between such weather factors as the depth of snow cover and number of days with frost and recorded mortality in total animal populations analysed ranged from r = 0.33 to r = 0.77. The least adapted to local weather conditions was mouflon introduced to this area ca. 100 years ago from more southern parts of Europe. Roe deer species seems to be environmentally plastic, and are doing quite well in severe winters. Tolerance of red deer to the snow cover is much lower at low temperatures due to the fact that this species, during the period of snow cover, has limited access to the plants covered with snow and difficult access to food base. © 2015 by Forest Research Institute.

ABSTRACT: A nest of the Ryukyu Scops Owl Otus elegans was found on Okinoshima (Okino Island), Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan (34.24°N, 130.10°E), in the Tsushima Strait, on 28 July 2013. The breeding pair and their three owlets were caught and their identity confirmed genetically using the BOLD System for COI in the mitochondrial genome. Their calls and external morphological measurements also accorded with what is known of the species. We estimated that at least 23 territorial males inhabit the Island. Okinoshima lies 490 km beyond the previously known northern limit of the species’ distribution. © The Ornithological Society of Japan 2015

ABSTRACT: This study investigated the effects of the first generation anticoagulant rodenticide chlorophacinone and the second generation rodenticide bromadiolone on the population and breeding performances of barn owls at oil palm plantations. Three treatment plots were established: one baited with chlorophacinone, one with bromadiolone, and the third kept rodenticide-free. Four rat-baiting campaigns which coincided with barn owl breeding season were carried in the rodenticide-treated plots. The occupancy rate of nest boxes, clutch size, brood size and fledging rates of the barn owls in each plot were monitored weekly throughout the study. Freshly regurgitated pellets from barn owls were collected from all occupied nest boxes at weekly intervals during the development of nestlings in each breeding season. The results show that the occupancy rate of the nest boxes was significantly higher in the rodenticide-free area compared with both rodenticide-treated areas. Similarly, the breeding performances, such as clutch size, brood size and fledging success, were higher in the rodenticide-free area compared with the rodenticide-treated areas. Results of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed that 20.56% (mean residue: 1.335 ± 0.073 μg/g) and 28.89% (mean residue: 0.777 ± 0.032 μg/g) of the collected regurgitated pellet samples from the rodenticide-treated areas contained bromadiolone and chlorophacinone residue, respectively. The mean brood size and fledging success of the barn owls showed a strong negative correlation with the mean concentration of rodenticide residues present in the regurgitated pellets and with the percentages of pellets detected having such residues (R2 ≥ 0.44, P < 0.05). Similarly, the mean clutch size of barn owls was negatively correlated with the mean concentration of rodenticide residues and with the percentages of pellets detected with these residues. However, the correlation was not significantly different (R2 ≥ 0.34, P > 0.05). In general, the higher the amount of residues detected, the lower the breeding performance parameters measured in this study. © 2014 Raptor Protection of Slovakia (RPS).

ABSTRACT: Mobility and irruptive movements have been proposed as mechanisms that could allow some diet specialists to inhabit and breed in environments with highly unpredictable resources, like the arctic tundra. The snowy owl, one of the main avian predators of the tundra, is known to specialize on lemmings during the breeding season. These small mammals are also well known for their tremendous spatial and temporal variations in abundance. We examined the spring (pre-breeding, from March to June) movements of snowy owls by tracking 9 breeding females in the Canadian Arctic for up to 3 yr with satellite transmitters. We used state-space modeling to assess searching behavior and measure breeding dispersal distances. We also ascertain lemming abundance at some of the sites used by the marked owls. Tracked owls displayed searching movements for extended periods (up to 108 d) and traveled over large distances (up to 4093 km) each spring. The distance between furthest apart searching areas in a given year averaged 828 km (range 220 to 2433 km). Settlement date, distance between searching areas, traveled distance and the duration of prospecting movements were longer in the year where density of lemmings recorded in the eastern High-Arctic (Bylot Island) was lowest. Nonetheless, snowy owls settled in areas where local lemming abundance was relatively high. Individual breeding dispersal distance between consecutive years averaged 725 km (range 18 to 2224). Overall, the high mobility of female snowy owls allowed these diet specialists to behave as irruptive migrants and to sustain their reproductive activities during consecutive years even under highly fluctuating resources. © 2014 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: As a governmentally approved domestic entity for Space Situational Awareness, Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI) is developing and operating an optical telescopes system, Optical Wide-field PatroL (OWL) Network. During the test phase of this system, it is necessary to determine the range of brightness of the observable satellites. We have defined standard magnitude for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites to calibrate their luminosity in terms of standard parameters such as distance, phase angle, and angular rate. In this work, we report the optical brightness range of five LEO Satellites using OWL-Net. © 2015. The Korean Space Science Society.

ABSTRACT: We examined blood smears from 139 Northern Saw-whet Owls (Aegolius acadicus) to ascertain the prevalence of haematozoa in this species during fall migration in eastern North America. Owls were captured with mist nets on the Mohonk Preserve near New Paltz, New York from 1 October to 2 December 2011. We examined blood smears under an optical microscope at 200× and 1000× magnification, and observed four genera of haematozoa, Haemoproteus, Leucocytozoon, Plasmodium, and Trypanosoma, in addition to a genus or genera of microfilarial nematodes, unidentifiable by morphology. We found haematozoa in blood smears from both male and female Northern Saw-whet Owls and in both age groups sampled, i.e., hatching year and after hatching year. Leucocytozoon was the most common parasite, with an overall prevalence of 49.6%. Prevalence of Haemoproteus, microfilaria, Plasmodium, and Trypanosoma was 5.0%, 5.0%, 10.0%, and 2.9% respectively, and overall occurrence of infection was 64%. We found no difference in body condition of individuals compared by age, infection status, or intensity of infection. To our knowledge, this is the first record of Plasmodium in Northern Saw-whet Owls, and the first study to document five genera of haematozoa in Northern Saw-whet Owls during fall migration. Revealing new host-parasite information, this study contributes to the information portfolio of Northern Saw-whet Owls and, thus, may influence future research. © 2014 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: When a bird population is facing extinction, ecologically artificial conservation actions such as feeding and captive breeding may be considered as temporary efforts to rescue the population remains until environmental conditions for a self-sustaining population have been restored. Population viability analysis can be used to evaluate different management options for endangered bird populations. Here we use the program VORTEX to explore different management strategies using the Danish population of Little Owl (Athene noctua) as a model species. The Little Owl is declining in several countries, including Denmark, where lack of food during the breeding season has been identified as the main reason for the decline. Four scenarios were run, simulating 25 years of population dynamics: (1) "do nothing" scenario, (2) captive breeding scenario where individuals are supplemented to the population, (3) food supplementation or habitat improvement scenario and (4) scenario combining captive breeding and food supplementation/habitat improvements. In scenarios where no management actions were taken the population went extinct within 12 years. When supplementing individuals continuously the population remained extant but the population size remained small. Food supplementation/habitat improvements can restore the population, though there must be capacity to secure food/habitat for a minimum of 100 individuals to minimize genetic losses. By combining food supplementation and the release of captive bred individuals, the population has a chance of being restored and become independent of human aid. This study exemplifies how management scenarios can be used to guide managers to make informed decisions.

ABSTRACT: A principal challenge of federal forest management has been maintaining and improving habitat for sensitive species in forests adapted to frequent, low- to moderate-intensity fire regimes that have become increasingly vulnerable to uncharacteristically severe wildfires. To enhance forest resilience, a coordinated landscape fuel network was installed in the northern Sierra Nevada, which reduced the potential for hazardous fire, despite constraints for wildlife protection that limited the extent and intensity of treatments. Small mammal and songbird communities were largely unaffected by this landscape strategy, but the number of California spotted owl territories declined. The effects on owls could have been mitigated by increasing the spatial heterogeneity of fuel treatments and by using more prescribed fire or managed wildfire to better mimic historic vegetation patterns and processes. More landscape-scale experimentation with strategies that conserve key wildlife species while also improving forest resiliency is needed, especially in response to continued warming climates. © The Author(s) 2014.

ABSTRACT: The mitochondrial genome of Brown wood owl is a 16,308-bp circular molecule, which contains 37 typical mitochondrial genes (13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNAs and 22 tRNAs) and a 741-bp A + T-rich region. Its gene arrangement pattern is identical with typical bird species. All protein-coding genes start with an ATG codon. TAA is the most frequent stop codon, and TAG and T-are also occurred very common. The mtDNA sequence contains 12S rRNA and 16S rRNA of rRNA. Except for tRNASer(AGY)and tRNALeu(CUN)without the dihydrouridine (DHU) arm, all tRNAs could be folded into canonical cloverleaf secondary structures. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Habitat-specialists have narrower niches, but achieve higher or similar peak performance (e.g. occurrence probability, ψ) than habitat-generalists along resource gradients that may be selected from the stand- to landscape-levels. Understanding the relationship between niche width and ψ of forest owls will facilitate the development of appropriate management recommendations for their conservation. We assessed ψ of the threatened habitat-specialist rufous-legged owls (. Strix rufipes) and habitat-generalist austral pygmy-owls (. Glaucidium nana) across three spatial scales, and tested whether they differed in resource utilization and peak ψ in temperate forests of southern Chile. We conducted 1145 broadcast surveys at 101 sites and used multi-season occupancy models, accounting for imperfect detection, to estimate ψ. For S. rufipes, ψ ranged between 0.05 and 1 across sites, and was positively associated with the variability (standard deviation, SD) in diameter at breast height (DBH) of trees and bamboo understory density. For G. nana, ψ ranged between 0.67 and 0.98, and was positively associated with forest-patch shape index (irregularity and edge effects) and forest cover at 180. ha, although the parameter estimates were imprecise. Relative to G. nana, S. rufipes had lower total resource utilization due to lower ψ over gradients of all covariates, but achieved similar peak ψ for resources related with stand-level forest complexity and forest stability at the landscape scale. Occurrence of habitat-specialist owls will be promoted if multi-aged stands with a variety of tree sizes (SD of DBH. =. 19.9. ±. 9. cm), including large old-growth trees, with relatively high bamboo cover (34.2. ±. 26.6%), are retained. Landscapes with forest cover >63.5% would also favor occurrence by habitat-specialist owls. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Environmental variation across space and time can strongly influence life-history strategies in vertebrates. It has been shown that the reproductive success of birds of prey is closely related to food availability. However, relatively little is known about intraspecific differences in reproductive success of birds in relation to varying ecological conditions across environmental gradients. We investigated the reproductive performance of Tengmalm's Owls Aegolius funereus in a temperate (Czech Republic, 50°N) and a boreal (Finland, 63°N) population in relation to long-term variations in the abundance of their main prey (small rodents). Prey densities at the northern site were much higher, but there were also large inter-annual fluctuations and years with steep summer declines of vole densities. Northern owls laid larger clutches but offspring production per nest was similar at both study sites. This resulted from higher nestling mortality in the northern population, especially in nests established later in the season. Despite much greater nesting losses due to predation by Pine Martens Martes martes, productivity at the population level was about four times greater at the temperate site, mainly due to the much higher breeding densities compared with Finland. Tengmalm's Owls at the temperate study site may benefit from relatively stable prey abundance, a more diverse prey community that offers alternative prey during vole scarcity, longer nights in summer that allow more time for foraging, and a lower level of interspecific competition with other vole-specialized predators. © 2015 British Ornithologists' Union.

ABSTRACT: Enzymes are used in industries for variety of purposes. Microbial keratinase enzyme offer a substantial advantage of degrading keratin waste. In large amount of keratin are present in the soil, nail, hairs, feather and poultry. In many microorganisms are secreted keratinase degrading enzyme used in our study were isolated from poultry waste soil and feathers. The isolates were obtained from culture filtrate was measured in units by keratinolytic activity and their activity was measured used by different incubation periods pH, temperature and different agitation. The highest enzyme activity was observed at 50°C and pH 8 .The enzyme was stable at 40 to 50°C. It was found to be highly stable within the range of 5- 8.5 pH values. Complete feather degradation was achieved at pH 8, inoculum size 2%, agitation rate 200 rpm, and incubation temperature 37°C, incubation period for 48 h. Feather keratin is highly resistant to degradation, but some keratinase produced microorganisms can easily degraded insoluble keratins. These keratinase produced species have an important application in removal of poultry waste and recycled into valuable by product. Maximum feather degrading activity attained at the optimal conditions. In practical applications, keratinase is a useful enzyme for promoting the hydrolysis of feather keratin and improving the digestibility of feather meal. The aim of this study to identify new keratinolytic bacteria and its optimum parameters for higher feather degradation at pH 8 and 500C, with potential application in biotechnological processes.

ABSTRACT: IFN-induced restriction factors can significantly affect the replicative capacity of retroviruses in mammals. TRIM5α (tripartite motif protein 5, isoform α) is a restriction factor that acts at early stages of the virus life cycle by intercepting and destabilizing incoming retroviral cores. Sensitivity to TRIM5α maps to the N-terminal domain of the retroviral capsid proteins. In several New World and Old World monkey species, independent events of retrotransposon-mediated insertion of the cyclophilin A (CypA)-coding sequence in the trim5 gene have given rise to TRIMCyp (also called TRIM5-CypA), a hybrid protein that is active against some lentiviruses in a species-specific fashion. In particular, TRIMCyp from the owl monkey (omkTRIMCyp) very efficiently inhibits human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Previously, we showed that disrupting the integrity of microtubules (MTs) and of cytoplasmic dynein complexes partially rescued replication of retroviruses, including HIV-1, from restriction mediated by TRIM5α. Here, we showed that efficient restriction of HIV-1 by omkTRIMCyp was similarly dependent on the MT network and on dynein complexes, but in a context-dependent fashion. When omkTRIMCyp was expressed in human HeLa cells, restriction was partially counteracted by pharmacological agents targeting MTs or by small interfering RNA-mediated inhibition of dynein. The same drugs (nocodazole and paclitaxel) also rescued HIV-1 from restriction in cat CRFK cells, although to a lesser extent. Strikingly, neither nocodazole, paclitaxel nor depletion of the dynein heavy chain had a significant effect on the restriction of HIV-1 in an owl monkey cell line. These results suggested the existence of cellspecific functional interactions between MTs/dynein and TRIMCyp. © 2015 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: An algorithm to automatically extract coordinate and time information from optical observation data of geostationary orbit satellites (GEO satellites) or geosynchronous orbit satellites (GOS satellites) is developed. The optical wide-field patrol system is capable of automatic observation using a pre-arranged schedule. Therefore, if this type of automatic analysis algorithm is available, daily unmanned monitoring of GEO satellites can be possible. For data acquisition for development, the COMS1 satellite was observed with 1-s exposure time and 1-m interval. The images were grouped and processed in terms of "action", and each action was composed of six or nine successive images. First, a reference image with the best quality in one action was selected. Next, the rest of the images in the action were geometrically transformed to fit in the horizontal coordinate system (expressed in azimuthal angle and elevation) of the reference image. Then, these images were median-combined to retain only the possible non-moving GEO candidates. By reverting the coordinate transformation of the positions of these GEO satellite candidates, the final coordinates could be calculated. © The Korean Space Science Society.

ABSTRACT: Background: Tracking individual animals using satellite telemetry has improved our understanding of animal movements considerably. Nonetheless, thorough statistical treatment of Argos datasets is often jeopardized by their coarse temporal resolution. State-space modelling can circumvent some of the inherent limitations of Argos datasets, such as the limited temporal resolution of locations and the lack of information pertaining to the behavioural state of the tracked individuals at each location. We coupled state-space modelling with environmental characterisation of modelled locations on a 3-year Argos dataset of 9 breeding snowy owls to assess whether searching behaviour for breeding sites was affected by snow cover and depth in an arctic predator that shows a lack of breeding site fidelity. Results: The state-space modelling approach allowed the discrimination of two behavioural states (searching and moving) during pre-breeding movements. Tracked snowy owls constantly switched from moving to searching behaviour during pre-breeding movements from mid-March to early June. Searching events were more likely where snow cover and depth was low. This suggests that snowy owls adapt their searching effort to environmental conditions encountered along their path. Conclusions: This modelling technique increases our understanding of movement ecology and behavioural decisions of individual animals both locally and globally according to environmental variables. © 2015 Therrien et al.

ABSTRACT: Barn owls do not immediately approach a source after they hear a sound, but wait for a second sound before they strike. This represents a gain in striking behavior by avoiding responses to random incidents. However, the first stimulus is also expected to change the threshold for perceiving the subsequent second sound, thus possibly introducing some costs. We mimicked this situation in a behavioral double-stimulus paradigm utilizing saccadic head turns of owls. The first stimulus served as an adapter, was presented in frontal space, and did not elicit a head turn. The second stimulus, emitted from a peripheral source, elicited the head turn. The time interval between both stimuli was varied. Data obtained with double stimulation were compared with data collected with a single stimulus from the same positions as the second stimulus in the double-stimulus paradigm. Sound-localization performance was quantified by the response latency, accuracy, and precision of the head turns. Response latency was increased with double stimuli, while accuracy and precision were decreased. The effect depended on the inter-stimulus interval. These results suggest that waiting for a second stimulus may indeed impose costs on sound localization by adaptation and this reduces the gain obtained by waiting for a second stimulus. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: The quantification of shifts in bird distributions in response to climate change provides an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the processes that influence species persistence. We used data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) to document changes in the distributional limits of the western Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia hypugaea) from 1967 to 2008. We used logistic regression to model presence probability (p) as a function of longitude, latitude, and year. We modeled a linear trend in logit(p) through time with slope and intercept modeled as a double Fourier series of longitude and latitude. We found that the western Burrowing Owl has experienced an intriguing southward shift in the northern half of its breeding range, contrary to what is predicted by most species niche models and what has been observed for many other species in North America. The breeding range of the Burrowing Owl has been shrinking near its northern, western, and eastern edges. Our model detected the population declines that were observed in California and eastern Washington, in locations where maps based on route-specific estimating equations had predicted significant population increases. We suggest that the northern boundary of the breeding distribution of the western Burrowing Owl has contracted southward and the southern boundary of the species' breeding distribution has expanded southward into areas of northern Mexico that were formerly used only by wintering migrants. © 2015 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: By using the Optical Wide-field Patrol (OWL) network developed by the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI) we generated the right ascension and declination angle data from optical observation of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. We performed an analysis to verify the optimum number of observations needed per arc for successful estimation of orbit. The currently functioning OWL observatories are located in Daejeon (South Korea), Songino (Mongolia), and Oukaïmeden (Morocco). The Daejeon Observatory is functioning as a test bed. In this study, the observed targets were Gravity Probe B, COSMOS 1455, COSMOS 1726, COSMOS 2428, SEASAT 1, ATV-5, and CryoSat-2 (all in LEO). These satellites were observed from the test bed and the Songino Observatory of the OWL network during 21 nights in 2014 and 2015. After we estimated the orbit from systematically selected sets of observation points (20, 50, 100, and 150) for each pass, we compared the difference between the orbit estimates for each case, and the Two Line Element set (TLE) from the Joint Space Operation Center (JSpOC). Then, we determined the average of the difference and selected the optimal observation points by comparing the average values. © 2015. The Korean Space Science Society.

ABSTRACT: Three species of thorny-headed worms of the genus Centrorhynchus were found to parasitize birds of prey and owls in the territory of the Slovakia during the years 2012–2014. Out of 286 examined bird individuals belonging to 23 species, only Buteo buteo, Buteo rufinus, Falco tinnunculus (Falconiformes), Asio otus, Strix aluco, Strix uralensis and Tyto alba (Strigiformes) were infected by acanthocephalans. All the bird species except for S. aluco represent new host records for Slovakia. The most prevalent acanthocephalan Centrorhynchus aluconis was detected in all 15 examined birds of non-migratory Ural owl S. uralensis (P = 100 %); however, it was found occasionally also in two individuals of the tawny owl S. aluco (P = 20 %), one long-eared owl A. otus (P = 7.7 %), one barn owl T. alba (P = 33.3 %) and the common buzzard B. buteo (P = 0.8 %). Two other thorny-headed worms occurred exclusively in Falconiformes in raw or mixed infections: Centrorhynchus buteonis was found in 11 individuals of B. buteo (P = 9.2 %), and two birds (B. buteo and B. rufinus) were parasitized simultaneously by C. buteonis and the species Centrorhynchus globocaudatus. Moreover, the latest, relatively rare acanthocephalan was found alone in two common kestrels F. tinnunculus (P = 2.7 %). Regarding intensity of infection, it ranged from a single female of C. buteonis, C. globocaudatus or C. aluconis per host (four cases) to a maximum of 82 C. aluconis per an Ural owl. The difference in acanthocephalan species spectrum between birds of prey and owls in Slovakia was apparent. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: This paper examines the possibility of storing OWL 2 based ontology information in a classical relational database and reviews some existing methods for ontology databases. In most cases a database is a fitting solution for storing and sharing information among systems, clients or agents. Similarly, in order to make domain ontology information more accessible to systems, in a comparable way, it can be stored and provided in a database form. As of today, there is no consensus on a specific ontology database structure. The main focus of this paper is specifically on OWL 2 as a basis for the description of ontology centric information in a database. The Web Ontology Language OWL 2 is a language for describing ontology information for the Semantic Web. As such it consists of a list of reserved words and grammatical rules for defining many parts of ontology knowledge. Based on this language specification this paper examines the possibility of storing information in a relational database for the description of domain ontology information. By creating a database structure based on OWL2 it is feasible to obtain an approach to storing information about the domain ontology in an utilizable way, by using its descriptive abilities. Nowadays multiple approaches to storing ontology information and OWL in databases exist; most of them are based on storing RDF data or provide persistence for specific OWL software libraries. The examination of the existing approaches provided in this paper, shows how they differ from the goal of obtaining a general, more easily usable and less software library specific database for domain ontology centric information. This paper describes a version of a simple relational database capable of holding and providing ontology knowledge on demand, which can be implemented on a database management system of choice. © Rezekne Higher Education Institution (Rēzeknes Augstskola), Rezekne 2015.

ABSTRACT: This research was conducted to reveal the characteristics of breeding ecology of oriental scops owl (Otus sunia stictonotus) inhabiting in South Korea according to the nest types during the breeding season from march to October for two years (2011 and 2012). Oriental scops owl nested in woodpecker’s nest holes (46.1%), natural tree holes (38.5%), and artificial wood boxes (15.4%). These nests were located on following trees: Zelkova serrata, Paulownia coreana, Celtis sinensis, Salix chaenomeloides, Salix babylonica, Fraxinus rhynchophylla, Robinia pseudoacacia and Platanus occidentalis. The hatching success was 91.4%, fledging success was 83.0%, and breeding success was 75.9%. The factors of the breeding failure were falling (57.1%), abandonment (28.6%), hatching failure (7.1%), and others with unknown cause of death (7.1%). According to nest types, the fledging success (69.2%) of woodpecker’s nest holes were low and the hatching success (79.2%) of natural tree holes were also low due to hatching failure and abandonment. However, hatching success, fledging success, breeding success were high in the artificial nests as all the eggs hatched and succeeded in fledging. Therefore, we suggested that artificial nests can cover the weaknesses of natural nests as well as increasing the breeding success. However, long-term research on installation place, height, and hole sizes of the artificial nest are required in order to clearly reveal the effects on the breeding success of oriental scops owl. © 2015 Ecological Society of Korea.

ABSTRACT: In this paper new mitochondrial COI sequences of Common Barn Owl Tyto alba (Scopoli, 1769) and Short-eared Owl Asio flammeus (Pontoppidan, 1763) from southern Chile are reported and compared with sequences from other parts of the World. The intraspecific genetic divergence (mean p-distance) was 4.6 to 5.5% for the Common Barn Owl in comparison with specimens from northern Europe and Australasia and 3.1% for the Short-eared Owl with respect to samples from north America, northern Europe and northern Asia. Phylogenetic analyses revealed three distinctive groups for the Common Barn Owl: (i) South America (Chile and Argentina) plus Central and North America, (ii) northern Europe and (iii) Australasia, and two distinctive groups for the Short-eared Owl: (i) South America (Chile and Argentina) and (ii) north America plus northern Europe and northern Asia. The level of genetic divergence observed in both species exceeds the upper limit of intraspecific comparisons reported previously for Strigiformes. Therefore, this suggests that further research is needed to assess the taxonomic status, particularly for the Chilean populations that, to date, have been identified as belonging to these species through traditional taxonomy. © Nelson Colihueque et al.

ABSTRACT: This paper describes the frequency of Barking Owl Ninox connivens loud ('barking') calls over one dry and one wet season in 1981-82 at Kapalga within Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory, Australia. A single recording site was located on the fringe of the tree-less seasonally inundated black soil floodplain of the South Alligator River where prey are common, especially Dusky Rats Rattus colletti. Up to three pairs of Barking Owls were recorded calling in bouts throughout the year but they called more frequently both hourly and nightly (mean 2 127 loud calls/night) in dry season months (April-December) when they were probably breeding, than in the peak monsoon season months (January- March, mean 212 loud calls/night). Barking Owls are relatively more common and more widely distributed in tropical northern Australia than in temperate eastern and southern Australia where populations are localised, uncommon to rare and declining mainly due to the decline and fragmentation of their habitat. It is therefore vital to leave suitable habitats in the Northern Territory and elsewhere in the Top End of Australia to preserve current populations of Barking Owls and their prey.

ABSTRACT: Summary: Newcastle disease is a contagious and often fatal disease, capable of affecting all species of birds. A velogenic Newcastle disease virus (vNDV) outbreak occurred in an Israeli zoo, in which Little owls (Athene noctua) and African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) were found positive for presence of NDV. Some of them have died. The diagnostic process included: post-mortem examination, histopathology, real-time RT-PCR assay, virus isolation, serology, intracerebral pathogenicity index and phylogenetic analysis. A vNDV was diagnosed and found to be closely related to isolates from vNDV outbreaks that occurred in commercial poultry flocks during 2011. All isolates were classified as lineage 5d. © 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

ABSTRACT: An adult barn owl (Tyto alba) was brought with complete oblique compound fracture of the tibiotarsus bone. After aseptic preparation of site and local infiltration with Lignocaine HCl (2%) an intramedullary pin was introduced in retrograde manner and the fracture was reduced. The muscles and skin were sutured routinely. Thin layer of plaster cast was applied leaving the area of wound open for dressing .Post operatively inj. Taxim 50mg and Dexona 0.3ml for 3 days were given. The owl showed uneventful recovery three weeks following surgery and was able to fly properly after removal of intramedullary pin.

ABSTRACT: This note details two roosting Eastern Grass Owls Tyto longimembris flushed from a wheat crop by a combine harvester near Bellata in the Brigalow Belt South bioregion (northern inland plains) of New South Wales, in October-November 2013. Despite the observer searching on foot in a remnant of unharvested crop 9 × 500 m, a Grass Owl, known to be within the crop, evaded detection by walking, until flushed by the harvester. The flushed Owls retreated to a nearby dry gully vegetated with tall ground-cover. No nest and no owlets were found in the crop. The farmer considered that Grass Owls have occurred in his corn, sorghum and wheat crops over decades, although they appear to be absent in winter, after crops have been harvested. Crops may provide food (rodents) and roost-sites for the Owls, and/or may substitute for lost natural wetland habitats in the region. Further investigation of the Grass Owl's occurence in the sheep-wheat belt is warranted.

ABSTRACT: The worldwide distribution of Trichinella pseudospiralis, the first discovered non-encapsulated Trichinella species infecting both mammals and avian hosts, has been suggested to be attributed to bird migration. At present, the knowledge on the role of carnivorous avian species as a reservoir hosts in Europe is still limited. Thus, the aim of this research was to screen for T. pseudospiralis in raptorial, carrion-feeding, and scavenging birds in Sweden and Slovakia, where the parasite has been previously documented in wildlife. In total, 212 pectoral muscle samples of carnivorous birds from Slovakia (n = 153) and Sweden (n = 59) were examined for the presence of Trichinella larvae using standard artificial digestion method. Out of 12 Accipitridae species, 4 Falconidae species, 2 Strigidae species, 1 Tytonidae species, and 4 Corvidae species examined within our study, muscle larvae were found in two non-migratory tawny owls (Strix aluco) from one geographical region of Sweden. Histological and molecular methods confirmed the presence of T. pseudospiralis. This is the first report of this parasite in an avian species in Sweden and the second report in European birds. © 2014, Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Wien.

ABSTRACT: The regular consumption of foods containing probiotic bacteria has beneficial physiological effects on the health and the digestion system. There is a need for novel analytical approaches for the determination of these bacteria that are faster than the classical plate counting method. For this purpose, two label-free biosensors were investigated and presented in this paper: Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) and Optical Waveguide Lightmode Spectroscopy (OWLS) based direct immunosensors were developed for real-time direct detection of probiotic bacteria in fermented dairy products. Bifidobacterium bifidum O1356 and Lactobacillus acidophilus O1132 were detected by polyclonal anti- B. bifidum IgG and anti- L. acidophilus IgG immobilized on the sensors' surface.Sulfo-LC-SPDP cross linking agent was used to bind antibodies to the gold surface of the QCM's AT-cut quartz wafer. Concerning OWLS, antibodies were covalently bound to the amino groups of the silanized surface of the waveguide by glutaraldehyde. The dynamic measuring range was found between 1.0E+3 and 5.0E+5CFUmL-1 in 100 fold diluted fermented milk products by QCM and with OWLS. Considering the current legislation of the probiotic content in probiotic products, the two developed immunosensors can be applied for rapid quantification of L. acidophilus and B. bifidum in fermented milk. These examinations offer effective alternatives to the microbiological plate counting method. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Dispersal is a key process influencing population dynamics and gene flow in species. Despite this, little is known about breeding dispersal in threatened Mexican Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis lucida), here defined as movement of a non-juvenile owl between territories where it had the opportunity to breed. We observed 28 cases of breeding dispersal during a study of color-banded Mexican Spotted Owls in the Sacramento Mountains, New Mexico, 2003-2011. This represented 4.9% of total opportunities to disperse (n = 575 observed occasions, range = 0-9.0% of owls dispersing per yr). Breeding dispersal probability was greater for single owls and paired owls whose mate disappeared or moved than for paired owls whose mate remained in the original territory, greater for subadult than for adult owls, and greater for owls that failed to reproduce the year prior to dispersing than for owls that reproduced successfully. There was some evidence that dispersal probability was greater for female owls and that females dispersed greater distances than males, but dispersal distances generally were small for both sexes of owls (mean distance = 5.1 and 3.6 km for females and males, respectively). All dispersing owls were paired the first year they were observed in their new territory. Breeding dispersal appeared to occur regularly but at relatively low levels in this population, and dispersal probability appeared to be associated with owl social status, reproductive status, and age prior to dispersal. Because most dispersing owls either were unpaired or lost their mate, and because most failed to reproduce the year prior to dispersal, these owls generally were able to improve their social status and reproductive success by dispersing. © 2014 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Deuterium (2H) has been used to track movements of land birds, under the assumption that δ2H in precipitation (δ2Hp) and δ2H in bird feathers (δ2Hf) are correlated across broad geographic gradients. The nature of this correlation has been evaluated only in a small percentage of the birds that breed in North America. We sampled Western Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia hypugaea) feathers of known origin (nestling feathers) at 36 locations throughout North America (from southern Canada to central Mexico). We used a modification of the "comparative equilibrium" technique of Wassenaar and Hobson (2003) to measure the δ2H of nonexchangeable hydrogen in feather samples. We characterized the strength of the relationship between δ2Hf and amount-weighted mean annual δ2Hp in a raptor that breeds in arid grasslands and deserts throughout western North America. We used a Bayesian hierarchical approach to model the δ2Hfδ2Hp relationship, accounting for levels of intrinsic and extrinsic variation in δ2Hf. We found a linear relationship between δ2Hf and δ2Hp (δ2Hf=-13.48+0.78 δ2Hp; 95% credible interval (slope): 0.55-1.01) and used this relationship to construct a feather deuterium isoscape map. We observed relatively high levels of variation in mean δ2Hf across locations (SD=11.01%), due in part to variation in the contribution of precipitation to local food webs, and substantial variation among individuals within locations (SD = 6.68%). Our data demonstrate that δ2Hf of juvenile Burrowing Owls can be used to infer local amount-weighted mean annual δ2Hp from the location of origin. Deuterium remains a valuable tool for tracking continental-scale raptor movements, with the caveat that researchers must identify and model for potential discontinuities in the δ2Hf-δ2Hp relationship in their inferences. However, isotopic discontinuities, coupled with a high relative abundance of individuals in those areas, can seriously hinder the usefulness of deuterium for identifying the origin of individual birds. © 2015 American Ornithologists' Union.

ABSTRACT: Pygmy owls of the genus Glaucidium prey on large insect and small vertebrates, mostly birds. Among the birds preyed on by pygmy owls are hummingbirds, caught mostly while mobbing these owlets or when still at nestling stage. I report here on the Ferruginous Pygmy Owl (Glaucidium brasilianum) snatching flower-visiting hummingbirds in an orchard at a farm in southwestern Brazil. I recorded one White-tailed Goldenthroat (Polytmus guainumbi) and three Gilded Hummingbirds (Hylocharis chrysura) preyed on by this owlet on three consecutive days. The large concentration of flowers and, consequently, of hummingbirds in the orchard likely contributed to the hunting success of the owlet on such fleeting and quickly moving prey. The role this pygmy owl plays on predation of adult hummingbirds in the Neotropics merits closer consideration. © 2015, Sociedade Brasileira de Ornitologia. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The study of tradeoffs among life-history traits has long been key to understanding the evolution of life-history strategies. However, more recently, evolutionary ecologists have realized that reproductive costs have the potential to influence population dynamics. Here, we tested for costs of reproduction in the California Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis), and assessed whether costs of reproduction in year t - 1 on reproduction in year t could be responsible for regionally synchronized biennial cycles in reproductive output. Logistic regression analysis and multistate mark-recapture models with state uncertainty revealed that breeding reduced the likelihood of reproducing in the subsequent year by 16% to 38%, but had no influence on subsequent survival. We also found that costs of reproduction in year t - 1 were correlated with climatic conditions in year t, with evidence of higher costs during the dry phase of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. Using a simulation-based population model, we showed that strong reproductive costs had the potential to create biennial cycles in population-level reproductive output; however, estimated costs of reproduction appeared to be too small to explain patterns observed in Spotted Owls. In the absence of strong reproductive costs, we hypothesize that observed natural cycles in the reproductive output of Spotted Owls are related to as-yet-unmeasured, regionally concordant fluctuations in environmental conditions or prey resources. Despite theoretical evidence for demographic effects, our analyses illustrate that linking tradeoffs to actual changes in population processes will be challenging because of the potential confounding effects of individual and environmental variation. © 2015 American Ornithologists' Union.

ABSTRACT: This paper extends previous observations of behavioural development in Powerful Owl Ninox strenua fledglings. The study combines a near-daily visual monitoring program on a pair of owlets in Oatley, suburban Sydney, New South Wales, with corresponding pellet analysis. The fledglings were initially fed on possums, fruit-bats, birds and insects, and first demonstrated independence by disassembling carcasses by themselves. By October, they apparently mimicked the adults' strategy for capturing insects, and began to chase birds and bats. Behaviours thought to be part of honing their hunting skills - including tearing and ferrying strips of bark, foliage-snatching, and swooping at animals on the ground - were recorded. Such actions intensified during a period when the adults were mostly absent in November and December.

ABSTRACT: The mite family Ascouracaridae Gaud et Atyeo, 1976 contains large-sized mites (mostly > 1 mm) which live inside the quills of birds of several orders. To date, no representative of this family has been found associated with the order Strigiformes (owls). In this paper, a new species of this family, Cystoidosoma hermaphroditus sp. n., is described from the tropical screech owl, Megascops choliba (Vieillot) (Aves: Strigiformes) from Brazil. This species is unique in having an external spermaduct, a primary duct and a rudimentary bursa copulatrix present in males. This is the first astigmatan feather mite described from the order Strigiformes in this country. A key to adults of the genus Cystoidosoma Gaud et Atyeo, 1976 of the world is presented. © Institute of Parasitology, Biology Centre CAS.

ABSTRACT: Parental behavior modifies neural, physiologic, and behavioral characteristics of both maternal and paternal mammals. These parenting-induced modifications extend to brain regions not typically associated with parental responses themselves but that enhance ancillary responses, such as foraging efficiency and predator avoidance. Here we hypothesized that male and female owl monkeys (Aotus spp.) with reproductive experience (RE) would demonstrate more adaptive ancillary behavioral and neuroendocrine responses than those of their nonRE counterparts. To assess cognitive skills and coping flexibility, we introduced a foraging strategy task, including a set of novel objects (coin holders) marked with different symbols representing different food rewards, to the animals. To assess endocrine responses, urine samples were assayed for cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) levels and their ratios to determine physiologic measures of emotional regulation in RE and nonRE owl monkeys. Compared with nonRE monkeys, experienced parents had higher DHEA:cortisol ratios after exposure to habituation training and on the first day of testing in the foraging task. Both hormones play critical roles in the stress response and coping mechanisms, and a high DHEA:cortisol ratio usually indicates increased coping skills. In addition, RE monkeys exhibited more efficient foraging responses (by 4-fold) than did the nonRE mating pairs. We conclude that RE modifies relevant behavioral and hormonal responses of both maternal and paternal owl monkeys exposed to a challenging cognitive paradigm. Corroborating previous research demonstrating adaptive modifications in foraging efficiency and emotional responses in reproductively experienced rodents, the current results extend these findings to a monogamous primate species.

ABSTRACT: Long-eared owl Asio otus is a specialist predator, hunting primarily upon voles Microtus spp. Because size of the territory and breeding success of the predator depend on food availability, the number of long-eared owls wintering in a given locality is likely determined by the local abundance of voles. The amplitude and regularity of their cycle have been recently diminished and quantitative assessment of such a cycle is currently unavailable. Diet and number of wintering owls were monitored during two winters (2005/06 and 2006/07) in Busko-Zdrój and Pińczów (south-central Poland). It was found that number of voles is still a factor determining number of wintering owls, also every flock in particular locality has its' own dynamics of owl number. Research on predators' diet - especially specialists like long-eared owl - is nowadays very important because of vole fluctuation cycle disturbances caused mainly by global warming.

ABSTRACT: Since evolutionary process is slow, the human brain was adapted to the ancestral rather than todays environment. Therefore, genetic predisposition of young people to nocturnal lifestyle requires explanation. The pattern of age- and sex-associated differences revealed from self-reports of 2054 native and non-native residents of Turkmenia, Siberia, Yakutia, Chukotka and Alaska suggested that late bedtime preference might has evolved under sexual selection pressure. Moreover, simulation of experimental data on prolonged wakefulness indicated that differences between people preferring early, late and extremely late bedtimes (n = 39, 53 and 38, respectively) on wave-forms of their alertness rhythm can be explained by a relatively small circadian phase delay. It was hypothesized that, due to sexual division of daytime labour in ancestral societies, the late bedtime preference evolved to solve an adaptive problem of creation of early night lek for displaying throughout courtship various human-specific behaviours advertising high cognitive, music, gymnastic, artistic, language and humour abilities. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

ABSTRACT: Two localities with unsuccessful breeding of Eagle Owls were found in the Kazanlak Valley (0.25 pair/100 sq. km). Mammals (41.3% by number, 47.9% by biomass) and birds (56.2% by number, 52.0% by biomass) predominated in the diet among 72 animal taxa. Most important prey species were Erinaceus roumanicus (7.4% by number, 21.3% by biomass) and Rattus norvegicus (8.8% by number, 7.4% by biomass), within a broad food niche with a high number of birds. The quantitative parameters of carnivore mammals and birds (11.5% by number, 20.4% by biomass) were much higher than their mean values in Europe and on the Balkan Peninsula. The open non-forested lands were the main hunting habitats but wetlands were the most exploited ones according to their small surfaces in the main hunting area and disproportionate numerous inhabitants in the diets. The small number of breeding birds, later clutches, higher diet diversity with considerable share of mesopredators, in the Eagle Owls studied could be a result of decreasing supply of the preferred prey (following the food stress hypothesis), as well as of inhabiting suboptimal territories in the valley. © 2015, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.

ABSTRACT: In addition to environmental factors, social variables such as group size may play an important role in explaining primate ranging patterns. In this study we investigated range sizes, site fidelity, and range overlaps of owl monkeys (Aotus azarae) in Northern Argentina. We calculated the size of home range and core areas for 18 groups in our study area. For the six most intensively studied groups we tested whether precipitation as a crude proxy for food availability or group size had an influence on range size, assessed the degree of site fidelity by quantifying overlaps of annual ranges and core areas, and calculated the amount of range overlap between neighboring groups for each year. We used the kernel density estimation method to calculate home ranges as 90% kernel and core areas as 50% kernel. Home range size (mean ± SD) was 6.2 ha (± 1.8) and core area size 1.9 (± 0.6). Rainfall and group size were not statistically significant predictors of range sizes. Site fidelity was high, with a range overlap of 82% (± 11) between consecutive years. Neighboring groups overlapped over 48% (± 15) of the outer parts of their group ranges and 11% (± 15) of their core areas. We found no evidence that larger groups occupy larger areas than smaller groups, suggesting that food availability might be above a critical threshold for owl monkeys so that larger groups do not need to extend their foraging areas to meet their energy requirements. Our findings indicate that ranges remain stable over several years as groups visit the same locations of fruit trees within their range. We showed that owl monkeys exhibit a considerable degree of range overlap. However, we suggest that this range overlap might be spatial rather than temporal, which maximizes access to clumped feeding resources in overlapping areas that are used at distinct times, while excluding other males from access to females in exclusively used areas. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: Background: Ovarian function and morphology of owl monkeys (Aotus spp.) is inadequately known, but it is essential to describe this organ in detail to better understand reproductive patterns of the species. Methods: This study reports the anatomical and histological features of the ovaries from 41 owl monkeys, considering their reproductive status and parity. Results: The corpora lutea (CL) and reproductive state had a significant effect on ovarian volume. Follicles were observed in both pregnant and non-pregnant subjects. All females in the luteal phase and pregnant females showed at least one cyclic or pregnancy CL. Mean ovulation rate was 1.89 CL/female, and the mean ovum mortality was 37.5%. There were no significant differences in ovarian volume related to parity. Conclusions: These results contribute to the scarce information available on the reproductive biology of owl monkeys and can aid in the development of biotechnologies involved in assisted reproduction. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

ABSTRACT: Background: Many ontologies have been developed in biology and these ontologies increasingly contain large volumes of formalized knowledge commonly expressed in the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Computational access to the knowledge contained within these ontologies relies on the use of automated reasoning. Results: We have developed the Aber-OWL infrastructure that provides reasoning services for bio-ontologies. Aber-OWL consists of an ontology repository, a set of web services and web interfaces that enable ontology-based semantic access to biological data and literature. Aber-OWL is freely available at http://aber-owl.net. Conclusions: Aber-OWL provides a framework for automatically accessing information that is annotated with ontologies or contains terms used to label classes in ontologies. When using Aber-OWL, access to ontologies and data annotated with them is not merely based on class names or identifiers but rather on the knowledge the ontologies contain and the inferences that can be drawn from it. © Hoehndorf et al.

ABSTRACT: This article analyses the complex relationship between impact assessments (IAs) of all types (such as comprehensive, regulatory, economic, social or environmental IAs) and their governance environment, using an analytical framework based on the concepts of governance styles and metagovernance. It is argued that each governance system builds on specific values, traditions and history and produces specific mixtures of hierarchical, network and market styles of governance (with or without an explicit metagovernance approach). Although governance can be considered as a non-normative perspective on polity and politics, the normative dimension of governance practice results in, for example, conflicting convictions about which type of knowledge or ‘evidence’ is valid for IA processes. This is particularly relevant because IAs have an important role in improving the knowledge base of governance. The concrete governance system in a specific country or other administrative entity influences the design and governance of IA systems positively or negatively, which leads to a variety of challenges. The conclusion is drawn that understanding the governance context and its dynamics can help improving IA governance. © 2015, © 2014 IAIA.

ABSTRACT: Research on the diet of barn owls on some of the lesser Pityusic Islands (Formentera, s’Espalmador and s’Espartar) reveals a previously undescribed opportunistic trophic behaviour based on regular foraging in patches of territory separated by relatively broad sea channels. Individually, small islets with reduced human influence do not usually provide enough food for the barn owl. Consequently, the species expands its home range to include multiple islands or islets. This study is the first to document the regular crossing of broad sea channels (one of which exceeds 4.5 km) by barn owls in order to hunt. The islets provide the barn owls with prey otherwise considered as marginal (such as Oryctolagus cuniculus and Hydrobates pelagicus). © 2014, Czech Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The diverse colorations of a birds’ plumage are due to either structural colors or pigments that are synthesized in specialized cells or incorporated through the diet. However, plumage color aberrations can occur; several cases of albinism and leucism have been reported for different bird species and some examples are found in Strigiformes. A specimen of the American Barn Owl (Tyto furcata) with partial leucism was found in Carhué, Buenos Aires province. The plumage of its facial disc, tail and the ventral region was completely white; furthermore, the neck, primaries, and secondaries were pigmented although in a significantly lighter fashion than in normal-phenotype specimens. The rest of the body presented a normal pattern for the species. © 2015 Sociedade Brasileira de Ornitologia. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Understanding factors that influence the survival of endangered migratory species is critical for making informed management decisions, yet this understanding relies on long-term recapture datasets for species that are, by definition, rare. Using 3 geographically widespread (Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Manitoba, Canada) and long-term (6-15 yr) mark-recapture datasets, we quantified spatial and temporal variation in apparent annual survival and recapture probabilities of Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia), an endangered species that breeds in Canada. We then examined how large-scale weather patterns during migration (storms) and on the wintering and breeding grounds (precipitation), in addition to prey irruptions on the breeding grounds, influenced apparent survival of Burrowing Owls. Female Burrowing Owls had lower apparent survival than males in all 3 study areas. Storms during fall migration and above-average precipitation on the wintering grounds were associated with reduced apparent survival of Burrowing Owls in the longest-running study area, Saskatchewan; in Alberta and Manitoba, there were few correlations between apparent survival of Burrowing Owls and weather or prey irruptions. Increases in stochastic events such as storms during migration or precipitation on the wintering grounds could have adverse consequences on the already small Burrowing Owl population in Canada. Local management actions that focus solely on improving adult apparent survival within Canada are likely insufficient for mitigating susceptibility of adults to inclement weather or other factors outside the breeding season, underscoring the need for management of this species across multiple jurisdictions within North America. © 2014 Cooper Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: The use of private land by owls has long been of interest to wildlife managers in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA, because private lands could contribute to owl conservation if it is used extensively. Therefore, we studied the use of private lands for foraging by 14 California spotted owls (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) in the central Sierra Nevada, California during 2006. We modeled foraging locations as a function of 2 land-ownership categories within an owl's territory: public and private land. The log probability of an owl using a public-land location was 15% greater than for a private-land location. Private-land distribution was relatively consistent with respect to the geometric center of owl home ranges, suggesting that our result was not influenced by a peripheral distribution of private land in owl home ranges. Based on our findings, national forest lands within our study area currently have more foraging habitat for California spotted owls than do private lands. We recommend that managers consider owl use of private land within the context of our results when developing conservation strategies for California spotted owls in the central Sierra Nevada. © 2014 The Wildlife Society.

ABSTRACT: Although birds are among the best studied taxa, many of the globally threatened species lack the information required to fully assess their conservation status and needs. One such species is the Anjouan Scops Owl Otus capnodes which was presumed extinct until its rediscovery to science in 1992. Based on the limited extent and decline of the moist forests in the highlands of Anjouan in the Comoro Islands, a population size of only 100-200 pairs was estimated and the species was classified as 'Critically Endangered'. The current study is the first comprehensive survey ever conducted on this species, and aimed to establish the current distribution and population size. Point counts with distance sampling were conducted across the agroforestry and forest zones of Anjouan in both a dry and wet season. A niche suitability model predicted the species distribution to be wider than expected with owls observed as low as 300 m altitude and in highly modified agroforestry habitats. However, the encounter rate in natural relatively undisturbed forest was significantly greater than in other habitats. The wider than expected geographic range of O. capnodes supports a possible downlisting of this species on the IUCN Red List to 'Endangered'. Population size was found to be far greater than previously thought, at approximately 3,450 individual owls in the dry season and 5,450 in the wet season. These results show the importance of investing in robust surveys of poorly known and cryptic bird species, and provide up to date and important information for landscape scale conservation planning in the Comoros Islands.

ABSTRACT: Understanding the function of variation in sleep requires studies in the natural ecological conditions in which sleep evolved. Sleep has an impact on individual performance and hence may integrate the costs and benefits of investing in processes that are sensitive to sleep, such as immunity or coping with stress. Because dark and pale melanic animals differentially regulate energy homeostasis, immunity and stress hormone levels, the amount and/or organization of sleep may covary with melanin-based colour. We show here that wild, cross-fostered nestling barn owls (Tyto alba) born from mothers displaying more black spots had shorter non-REM (rapid eye movement) sleep bouts, a shorter latency until the occurrence of REM sleep after a bout of wakefulness and more wakefulness bouts. In male nestlings, the same sleep traits also correlated with their own level of spotting. Because heavily spotted male nestlings and the offspring of heavily spotted biological mothers switched sleep-wakefulness states more frequently, we propose the hypothesis that they could be also behaviourally more vigilant. Accordingly, nestlings from mothers displaying many black spots looked more often towards the nest entrance where their parents bring food and towards their sibling against whom they compete. Owlets from heavily spotted mothers might invest more in vigilance, thereby possibly increasing associated costs due to sleep fragmentation. We conclude that different strategies of the regulation of brain activity have evolved and are correlated with melanin-based coloration.

ABSTRACT: Management of many North American forests is challenged by the need to balance the potentially competing objectives of reducing risks posed by high-severity wildfires and protecting threatened species. In the Sierra Nevada, California, concern about high severity fires has increased in recent decades but uncertainty exists over the effects of fuel reduction treatments on species associated with older forests, such as the California Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis). Here, we assessed the effects of forest conditions, fuel reductions, and wildfire on a declining population of Spotted Owls in the central Sierra Nevada using 20 years of demographic data collected at 74 Spotted Owl territories. Adult survival and territory colonization probabilities were relatively high, while territory extinction probability was relatively low, especially in territories that had relatively large amounts of high canopy cover (≥70%) forest. Reproduction was negatively associated with the area of medium-intensity timber harvests characteristic of proposed fuel treatments. Our results also suggested that the amount of edge between older forests and shrub/sapling vegetation and increased habitat heterogeneity may positively influence demographic rates of Spotted Owls. Finally, high-severity fire negatively influenced the probability of territory colonization. Despite correlations between owl demographic rates and several habitat variables, life stage simulation (sensitivity) analyses indicated that the amount of forest with high canopy cover was the primary driver of population growth and equilibrium occupancy at the scale of individual territories. Greater than 90% of medium-intensity harvests converted high-canopy cover forests into lower-canopy-cover vegetation classes, suggesting that landscape-scale fuel treatments in such stands could have short-term negative impacts on populations of California Spotted Owls. Moreover, high-canopy-cover forests declined by an average of 7.4% across territories during our study, suggesting that habitat loss could have contributed to declines in abundance and territory occupancy. We recommend that managers consider the existing amount and spatial distribution of high-canopy forest before implementing fuel treatments within an owl territory, and that treatments be accompanied by a rigorous monitoring program. © 2014 by the Ecological Society of America

ABSTRACT: Because of the worldwide distribution of the Barn Owl (Tyto alba) and the easily way to find its pellets, it is often used to diet studies. To investigate the eco-geographical impact of mountainous areas on its diet, we conducted studies in the Jura, Alpes, Central and Pyrénées mountains and we also did pellet analysis from 8 sites in the Jura mountains. Analysis of the tooth and skull content of pellets allowed us to draw up two types of change in the diet of Tyto alba in correlation with mountain elevation. The first one concerns the Jura, Alpes and Central mountains, where the diversity of the diet declines with the increase in elevation. The second one concerns the Pyrénées mountains, where there is no change in the diversity of the diet, perhaps because of the higher diversity of small mammals caused by mediterranean influence. Thus, it seems that elevation causes a decrease in diet diversity of Tyto alba in continental mountains (Jura, Alpes and Central mountains) probably because of more homogeneous landscapes dedicated to grass production. However, in Mediterranean mountains (Pyrénées), a more diversified small mammal guild provides a constant level of diet diversity. © 2018, BirdLife Hungary. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The Eurasian scops owl is one of the least known European nocturnal raptors. The species is declining throughout its distributional range, thus giving concern for its conservation status. We investigated seasonal shifts in its habitat use and diet in central Italy, where scops owl is a resident species in Central Tuscany. The owls used grasslands and human settlements during the breeding period, while woodlands were mainly used during the winter. The main prey species in the diet during the warm period were grasshoppers (Orthoptera, Tettigoniidae), whereas shrews (Soricomorpha) constituted the main prey during the winter. Thus, protecting extensive grassland would not suffice to conserve resident populations of Eurasian scops owls and preservation of mature deciduous woodlands with trunk cavities is also recommended.

ABSTRACT: Tympanal organs are widespread in Nymphalidae butterflies, with a great deal of variability in the morphology of these ears. How this variation reflects differences in hearing physiology is not currently understood. This study provides the first examination of hearing organs in the crepuscular owl butterfly, Caligo eurilochus. We examined the tuning and sensitivity of the C. eurilochus hearing organ, called Vogel’s organ, using laser Doppler vibrometry and extracellular neurophysiology. We show that the C. eurilochus ear responds to sound and is most sensitive to frequencies between 1 and 4 kHz, as confirmed by both the vibration of the tympanal membrane and the physiological response of the associated nerve branches. In comparison to the hearing of its diurnally active relative, Morpho peleides, C. eurilochus has a narrower frequency range with higher auditory thresholds. Hypotheses explaining the function of hearing in this crepuscular butterfly are discussed. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Spatial variation in resources is a fundamental driver of habitat quality but the realized value of resources at any point in space may depend on the effects of conspecifics and stochastic factors, such as weather, which vary through time. We evaluated the relative and combined effects of habitat resources, weather, and conspecifics on habitat quality for ferruginous pygmy-owls (Glaucidium brasilianum) in the Sonoran Desert of northwest Mexico by monitoring reproductive output and conspecific abundance over 10 years in and around 107 territory patches. Variation in reproductive output was much greater across space than time, and although habitat resources explained a much greater proportion of that variation (0.70) than weather (0.17) or conspecifics (0.13), evidence for interactions among each of these components of the environment was strong. Relative to habitat that was persistently low in quality, high-quality habitat buffered the negative effects of conspecifics and amplified the benefits of favorable weather, but did not buffer the disadvantages of harsh weather. Moreover, the positive effects of favorable weather at low conspecific densities were offset by intraspecific competition at high densities. Although realized habitat quality declined with increasing conspecific density suggesting interference mechanisms associated with an Ideal Free Distribution, broad spatial heterogeneity in habitat quality persisted. Factors linked to food resources had positive effects on reproductive output but only where nest cavities were sufficiently abundant to mitigate the negative effects of heterospecific enemies. Annual precipitation and brooding-season temperature had strong multiplicative effects on reproductive output, which declined at increasing rates as drought and temperature increased, reflecting conditions predicted to become more frequent with climate change. Because the collective environment influences habitat quality in complex ways, integrated approaches that consider habitat resources, stochastic factors, and conspecifics are necessary to accurately assess habitat quality. © 2015 Flesch et al.

ABSTRACT: To resolve the share of limited resources, animals often compete through exchange of signals about their relative motivation to compete. When two competitors are similarly motivated, the resolution of conflicts may be achieved in the course of an interactive process. In barn owls, Tyto alba, in which siblings vocally compete during the prolonged absence of parents over access to the next delivered food item, we investigated what governs the decision to leave or enter a contest, and at which level. Siblings alternated periods during which one of the two individuals vocalized more than the other. Individuals followed turn-taking rules to interrupt each other and momentarily dominate the vocal competition. These social rules were weakly sensitive to hunger level and age hierarchy. Hence, the investment in a conflict is determined not only by need and resource-holding potential, but also by social interactions. The use of turn-taking rules governing individual vocal investment has rarely been shown in a competitive context. We hypothesized that these rules would allow individuals to remain alert to one another's motivation while maintaining the cost of vocalizing at the lowest level. © 2015.

ABSTRACT: The Scops Owl (Otus scops) is one of the least studied owls in Europe and its loud and monotonous calls are not well documented. This paper summarises published alarm-like calls and presents data on daytime calling recorded in Lesencetomaj, Hungary between 9th and 17th September 2012. Calls were similar to the sound of an alarm on a reversing truck. The bird was most active around midday (11–13 hrs) and in the afternoons between 15–17 hrs. No calling occurred before 09.00 or after 19.15 o’clock. Weather affected the intensity of calls and particularly high autumn temperatures are suggested as a possible reason for this unusual activity. © 2018, BirdLife Hungary. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: For the first time a Common Barn-owl (Tyto alba) individual was tracked using a GPS technology to evaluate the use of a commercial and economic GPS pet tracker device, and to test GPS tracking as a technique for determining movement patterns and foraging habitat selection. A GPS pet tracker device was removed from its plastic frame and attached to the back of an adult male. The device recorded during eight consecutive nights a total of 12501 waypoints. The home range, estimated as the minimum convex polygon, was 1746 ha. Tracks obtained allowed the identification of three movement patterns that could be attributed to different behaviours: meandering, linear and point, corresponding to hunting, straight-lined flights and roosting, respectively. The overlap of tracks with a land cover map revealed that the owl selected vegetated areas (except where pigs were present) and barren areas with pigs for hunting. The use of this technique represents an improvement for behavioural studies of this species. © 2015, Association Ornitologica del Plata. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Hemos estado anillando individuos de Psiloscops flammeolus y Aegolius acadicus durante la migración otoñal en Idaho desde 1998. Nuestras redes de niebla con señuelos auditivos se ubican dentro de bosques de Pseudotsuga menziesii con muy escaso sotobosque. Durante el otoño de 2011 observamos algunos individuos de P. flammeolus dentro de parches densos de matorrales deciduos de montaña ubicados hasta 100 m de distancia del señuelo auditivo. Por ello, a mitad de la temporada de 2011, colocamos experimentalmente redes de niebla dentro de estos hábitats densos de arbustos deciduos para evaluar si podíamos incrementar la frecuencia de captura de P. flammeolus, la cual está catalogada como una especie de preocupación por la mayoría de las agencias estatales y federales dentro de su área de cría. Estandarizamos este protocolo para las temporadas de 2012 y 2013. Las redes de niebla colocadas en matorrales densos tuvieron tasas de captura de P. flammeolus de 7 a 21 veces más altas que nuestras redes de niebla tradicionales colocadas en el sotobosque, lo que sugiere que el emplazamiento de las redes en este tipo de hábitat puede ser valioso para estudios de anillamiento. Aunque nuestro objetivo principal fue aumentar la tasa de captura de individuos de P. flammeolus, también documentamos un incremento menor en la tasa de captura de A. acadicus en las mismas redes. © 2015 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The eastern grass owl Tyto longimembris was first detected in Thailand in July 2006 at Nong Lom, a grassland in open peat swamp located in the south part of Nong Bong Khai Non-hunting Area, Chiang Rai. Here, it is considered to be a rare resident. At this site, we studied the diet of eastern grass owl by analysing regurgitated pellets collected at their nests during the breeding season from December 2010 to February 2011. We collected 67 pellets from five nests and identified 33 mammal skulls. To identify prey species, DNA was extracted from skulls and was analysed based on molecular techniques. The dietary remains consisted of three murids (Muridae), with the house rat Rattus rattus the dominant species detected (16 skulls, 48.5 % occurrence), and the remainder being Asian house mouse Mus musculus (13 skulls, 39.4%) and ricefield mouse Mus caroli (4 skulls, 12.1%). © National University of Singapore.

ABSTRACT: Capsule Boldness defines the extent to which animals are willing to take risks in the presence of a predator. Late, but not early, in the breeding season, Israeli nestling Barn Owls displaying larger black feather spots were more docile, feigned death longer and had a lower breathing rate when handled than smaller-spotted nestlings. Larger-spotted breeding females were less docile if heavy but more more docile if light. The covariation between personality (boldness vs. timid) and melanin-based colouration is therefore conditional on environmental factors. © 2014 British Trust for Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: Describimos dos aberraciones cromáticas de plumaje no documentadas previamente en individuos de Aegolius acadicus capturados para anillamiento en los Estados Unidos y Canadá, entre 2007 y 2012. Ocho individuos exhibieron una "dilución pastel" con una intensidad reducida de los pigmentos negro y marrón, consistente con una reducción de ∼50% en los niveles de eumelanina y feomelanina. Los individuos de A. acadicus presentaron pico y garras pálidos pero pigmentados e iris normalmente pigmentado. Cuatro de los ocho individuos capturados fueron clasificados como adultos basados en la muda del ala (dos individuos de dos años y dos individuos de más de dos años), lo que sugiere que la aberración no es un impedimento para la supervivencia. También describimos un individuo de A. acadicus de menos de un año de edad con leucismo parcial, en el cual estuvieron ausentes las barras verticales anchas y de color ferruginoso que normalmente se encuentran en el pecho y en la parte superior del pecho. Ambas aberraciones parecen ser extremadamente raras, ocurriendo sólo ocho veces y una vez, respectivamente, de entre >30000 individuos capturados para anillado. © 2015 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Resource polymorphism refers to individuals from the same population foraging in alternative habitats or on alternative food. Food specialization can be associated with adaptations such as colour polymorphism, with pale and dark colours conferring differential camouflage in different habitats. Pale and dark-reddish pheomelanic Barn Owls (Tyto alba) forage on different prey species in closed and open habitats, respectively. We show here that darker-reddish owls have heavier stomach content when found dead, and their 5th secondary wing feather is more deeply anchored inside the integument. These correlations suggest that their feathers bend less when flying, and that darker-reddish Barn Owls are able sustain more intense flying than their paler conspecifics. © 2014, Dt.

ABSTRACT: Barn owls are effective hunters of small rodents. One hunting technique is a leap from the ground followed by a brief flight and a plummeting 'strike' onto an acoustically targeted - and potentially entirely hidden - prey. We used forceplate measurements to derive kinetics of the leap and strike. Leaping performance was similar to reported values for guinea fowl. This is likely achieved despite the owl's considerably smaller size because of its relatively long legs and use of wing upstroke. Strikes appear deliberately forceful: impulses could have been spread over larger periods during greater deflections of the centre of mass, as observed in leaping and an alighting landing measurement. The strike, despite forces around 150 times that of a mouse body weight, is not thought to be crucial to the kill; rather, forceful strikes may function primarily to enable rapid penetration of leaf litter or snow cover, allowing grasping of hidden prey. © 2014.

ABSTRACT: Annual productivity of great gray owls (Strix nebulosa) in California, USA, is thought to be largely dependent on vole (Microtus spp.) and pocket gopher (Thomomys spp.; hereafter, gopher) abundance, yet factors influencing these prey populations have not been thoroughly investigated. The abundance of voles and gophers has been influenced by vegetation and cattle grazing in other regions; and many meadows are grazed within the breeding range of great gray owls in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. We evaluated the influence of vegetation and cattle grazing on great gray owl foraging habitat by quantifying vole abundance, gopher abundance, and vegetation features in grazed and ungrazed meadows in 2010 and 2011. We found that vole presence was positively associated with sward height and corn lily (Veratrum californicum) dominance; vole abundance was weakly negatively associated with cattle grazing. Gopher abundance was negatively associated with site wetness, and weakly positively associated with stem density, the frequency of forb presence, cattle grazing, and the dominance of corn lily. To efficiently manage vegetation and cattle grazing to benefit great gray owl prey, we suggest prioritizing habitat for voles in wet meadows because gophers were not likely to be abundant in wet sites. Particularly in areas with moist soils, we recommend maintaining sward height commensurate with the habitat relationships of voles found in this study; >290mm where corn lily is not dominant and 125mm where it is. Sustaining sward height for voles should benefit great gray owls and other meadow or forest edge carnivores. © 2014 The Wildlife Society.

ABSTRACT: The morphological characterization of ovaries and ovarian follicular oocytes obtained from the owl monkey is detailed in the present paper. In vitro maturation of oocytes, using a method which has proved successful for other mammalian oocytes, was also evaluated and the maturation rate was compared with that obtained with squirrel monkey oocytes. The ovaries of the owl monkey are oval in shape (long axis of about 10 mm, short axis about 7 mm) and their oocytes are spherical. The mean diameter of owl monkey oocytes is significantly larger than that of squirrel monkey oocytes (145.7 ± 16.3 μm vs 112.0 ± 12.4 μ m). The owl monkey oocytes were incubated in HTF medium containing 10% FBS at 37 °C (5% CO2 in air) for 22-23 hours. The in vitro maturation rate of the owl monkey oocytes was higher than that of the squirrel monkey oocytes (83.3% vs 40.0%); therefore, our maturation conditions were as suitable for them. This study is the first to detail differences in the follicular oocytes of the owl monkey and squirrel monkey. Further studies using owl monkey gametes might yield results leading to a greater understanding of primate reproduction. © 2015 Japan Society for Ova Research.

ABSTRACT: We investigated the diet of Great Horned Owls (Bubo virginianus) in southwestern British Columbia. Our objective was to compare the diets of owls in urban and rural areas and determine whether urban owls consume a higher proportion of commensal rodents to understand possible pathways of secondary rodenticide poisoning of Great Horned Owls. Among 546 prey items identified at seven sites, townsend's Vole (Microtus townsendii [Bachman, 1839]) and rats (Rattus G. fischer, 1803) were the two main prey items, making up 65.9% and 13.1% of the diet, respectively. the proportion of rats in the diet was positively correlated with the degree of urban development in the owls' home range (rp = 0.83, P < 0.05, df = 5).

ABSTRACT: We report a unique case of two female Barn Owls laying eggs and incubating together in a single nest cup in a communal nest. A trio of two females and one male bred in an abandoned water tower in 2013 in Israel. Both females incubated/brooded together in the communal nest, and all three individuals brought food to the communal family. The two females laid 20 eggs, of which 19 hatched and 16 fledged. © 2015 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Gradients of variation - or clines - have always intrigued biologists. Classically, they have been interpreted as the outcomes of antagonistic interactions between selection and gene flow. Alternatively, clines may also establish neutrally with isolation by distance (IBD) or secondary contact between previously isolated populations. The relative importance of natural selection and these two neutral processes in the establishment of clinal variation can be tested by comparing genetic differentiation at neutral genetic markers and at the studied trait. A third neutral process, surfing of a newly arisen mutation during the colonization of a new habitat, is more difficult to test. Here, we designed a spatially explicit approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) simulation framework to evaluate whether the strong cline in the genetically based reddish coloration observed in the European barn owl (Tyto alba) arose as a by-product of a range expansion or whether selection has to be invoked to explain this colour cline, for which we have previously ruled out the actions of IBD or secondary contact. Using ABC simulations and genetic data on 390 individuals from 20 locations genotyped at 22 microsatellites loci, we first determined how barn owls colonized Europe after the last glaciation. Using these results in new simulations on the evolution of the colour phenotype, and assuming various genetic architectures for the colour trait, we demonstrate that the observed colour cline cannot be due to the surfing of a neutral mutation. Taking advantage of spatially explicit ABC, which proved to be a powerful method to disentangle the respective roles of selection and drift in range expansions, we conclude that the formation of the colour cline observed in the barn owl must be due to natural selection. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Ontology alignment, or ontology matching, is a technique of mapping different concepts between ontologies. For this purpose at least two ontologies are required. In certain scenarios, such as data integration, heterogeneous database integration and data model compatibility evaluation, a need to transform a relational database schema to an ontology can arise. To conduct a successful transformation it is necessary to identify the differences between relational database schema and ontology information representation methods, and then to define the transformation rules. The most straight forward but time consuming way to carry out transformation is to do it manually. Often this is not an option due to the size of data to be transformed. For this reason there is a need for an automated solution. The automatic transformation of OWL ontology from relational database schema is presented in this paper; the data representation differences between relational database schema and OWL ontologies are described; the transformation rules are defined and the transformation tool’s prototype is developed to perform the described transformation. © Rezekne Higher Education Institution (Rēzeknes Augstskola), Rezekne 2015.

ABSTRACT: Diet of co-occurring Barn Owl and Spotted Eagle Owl has been studied by means of pellet contents analysis in urban and rural environments in the Highveld of South Africa. In urban environment, diet of both owl species was dominated by murid rodents (mainly Otomys, Mastomys and Rhabdomys). In rural environment, Barn Owl diet was also dominated by murid rodents, but in the diet of the Spotted Eagle Owl higher proportion of birds and non-murid rodents was recorded. Although in the rural environment the breadth of diet niche was wider in Spotted Eagle Owl (DB = 35.41) than in Barn Owl (DB = 12.67), there was almost total dietary overlap (DO = 0.98) between these two co-occurring owl species. For contrast, there was only slight food niche overlap (DO = 0.12) between these owl species co-occurring in the urban environment, but the diet breadth here was also wider in Spotted Eagle Owl (DB = 29.02) than in Barn Owl (DB = 17.90). In the urban environment diet breadth of the Spotted Eagle Owl is, therefore, slightly wider than in rural environment, while in the case of the Barn Owl the reverse is true. Probably there is lower abundance of available prey in urban and rural areas in the Highveld, in comparison with more natural habitats. This may force both species to resort to a more diverse diet to meet their energy requirements. Both species show, therefore, high plasticity of foraging.

ABSTRACT: A key tool used to assess reproductive trade-offs in birds is brood size manipulation (BSM) experiments. Most BSM studies have examined the influence on short-term measures of reproductive output. Seldom evaluated are the effects on long-term fitness proxies under temporally or spatially varying environments. Unpredictable environments may affect reproductive trade-offs by altering the value of the brood or hampering optimization of reproductive effort. We reduced or enlarged broods of 140 male Tengmalm’s owls Aegolius funereus by one chick during their first lifetime reproductive event. Males differed in age and bred in environments that varied in quality spatially (habitat structure) and temporally (abundance of main food). We measured the short-term (nestling number and condition) and long-term fitness proxies (survival, lifetime fledgling and recruits produced) until all experimental males disappeared from the population. BSMs did not affect fledgling number or condition, but in enlarged broods, offspring condition was lower in territories with a high proportion of agricultural fields. Importantly, no obvious impacts on long-term fitness proxies emerged; lifetime fledgling and recruit production of males did not differ between the BSM treatments. Thus, the primary caregiver (i.e. Tengmalm’s owl males) passed increased reproductive costs to their offspring, which is in agreement with other studies investigating intergenerational reproductive trade-offs in species of intermediate lifespan. Reluctance to accept increased current reproductive costs in these systems highlights the potential for sexual conflict in bi-parental care systems in which one of the pair is the primary caregiver. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Individual members of a group must conform to the group norms, as they may otherwise become isolated from the group or the group may split. On the other hand, social groups usually comprise various social ranks and display a differential division of labor and consequently different behaviors. The present study was aimed at examining how the above factors are manifested in social voles that had experienced owl attack. Here, we reconfirm the findings of past studies: that grouped voles converge to display similar behavior after owl attack. In addition, we found that high-mass voles were more active in the open sectors of the experimental set-ups both before and after the owl attack, whereas low-mass voles dichotomized to those that increased and those that decreased their activity in the open following owl attack. Taking body mass as a proxy for social rank, it is suggested that as a consequence of their larger size and of their experience and physical strength, high-mass voles both presented an exemplary model for the low-mass voles and, accordingly, assumed leadership and stabilized their group's behavior. We also suggest a hypothetical model for the propagation of behavior in hierarchical groups. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Most HIV-1 variants isolated from early-stage human infections do not use nonhuman primate versions of the CD4 receptor for cellular entry, or they do so poorly. We and others have previously shown that CD4 has experienced strong natural selection over the course of primate speciation, but it is unclear whether this selection has influenced the functional characteristics of CD4 as an HIV-1 receptor. Surprisingly, we find that selection on CD4 has been most intense in the New World monkeys, animals that have never been found to harbor lentiviruses related to HIV-1. Based on this, we sampled CD4 genetic diversity within populations of individuals from seven different species, including five species of New World monkeys. We found that some, but not all, CD4 alleles found in Spix's owl monkeys (Aotus vociferans) encode functional receptors for early-stage human HIV-1 isolates representing all of the major groupMclades (A, B, C, and D). However, only some isolates of HIV-1 subtype C can use the CD4 receptor encoded by permissive Spix's owl monkey alleles. We characterized the prevalence of functional CD4 alleles in a colony of captive Spix's owl monkeys and found that 88% of surveyed individuals are homozygous for permissive CD4 alleles, which encode an asparagine at position 39 of the receptor. We found that the CD4 receptors encoded by two other species of owl monkeys (Aotus azarae and Aotus nancymaae) also serve as functional entry receptors for early-stage isolates of HIV-1. © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

ABSTRACT: We studied habitat selection by northern spotted owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) during natal dispersal in Washington State, USA, at both the roost site and landscape scales. We used logistic regression to obtain parameters for an exponential resource selection function based on vegetation attributes in roost and random plots in 76 forest stands that were used for roosting. We used a similar analysis to evaluate selection of landscape habitat attributes based on 301 radio-telemetry relocations and random points within our study area. We found no evidence of within-stand selection for any of the variables examined, but 78% of roosts were in stands with at least some large (>50cmdbh) trees. At the landscape scale, owls selected for stands with high canopy cover (>70%). Dispersing owls selected vegetation types that were more similar to habitat selected by adult owls than habitat that would result from following guidelines previously proposed to maintain dispersal habitat. Our analysis indicates that juvenile owls select stands for roosting that have greater canopy cover than is recommended in current agency guidelines. Published 2014.

ABSTRACT: We investigated the diet of Barred Owls (Strix varia) inhabiting urban environments in the Lower Fraser Valley of southwestern British Columbia, Canada. Our objective was to use the diet information to gain insight into the pathways of exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides (ARs) previously documented in this owl species. In particular, we examined whether such exposure is driven by the consumption of rodents commonly targeted during AR application, Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus), black rats (Rattus rattus) and house mice (Mus musculus), or if the secondary exposure is via consumption of native non-target rodents feeding at outdoor bait-stations. We identified 688 prey items from eight urban nest/roost sites. Rats (54.5%) were by far the most common prey, followed by field voles (Microtus townsendii; 19.3%), and deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus; 5.2%). The consumption of rats was positively correlated with the degree of urban development within Barred Owl home ranges (rp = 0.70, r2 = 0.48, P < 0.05, one-tailed). Barred Owls consumed predominantly younger rats, as the average rat weight was 103 ± 51.7 grams (n = 164). Surprisingly, no house mice were found in the prey remains, supporting the assumption that house mice seldom venture outdoors and therefore are not a likely vector of ARs to owls. If we assume more intensive AR usage in urban environments, then the higher consumption of rats in urban areas implicates rats as the likely pathway for secondary AR exposure to Barred Owls in urban landscapes. © 2015 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Several studies suggest that species' mortality rates are positively related with local population abundances. Because owls have shown both high road mortality rates and road avoidance behaviours, we hypothesize that road-kill likelihood is not always directly linked to their occurrence. In this study, we examined the relationship between the likelihood of species occurrence in the vicinity of major roads and the road-kill risk for barn owls Tyto alba, tawny owls Strix aluco and little owls Athene noctua. Specifically, we address: (1) the role of road-related features on spatial patterns of species' occurrence and road kills; (2) the composition of road kills and their distribution throughout the year; (3) the relationship between species' occurrence likelihood and mortality risk. Our findings show that changes in movement patterns is probably the main behavioural mechanism that threatens owls in roaded landscapes. The high mortality risk of barn owls in autumn and winter seasons, after the peak of dispersal period, provides support for the hypotheses of expanding movements because of lack of food. However, mortality because of high occurrence likelihood seems to also explain tawny owls' response towards roads. The high occurrence likelihood of little owls combined with low mortality rate also suggests avoidance of road crossings. Although, it is clear that within species there is variation according to age- and territory-holding status, closely related species have different sensitivities to roads as a function of their varying food preferences. We believe that linking species distribution with mortality risk may be more effective in focus conservation efforts. Therefore, we suggest measures should be applied to reduce prey availability close to roads and in road verges. This is particularly important for barn owls, for which foraging in the vicinity of roads during the cold season is especially risky. © 2014 The Zoological Society of London.

ABSTRACT: In this study we tested the hypothesis that inter-individual variation in morningness-eveningness (i.e., chronotype) is associated with variation in a composite measure of life history (the mini-K) such that morning-types (i.e., early birds) exhibit traits typically associated with slow life histories while evening-types (i.e., night owls) exhibit traits typically associated with fast life histories. In addition, we tested the hypothesis that time perspective may be one of the psychological mechanisms mediating the relationship between chronotype and socio-sexuality. Study participants were 95 heterosexual young men, most of whom were university students. Chronotype, life-history traits, socio-sexuality, and time perspective were assessed with well-established self-report measures. Variations in chronotype and in life-history traits were significantly associated in the direction predicted by our hypothesis. Consistent with our second hypothesis, time perspective emerged as a significant mediator of the association between chronotype and socio-sexuality so that the future orientation of morning-types was associated with their long-term mating orientation and relatively low sexual experience, while the present orientation of evening-types was associated with their short-term mating orientation and greater sexual experience. Our study provides the first evidence that variation in chronotype may be adaptive and elucidates one of the psychological mechanisms underlying the life history and reproductive strategies of male early birds and night owls. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: We used multi-season occupancy analyses to model 2 fates of northern spotted owl territories in relation to habitat amount, habitat fragmentation, and the presence of barred owls in Washington State, USA, 1989-2005. Local colonization is the probability a territory unoccupied by a spotted owl in year i would be occupied in year i + 1, and local extinction is the probability a territory that was occupied by a spotted owl in year i would be unoccupied in year i + 1. We found a negative relationship between local extinction probability and amount of late-seral forest edge. We found a negative relationship between colonization probability and the number of late-seral forest patches (higher fragmentation), and a negative relationship between colonization probability and the amount of non-habitat within 600 m of a spotted owl territory center (Akaike weight = 0.59). The presence of barred owls was positively related to extinction probability and negatively related to detection probability of spotted owls. The negative relationship between presence of barred owls and detectability of spotted owls indicated that spotted owls could be modifying their calling behavior in the presence of barred owls. The positive relationship between barred owl detections and local extinction probability suggests that because of competition with barred owls, spotted owls are being displaced. Published 2014.

ABSTRACT: Data on the food of the Eurasian pygmy owl in Slovakia was collected in 1999-201 4 at 12 breeding locations in 7 mountain ranges of the Western Carpathian Mts and 1 range belonging to the Eastern Carpathian Mts. The basis of the evaluation of the food spectrum of prey of G. passerinum was the collection of pellets, osteological remnants and feathers from birds beneath nest cavities and roosting places of females in the months of May to July, that is, in the period of feeding young in the nest. Overall samples of food from 12 nests at elevations of 650-1, 260 m a.s.l. were collected; from the largest of the three nests in the upper Nitra Region, from one nest in the Západné Tatry Mts and from three nests in the Volovské vrchy Mts. We compared these data with existing published data from Slovakia. A higher share of birds (65.0%) was found in the obtained material than mammals (34.8%). In the samples from 12 locations 10 species of mammals and 33 species of birds were found among the 377 individual prey samples. Among mammals, forest species of rodents predominated: Clethrionomys glareolus (22.8%) and Apodemus flavicollis (6.6%). The species Microtus arvalis (2.7%) was less abundant than in the stores of food from the Chocské vrchy Mts (35.4%). From the broad spectrum of songbirds, no species exceeded a presence of 7%. Species from the families Sylviidae, Turdidae, Paridae and Fringillidae were more numerous, while the species Phoenicurus phoenicurus, Motacilla alba, Carduelis cannabina, Dendrocopos minor and Passer domesticus were among the more uncommon prey. In total 582 individual prey were determined from the food remnants of G. passerinum in Slovakia (present study and other published studies). The species Clethrionomys glareolus occurred with a higher dominance than average in the pellets of G. passerinum in the mountains which border the region of the upper Nitra. In the Belianské Tatry Mts the most abundant rodent species was Terricola subterraneus, while in the mountains of eastern Slovakia the yellow-necked mouse Apodemus flavicollis was most often hunted, and of the songbirds, the coal tit Periparus ater. Among songbirds hunted near the breeding grounds of G. passerinum in the Považský Inovec Mts the collared flycatcher Ficedula albicollis was the most numerous. Among the most numerous songbirds which are evenly represented in all compared areas were: Regulus sp., Certhia familiaris, Poecile montanus and Cyanistes caeruleus. © 2015 Raptor Protection of Slovakia (RPS).

ABSTRACT: Anthropogenic activity can lead to deforestation and subsequent dramatic impacts on forest-dwelling animal species. In this study, we investigated the habitat use of a forest raptor (Tengmalm’s Owl Aegolius funereus) in an air-polluted area of the Ore Mountains (Czech Republic) that has been restored by non-native spruce. Based on a 14-year Tengmalm’s Owl nest-box breeding dataset, we found that the percentage of native Norway Spruce forest was higher for occupied nest boxes than for unoccupied ones within close surroundings of the nest (buffer radius of 25 m). Meanwhile, the percentage of nonnative Blue Spruce (originally from Northern America) was higher for occupied nest boxes than for unoccupied ones within the home-range breeding area (buffer radius of 750 m). Moreover, the surroundings of non-predated nests (radius of 750 m) showed a higher percentage of Blue Spruce and a lower percentage of deciduous trees than surroundings of nests predated by Pine Martens. Although small mammal availability was not affected by habitat categories, we found a positive correlation between the percentage of Apodemus mice in the diet of owls and the percentages of both Blue Spruce and open forest area within the foraging area radius (750 m). We suggest that adult owls and young fledglings use remnants of tall, oldgrowth Norway Spruce forests as a safe refuge against avian predators, while secondary stands of non-native Blue Spruce are suitable for hunting both main prey types (Apodemus mice and Microtus voles), and also ensure good protection against nest predation by Pine Martens. © 2014, Dt.

ABSTRACT: Climate change is causing range shifts in many species, and impacts are predicted to be highest in mountain regions. The effectiveness of protected areas in preserving suitable habitats for target species in the face of climate change is particularly concerning, as many protected sites may lose suitable conditions for those species. We investigate the potential effect of temperature increase on the regional distribution of pygmy and boreal owl, mountain forest specialists in the Italian Alps, and the relative effectiveness of the Natura 2000 network at the regional level. We modelled current and future distributions by MaxEnt, relating occurrence to climate and land cover, considering current and future climates (changes predicted for 2050 considering representative concentration pathways of +4.5 and +8.5 W/m2). The distribution of both species is affected by climate variables and by the availability of coniferous forests, and of a few other habitat types (such as grassland, bare soil, broadleaved forest, mixed forest). The potential regional distribution of the two species will undergo a significant reduction, more marked for boreal owl (52–54 %) than for pygmy owl (23–34 %). Although Natura 2000 covers (and will cover also in the future) more than 30 % of suitable sites of both species, 64 % of the sites suitable for both species now and in the two alternative future scenarios are not included in any Site of Community Importance or Special Protection Areas (SPAs). Those sites are ideal candidate for new SPAs. Network enlargement or adequate forest management also outside protected areas is required for the conservation of those and other forest-specialist species in a warmer future. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Wildlife habitat mapping has evolved at a rapid pace over the last few decades. Beginning with simple, often subjective, hand-drawn maps, habitat mapping now involves complex species distribution models (SDMs) using mapped predictor variables derived from remotely sensed data. For species that inhabit large geographic areas, remote sensing technology is often essential for producing range wide maps. Habitat monitoring for northern spotted owls (Strix occidentalis caurina), whose geographic covers about 23. million. ha, is based on SDMs that use Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery to create forest vegetation data layers using gradient nearest neighbor (GNN) methods. Vegetation data layers derived from GNN are modeled relationships between forest inventory plot data, climate and topographic data, and the spectral signatures acquired by the satellite. When used as predictor variables for SDMs, there is some transference of the GNN modeling error to the final habitat map.Recent increases in the use of light detection and ranging (lidar) data, coupled with the need to produce spatially accurate and detailed forest vegetation maps have spurred interest in its use for SDMs and habitat mapping. Instead of modeling predictor variables from remotely sensed spectral data, lidar provides direct measurements of vegetation height for use in SDMs. We expect a SDM habitat map produced from directly measured predictor variables to be more accurate than one produced from modeled predictors.We used maximum entropy (Maxent) SDM modeling software to compare predictive performance and estimates of habitat area between Landsat-based and lidar-based northern spotted owl SDMs and habitat maps. We explored the differences and similarities between these maps, and to a pre-existing aerial photo-interpreted habitat map produced by local wildlife biologists. The lidar-based map had the highest predictive performance based on 10 bootstrapped replicate models (AUC. = 0.809 ± 0.011), but the performance of the Landsat-based map was within acceptable limits (AUC. = 0.717 ± 0.021). As is common with photo-interpreted maps, there was no accuracy assessment available for comparison. The photo-interpreted map produced the highest and lowest estimates of habitat area, depending on which habitat classes were included (nesting, roosting, and foraging habitat. = 9962. ha, nesting habitat only. = 6036. ha). The Landsat-based map produced an estimate of habitat area that was within this range (95% CI: 6679-9592. ha), while the lidar-based map produced an area estimate similar to what was interpreted by local wildlife biologists as nesting (i.e., high quality) habitat using aerial imagery (95% CI: 5453-7216). Confidence intervals of habitat area estimates from the SDMs based on Landsat and lidar overlapped.We concluded that both Landsat- and lidar-based SDMs produced reasonable maps and area estimates for northern spotted owl habitat within the study area. The lidar-based map was more precise and spatially similar to what local wildlife biologists considered spotted owl nesting habitat. The Landsat-based map provided a less precise spatial representation of habitat within the relatively small geographic confines of the study area, but habitat area estimates were similar to both the photo-interpreted and lidar-based maps.Photo-interpreted maps are time consuming to produce, subjective in nature, and difficult to replicate. SDMs provide a framework for efficiently producing habitat maps that can be replicated as habitat conditions change over time, provided that comparable remotely sensed data are available. When the SDM uses predictor variables extracted from lidar data, it can produce a habitat map that is both accurate and useful at large and small spatial scales. In comparison, SDMs using Landsat-based data are more appropriate for large scale analyses of amounts and general spatial patterns of habitat at regional scales. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The loss of biodiversity from urbanized areas is a major environmental problem challenging policy-makers throughout the world. Solutions to this problem are urgently required in China. We carried out a case study of wintering long-eared owls (Asio otus) and their main prey to illustrate the negative effects of urbanization combined with ineffective conservation of biodiversity in Beijing. Field monitoring of owl numbers at two roosting sites from 2004 to 2012 showed that the owl population had fallen rapidly in metropolitan Beijing. Analysis of pellet contents identified only seven individuals of two species of shrew. The majority of mammalian prey comprised four bat and seven rodent species, making up 29.3% and 29.5% of the prey items, respectively. Prey composition varied significantly among years at the two sample sites. At the urban site the consumption of bats and rodents declined gradually over time, while predation on birds increased. In contrast, at the suburban site the prey composition showed an overall decrease in the number of bats, a sharp increase and a subsequent decrease in bird prey, and the number of rodent prey fell to a low point. Rapid development of real estate and inadequate greenfield management in city parks resulted in negative effects on the bird and small mammal habitat of urban areas in Beijing. We suggest that measures to conserve biodiversity should be integrated into future urban planning to maintain China's rich biodiversity while also achieving sustainable economic development. © 2014 International Society of Zoological Sciences, Institute of Zoology/Chinese Academy of Sciences and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Integrated population models (IPMs) constitute a relatively new approach for estimating population trends and demographic parameters that makes use of multiple, independent data sources (e.g., count and mark-recapture data) within a unified statistical framework. In principle, IPMs offer several advantages over more conventional modeling approaches that rely on a single source of data, including greater precision in parameter estimates and the ability to estimate demographic parameters for which no explicit data are available. However, to date, the IPM literature has focused primarily on model development and evaluation, and few "real-world" applications have demonstrated that IPMs can strengthen inferences about population dynamics in a species of conservation concern. Here, we combined 23 years of count, occupancy, reproductive, and mark-recapture data into an IPM framework to estimate population trends and demographic rates in a population of California spotted owls (Strix occidentalis occidentalis). Using this framework, we observed a significant population decline, as evidenced by the geometric mean of the finite annual rate of population change (λt-̂=0.969, 95% CRI 0.957-0.980) and the resulting realized population change (proportion of the initial population present in 2012; δ̂2012=0.501, 95% CRI 0.383-0.641). The estimated decline was considerably greater than the approximately 30% decline estimated using conventional mark-recapture and occupancy approaches (Tempel and Gutiérrez, 2013). The IPM likely yielded a greater decline because it allowed for the inclusion of three years of data from the beginning of the study that were omitted from previous analyses to meet the assumptions of mark-recapture models. The IPM may also have yielded a greater estimate of decline than occupancy models owing to an increase in the number of territories occupied by single owls over the study period. All demographic parameters (adult and juvenile apparent survival, reproductive rate, immigration rate) were positively correlated with λt̂, but immigration was fairly high (immt̂=0.097, 95% CRI 0.055-0.140) and contributed most to temporal variation in λt̂, suggesting that changes in owl abundance were influenced by processes occurring outside of our study area. More broadly, our results indicated that the IPM framework has the potential to strengthen inference in population monitoring and demographic studies, particularly for those involving long-lived species whose abundance may be slowly declining. In our case, the conservation implications from the results of the IPM suggested a decline in the population of owls that was steeper than previously thought. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: We studied size preferences of Tawny (Strix aluco) and Long-eared (Asio otus) Owls preying on common voles (Microtus arvalis) in the winter and spring seasons in Central Lithuania. Regression equations were used for body mass estimations. We found that both A. otus and S. aluco preferred larger M. arvalis than the average available in the population (the average body mass of predated individuals was 21.45 ± 0.12 g compared to 16.42 ± 0.16 g of snap-trapped individuals). Irrespective of the owl species, most of the predated Microtus voles were adults. In S. aluco prey, the winter proportion of young voles was significantly higher than in the prey of A. otus, 33.3% versus 5.2%. By contrast, the proportion of subadult and adult voles with a body mass in the range between 19 and 23 g was significantly higher in the prey of A. otus. Our results may indicate that the selection of the diferently sized prey allows the 2 species of owls to coexist sympatrically. © TÜBİTAK.

ABSTRACT: A large emergence of bats from a roost tree or more commonly a cave, provide birds of prey, especially owls, with an improved opportunity to capture bats. Away from these concentrated bat communities, bats are thought to make up an insignificant portion of owl diets. However, little research has investigated if bats perceive owls as a potential predatory threat. We conducted acoustic bat surveys to assess if bat activity was altered by the presence of owl calls or ambient nocturnal noise. Our surveys found no difference in the level of bat activity recorded before or during broadcasted owl calls or nocturnal noise. It is possible bats do not respond to calling owls because bats do not perceive owls as a threat. Additional studies may elucidate the relationship (if any) between bats and owls. © 2013, American Midland Naturalist.

ABSTRACT: In the visual, auditory, and electrosensory modalities, stimuli are defined by first- and second-order attributes. The fast time-pressure signal of a sound, a first-order attribute, is important, for instance, in sound localization and pitch perception, while its slow amplitude-modulated envelope, a second-order attribute, can be used for sound recognition. Ascending the auditory pathway from ear to midbrain, neurons increasingly show a preference for the envelope and are most sensitive to particular envelope modulation frequencies, a tuning considered important for encoding sound identity. The level at which this tuning property emerges along the pathway varies across species, and the mechanism of how this occurs is a matter of debate. In this paper, we target the transition between auditory nerve fibers and the cochlear nucleus angularis (NA). While the owl's auditory nerve fibers simultaneously encode the fast and slow attributes of a sound, one synapse further, NA neurons encode the envelope more efficiently than the auditory nerve. Using in vivo and in vitro electrophysiology and computational analysis, we show that a single-cell mechanism inducing spike threshold adaptation can explain the difference in neural filtering between the two areas. We show that spike threshold adaptation can explain the increased selectivity to modulation frequency, as input level increases in NA. These results demonstrate that a spike generation nonlinearity can modulate the tuning to second-order stimulus features, without invoking network or synaptic mechanisms. © 2014 the American Physiological Society.

ABSTRACT: Little is known about Neotropical owls. In particular, in many areas their presence is unconfirmed and several parameters about these populations are unknown. Hence, our study aimed to assess the diversity, habitat association, and densities of owls inhabiting La Malinche National Park, the only natural protected area in the state of Tlaxcala, Mexico. As result we report seven owl species: Barn Owl (Tyto alba), Western Screech-Owl (Megascops kennicottii), Whiskered Screech-Owl (M. trichopsis), Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus), Northern Pygmy-Owl (Glaucidium gnoma), Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia), and Northern Saw-whet Owl (Aegolius acadicus). We detected these species by using point counts in three vegetation types (pine, oak, and mixed pine-oak forest) that occur in this natural protected area. The species with the highest number of vocalizations/km2 was the Western Screech-Owl (0.25 vocalizations/km2) followed by the Great Horned Owl (0.23). Some species showed a clear preference for a specific vegetation type; for example, the Western Screech-Owl was recorded with more frequency in oak forest, while its congener the Whiskered Screech-Owl was only recorded in pine forest. Our results provide the first list of the owl species inhabiting this natural protected area and suggest the need for updating existing species lists. © 2014 The Neotropical Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Pleistocene glaciations greatly affected the distribution of genetic diversity in animal populations. The Little Owl is widely distributed in temperate regions and could have survived the last glaciations in southern refugia. To describe the phylogeographical structure of European populations, we sequenced the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) and control region (CR1) in 326 individuals sampled from 22 locations. Phylogenetic analyses of COI identified two deeply divergent clades: a western haplogroup distributed in western and northwestern Europe, and an eastern haplogroup distributed in southeastern Europe. Faster evolving CR1 sequences supported the divergence between these two main clades, and identified three subgroups within the eastern clade: Balkan, southern Italian and Sardinian. Divergence times estimated from COI with fossil calibrations indicate that the western and eastern haplogroups split 2.01-1.71 Mya. Slightly different times for splits were found using the standard 2% rate and 7.3% mtDNA neutral substitution rate. CR1 sequences dated the origin of endemic Sardinian haplotypes at 1.04-0.26 Mya and the split between southern Italian and Balkan haplogroups at 0.72-0.21 Mya, coincident with the onset of two Pleistocene glaciations. Admixture of mtDNA haplotypes was detected in northern Italy and in central Europe. These findings support a model of southern Mediterranean and Balkan refugia, with postglacial expansion and secondary contacts for Little Owl populations. Central and northern Europe was predominantly recolonized by Little Owls from Iberia, whereas expansion out of the Balkans was more limited. Northward expansion of the Italian haplogroup was probably prevented by the Alps, and the Sardinian haplotypes remained confined to the island. Results showed a clear genetic pattern differentiating putative subspecies. Genetic distances between haplogroups were comparable with those recorded between different avian species. © 2014 British Ornithologists' Union.

ABSTRACT: This study presents the concentration of mercury in feathers of 40 owls (five species) in five regions of Iran. Results showed that mercury concentration in Tawny owl's feathers (Strix aluco) were significantly higher than in the Little owl (Athena noctua), Eagle owl (Bub bubo), Long-eared owl (Asio otous) and Short-eared owl (Asio flammeus). Also, mercury concentrations in owl feathers collected from the north of Iran were significantly higher than others regions. Furthermore, mercury concentrations in owl feathers obtained in this study were higher than other regions in the world except for Sweden. This study demonstrates that mercury concentrations in Iranian owls, with the exception of the Tawny owl, are below toxic concentration (5 mg kg-1). In addition, location was a contributing factor in the mercury concentration in Iranian owl's feathers.

ABSTRACT: Evidence of necrophagous behaviour has been reported for 8.43% of nocturnal raptors. To determine whether preys were captured alive or consumed as carrion is challenging, as the diet of Strigiformes is mainly studied through pellet analysis, rather than direct observation. The diet of the long-eared owl Asio otus has been widely studied all over the distribution range of this species, but proven evidence of this feeding habit is still lacking. We collected 106 pellets under a suburban dormitory in Southern Tuscany (Central Italy) between December 2012 and April 2013. Prey remains (skulls, mandibles) were compared with a specific atlas. Four fragments of crested porcupine (Hystrix cristata) quills and a jawbone of Martes sp. were found in pellets collected after a snowfall (20-40 cm in depth). Although voles and mice constituted the staple of the diet of this species, accordingly with previous studies, these findings represent the first proof of carrion consumption by the long-eared owl. Body sizes of crested porcupine and Martes sp, as well as the defence behaviour of the rodent, rule out a direct predation by the owl. Our study enlarges the trophic spectrum of the long-eared owl, thus adding a further dimension to the behavioural plasticity of this species. © 2014 © 2014 Unione Zoologica Italiana.

ABSTRACT: Birds that forage nocturnally should select daytime roosts that minimize predation risk to themselves, maximize their ability to warn mates or young about predators, and reduce their exposure to inclement weather. The objective of this study was to identify landscape features used by burrowing owls Athene cunicularia hypugaea during the day and to determine if traffic disturbance altered patterns of daytime space use. We tracked 17 adult male owls for 0.6 to 2.8 d each with GPS dataloggers and used resource utilization and resource selection functions to examine the response of each owl to nest burrows, perches, and roads. Selection for roads de - creased as average vehicle speed increased. Roads with vehicle speeds > 80 km h-1 were avoided. Owls may avoid roads with high traffic speeds because auditory disturbance from passing vehicles interferes with their ability to communicate the presence of predators to their mates and young. Owls also spent more time near fences and posts, likely because these elevated perches are good vantage points for predator detection. Perches near burrowing owl nests should be maintained, and speed limits on roads near burrowing owl nests should be set to < 80 km h-1 to help ensure owls are able to effectively detect and react to predators. © Inter-Research and Environment Canada 2014.

ABSTRACT: Small-basin floodplain buried soils formed in association with low-order tributary streams are valuable archives of past climates, but have not been studied extensively in central Texas, USA. Four buried soils exposed along Owl Creek, within the larger Brazos River drainage basin, were examined using soil morphology and micromorphology, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating, soil characterization, whole-soil geochemical and stable isotope analyses of soil organic matter and pedogenic carbonate. These buried soils provide a record of changes in paleoecological and paleo-alluvial conditions spanning ~14ky. Morphological and geochemical differences between buried soils reflect changes in landscape attributable to climate, with a distinct 5% increase in δ13C values of soil organic matter corresponding to the Holocene onset and drier conditions. Paleoecological reconstructions coupled with depth to Bk suggest possible amounts of erosion of ~1m for each of the buried soils. Compilation of the proxies presented shows evidence for a cooler and wetter late Pleistocene climate, followed by a warmer and drier climate dominating during the Holocene. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The federally threatened northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) is the focus of intensive conservation efforts that have led to much forested land being reserved as habitat for the owl and associated wildlife species throughout the Pacific Northwest of the United States. Recently, however, a relatively new threat to spotted owls has emerged in the form of an invasive competitor: the congeneric barred owl (S. varia). As barred owls have rapidly expanded their populations into the entire range of the northern spotted owl, mounting evidence indicates that they are displacing, hybridizing with, and even killing spotted owls. The range expansion by barred owls into western North America has made an already complex conservation issue even more contentious, and a lack of information on the ecological relationships between the 2 species has hampered recovery efforts for northern spotted owls. We investigated spatial relationships, habitat use, diets, survival, and reproduction of sympatric spotted owls and barred owls in western Oregon, USA, during 2007-2009. Our overall objective was to determine the potential for and possible consequences of competition for space, habitat, and food between these previously allopatric owl species. Our study included 29 spotted owls and 28 barred owls that were radio-marked in 36 neighboring territories and monitored over a 24-month period. Based on repeated surveys of both species, the number of territories occupied by pairs of barred owls in the 745-km2 study area (82) greatly outnumbered those occupied by pairs of spotted owls (15). Estimates of mean size of home ranges and core-use areas of spotted owls (1,843 ha and 305 ha, respectively) were 2-4 times larger than those of barred owls (581 ha and 188 ha, respectively). Individual spotted and barred owls in adjacent territories often had overlapping home ranges, but interspecific space sharing was largely restricted to broader foraging areas in the home range with minimal spatial overlap among core-use areas. We used an information-theoretic approach to rank discrete-choice models representing alternative hypotheses about the influence of forest conditions, topography, and interspecific interactions on species-specific patterns of nighttime resource selection. Spotted owls spent a disproportionate amount of time foraging on steep slopes in ravines dominated by old (>120 yr) conifer trees. Barred owls used available forest types more evenly than spotted owls, and were most strongly associated with patches of large hardwood and conifer trees that occupied relatively flat areas along streams. Spotted and barred owls differed in the relative use of old conifer forest (greater for spotted owls) and slope conditions (steeper slopes for spotted owls), but we found no evidence that the 2 species differed in their use of young, mature, and riparian-hardwood forest types. Mean overlap in proportional use of different forest types between individual spotted owls and barred owls in adjacent territories was 81% (range = 30-99%). The best model of habitat use for spotted owls indicated that the relative probability of a location being used was substantially reduced if the location was within or in close proximity to a core-use area of a barred owl. We used pellet analysis and measures of food-niche overlap to determine the potential for dietary competition between spatially associated pairs of spotted owls and barred owls. We identified 1,223 prey items from 15 territories occupied by spotted owls and 4,299 prey items from 24 territories occupied by barred owls. Diets of both species were dominated by nocturnal mammals, but diets of barred owls included many terrestrial, aquatic, and diurnal prey species that were rare or absent in diets of spotted owls. Northern flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus), woodrats (Neotoma fuscipes, N. cinerea), and lagomorphs (Lepus americanus, Sylvilagus bachmani) were primary prey for both owl species, accounting for 81% and 49% of total dietary biomass for spotted owls and barred owls, respectively. Mean dietary overlap between pairs of spotted and barred owls in adjacent territories was moderate (42%; range = 28-70%). Barred owls displayed demographic superiority over spotted owls; annual survival probability of spotted owls from known-fate analyses (0.81, SE = 0.05) was lower than that of barred owls (0.92, SE = 0.04), and pairs of barred owls produced an average of 4.4 times more young than pairs of spotted owls over a 3-year period. We found a strong, positive relationship between seasonal (6-month) survival probabilities of both species and the proportion of old (>120 yr) conifer forest within individual home ranges, which suggested that availability of old forest was a potential limiting factor in the competitive relationship between these 2 species. The annual number of young produced by spotted owls increased linearly with increasing distance from a territory center of a pair of barred owls, and all spotted owls that attempted to nest within 1.5 km of a nest used by barred owls failed to successfully produce young. We identified strong associations between the presence of barred owls and the behavior and fitness potential of spotted owls, as shown by changes in movements, habitat use, and reproductive output of spotted owls exposed to different levels of spatial overlap with territorial barred owls. When viewed collectively, our results support the hypothesis that interference competition with barred owls for territorial space can constrain the availability of critical resources required for successful recruitment and reproduction of spotted owls. Availability of old forests and associated prey species appeared to be the most strongly limiting factors in the competitive relationship between these species, indicating that further loss of these conditions can lead to increases in competitive pressure. Our findings have broad implications for the conservation of spotted owls, as they suggest that spatial heterogeneity in vital rates may not arise solely because of differences among territories in the quality or abundance of forest habitat, but also because of the spatial distribution of a newly established competitor. Experimental removal of barred owls could be used to test this hypothesis and determine whether localized control of barred owl numbers is an ecologically practical and socio-politically acceptable management tool to consider in conservation strategies for spotted owls. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.

ABSTRACT: This note reports an incidental observation of an Eastern Grass Owl Tyto longimembris which was disturbed from its roosting site in wetland vegetation associated with a natural mound spring in south-western Queensland. There are only two published records of the Grass Owl using this rare habitat type, although there are records from similar habitats associated with artificial bore drains. The potential importance of mound-spring habitats for Grass Owls is explored, and some of the threats facing these sites are described.

ABSTRACT: Pellets, regurgitated by the Barn Owl, Tyto alba, were collected from Chadra-Akkar region in northern Lebanon. Pellets analyses yielded remains of 249 individuals, representing nine mammalian species and one species of a passerine bird. Small mammals constituted 96.4% of its diet (90.4% rodents and 6.0% insectivores), while birds constituted 3.6%. Günther's Vole, Microtus guentheri, and the House Mouse, Mus domesticus/macedonicus, were the most abundant prey items, representing 34.4% and 32.1% of the total number of recovered prey items respectively. The number of prey items per one pellet ranged from 1-6 individuals (Average 2.15 ±1.23 skull/pellet, N= 55). © 2014 Jordan Journal of Biological Sciences.

ABSTRACT: Present study was conducted on three sets of sternum of pigeon, crow and owl. Dorsal surface of body was concave but concavity was more in owl. In pigeon, single median pneumatic foramen was present anteriorly whereas in crow and owl, two lateral and a median pneumatic foramina were present. In pigeon, caudo-lateral processes were two in number. In crow, middle part of ventral lip showed a well-developed 'Y' shaped structure. In owl, sternal crest was bifi d anteriorly. Length of sternum and height of sternal crest was maximum in pigeon indicating a positive correlation with its night capability.

ABSTRACT: The distinct rufous and gray color-morphs of the Eastern Screech-Owl (Megascops asio) have long intrigued ornithologists. Eastern Screech-Owls range across the eastern half of the United States, where the morph ratio varies from >70% rufous birds in the center of the range to <30% rufous at the periphery. Although the adaptive significance of polymorphism is, in general, poorly understood, careful mapping of the morph-frequency and determination of ratio clines is a first step toward understanding this phenomenon. In this paper, I examine the distribution of Eastern Screech-Owl color-morphs in Iowa, which lies in the northwestern part of the species' range. I collected 519 records of Iowa screech-owls from museum curators, wildlife rehabilitators, bird-banders, and bird watchers. For all records combined, 41.0% were rufous morphs, 55.7% were gray morphs, and 3.3% were intermediates. For all birds of known sex, 44.7% (21/47) of males and 57.6% (34/59) of females were rufous; the difference was not statistically significant, but the results are consistent with a trend in other studies suggesting that females are more likely than males to be rufous. The percentage of rufous screech-owls increased clinally from west to east across Iowa, but did not change from north to south. Because annual precipitation exhibits a longitudinal pattern in Iowa and annual temperature exhibits a latitudinal pattern, this suggests that the morph ratio pattern in Iowa is influenced more by precipitation than by temperature. Based on records dating 1880-2003, the percentage of rufous birds decreased from the early to later decades of the 20th century. The range-wide distribution of morph ratio clines fits a model where rufous morphs are better-adapted at the center of the range but gray morphs are selected for toward the periphery. © 2014 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Begging behaviour of nestlings has been intensively studied for several decades as a key component of parent-offspring conflict. There are essentially two main theories to account for intensity of food solicitation among offspring: that intensity of begging is related to some form of scramble competition between nest mates or that it offers honest signalling of need to parents. The vast majority of studies which have addressed begging behaviour have been based on observations of, and experiments on, nestlings and have not considered begging behaviour, during the post-fledging period. Begging vocalizations in this post-fledging phase of dependence have rarely been studied, despite the importance of vocalizations as a communication method between offspring and parents, particularly for nocturnal species. We radiotracked 39 fledglings of the Tengmalm's owl ( Aegolius funereus ) in two years with different availability of prey: 2010 (n = 29 fledglings) and 2011 (n = 10 fledglings) and made 1320 nightly localizations in which we recorded presence or absence of begging calls. Within years, the most important measures related to the probability of vocalization were body condition at fledging, time of night, number of surviving siblings, age and weather conditions. Begging intensity increased with age in both years; however, in the year with low prey availability fledglings vocalized significantly more often. The main factor causing these differences between years was probably the different availability of prey, affecting breeding success, post-fledging behaviour, and thus also both short- and long-term needs of offspring. We believe that our results suggest honest signalling of their fledgling's need. © 2014 Kouba et al.

ABSTRACT: Genetic evaluation using animal models or pedigree-based models generally assume only autosomal inheritance. Bayesian animal models provide a flexible framework for genetic evaluation, and we show how the model readily can accommodate situations where the trait of interest is influenced by both autosomal and sex-linked inheritance. This allows for simultaneous calculation of autosomal and sex-chromosomal additive genetic effects. Inferences were performed using integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA), a nonsampling-based Bayesian inference methodology. We provide a detailed description of how to calculate the inverse of the X- or Z-chromosomal additive genetic relationship matrix, needed for inference. The case study of eumelanic spot diameter in a Swiss barn owl (Tyto alba) population shows that this trait is substantially influenced by variation in genes on the Z-chromosome (σz2=0.2719 and σa2=0.4405). Further, a simulation study for this study system shows that the animal model accounting for both autosomal and sex-chromosome-linked inheritance is identifiable, that is, the two effects can be distinguished, and provides accurate inference on the variance components. © 2014 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: In a foraging game, predators must catch elusive prey while avoiding injury. Predators manage their hunting success with behavioral tools such as habitat selection, time allocation, and perhaps daring-the willingness to risk injury to increase hunting success. A predator's level of daring should be state dependent: the hungrier it is, the more it should be willing to risk injury to better capture prey. We ask, in a foraging game, will a hungry predator be more willing to risk injury while hunting? We performed an experiment in an outdoor vivarium in which barn owls (Tyto alba) were allowed to hunt Allenby's gerbils (Gerbillus andersoni allenbyi) from a choice of safe and risky patches. Owls were either well fed or hungry, representing the high and low state, respectively. We quantified the owls' patch use behavior. We predicted that hungry owls would be more daring and allocate more time to the risky patches. Owls preferred to hunt in the safe patches. This indicates that owls manage risk of injury by avoiding the risky patches. Hungry owls doubled their attacks on gerbils, but directed the added effort mostly toward the safe patch and the safer, open areas in the risky patch. Thus, owls dared by performing a risky action-the attack maneuver-more times, but only in the safest places-the open areas. We conclude that daring can be used to manage risk of injury and owls implement it strategically, in ways we did not foresee, to minimize risk of injury while maximizing hunting success. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: We investigated whether Tawny Owls (Strix aluco) selectively predate yellow-necked mice (Apodemus flavicollis) with respect to body size. We calculated the body mass of predated individuals using regressions, prepared on basis of mandible measurements (n = 581) from A. flavicollis trapped in the nonvegetation period. The distribution and age composition of predated mice was compared to the trapping results. We found that the percentage of adult mice preyed upon by breeding S. aluco was in accordance with their percentage in the wild population (38.04% and 41.36%, respectively). Juvenile mice were underpredated (20.45% and 4.13%, p<0.001), while subadult A. flavicollis individuals were over-predated, comprising 38.18% in the population, but 57.83% in the prey items (p<0.001). Selective predation on A. flavicollis in the non-vegetative period should be one of the factors regulating the population, though the impact on the reproductive investment of A. flavicollis is not critical as the removed individuals are yet to begin reproducing. Through their relative lack of predation of adult A. flavicollis in winter and spring, S. aluco could be determinants of the population structure before the start of reproduction in spring. Removing subadult mice just before onset of spring reproduction delays population growth and postpones the maximum population size to the autumn season. © NwjZ, Oradea, Romania, 2014.

ABSTRACT: We describe attributes of Northern Saw-whet Owls (Aegolius acadicus) during fall migration using 167,774 records from the U.S. Bird Banding Laboratory for central and eastern North America from 1929-2010. We describe movement among 18 geographic regions using records of 1,444 birds captured and recaptured between 1 September and 31 December of the same year. These data show little exchange between western Lake Superior and eastern North America. The direction of movement within a region was strongly influenced by large water bodies, varied greatly among regions, and showed high dispersal in the absence of shorelines of large water bodies. We used recent banding data to analyze population demographics from northwestern Minnesota to the coast of Maine in the north, and from southern Minnesota and southern Wisconsin to southern Appalachia and the mid-Atlantic coastal region in eastern United States. The weighted mean proportion of Hatch Year (HY) birds declined significantly from 63% in northwestern Minnesota to 42% in southern Minnesota/southern Wisconsin and from 70% in northern Ontario to 48% in southern Appalachia. Annual variation in the proportion of HY birds showed little correlation between eastern and central origin sites but moderate correlation within each of these regions. We define irruptions as years when the proportion of HY birds is 15% or greater than the weighted mean for each site, a level that occurs once in 4 years on average but at irregular intervals. We determined a very high correlation between the proportion of HY birds banded in northeast of Lake Ontario and the abundance of small mammals, suggesting a close relationship between food supply and reproductive success. © 2014 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Differentiation, often leading to speciation, is common among island populations of birds. However, migratory species tend to differentiate less because increased movements often preclude the extended periods of allopatry thought to be required for speciation. This interaction of isolation and migration-gene flow is a complex issue in evolutionary biology. We examined the genetics of divergence in Northern Saw-whet Owls (Aegolius acadicus), in which a migratory form (A. a. acadicus) occurs during fall migration and winter, but not at other times of the year, in the range of a sedentary, island form (A. a. brooksi) on Haida Gwaii, British Columbia. We used 2,018 base pairs of mtDNA and genomic data from 405 amplified fragment-length polymorphisms to assess the population genetics and evolutionary history of these two subspecies. Both mtDNA and nuclear genomic markers showed significant divergence between these subspecies, and mtDNA gene flow between them was very low (<1 individual generation-1). These subspecies likely diverged in association with the Wisconsin glacial maximum, ∼16,000 yr BP. The refugial history of the region, life-history traits, and the maintenance of lineage integrity despite current contact suggest that this divergence occurred or is maintained through heteropatric differentiation, probably driven by a loss of migratory behavior in brooksi accompanied by local adaptations. © 2014 American Ornithologists' Union.

ABSTRACT: A wild young adult western screech owl (Megascops kennicottii) of unknown sex was presented for evaluation of an abnormal left eye (OS). Ophthalmic examination OS revealed raised intraocular pressure (37 mm Hg; reference interval 7-16 mm Hg), mydriasis, conjunctival and episcleral hyperemia, shallow anterior chamber due to anterior displacement of the lens and iris, rubeosis iridis, and engorgement of the pecten. The intraocular pressure in the right eye (OD) was 11 mm Hg. Multifocal pale, variably translucent, curvilinear to vermiform opacities were observed in the medial and ventral peripheral regions of the retina OD, consistent with focal retinitis. Mannitol (0.46 g/kg IV) was administered over 10 minutes. Forty minutes later, the intraocular pressure was 27 mm Hg OS and 13 mm Hg OD. Dorzolamide (one drop OS q12h), diclofenac (one drop OU q8-12h), and meloxicam (0.5 mg/kg PO q24h) were administered for 3 days. The intraocular pressure OS was within normal limits 1 day (11 mm Hg), 7 days (13 mm Hg), and 4 weeks (14 mm Hg) after this treatment. Complications arising during hospitalization and rehabilitation included superficial corneal ulceration of both eyes presumed secondary to trauma on being caught and superficial damage to a talon. The owl was released after a period of rehabilitation. Characteristic presenting signs as well as response to therapy suggest aqueous misdirection was the cause of ocular hypertension in this owl. To our knowledge, this is the first report of suspected aqueous misdirection and its medical management in a raptor. © 2014 by the Association of Avian Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Studies of habitat selection often measure an animal's use of space via radiotelemetry or GPS-based technologies. Such data tend to be analyzed using a resource selection function, despite the fact that the actual resources acquired are typically not recorded. Without explicit proof of resource use, conclusions from RSF models are based on assumptions regarding an animal's behavior and the resources gained. Conservation initiatives are often based on space-use models, and could be detrimental to the target species if these assumptions are incorrect. We used GPS dataloggers and digital video recorders to determine precise locations where nocturnally foraging Burrowing Owls acquired food resources (vertebrate prey). We compared land cover type selection patterns using a presence-only resource selection function (RSF) to a model that incorporated prey capture locations (CRSF). We also compared net prey returns in each cover type to better measure reward relative to foraging effort. The RSF method did not reflect prey capture patterns and covertype rankings from this model were quite different from models that used only locations where prey was known to have been obtained. Burrowing Owls successfully foraged across all cover types; however, return vs. effort models indicate that different cover types were of higher quality than those identified using resource selection functions. Conclusions about the type of resources acquired should not be made from RSF-style models without evidence that the actual resource of interest was acquired. Conservation efforts based on RSF models alone may be ineffective or detrimental to the target species if the limiting resource and where it is acquired are not properly identified. © 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.

ABSTRACT: Understanding the way animals respond to novel habitats and fluctuations in food resources can provide insights into the ability of species to settle in modified habitats. We studied the patterns of arthropod selection by Burrowing Owls in natural and modified habitats. We assessed the diet of this owl by means of pellet analysis and, simultaneously, we estimated relative abundance of arthropods in the field by trapping. A similar pattern of prey selection and avoidance was found among habitats, with coleopterans the main prey consumed. Food-niche breadth was low at all habitats, reflecting the dominance of a few prey items in the diet of the Burrowing Owl. Its wide trophic spectrum as well as its ability to take advantage of dominant resources suggests that, from a feeding perspective, the Burrowing Owl can readily colonise and adapt to newly human-modified habitats.© BirdLife Australia 2014.

ABSTRACT: during 2009 and 2010, nine Barred Owl (Strix varia) nest sites were located in Manitoba, Canada, and data on nest trees, nest structure, and nest site habitat were collected. Nests were located in a variety of tree species, including Balsam Poplar (Populus balsamifera), Paper Birch (Betula papyrifera), Trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) and Burr Oak (Quercus macrocarpa). all nests were in tree cavities, and the majority of nests were in dead trees (67%) and had lateral openings (67%). habitat surrounding nest trees and estimated canopy cover were highly variable. diameter at breast height of nest trees, cavity width, and cavity depth were consistent and were determined to be the most reliable indicators of nest suitability for breeding Barred Owls. We conclude that the distribution of nesting Barred Owls is influenced more by availability of suitable nest sites than by nest tree species or nest site habitat.

ABSTRACT: In predator-prey foraging games, the prey's reaction to one type of predator may either facilitate or hinder the success of another predator. We ask, do different predator species affect each other's patch selection? If the predators facilitate each other, they should prefer to hunt in the same patch; if they interfere, they should prefer to hunt alone. We performed an experiment in a large outdoor vivarium where we presented barn owls (Tyto alba) with a choice of hunting greater Egyptian gerbils (Gerbillus pyramidum) in patches with or without Saharan horned vipers (Cerastes cerastes). Gerbils foraged on feeding trays set under bushes or in the open. We monitored owl location, activity, and hunting attempts, viper activity and ambush site location, and the foraging behavior of the gerbils in bush and open microhabitats. Owls directed more attacks towards patches with vipers, and vipers were more active in the presence of owls. Owls and vipers facilitated each other's hunting through their combined effect on gerbil behavior, especially on full moon nights when vipers are more active. Owls forced gerbils into the bushes where vipers preferred to ambush, while viper presence chased gerbils into the open where they were exposed to owls. Owls and vipers took advantage of their indirect positive effect on each other. In the foraging game context, they improve each other's patch quality and hunting success. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: A 6-year-old breeding female spectacled owl (Pusilatrix perspicillata) was presented for a soft, fluid-filled, spherical mass under the neck that had been increasing in size over the previous 3 days. Results of a fine-needle aspirate of the mass showed clear, pale-yellow fluid with a total protein of 12.6 g/L. Cytologic examination revealed erythrocytes, moderate numbers of heterophils, and numerous foamy mononuclear cells against a mucoid background. Macroscopically, the mass appeared to be attached firmly to the esophagus. The mass was excised surgically and submitted for histopathologic examination. The lesion comprised a circumscribed, fibrous-encapsulated multilocular cyst, lined by plump, goblet-type, cuboidal epithelial cells lying in abundant mucinous matrix. Findings were consistent with a mucocele of the esophageal mucosal gland. Excision was considered curative based on follow-up 6 months after initial presentation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of this condition in Strigiformes and indicates that mucocele should be included in the differential diagnosis of cervical masses in birds. © 2014 by the Association of Avian Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: High-resolution Particle-Image Velocimetry (PIV) and time-resolved force measurements were performed to analyze the impact of the comb-like structure on the leading edge of barn owl wings on the flow field and overall aerodynamic performance. The Reynolds number was varied in the range of 40,000 to 120,000 and the range of angle of attack was 0° to 6° for the PIV and -15° to +20° for the force measurements to cover the full flight envelope of the owl. As a reference, a wind-tunnel model which possessed a geometry based on the shape of a typical barn owl wing without any owl-specific adaptations was built, and measurements were performed in the aforementioned Reynolds number and angle of attack range. This clean wing model shows a separation bubble in the distal part of the wing at higher angles of attack. Two types of comb-like structures, i.e., artificial serrations, were manufactured to model the owl's leading edge with respect to its length, thickness, and material properties. The artificial structures were able to reduce the size of the separation region and additionally cause a more uniform size of the vortical structures shed by the separation bubble within the Reynolds number range investigated, resulting in stable gliding flight independent of the flight velocity. However, due to increased drag coefficients in conjunction with similar lift coefficients, the overall aerodynamic performance, i.e., lift-to-drag ratio is reduced for the serrated models. Nevertheless, especially at lower Reynolds numbers the stabilizing effect of the uniform vortex size outperforms the lower aerodynamic performance. © 2014 Jilin University.

ABSTRACT: The assessment of feeding conditions and variations in diet composition over the pre-breeding period of birds plays a keyrole in the understanding of reproductive performance. Pellets regurgitated by the Little Owl, Athene noctua, were collected from Boulhilet (Batna, north-east Algeria). The analysis of 48 pellets resulted in the identification of 471 preyitems of 38 different species classified into 6 classes, 7 orders, 21 families, and 35 genera. Although the diet of the Little Owl mainly consists of arthropods, it is highly diverse (Food Niche Breadth = 14.5, Shannon index = 4.4 bits). Insects are made up 90% of the consumed food; however, they accounted only for 8% of the total biomass. Small mammal prey constituting a rich source of energy during the pre-breeding period, when other kinds of prey are not available due to cold conditions, made up 72% of the diet biomass. We found no significant variation in rodents as a component (number of prey-individuals, biomass, and prey-species richness, prey-species occurrence) of the Little Owl's diet between study months and years. Meanwhile, the other identified prey-categories, principally invertebrates (characterized by prey frequency, composition, and biomass) showed significant variations between months and/or years of the study. We suggest that these prey categories represent a food supplement when conditions become severe. © 2014 Nature Research Centre.

ABSTRACT: A Recovery Plan developed for the threatened Mexican Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis lucida) recommended designating Protected Activity Centers (PACs) with a minimum size of 243 ha to conserve core use areas of territorial owls. The plan assumed that areas of this size would protect "the nest site, several roost sites, and the most proximal and highly-used foraging areas." The PAC concept remains an important component of the recovery strategy nineteen years later, although use of designated PACs by territorial owls has never been evaluated. We assessed use of PACs for nesting and roosting by Mexican Spotted Owls in the Sacramento Mountains, New Mexico, using location data obtained during a study of owl demography from 2004-2011. High proportions of both nest and roost locations were located within the PAC boundary for most, but not all, PACs. Many locations outside of PAC boundaries were adjacent to those boundaries, but some occurred >1 km from PAC boundaries. Proportions of roost locations within the PAC also were high for most, but not all, individual owls of both sexes, and in all years of the study. Proportions of locations within PACs remained relatively high for periods of up to 24 yr following PAC establishment, suggesting that owls continued to use these areas over relatively long periods. A number of vacant PACs were recolonized by owls during the study, and these owls also used PAC areas at high levels in most, but not all, cases. It would be desirable to assess PAC use over longer time periods, in other geographic areas, and to incorporate foraging use in such evaluations. In the meantime, however, our results suggest that most resident owls concentrated nesting and roosting activity within designated PAC areas in our study area, that some vacant PACs were recolonized, and that use levels in PACs remained high as long as 24 yr after PAC establishment, suggesting that PACs in this area are providing important habitat for owls. © 2014 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Predicting the dynamics of animal populations with different life histories requires careful understanding of demographic responses to multifaceted aspects of global changes, such as climate and trophic interactions. Continent-scale dampening of vole population cycles, keystone herbivores in many ecosystems, has been recently documented across Europe. However, its impact on guilds of vole-eating predators remains unknown. To quantify this impact, we used a 27-year study of an avian predator (tawny owl) and its main prey (field vole) collected in Kielder Forest (UK) where vole dynamics shifted from a high- to a low-amplitude fluctuation regime in the mid-1990s. We measured the functional responses of four demographic rates to changes in prey dynamics and winter climate, characterized by wintertime North Atlantic Oscillation (wNAO). First-year and adult survival were positively affected by vole density in autumn but relatively insensitive to wNAO. The probability of breeding and number of fledglings were higher in years with high spring vole densities and negative wNAO (i.e. colder and drier winters). These functional responses were incorporated into a stochastic population model. The size of the predator population was projected under scenarios combining prey dynamics and winter climate to test whether climate buffers or alternatively magnifies the impact of changes in prey dynamics. We found the observed dampening vole cycles, characterized by low spring densities, drastically reduced the breeding probability of predators. Our results illustrate that (i) change in trophic interactions can override direct climate change effect; and (ii) the demographic resilience entailed by longevity and the occurrence of a floater stage may be insufficient to buffer hypothesized environmental changes. Ultimately, dampened prey cycles would drive our owl local population towards extinction, with winter climate regimes only altering persistence time. These results suggest that other vole-eating predators are likely to be threatened by dampening vole cycles throughout Europe. © 2014 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Understanding the evolution of mating systems, a central topic in evolutionary biology for more than 50 years, requires examining the genetic consequences of mating and the relationships between social systems and mating systems. Among pair-living mammals, where genetic monogamy is extremely rare, the extent of extra-group paternity rates has been associated with male participation in infant care, strength of the pair bond and length of the breeding season. This study evaluated the relationship between two of those factors and the genetic mating system of socially monogamous mammals, testing predictions that male care and strength of pair bond would be negatively correlated with rates of extra-pair paternity (EPP). Autosomal microsatellite analyses provide evidence for genetic monogamy in a pair-living primate with bi-parental care, the Azara's owl monkey (Aotus azarae). A phylogenetically corrected generalized least square analysis was used to relate male care and strength of the pair bond to their genetic mating system (i.e. proportions of EPP) in 15 socially monogamous mammalian species. The intensity of male care was correlated with EPP rates in mammals, while strength of pair bond failed to reach statistical significance.

ABSTRACT: Forested landscapes vary greatly in habitat structure and complexity due to natural and anthropogenic disturbances that may alter forest attributes. Habitat structure along with temporal factors may directly affect interactions between species, particularly those between predators and their prey. Our study assesses the effects of habitat structure in prey intake of a small avian predator, the ferruginous pygmy-owl (Glaucidium brasilianum) in semiarid forests of caldén (Prosopis caldenia) in central Argentina. Overall, the main prey of owls was small mammals, followed in importance by birds, insects and reptiles. The mean abundance of mammals in the diet was affected by season and year, while the abundance of birds in the diet was greater during spring-summer than during autumn-winter. As for insect prey, abundance of birds in the diet was also greater in open than in closed forests. Habitat type seems to plays an important role in the use of food resources by the ferruginous pygmy-owl in caldén forests. Due to the recurrence, spatial extent and remarkable effects of natural disturbances on habitat structure in these environments, our results suggest that habitat type and structure should be taken into account in diet studies of forest specialist avian predators in these habitats. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Hematologic and plasma biochemistry parameters of barn owls (Tyto alba) were studied in collaboration by the Exotic Division of the Faculty of Veterinary Science of the Szent Istvan University and the Eötvös Loránd University, both in Budapest, Hungary. Blood samples were taken from a total of 42 adult barn owls kept in zoos and bird repatriation stations. The following quantitative and qualitative hematologic values were determined: packed cell volume, 46.2 ± 4%; hemoglobin concentration, 107 ± 15 g/L; red blood cell count, 3.2 ± 0.4 × 1012/L; white blood cell count, 13.7 ± 2.7 × 109/L; heterophils, 56.5 ± 11.5% (7.8 ± 2 ×109/L); lymphocytes, 40.3 ± 10.9% (5.5 ± 1.9 × 109/L); monocytes, 1.8 ± 2.1% (0.3 ± 0.3 × 109/L); eosinophils, 1 ± 1% (0.1 ± 0.1 × 109/L); and basophils, 0.6 ± 0.5% (0.1 ± 0.1 × 109/L). The following plasma biochemistry values also were determined: aspartate aminotransferase, 272 ± 43 U/L; l-γ-glutamyltransferase, 9.5 ± 4.7 U/L; lipase, 31.7 ± 11.1 U/L; creatine kinase, 2228 ± 578 U/L; lactate dehydrogenase, 1702 ± 475 U/L; alkaline phosphatase, 358 ± 197 U/L; amylase, 563 ± 114 U/L; glutamate dehydrogenase, 7.5 ± 2.5 U/L; total protein, 30.6 ± 5.3 g/L; uric acid, 428 ± 102 μmol/L; and bile acids, 43 ± 18 μmol/L. These results provide reliable reference values for the clinical interpretation of hematologic and plasma biochemistry results for the species. © American Association of Avian Pathologists.

ABSTRACT: We review the distribution of the Buff-fronted Owl Aegolius harrisii harrisii in Peru, supported by unpublished museum records and new specimens and observations. Compared to previous published records, the distribution and elevation range for the species in Peru are expanded significantly. Based on all records, we deduce that the overall distribution of A. harrisii in Peru is almost continuous, from the northwestern Andes to the eastern southern Andes, between 250 and 2960 m. The northern Peruvian Andes show a dense distribution of A. harrisii records compared to the distribution elsewhere in the Andes. © 2014 Check List and Authors.

ABSTRACT: Populations of Australian desert rodents are known to undergo booms in response to resource pulses following periods of high rainfall. Australia's arid-adapted Tyto owls have been recorded responding functionally and numerically to these small mammal booms, though it is not known whether the Southern Boobook Ninox novaeseelandiae is able to respond similarly. We aimed to determine whether Southern Boobooks could find and exploit a localised rodent irruption in the western Simpson Desert, in a location with few roost trees and no tree hollows. Boobook owls immigrated to the site from an estimated distance of ≥ 32 km and appeared to be resident over a period of ≥ 4 months, coinciding with a localised irruption of Rains mice Pseudomys australis. Dietary analysis confirmed that the owls specialised on small mammals, with rodent and dasyurid species accounting for c. 98% of prey items and > 99% of prey biomass. There was no evidence of reproductive activity among the owls and they vacated the area as the small mammal irruption subsided. Although a dietary generalist across its range, our results indicate the Southern Boobook is capable of specialising on small mammals during population irruptions.

ABSTRACT: The present study investigated the current-use brominated flame retardants (BFRs) tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), simultaneously with legacy polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), in Barn Owls (Tyto alba) collected from two regions with a contrasting degree of urbanisation and vicinity to point sources (Flanders in Belgium versus Normandy in France). Both tissues (muscle, liver, adipose and preen gland) and feathers (primary, tail and body feathers) showed elevated HBCD concentrations in Flanders, close to Europe's sole HBCD production plant in the Netherlands, and identified Normandy as a historical source region for PBDEs. In sharp contrast, the reactive BFR TBBPA bioaccumulated poorly (2.3%) in tissue samples, but was present in 96% of all body feather samples (0.36-7.07ngg-1dw), equally in both regions. PBDE concentrations in tissues (7.46-903ngg-1lw) were considerably lower in the investigated Flemish Barn Owls, collected in 2008/2009, compared to specimens collected in 2003/2004 (46-11,000ngg-1lw), possibly suggesting the effectiveness of the 2004 European ban of Penta- and Octa-BDE mixtures. Feathers showed a similar trend and additionally exhibited HBCD concentrations (0.02-333ngg-1dw) surpassing those of PBDEs (0.50-10.4ngg-1dw). While body feathers were a reliable matrix to predict both internal PBDE (0.21≤R2≤0.67) and HBCD body burdens (0.20≤R2≤0.37), the suitability of primary and tail feathers appeared to be confounded by external contamination and moult. In conclusion, the present study clearly showed that the reactive versus additive use of BFRs results in contrasting exposure scenarios in a species higher up the food chain, and therefore may have profound implications for environmental health. In addition, the presented results extend the promising use of feathers as a non-destructive sampling strategy for current-use BFRs, and show that birds of prey are valid early-warning systems for environmental contamination. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Understanding patch dynamics can help scientists better understand metapopulations and the relationships of animals that share a habitat. The Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia) is a well-known associate of prairie dog colonies, thereby linking conservation measures that benefit these species. We used occupancy modeling to determine how colony attributes (e.g., size and edge effects) and the loss of prairie dog colonies to sylvatic plague affected the occupancy of those colonies by Burrowing Owls in north-central Montana. We surveyed presence- Absence of Burrowing Owls during a 13-yr period (1995-2007) and analyzed the data using a robust-design occupancy model in Program MARK. The proportion of colonies occupied by Burrowing Owls ranged from 0.41 to 0.54 across years while the probability of detecting the owls ranged from 0.22 to 0.92. Contrary to our predictions, colony edge effects and plague epizootics showed only weak or no effects on Burrowing Owl occupancy. Prairie dog colony size had the greatest effect on Burrowing Owl occupancy patterns. Colonization of prairie dog colonies by owls generally increased with colony area, whereas owl extinction initially dropped and then increased as a function of increasing colony area. We found no direct link between Burrowing Owl occupancy of prairie dog colonies and plague history, but our results reaffirmed the importance of colony size. Collectively, this information will help inform future conservation efforts for Burrowing Owls that occupy prairie dog colonies. © 2014 Cooper Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: The potential secondary hazards of two anti-coagulant rodenticides commonly used in Malaysian oil palm plantations were evaluated through feeding trials with captive barn owls. A total of 12 adult barn owls (six pairs) were assigned to two rodenticide treatments and a control. The two treatments were rats fed with bromadiolone (0.005% a.i) and chlorophacinone (0.005% a.i) respectively. All rodenticide treated owls received four poisoned rats at Day 1, 3, 5 and 7 and a non-poisoned rat on each intervening day for 30 days. Each barn owl of the control group received a non-poisoned rat throughout the study. The reliability of a non-invasive technique such as an estimation of anti-coagulant rodenticide residue in regurgitated pellets and blood samples, were also evaluated. Barn owls showed behavioural aberrations such as coarse breathing, frequent closing of the eyes and reduced flying activity as early as Day 5 after consuming three poisoned rats. The weight recorded at Day 7 after treatment showed that all treated owls registered a reduction in weight. The owls in the control group on the contrary gained weight. Bromadiolone and chlorophacinone were found to have high degree of toxicity on captive barn owls. After feeding the birds with as few as four poisoned rats in a week the signs of toxicity in birds such as haemorrhages (beak) and haematoma (wing) were found. This finding is very crucial since barn owls have been reported to consume up to three rats per night and this would certainly increase their potential exposure to lethal secondary poisoning. The detection of residue in the pellets regurgitated by barn owls can be used to indicate exposure of the latter to both compounds. However, as the blood residue method is limited to the exposure duration of the compounds, this technique can only detect recent exposure to bromadiolone and chlorophacinone. The amount of residue detected in the pellet samples for chlorophacinone was 69.9 to 81.6 μg per day or equivalent to 17.2% to 27.4% of the compound consumed and corresponding value for bromadiolone was 27.2% to 34.5% (72.24 - 85.77 μg per day). This suggests that the amount of bromadiolone retained in the tissue of the rats was higher than that of chlorophacinone. Thus, barn owls face a greater potential for secondary poisoning from bromadiolone rather than chlorophacinone as can be deduced from this study.

ABSTRACT: An immunoreaction-based method was investigated for the detection of afl atoxin M1 (AFM1), which is the hydroxylated metabolite of afl atoxin B1 (AFB1). This mycotoxin may be found in milk and milk products obtained from livestock that have ingested contaminated feed. Quantitative analysis of AFM1 was carried out using indirect (competitive) immunoassay method, which can be used for low weight molecules. The real-time measurement was done with Optical Waveguide Lightmode Spectroscopy (OWLS) technique. After the optimization of the chemical and biochemical parameters (determination of the optimal concentration of the immobilized AFM1-protein conjugate, determination of the AFM1 antibody content of the samples, etc.) real samples were also examined. Three kinds of milk sample preparation methods (filtration, centrifugation, size exclusion centrifugation) and two dilution rates (100 and 200 fold) were compared. The presented competitive immunoassay method showed the best results when 100 fold diluted fi ltered or centrifuged milk samples were examined. The dynamic measuring ranges for AFM1 were 0.001-0.1 ng ml-1 and 0.0005-0.01 ng ml-1, respectively. 2014 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.

ABSTRACT: We found two nests of the long-eared owl (Asio otus) in Reserva Ecológica el Uno, located in Janos municipality, Chihuahua, Mexico. Contents of nests were recorded, photographed, and monitored between 28 March and 10 June 2007. Nests were constructed on honey mesquites (Prosopis glandulosa) and contained three eggs and three nestlings, respectively. These nests represent the first confirmed breeding record for the state of Chihuahua and the second for Mexico (outside Baja California).

ABSTRACT: We analyzed differences in wing loading and body condition indices (BCI) between hatch-year (HY) and after-hatch-year (AHY) Northern Saw-whet Owls (Aegolius acadicus) captured during autumn migration in south-central Indiana. From 2002 to 2012, banders captured 1469 owls at two sites, including 826 HY owls and 641 AHY owls. The mean BCI (mass to wing chord ratio) was 0.665 g/mm and did not vary between HY and AHY owls. BCI was lowest in 2005 (0.658 g/mm) and highest in 2008 (0.679 g/mm). During autumn 2007, the banders photographed 267 owls at the two banding sites to enable comparisons of wing loading (mass to wing surface area ratio) and BCI for different age categories. Mean wing loading was 0.242 g/cm2 and also did not vary between HY and AHY owls, confirming the BCI results and suggesting that the age classes were not gaining or losing mass differentially. The median arrival date was 3 d earlier and the nightly median capture time was 10 min later for HY owls. In addition, the mass of HY owls correlated positively with the nightly capture time, whereas this was not true for adults. Together these results suggest that HY Northern Saw-whet Owls in south-central Indiana make up for any limitations in migratory/hunting abilities by migrating earlier each night and foraging more frequently while migrating. Migrating earlier, whether by choice or as a result of density-dependent adult competition, likely affords the younger birds greater access to prey in commonly exploited foraging areas. Available data indicate the potential for regional variation in the mass to wing chord correlation for this species, which needs further research. We also suggest that future studies obtain full wingspan measurements and compare the wingtip shape (amount of point and convexity) between juvenile and adult birds. © 2014 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Flight feather shaft of long-eared owl is characterized by a three-parameter model for linear viscoelastic solids to reveal its damping ability. Uniaxial tensile tests of the long-eared owl, pigeon, and golden eagle flight feather shaft specimens were carried out based on Instron 3345 single column material testing system, respectively, and viscoelastic response of their stress and strain was described by the standard linear solid model. Parameter fitting result obtained from the tensile tests shows that there is no significant difference in instantaneous elastic modulus for the three birds' feather shafts, but the owl shaft has the highest viscosity, implying more obvious viscoelastic performance. Dynamic mechanical property was characterized based on the tensile testing results. Loss factor (tanδ) of the owl flight feather shaft was calculated to be 1.609 ± 0.238, far greater than those of the pigeon (0.896 ± 0.082) and golden eagle (1.087 ± 0.074). It is concluded that the long-eared owl flight feather has more outstanding damping ability compared to the pigeon and golden eagle flight feather shaft. Consequently, the long-eared owl flight feathers can dissipate the vibration energy more effectively during the flying process based on the principle of damping mechanism, for the purpose of vibration attenuation and structure radiated noise reduction. © 2014 Jia-li Gao et al.

ABSTRACT: The behaviour of the nestlings of nocturnal cavity-nesting species has relatively rarely been studied in detail because of problems connected with use of the technical devices required to provide long-term monitoring of individuals. However, long-term observation of nestling behaviour is crucial in order to identify different types of behaviour which may be caused by sibling competition at the end of nesting period. We studied behaviour of 43 Tengmalm's owl (Aegolius funereus) nestlings at 14 nests using a camera and a chip system. The nestlings perched at the nest box entrance from an average age of 28 days from hatching (range 24-34 days) until fledging, spending around 2 hours per day here in total, in periods ranging from a few seconds to 147 min (7.6±10.9 min, mean ± SD). We found that individual duration of perching at the nest box entrance was significantly influenced by nestlings' age and wing length and that the duration of perching at the nest box entrance significantly decreased with time of night. However, during daylight hours, time of day had no effect on either probability or duration of nestlings' perching. We suggest daylight perching at the nest box entrance results from nestlings' preparation for fledging, while individuals perching here during the night may gain an advantageous position for obtaining food from the parents; another possibility at all times of day is that nestlings can reaffirm their social dominance status by monopolizing the nest box entrance. © 2014 Kouba et al.

ABSTRACT: In birds, energy supply during growth is a major predictor of the fledglings' physical condition and survival prospects. Differential quantity and quality of fledglings produced under varying nestling food supplies are likely to affect the number of offspring that recruit into the breeding population. However, the underlying mechanisms and associated consequences are still poorly known. Using a partial cross-fostering and food supplementation experiment, we estimated the effect of variation in food supply during growth on nestling survival and fledgling phenotypic traits of Little Owls Athene noctua. Survival to fledging was much higher in food-supplemented nestlings (98.6%) than in control nestlings (82.4%). Furthermore, supplemented nestlings were on average 8.9 g heavier and were more likely to develop subcutaneous fat deposits (99.4 vs. 73.7% of treatment and control nestlings, respectively). Supplemented nestlings also had on average longer wings than control nestlings, but tarsi and culmen did not differ significantly. Furthermore, experimentally supplemented fledglings struggled more when handled and emerged sooner from tonic immobility than control fledglings. The irises of supplemented fledglings were less intensely coloured. The experimentally induced changes in nestling development probably affect individual performance beyond fledging. Nestlings from orchard-dominated habitats were larger than those from habitats dominated by arable land. As nestling food supply is largely determined by natural food availability, we conclude that habitat quality affects Little Owl productivity and offspring quality, and ultimately, population dynamics. © 2014 British Ornithologists' Union.

ABSTRACT: Owls occur at relatively low densities and are cryptic; thus, monitoring programs that estimate variation in detectability will improve inferences about their presence. We investigated temporal and abiotic sources of variation associated with detection probabilities of rufous-legged owls (Strix rufipes), a threatened forest specialist, and austral pygmy-owls (Glaucidium nana), a habitat generalist, in temperate forests of southern Chile. We also assessed whether detection of 1 species was related to the detection of the other species. During 2011-2013, we conducted 1,145 broadcast surveys at 101 sampling units established along an elevational gradient located inside and outside protected areas. We used a multi-season occupancy framework for modeling occupancy (ψ) and detection (p), and ranked models using an information-theoretic approach. We recorded 292 detections of rufous-legged owls and 334 detections of austral pygmy-owls. Occupancy was positively associated with elevation for rufous-legged owls but constant (i.e., did not vary with covariates) for pygmy-owls. Detectability for both owls increased with greater moonlight and decreased with environmental noise, and for pygmy-owls greater wind speed decreased detectability. The probability of detecting pygmy-owls increased nonlinearly with number of days since the start of surveys and peaked during the latest surveys of the season (23 Jan-7 Feb). Detection of both species was positively correlated with the detection of the other species. We suggest both species should be surveyed simultaneously for a minimum of 3-4 times during a season, survey stations should be located away from noise, and observers should record the moon phase and weather conditions for each survey. © 2014 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2014.

ABSTRACT: The influence of weather conditions on the winter diet of the Long-eared Owl was studied in 2005-2013 at one roost site in Moscow, Russia. Pellets were collected every week from November to March. The diet composition of the owls included 6 rodent species, 2 in-sectivore species and 18 bird species. Common Vole was by far the most frequent prey (70.0%), followed by Ural Field Mouse (10.8%) and Brown Rat (7.5%). Among birdprey (5.3%), House Sparrow, Great Tit, Bullfinch, Tree Sparrow and Blue Tit were the most numerous species. The winter diet showed marked interannual fluctuations. In terms of weather conditions, depth of snow cover appears to be the most important factor affecting the availability of the most frequent prey species and prey groups in the diet of the Long-eared Owl. Wind speed and precipitation do not play a significant role in predating on voles and mice. The proportion of bird prey was relatively low, but increased with precipitation, indicating the high importance of birds as an alternative prey for owls. The results thus suggest that specific features of behavior and activity of prey in different weather conditions explain their proportions in the diet of the Long-eared Owl.

ABSTRACT: The main aim of the present study is the assessment of oxidative stress related to metals in the Eurasian eagle owl (Bubo bubo) from three areas (agricultural and rural area, industrial area, and mining area) of Murcia, Southern Spain. Mean blood metal concentrations were Cd=0.07±0.21, Pb=3.27±5.21, Cu=10.62±4.77, Zn=311.47±67.14, Hg=2.32±3.83. μg/dl wet weight. Although individuals from the mining area had significant higher Pb and Hg concentrations, and significant lower glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and catalase (CAT) activities in red blood cells (RBC); the lack of differences in oxidative damage to membrane lipids (TBARS) among areas suggests that the antioxidant capacity of the different populations is able to deal with oxidant species and maintain TBARS levels in the same amount. Despite the low levels of metals, several oxidative stress biomarkers were correlated with metal concentrations. This study provides threshold concentrations at which metals cause effects on the antioxidant system in Eagle owls. Blood Cd concentrations greater than 0.3. μg/dl produced an inhibition in GPx (32%) and CAT (26%) activity in RBC. However, Cd concentrations higher than 0.02. μg/dl were enough to produce an inhibition of these enzymes. Regarding Pb levels, blood concentrations above 2. μg/dl produced an inhibition of 8% and 10.5% in GPx and CAT activities, respectively, in RBC. A depletion of 16% and 4% in tGSH levels was associated with Pb concentrations higher than 15 and 3. μg/dl, respectively, in individuals from the ancient mine site. In addition, Pb concentrations above 2 and 10. μg/dl produced a TBARS induction of 10% and 28%, respectively, in individuals from both the industrial and the mining area. Finally, Hg concentrations greater than 3 and 10. μg/dl resulted in a TBARS induction of 102% and 190%, respectively, in Eurasian eagle owls from the industrial area. Our findings show that Pb may produce effects on oxidative stress biomarkers in Strigiformes at lower concentrations than those typically accepted for considering physiological effects in Falconiformes (20. μg/dl in blood). In addition, we provide new data on Hg and Cd concentrations related to effects in the antioxidant system. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Studies of habitat relationships indicate that burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia) often select nest sites with multiple burrows. This behavior may increase survival of post-emergent nestlings. We experimentally blocked access to burrows within 20 m of nests (satellite burrows) within a large grassland in central California to evaluate the response by year-round resident burrowing owls to removal of satellite burrows. We compared reproductive performance and nest fidelity between owls whose access to potential satellite burrows was blocked and owls whose nests had similar numbers of naturally occurring burrows within 20 m of the nest prior to manipulation. Adult owls and their young moved away from treatment nests, but reproductive rates between owls from treatment and control nests did not differ. Movements involved the entire family, occurred before young had fledged, and owls did not return to the natal nest burrow. Movements ranged from 25 m to 120 m and occurred at 5 of the 7 treatment nests with young. No such movement occurred at any of the control nests. Our findings support results from correlational studies that multiple nearby burrows influence nest site selection. © 2014 The Wildlife Society © The Wildlife Society, 2014.

ABSTRACT: The diet of Bubo ascalaphus in Qatar was assessed based on pellets collected from the first known nesting site of the species in the country. The pellets contained a total of 68 prey items, representing 9 different species: 4 mammals, 1 bird, 1 reptile, and at least 3 scorpions. Mammals clearly comprised the major food source (89.7% and 97.7% in frequency and biomass respectively). Our data suggest that Pharaoh Eagle Owls are opportunistic predators that feed on a variety of prey depending on their temporal/spatial availability, which is consistent with previous studies. A literature review clearly suggests that Eagle Owls in arid to semi-arid environments are opportunistic predators with small mammals being their main prey. Predation on migrating Blue-cheeked Bee-eaters Merops persicus supports this hypothesis. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

ABSTRACT: In predator-prey foraging games, predators should respond to variations in prey state. The value of energy for the prey changes depending on season. Prey in a low energetic state and/or in a reproductive state should invest more in foraging and tolerate higher predation risk. This should make the prey more catchable, and thereby, more preferable to predators. We ask, can predators respond to prey state? How does season and state affect the foraging game from the predator's perspective? By letting owls choose between gerbils whose states we experimentally manipulated, we could demonstrate predator sensitivity to prey state and predator selectivity that otherwise may be obscured by the foraging game. During spring, owls invested more time and attacks in the patch with well-fed gerbils. During summer, owls attacked both patches equally, yet allocated more time to the patch with hungry gerbils. Energetic state per se does not seem to be the basis of owl choice. The owls strongly responded to these subtle differences. In summer, gerbils managed their behavior primarily for survival, and the owls equalized capture opportunities by attacking both patches equally. © 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.

ABSTRACT: Capsule Spontaneous calls and replies to playback of Scops Owls were significantly more frequent during the breeding period, when paired birds defend territories. The probability of spontaneous calls varied with moon phase, with a peak occurring during nights with a full moon. In some cases, during the winter, Scops Owls responded to playback calls of Little Owls, thus suggesting possible intra-guild competition between these species. © 2014 British Trust for Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: The Barn Owl (Tyto alba) bred in 15 UTM squares (75%, n = 20) of the Kazanlak Valley (central south Bulgaria) at 33 localities (55% confirmed, 12% probable and 33% possible breeding). Its distribution in the Valley was found to be five times larger and its population size ten times greater during our study period than previously thought. Evidence of one to five breeding localities (mean 2.2±1.3) was detected in each occupied UTM square. A breeding density of 4.1 bp/100 km2 was close to the average in Central Europe. Nests inside or on metal frames and ducts were typical in the region and gave possibility for its successful breeding in most of the habitable buildings. The Barn Owls were breeding mainly in poorly maintained and abandoned buildings whose supply has not decreased markedly since the agricultural restoration started in Bulgaria after it joined the European Union and intensive industrial agriculture has resumed with EU support. Currently, it appears that Barn Owl is not threatened by a ‘housing shortageʼ over the next decade. © 2014, BirdLife Hungary. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The North American Breeding Bird Survey, Christmas Bird Count, and regional and national conservation assessments provide convincing evidence that the short-eared owl (Asio flammeus) is experiencing a range-wide, long-term decline in abundance in North America. However, the species has received little conservation or research attention. The short-eared owl is vulnerable to decline because it relies heavily on large, intact grasslands and a specialized diet of unpredictable small mammal prey. The species' nomadic movements compound these vulnerabilities by making a decline difficult to detect with current monitoring programs while obfuscating stewardship responsibilities for managers. The primary threat to the species is loss, fragmentation, and degradation of large tracts of native grasslands and wetlands. We propose the following conservation priorities to better understand and begin addressing the short-eared owl's decline: 1) better define and protect important habitats; 2) improve population monitoring; 3) determine seasonal and annual movements; 4) re-evaluate NatureServe's short-eared owl national conservation classifications; 5) develop management plans and tools; and 6) classify raptors, including short-eared owls, as migratory birds in Canada. We contend that the short-eared owl's need for habitat conservation at large spatial scales, status as a predator, and high reproductive potential that affords the species capacity to recover, make it an effective and useful candidate as an umbrella species for grassland conservation. © 2014 The Wildlife Society.

ABSTRACT: This study reports on impacts of illegal trade in owl monkeys (Aotus nancymaae, A. vociferans) for the biomedical research market in the Colombian-Peruvian Amazonian border. Through freedom of information requests and interviews with hunters we found that 912 owl monkeys, including A. nancymaae captured in Peru, were trapped over a 3-month period in 2012 to supply a malaria research facility based in Leticia, Colombia, which had trapping permits for the use of only 800 A. vociferans annually yet experimentation took place using A. nancymaae. High levels of extraction in Peru have had population-level impacts with significantly lower densities of Aotus spp. (3-24individuals/km2) compared to Colombian sites with low hunting pressure (26-44individuals/km2). Post-experimental release of this species in Colombian territory has created a new distribution whose status and impacts on resident populations of A. vociferans remain unknown. The trapping method has also had environmental impact, with loss of over 65,000 trees (including sleeping sites), annually. As Aotus species are registered under the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Appendix II, international trade requires official permission and evidence that extraction does not impact wild populations. However, no official records exist and CITES legislation has failed, due principally to a lack of appropriate monitoring by national authorities responsible for compliance. Of further concern is that we had previously documented and reported the illegal trade to the appropriate governmental authorities yet still no action was taken-as demonstrated by the continuing trade in 2013. Enforcement eventually occurred when a non-governmental organization initiated legal action against organizations responsible. A successful second instance ruling by the Colombian State's Council in 2013 revoked trapping permits. Using the trade in owl monkeys as a case study we consider implementation, compliance, and enforcement of CITES in the border area to identify mechanisms to improve enforcement of environmental legislation.

ABSTRACT: Landscape transformation associated with urbanization is one of the most damaging and pervasive impacts humans have on natural ecosystems. The response of species to increasing urbanization has become a major focus of research globally. Powerful owls ( Ninox strenua) are a top-order predator the have been shown to reside in urban environments, but increasing urbanization has also been demonstrated to significantly reduce available habitat. In this paper we use species distribution models established for key food and nesting resources of powerful owls across an urban-forest gradient to constrain habitat predictions from a previously developed powerful owl species distribution model. This multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach allowed us to investigate the impacts of urbanization on potential powerful owl habitat when challenged with food and nesting requirements. As powerful owls only use tree cavities for nesting we propose that the cue for settlement in an area is associated with the presence of habitat and food and as such breeding requirements may be disconnected from settlement requirements.Our results demonstrate that incorporation of a general prey resource (at least one group of arboreal marsupials) as a cue for settlement does not reduce the amount of available habitat for powerful owls substantially. Further constraining the model with a tree cavity resource, however, leads to a substantial reduction in powerful owl habitat in the urban and urban fringe environments. If a diverse prey resource (two or more groups of arboreal marsupials) is used as the cue for settlement, this sees a substantial reduction in available habitat in urban environments. Incorporation of tree cavities into this model does not reduce the available habitat for powerful owls substantially.We propose that powerful owls do not need a diverse prey base for survival, and that breeding resources are unlikely to be a cue for settlement. As such, we argue in this paper that increasing urbanization has the potential to create an ecological trap for powerful owls as there is a significant difference between habitat capable of supporting powerful owls, and habitat in which owls can breed.Management of powerful owls in urban environments will be difficult, but this research highlights the potential for the use of nest boxes to enhance the breeding activities in increasingly urbanized environments. Replacement of this critical resource may be able to reverse any potential ecological trap that is occurring. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Mercury (Hg) is a global pollutant that bioaccumulates and biomagnifies in food chains, and is associated with adverse effects in both humans and wildlife. The Hg levels detected in blood obtained from Eagle Owl (Bubo bubo) chicks in Southeast Spain (Murcia) can be considered low (mean Hg concentration in blood from 2006 to 2012 was 36.83 ± 145.58. μg/l wet weigh, n = 600), and it is therefore unlikely that Hg pollution can negatively affect their breeding. Positive correlation (r= 0.339, p< 0.001, n = 229) was found to exist between the Hg concentrations in the blood and back feathers of the chicks. We provide a regression equation that could be helpful to estimate blood Hg levels when analyzing Hg concentrations in back feathers. Blood Hg concentrations in Eagle Owls have shown positive correlations with Hg levels in rabbit muscles, more evident in nests from the Northern area (r = 0.600, p = 0.014, n = 16), where rabbits are the main prey of Eagle Owls. The best Linear Mixed Model to explain variations in blood Hg concentrations in nestling Eagle Owls includes year and location within the mining area as variables. The variable year is assigned the largest value of relative importance, followed by the location in the ancient mining sites and then the zone. Rainfalls may have an effect on the temporal differences in the blood Hg concentrations of nestling Eagle Owls. Although the studied region is not considered Hg polluted, the Hg levels were higher in Eagle Owls and European Rabbits from areas within the ancient mining sites as compared to those in the entire region. This result shows that spatial differences in Hg concentrations in Eagle Owls may be affected by local contamination, and that the role of diet composition may be less significant. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Several species of primates, including owl monkeys (Aotus spp.), anoint by rubbing their fur with odiferous substances. Previous research has shown that capuchin monkeys (Cebus and Sapajus) anoint socially by rubbing their bodies together in groups of two or more while anointing. Owl monkeys housed at the DuMond Conservancy have been observed to anoint over the last 10 years, and we report detailed new information on the anointing behavior of this population, including descriptions of social anointing which occurs frequently. We first investigated the occurrence of self-anointing in 35 Aotus spp. presented with millipedes. Detailed descriptions regarding body regions anointed were obtained for all anointers (n = 28). The median duration for a self-anointing bout was 3.6 min (range from approx. 2 s to 14.15 min). While the latency and length of anointing bouts showed considerable interindividual differences, no statistically significant differences were found between sexes, wild-or captive-born owl monkeys or across age groups. However, we found the lower back and tail were anointed at a rate significantly greater than other body parts, but there were no differences in these patterns across sex or wild-or captive-born owl monkeys. More recently, social anointing was investigated in 26 Aotus spp. presented with millipedes, of which half were observed to anoint socially. The average duration for all social anointing bouts was 72.88 s, with a median duration of 30 s (range 5-322 s). A detailed ethogram was also generated that included behaviors that were performed while anointing, including facial expressions and vocalizations. The intraindividual variability for 8 monkeys used in both investigations is discussed. These findings extend our knowledge of anointing and confirm the existence of social anointing in another genus with a unique biology (nocturnal and socially monogamous) distinct from capuchins. © 2014 S.

ABSTRACT: To better understand the status of the Boreal Owl (Aegolius funereus) at the southern extremity of its North American range, we conducted audio playback surveys between late July and mid-October 2012 at seven of the nine northern New Mexico locations where the species had been documented between 1987 and 1993, as well as four additional locations 10-15 km from sites of previous detections. All survey locations were in subalpine conifer forest at elevations >3000 m above sea level. In total, we called in at least 12 individuals (6 adults and 6 juveniles) at or near six of the seven historical locations and at least three adults at two new locations. Of the eight locations with confirmed Boreal Owl detections, two were in the San Juan Mountains, two were in the Jemez Mountains, and four were in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. Recently fledged owls were seen at both San Juan Mountain sites and photo-documented at one site. Adult owls were photo-documented at the other six locations. Detection of Boreal Owls at six of seven historical locations confirmed the species' long-term residency in New Mexico's three northern mountain ranges. While Boreal Owls have likely been present in New Mexico since the Pleistocene, climate change appears likely to threaten their high-elevation habitat, particularly since more frequent and larger fires are predicted in the future as the forest dries.

ABSTRACT: Urbanization and the constant upgrade of airports and wind power plants have led to the need of innovative wing-designs and applications to reduce noise of aircraft and rotors. How efficiently noise can be reduced during flight is shown by owls. Owls evolved unique wing geometries, surface- and edge-features to reduce flight noise to a minimum. Wings of owls are huge in comparison to the body mass. This in combination with a specific profiling leads to a wing geometry that produces much lift even at low flight-speeds. A velvety surface texture reduces friction noise of feathers and influences the boundary layer of the wing to delay separation. Serrations at the leading edge and fringes at the trailing edge of each remex influence both lift control and noise production by reducing turbulent eddies. Further, fringes merge neighboring feathers at the spread wing to create a smooth surface. Finally, the dense and porous plumage which covers the whole body acts as an acoustic absorber that dampens noise at the point of production. The complete knowledge of the physical mechanisms underlying silent flight of owls could lead to a future wing design and to applications that reduce noise pollution for humans and nature. © 2014 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

ABSTRACT: in three long-term studies of Ferruginous Hawks (Buteo regalis), Rough-legged Hawks (Buteo lagopus), and Great Horned Owls (Bubo virginianus), we observed rare but regular occurrences of superabundant prey at nests where nestlings were hungry, emaciated, or dead. in these cases, a male appeared to be the lone parent; the female parent was found dead, kept away by disturbances, or simply absent. We conclude that the male parents, whose normal role is to provide food, were unable to expand their care to include morseling, feeding, and brooding. Faced with the stress of incessant food begging by nestlings, the male parents responded by bringing more and more food to the nest, to the point where food spoiled while the young starved amid plenty. We provide and interpret detailed observations for 11 such cases and suggest several variables that would influence the nestlings' chances of survival.

ABSTRACT: In species of mammals that habitually bear single offspring, like most anthropoid primates, the occurrence of twins is expected to impose considerable energetic costs on the caretakers. The question then arises of how caregivers cope with the potentially increased costs of raising twins. These increased costs should lead to differing developmental rates in twins when compared to singletons, and/or to changes in the caregivers' behavior. Likewise, time budgets of parents of singletons are expected to differ from those of adults without offspring. Additionally, if twinning was an adaptive response to favorable ecological conditions, it should be more likely in years with high food abundance. Following the birth in 2011 of two sets of twins in a wild population of pair-living Azara's owl monkeys (Aotus azarae) in Northern Argentina, we used long-term demographic, behavioral, and phenological data to compare (a) the proportion of time that singleton and twin infants were carried by either parent; (b) adult time budgets and ranging behavior in groups with zero, one, or two infants; and (c) the availability of food in 2011 with food availability in other years. Twins, like singletons, were carried nearly exclusively by the male, and they were carried slightly more than singletons, suggesting a relatively inflexible pattern of infant care in the species. Time budgets showed that twin parents foraged more and moved less than singleton parents or groups without infants, despite the fact that phenological data indicate that fruit availability in 2011 was not substantially higher than in some of the other years. Overall, twinning thus presumably increased costs to breeders, especially males, but its effect on animals' long-term reproductive success remains unclear. Am. J.

ABSTRACT: Tengmalm's Owls (Aegolius funereus) (TO) exhibit a pronounced sexual size dimorphism in which females are bigger than males, which have to provide food for the breeding female and for the brood. Clutch size and breeding success are strongly influenced by food supply, especially by the abundance of small rodents. Since 1979, the breeding ecology of TO has been studied in a nest box population in the Harz Mountains. In this study, the influences of food supply and other variables on sex allocation of young TO were analysed. Between 2001 and 2011, all 758 nestlings from 176 broods were sampled. Their sex was determined by DNA analysis (PCR amplification of DNA markers on the sex chromosomes). The mean sex ratio was male-biased with 53.4 % male offspring with yearly variations between 43.3 and 66.7 %. Nestling mortality was independent of sex. Food abundance changed between good and bad years. No correlation could be established between food supply by individual fathers and offspring sex ratio. Neither seasonal variation of hatching dates, the hatching order within a clutch nor individual fitness characters of parents had a significant influence on sex ratios. Yearly sex ratios did not diverge significantly from 50 %. The sex ratio fluctuated to the same degree in 5 good years and in 4 bad years. These results are in contrast to a study in Sweden, where an influence was detected within a 3-year vole cycle of food supply on offspring sex ratio. There, the sex ratio was male-biased in the good year, unbiased in the subsequent year and female-biased in the bad year. © 2013 Dt. Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.

ABSTRACT: We used motion-activated cameras to monitor the reproduction and patterns of activity of the Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia) above ground at 45 burrows in south-central Nevada during the breeding seasons of 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2005. The 37 broods, encompassing 180 young, raised over the four years represented an average of 4.9 young per successful breeding pair. Young and adult owls were detected at the burrow entrance at all times of the day and night, but adults were detected more frequently during afternoon/early evening than were young. Motion-activated cameras require less effort to implement than other techniques. Limitations include photographing only a small percentage of owl activity at the burrow; not detecting the actual number of eggs, young, or number fledged; and not being able to track individual owls over time. Further work is also necessary to compare the accuracy of productivity estimates generated from motion-activated cameras with other techniques.

ABSTRACT: Dawn and dusk choruses represent one of the most investigated topics in avian vocal behaviour, but their underlying basis remains unclear. As with the dawn chorus in passerines, dusk chorus in owls seems to support the mate and rival assessment hypothesis and happens during the most constraining period, as individuals have not yet fed and, under the handicap principle, dusk chorus is likely to reveal inter-individual differences in competitive ability, body condition and/or habitat quality. Here, a study of vocal displays at dusk of 14 Eurasian Eagle Owls Bubo bubo revealed a temporal succession in the order in which males began their vocalizations. The vocalization order appeared to be related to both the quality of the nesting territory (based upon mean number of fledged young and proportion of rats in the diet) and the male's individual quality, as revealed by haematocrit values and the brightness of the white throat patch. © 2014 British Ornithologists' Union.

ABSTRACT: The robust representation of the environment from unreliable sensory cues is vital for the efficient function of the brain. However, how the neural processing captures the most reliable cues is unknown. The interaural time difference (ITD) is the primary cue to localize sound in horizontal space. ITD is encoded in the firing rate of neurons that detect interaural phase difference (IPD). Due to the filtering effect of the head, IPD for a given location varies depending on the environmental context. We found that, in barn owls, at each location there is a frequency range where the head filtering yields the most reliable IPDs across contexts. Remarkably, the frequency tuning of space-specific neurons in the owl's midbrain varies with their preferred sound location, matching the range that carries the most reliable IPD. Thus, frequency tuning in the owl's space-specific neurons reflects a higher-order feature of the code that captures cue reliability.

ABSTRACT: Two nonmutually exclusive hypotheses can explain why divorce is an adaptive strategy to improve reproductive success. Under the 'better option hypothesis', only one of the two partners initiates divorce to secure a higher-quality partner and increases reproductive success after divorce. Under the 'incompatibility hypothesis', partners are incompatible and hence they may both increase reproductive success after divorce. In a long-term study of the barn owl (Tyto alba), we address the question of whether one or the two partners derive fitness benefits by divorcing. Our results support the hypothesis that divorce is adaptive: after a poor reproductive season, at least one of the two divorcees increase breeding success up to the level of faithful pairs. By breeding more often together, faithful pairs improve coordination and thereby gain in their efficiency to produce successful fledglings. Males would divorce to obtain a compatible mate rather than a mate of higher quality: a heritable melanin-based signal of female quality did not predict divorce (indicating that female absolute quality may not be the cause of divorce), but the new mate of divorced males was less melanic than their previous mate. This suggests that, at least for males, a cost of divorce may be to secure a lower-quality but compatible mate. The better option hypothesis could not be formally rejected, as only one of the two divorcing partners commonly succeeded in obtaining a higher reproductive success after divorce. In conclusion, incompatible partners divorce to restore reproductive success, and by breeding more often together, faithful partners improve coordination. © 2014 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

ABSTRACT: In July 2013 we studied the occurrence of fungi in an underground complex named Włodarz, located inside the massif of Włodarz, within the Owl Mountains, Lower Silesia, Poland. The study is the first mycological evaluation of the rocks in the Włodarz underground complex and the air inside and outside of it. To examine the air, the Air Ideal 3P sampler and PDA medium were used. Microbiological evaluation of the rocks inside the adit was performed using two methods, swab sampling and rinse sampling. The results were analyzed by ANOVA, and means were compared using Fisher’s least significant difference (LSD) test at α ≤ 0.05. Eleven taxa of filamentous fungi were isolated from the air sampled outside the Włodarz adit, and fifteen from the air inside. Between 65.5 and 1003 colony-forming units of fungi per m3 of air were isolated from the air sampled in the adit and about 1115 CFU from the air sampled outside of it; the differences are statistically significant. The majority of the airborne fungi were isolated from outside the adit and from the ventilation shaft containing a waterfall, probably due to air movement. From the rock walls of the shafts seven taxa of fungi were isolated, whereas from the rock debris on the adit’s floor, only six taxa. The densities of fungi obtained from the research locations are statistically significant, and the most dense fungus isolated from the air outside and inside the adit was Cladosporium cladosporioides, followed by C. herbarum at one locations in the adit. Taxa of the Aspergillus niger group were most common on the rock debris and wall rocks except for one location where Penicillium chrysogenum was most common on the rock debris and one location where Cladosporium cladosporioides was most common from the rocks walls. © 2014, National Speleological Society Inc.

ABSTRACT: Little information is available on the patterns of genetic connectivity in owls. We studied the genetic structure of the eagle owl Bubo bubo (Linnaeus, 1758) in southeastern Spain at two different spatial scales. Seven microsatellites previously described for this species were used, although only six loci amplified correctly. The observed low genetic variation could be explained by the short dispersal distance, high mortality rate and high degree of monogamy shown by this large nocturnal predator. As expected, the highest genetic isolation was detected in the geographically most isolated population. Significant genetic differentiation was found among study units separated by less than 50 km. The territorial analysis showed interesting connectivity patterns related with the gene flow and turnover rate of the breeding individuals. The lowest genetic diversity was found in the region with the largest population, which could imply incipient inbreeding.

ABSTRACT: This note reports two opportunistic events of predation on Seba's Short-tailed Bats Carollia perspicillata (Chiroptera: Phyllostomidae) by an immature Crested Owl Lophostrix cristata (Strigiformes: Strigidae), in Central Amazonia, Brazil. Both predation events took place while bats were mist-netted. Given the abundance of C. perspicillata in the study area we argue that this bat species likely constitutes a natural prey for L. cristata.

ABSTRACT: The diet of the Sooty Owl Tyto tenebricosa was studied at Blaxland in the lower Blue Mountains, New South Wales, by analysis of regurgitated pellet material. Small and medium-sized mammals were the most common prey, as also documented by previous studies. However, birds and reptiles contributed an unusually high proportion of the diet, especially the Pink-tongued Skink Cyclodomorphus gerrardii, which was the second most important prey species, by both number and biomass.

ABSTRACT: The Mexican Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis lucida) was listed as "threatened" by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1993. Predicting the distribution of suitable habitat is an important step in the owl's recovery, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) provide appropriate spatial and analytic tools. We developed and validated a GIS-based occurrence model for Mexican Spotted Owls in arid canyon environments in Utah. We generated a set of competing models with topographic and vegetation covariates, and ranked models using information theory. Our top-ranked models indicated slope and variation in elevation were important predictors for the occurrence of Mexican Spotted Owls in rocky habitats, and we averaged coefficients from the top models to estimate probability of owl occurrence. During a model validation survey, we detected Spotted Owls in 22 test plots, where mean estimated probability of occurrence, an index to habitat suitability, was 0.68 (SE = 0.03). In addition, we evaluated model performance at 30 known Mexican Spotted Owl use sites from outside our model development areas, and observed an overall mean probability of occurrence equal to 0.78 (95% CI = 0.71-0.81). For the 30 known owl use sites, estimated probability of occurrence using our top model ranged from 0.54-0.90. Our results suggest that GIS modeling can be an important tool for predicting the potential distribution of Mexican Spotted Owls and their habitat in arid canyonlands in Utah. © 2014 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Source-sink dynamics are an emergent property of complex species-landscape interactions. A better understanding of how human activities affect source-sink dynamics has the potential to inform and improve the management of species of conservation concern. Here we use a study of the northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) to introduce new methods for quantifying source-sink dynamics that simultaneously describe the population-wide consequences of changes to landscape connectivity. Our spotted owl model is mechanistic, spatially-explicit, individual-based, and incorporates competition with barred owls (Strix varia). Our observations of spotted owl source-sink dynamics could not have been inferred solely from habitat quality, and were sensitive to landscape connectivity and the spatial sampling schemes employed by the model. We conclude that a clear understanding of source-sink dynamics can best be obtained from sampling simultaneously at multiple spatial scales. Our methodology is general, can be readily adapted to other systems, and will work with population models ranging from simple and low-parameter to complex and data-intensive. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht (outside the USA).

ABSTRACT: The Eastern Grass Owl, Tyto longimembris, has been recorded infrequently from arid zone springs, boredrains and wetlands in South Australia since first reported in the far north-east of South Australia in 1975. During the 2010-2012 La Niña event, rainfall in inland South Australia was at its highest in decades, resulting in irruptions of small native mammal populations, particularly the Long-haired Rat, Rattus villosissimus. We present seven new records of Grass Owls from five locations, including the first records from the western Lake Eyre Basin. Habitat and food resources are discussed in context with the sightings and we suggest methods for future surveys targeted at Grass Owls, along with reference to the management of the artificial bore drain habitats often used by the species.

ABSTRACT: The Tropical Screech-Owl (Megascops choliba) is a small nocturnal raptor that uses a large range of habitats throughout Brazil. Although it is one of the most abundant owls in the Neotropics, nothing has been published on its spatial ecology, and information on basic natural history is scarce. We followed four radio-tagged males to estimate home-range size and habitat selection in a savanna (cerrado) patch in southeastern Brazil. The mean (±SD) home-range size was 51.2 (26.9) ha using the 95% minimum convex polygon (MCP) method and 80.8 (40.2) ha using the 95% fixed kernel (FK) method. The mean (±SD) core area was 22.4 (8.8) ha (65% FK). During nocturnal activities, owls preferred semi-open (campo cerrado) and semi-closed (cerrado sensu stricto) habitats and avoided open habitats (campo sujo). Gallery forests and patches of invasive pines were preferred for roosting during the day. The variation in size of individual home ranges may be explained by individual's breeding status and habitat structure. Home-range sizes of Tropical Screech-Owls were generally similar to those of other screech-owls in North America, and the small differences in area requirements among species may be related to body mass and habitat structure. © 2014 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Spatially explicit models depicting species occupancy offer a useful conservation tool for land managers. Using occurrence data collected in 2009 and 2010 from the Boise National Forest, Idaho, we developed distribution models for Flammulated Owls (Psiloscops flammeolus) and Northern Saw-whet Owls (Aegolius acadicus) to explore associations between habitat factors and owl occupancy. We then spatially applied these models in a Geographic Information System. We considered land cover and topographic variables at three spatial scales: 0.4-km, 1-km, or 3-km-radius plots centered on point-count locations (n = 150) with resolution of land covers at 30 m. Flammulated Owls occupied 27 (18%) point-count locations and occurred in areas with a higher proportion of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) at the 0.4-km scale, less diverse land cover composition at the 1-km scale, and in south-facing aspects at the 3-km scale. Northern Saw-whet Owls occupied 45 (30%) point-count locations and were associated with relatively flat terrain at the 0.4-km scale that had larger proportions of non-forest land cover. At the 1-km and 3-km scales, Northern Saw-whet Owls occurred in areas with south-facing aspects having a higher proportion of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), respectively. Biologists and land managers interested in the conservation of Flammulated Owls and Northern Saw-whet Owls can use our approach to delineate habitats important for these owls or to help identify locations suitable for restoration. © 2014 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Animals sharing a common habitat can indirectly receive information about their environment by observing information exchanges between other animals, a process known as eavesdropping. Animals that use an auditory alarm calling system are an important indirect information source for eavesdropping individuals in their environments. We investigated whether Western burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia hypugaea) nesting on black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) colonies responded to broadcasts of prairie dog alarm calls. Western burrowing owls are closely associated with black-tailed prairie dogs in Colorado and neighboring states on the Great Plains of the United States. Prairie dog burrows in active colonies can serve as nesting sites for Western burrowing owls, and prairie dogs may act as an alternative prey source for predators, potentially decreasing the burrowing owls' risk of predation through the dilution effect. Burrowing owls nesting on prairie dog colonies may also eavesdrop on prairie dog alarm calls, enhancing their survival and nesting success on prairie dog colonies. We performed broadcast experiments with three different sounds: a prairie dog alarm call, a biological control (cattle mooing), and a non-biological control (an airplane engine), and characterized burrowing owl responses as either alert or relaxed. For each sound stimulus, we recorded the time to first alert response to broadcast sounds (latency) and also how frequently the target burrowing owl exhibited an alert response within the first ten seconds of the broadcast (intensity). Burrowing owls reacted more quickly to the prairie dog alarm than to the biological control. They significantly increased the intensity of alert behaviors in response to broadcasts of the alarm, but did not show an increased reaction to either the biological or the non-biological control. Our results suggest that burrowing owls nesting on prairie dog colonies eavesdrop on, and increase their alert behaviors in response to, prairie dog alarm calls. © 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

ABSTRACT: Colour morph variation is widely observed in owls and several studies have described differences In life history traits among the morphs. Traditionally, Glaucidium owls are described as having two colour morphs, rufous and grey, which are supposedly independent of age or sex. During 2010-2012, nest boxes were set up in order to study the basic life history of Collared Pygmy Owls Glaucidium brodiei. We banded the population and followed some of the fledglings for nearly two years. Our results-in combination with data from museum specimens-clearly show that the colour morph In Collared Pygmy Owls is age-dependent, changing from the original fledgling plumage (2-3 months after hatching) to the rufous morph (4-7 months after hatching), and finally to the definitive grey plumage. Our results reject the long-standing polymorphism hypothesis for the pygmy owl. We conclude that the age of the birds should be considered before a colour polymorphism can be confirmed, especially in secretive nocturnal species. The case of within-species polymorphism might be overstated in Strigiformes.

ABSTRACT: Restrictions in technology have limited past habitat selection studies for many species to the home-range level, as a finerscale understanding was often not possible. Consequently, these studies may not identify the true mechanism driving habitat selection patterns, which may influence how such results are applied in conservation. We used GPS dataloggers with digital video recorders to identify foraging modes and locations in which endangered Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia) captured prey. We measured the coarse and fine-scale characteristics of vegetation at locations in which owls searched for, versus where they caught, vertebrate prey. Most prey items were caught using hover-hunting. Burrowing Owls searched for, and caught, vertebrate prey in all cover types, but were more likely to kill prey in areas with sparse and less dense vegetative cover. Management strategies designed to increase Burrowing Owl foraging success in the Canadian prairies should try to ensure a mosaic of vegetation heights across cover types. © 2014 by the author(s).

ABSTRACT: Recently, huge amounts of data are generated in the domain of biology. Embedded with domain knowledge from different disciplines, the isolated biological resources are implicitly connected. Thus it has shaped a big network of versatile biological knowledge. Faced with such massive, disparate, and interlinked biological data, providing an efficient way to model, integrate, and analyze the big biological network becomes a challenge. In this paper, we present a general OWL (web ontology language) reasoning framework to study the implicit relationships among biological entities. A comprehensive biological ontology across traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and western medicine (WM) is used to create a conceptual model for the biological network. Then corresponding biological data is integrated into a biological knowledge network as the data model. Based on the conceptual model and data model, a scalable OWL reasoning method is utilized to infer the potential associations between biological entities from the biological network. In our experiment, we focus on the association discovery between TCM and WM. The derived associations are quite useful for biologists to promote the development of novel drugs and TCM modernization. The experimental results show that the system achieves high efficiency, accuracy, scalability, and effectivity. © 2014 Huajun Chen et al.

ABSTRACT: Invasive mammals include good tree climbers that use tree cavities for resting and nesting. Tree cavities are important but limited resources in most forests; thus, some invasive mammals can be serious competitors for native cavity-using species, especially cavity-nesting birds. Despite the potential impact, such inter-class competition has rarely been considered. We examined the possibility of resource competition for tree cavities between the invasive raccoon Procyon lotor and the native Ural owl Strix uralensis. Both species are nocturnal and use tree cavities during daytime. We assessed an overlap in cavity use for both species as an indication of potential competition by monitoring 341 cavities during their breeding season in a natural park in Hokkaido, Japan. Of 341 potentially available cavities, raccoons and Ural owls used 37 and 32, respectively. The characteristics of 58 cavities used by raccoons or owls were compared to 49 random cavities to determine if they selected cavities with certain characteristics. As predicted from a large amount of tree cavities and a low raccoon density in this managed forest, we did not find direct evidence of competition, such as physical interaction, intrusion to cavities, or habitat segregation. Cavity types used by both species overlapped considerably in terms of height, entrance size, depth, and other characteristics: their habitats were widely overlapped. Further, in four cavities, one species was replaced by the other. Given the similar habitat requirements, the invasive raccoon could be a potential competitor for Ural owl when raccoon density increases and/or cavity availability decreases, which is the case for many forests in Japan. This study suggests that potential threats of resource competition among not only closely but also distantly related taxa should be taken into consideration when studying the impacts of invasive species. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

ABSTRACT: The present study was conducted on shoulder girdle of pigeon, crow and owl. The shoulder girdle was comprised of three bones namely scapula, clavicle and coracoid. In all the three species, the scapula was in the form of a blade like structure and slightly curved from cranial to caudal. The proximal extremity was composed of a lateral facet and a medial pointed process. The presence of additional intermediate process and pneumatic foramina could act as an identification mark for the scapula of crow. The clavicles were two in number-right and left which were fused distally to form a single bony structure called furcula in all the three species. The lateral surface of the proximal extremity of crow contained pneumatic foramina. The furcula was typically 'U' shaped in crow and 'V' shapd in own and pigeon. The hypocleidium was present only in crow. The coracoids was the strongest bone of the shoulder girdle. Medial face of procoracoid process of crow presented a well-developed pneumatic foramen which was absent in owl and pigeon. Acrocoracoid process of owl was pierced by a through and though foramen which was not seen in crow and pigeon. It could now be concluded that the morphological variations of shoulder girdle is potentially phylogenetically useful and the variation might be useful for differentiating species level taxa.

ABSTRACT: Diet of tawny owl Strix aluco was studied in gardens of National Agronomical Institute of El Harrach during 1996 and 1997, and that of barn owl Tyto alba in Jardin d'Essai of Hamma in 1997. In total 601 regurgitated pellets, 527 of tawny owl and 74 of barn owl, were analyzed. Five types of prey items included: arthropods, amphibians, reptiles, birds and small mammals. Birds were consumed the most (37.8%) by tawny owl, and the amphibians (37.5%) by the barn owl. Common wall gecko or moorish gecko. Tarentola mauritanica (16.8%) was the most frequently preyed by tawny owl and Mediterranean painted frog, Discoglosssus pictus (34.9%) by barn owl. Copyright 2014 Zoological Society of Pakistan.

ABSTRACT: We studied a small isolated population of Mexican Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis lucida) from 1996-1997 in the Rincon Mountains of Saguaro National Park, southeastern Arizona, USA. All mixed-conifer and pine-oak forest patches in the park were surveyed for Spotted Owls, and we located, captured, and radio-tagged 10 adult birds representing five mated pairs. Using radio-telemetry, we examined owl home range characteristics, roost habitat, and monitored reproduction within these five territories. Breeding season (Mar-Sep) home range size for 10 adult owls (95% adaptive kernel isopleths) averaged 267 ha (±207 SD), and varied widely among owls (range 34-652 ha). Mean home range size for owl pairs was 478 ha (±417 ha SD), and ranged from 70-1,160 ha. Owls that produced young used smaller home ranges than owls that had no young. Six habitat variables differed significantly between roost and random sites, including: percent canopy cover, number of trees, number of vegetation layers, average height of trees, average diameter of trees, and tree basal area. Radio-marked owls remained in their territories following small prescribed management fires within those territories, exhibiting no proximate effects to the presence of prescribed fire. © Copyright 2014 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: The barred owl (Strix varia) has invaded the range of the northern spotted owl (S. occidentalis caurina) over the past century. The Northern Spotted Owl Recovery Plan recommended removal experiments to assess both the effect of barred owls on spotted owls and the feasibility of initiating some form of barred owl control to enhance recovery of the northern spotted owl. Concern has been raised that such experiments will be neither feasible nor cost-effective. To assess these and other concerns, we conducted lethal removal of barred owls within 3 areas totaling 85,205 ha in northern California, USA. We collected 73 of 81 territorial barred owls detected from 2009 to 2012 during 122 field visits. It took an average of 2 hr 23 min to collect each barred owl from the time of arrival at a site to the time a collected bird was completely processed for field data. Most barred owls were collected within one-half hour of arrival at a site. Lethal removal of barred owls was rapid, technically feasible, and cost-effective. We provide recommendations for techniques we found to be effective. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.

ABSTRACT: The Northern Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) is an emblematic, threatened raptor associated with dense, late-successional forests in the Pacific Northwest, USA. Concerns over high-severity fire and reduced timber harvesting have led to programs to commercially thin forests, and this may occur within habitat designated as "critical" for spotted owls. However, thinning is only allowed under the U.S. Government spotted owl guidelines if the long-term benefits clearly outweigh adverse impacts. This possibility remains uncertain. Adverse impacts from commercial thinning may be caused by removal of key habitat elements and creation of forests that are more open than those likely to be occupied by spotted owls. Benefits of thinning may accrue through reduction in high-severity fire, yet whether the firereduction benefits accrue faster than the adverse impacts of reduced late-successional habitat from thinning remains an untested hypothesis. We found that rotations of severe fire (the time required for high-severity fire to burn an area equal to the area of interest once) in spotted owl habitat since 1996, the earliest date we could use, were 362 and 913 years for the two regions of interest: the Klamath and dry Cascades. Using empirical data, we calculated the future amount of spotted owl habitat that may be maintained with these rates of high-severity fire and ongoing forest regrowth rates with and without commercial thinning. Over 40 years, habitat loss would be far greater than with no thinning because, under a "best case" scenario, thinning reduced 3.4 and 6.0 times more dense, late-successional forest than it prevented from burning in high-severity fire in the Klamath and dry Cascades, respectively. Even if rates of fire increase substantially, the requirement that the long-term benefits of commercial thinning clearly outweigh adverse impacts is not attainable with commercial thinning in spotted owl habitat. It is also becoming increasingly recognized that exclusion of high-severity fire may not benefit spotted owls in areas where owls evolved with reoccurring fires in the landscape. © Odion et al.; Licensee Bentham Open.

ABSTRACT: Road mortality affects natural populations worldwide. Although the effects of road mortality are often documented, studies assessing the impact of road mortality on the viability of the affected populations are not so common. In fact, road mortality data are often limited to a small number of years from which it is difficult to build statistical models to assess the impact of road mortality on population trends, including the probability of extinction. In the last decades several studies have reported a considerable decline in barn owl (Tyto alba) populations attributed mainly to land use change and to the expansion of the road network to accommodate traffic growth. For instance, road monitoring programs show high road mortality rates ranging from 0.07 owls/km/year to 2.61 owls/km/year. We developed a stochastic, age-structured model to evaluate the impact of road-kills on barn owl populations and their risk of extinction. Using this model we identified the range of parameters that are most likely to apply to a population in southern Portugal and assessed how road mortality has affected this population. Three important results are: the number of individuals of the barn owl population exhibits high intra and inter-annual variability, even an annual road mortality rate of 5% reduces barn owl populations to half of their original size, and probability of extinction increases dramatically when annual road mortality exceeds 30% and it is largely independent of the original population size. Although simulations seem to show that road mortality is still below the values for which there is risk of extinction, we recommend authorities to closely monitor the owls' numbers temporal trends and to take the necessary measures to reduce road mortality. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Natal dispersal is an important driver of population and colonization dynamics, yet factors that affect timing and distance of post-fledging movements are poorly understood. We studied post-fledging movements of 34 (12 male and 22 female) juvenile Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia) between June 2002 and April 2003, in a nonmigratory population in the Imperial Valley, California. We found high variation in movement patterns among individuals. Juvenile Burrowing Owls left their nest throughout the year, with two females (6%) remaining within 100 m of their natal burrow until the beginning of the following year's breeding season. Juvenile Burrowing Owls moved up to 11.7 km (males: 397 ± 124 m; females 1762 ± 630 m) between emergence from the nest to the following breeding season. Those that fledged early in the season remained closer to their nests for a longer period than those that fledged later in the season. Female Burrowing Owls remained ≤100 m from their natal nests for a longer duration than males. Members of male-female, but not male-male, sibling pairs were more likely to be within 100 m of one another than members of female-female sibling pairs. After members of sibling pairs were >100 m apart, distance between members of sibling pairs was related only to time since fledging. Our study, conducted in a highly simplified agricultural environment, provides evidence that sex, fledging date, and sibling relationships can be responsible for the high individual variation in post-fledging movements of Burrowing Owls that has often been attributed to environmental variation. © 2014 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: A spectrum of feeding of the eagle owl (Bubo bubo) was studied in the Republic of Mordovia. The results of analyzing the droplets of the bird of prey to determine the specific composition of mammals are presented. Using this method, more than half of all the registered kinds of rodents and insectivorous mammals were revealed. The most widespread food (55.3%) for the eagle owl in the conditions of Mordovia is Microtus arvalis. Rare species, which were not found earlier in the territories studied using traditional methods of catching, have been registered. About 64% of victims of the eagle owl were identified based on the bones of the skull and bottom jaw. The importance of various skeleton elements in revealing the specific structure is noted. While using fine mammals for feeding, the percentage of bone remains in the droplets, as a rule, is less than that when feeding on birds.

ABSTRACT: Recent studies provide evidence for the chronotype-time perspective relationships. Larks are more future-oriented and owls are more present-oriented. The present study expands this initial research by examining whether the associations are replicable with other time perspective measures, and whether self-control explains the observed relationships. Chronotype was assessed with the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire and the basic associations with the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory were replicated in a sample of 142 New Zealand students, but not with other measures.

ABSTRACT: Owls are a poorly-studied avian group, despite their well-established role in prey regulation and biological control. For Neotropical species, distribution and abundance are especially poorly known. Structural components of forests have been used to explain patterns of owl habitat use and community structure, but such analyses have largely focused on species in the northern hemisphere. The present study examines whether components of forest structure influence habitat use (occurrence and abundance) for six species of owls in an upland forest in central Amazonian Brazil. Between October and November 2012, a playback method was used to sample occurrence and abundance in 30 points, each separated from the next by 1 km. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed relationships between four owl species and components of forest structure associated with food availability: Amazonian Pygmy Owl (Glaucidium hardyi) and distance to nearest stream (p = 0.023), Northern Tawny-bellied Screech Owl (Megascops watsonii) and leaf-litter depth (p = 0.045), Crested Owl (Lophostrix cristata) and dead fallen trunks on forest floor (p = 0.042), and Spectacled Owl (Pulsatrix perspicillata) and dead fallen trunks on forest floor (p = 0.009). A multiple logistic regression also revealed a significant association (p = 0.050) between the Spectacled Owl and dead fallen trunks on forest floor. The influence of the components of forest structure differs between the species, demonstrating interspecific differences in micro-habitat use, and reflecting the importance of food resource availability in habitat choice.

ABSTRACT: Although paternal care is rare in mammals, males of several primate taxa exhibit high degrees of this behavior. Studies a number of vertebrate species found a positive correlation between prolactin (PRL) levels and paternal care. Studies of maternal care in knockout mice also indicate that the prolactin receptor (PRLR) plays a critical role in the neural regulation of parental care. To better understand the extent of PRLR genetic variation within primates, we characterized intraspecific coding variation in Azara's owl monkeys (Aotus azarai) from northern Argentina, a species with intensive paternal care. We then examined PRLR variation in 1088 humans (Homo sapiens) from the 1000 Genomes Project. Lastly, we assessed interspecific variation in PRLR in 4 different Aotus spp. and 12 phylogenetically (and behaviorally) disparate primate taxa. Our analyses revealed that the coding region of PRLR exhibits significant variation in all species of primates, with nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions being enriched in the intracellular domain, a region responsible for activation of downstream targets in the PRL pathway. In addition, several species exhibit entire codon deletions in this region. These results suggest a non-neutral evolutionary history of the PRLR locus within different primate lineages, and further imply that the translated PRLR protein has undergone considerable change throughout primate evolution. Such changes may be driven by selection for different behaviors and physiologies resulting from modulations of the pleiotropic prolactin pathway. Yet, the genetic variants in PRLR among primate taxa do not discretely cluster with species-level differences in paternal care behaviors. These observations imply that other mechanisms must be involved in the regulation of paternal care in primates. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: This study aimed to estimate the home range of Eurasian Eagle Owl (Bubo bubo) from May to November 2012. Bubo bubo were rescued by Chungnam Wild Animal Rescue Center. WT-100 weigh 83g. Analysis of home ranges used a SHP File and ArcGIS 9.0 for GIS, and used a Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and Minimum Convex Polygon (MCP) for analysis. Home range were 39.1 km2 (MCP) and 27.8 km2 (KDE 95%), 20.9km2 (KDE 90%), 4.2km2 (KDE 50%). Home range of Bubo bubo showed very similar results to the previous study. That is result of opportunistic foraging tactics to selecting prey. © 2013 Korean Biodiversity Information Facility.

ABSTRACT: A slat without a cove is built on the basis of a bionic airfoil (i.e. stowed multi-element airfoil), which is extracted from a long-eared owl wing. The three-dimensional models with a deployed slat and a stowed slat are measured in a low-turbulence wind tunnel. The results are used to characterize high-lift effect: compared with the stowed slat, the deployed slat works more like a spoiler at low angles of attack, but like a conventional slat or slot at high angles of attack. In addition, it can also increase stall angle and maximum lift coefficient, and postpone the decrease in the gradient of the lift coefficient. At the same time, the flow field visualized around both three-dimensional models suggests the leading-edge separation associated with the decrease in the gradient of the lift coefficient. Furthermore, the related two-dimensional simulation well agrees with the analysis of the lift coefficient, as the complement to the experiment. The bionic slat may be used as reference in the design of leading-edge slats without a cove. © 2013 Jilin University.

ABSTRACT: Episodes of fluvial deposition and incision preserved in Quaternary sediments are valuable archives, but have been understudied in low order streams in central Texas, USA. An exposure along Owl Creek a tributary of the Brazos River was examined using geological approaches and pedological, including stratigraphy and soil description and characterization. Eight stratigraphic units were identified, described, and constrained in time based on relative stratigraphy and optically stimulated luminescent (OSL) ranging in age from ~120ka to <8ka. Despite the dynamic nature of fluvial systems, the Owl Creek record has uniquely preserved sediment spanning the late Quaternary with major erosional events that may reflect the advance and retreat of the Laurentide ice sheet and the southward displacement of the jet stream and ensuing wetter conditions. Regional proxies become more abundant into the Holocene with Owl Creek and other local stream preserving sediment of different ages and are likely responding to intrinsic variables. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

ABSTRACT: Members of the genus Aotus are traditionally considered strictly nocturnal, however, in recent years cathemeral habits have been described in a single species of owl monkey, Aotus azarai, which occur in the highly seasonal habitat of the Argentinean Chaco. This finding raises the question as to whether other species of Aotus exhibit cathemeral activity in less seasonal habitats. In this study, we observed the diurnal activity of one group of A. nigriceps living in the Manu Biosphere Reserve, Peru over 65 days. The data collected indicate that A. nigriceps has only sporadic diurnal bouts of activity. In addition, nocturnal luminosity of the previous night, rainfall, and temperature did not correlate with the minor diurnal activity exhibited. This suggests that for A. nigriceps the potential costs of shifting to diurnality may outweigh its prospective advantages in this rainforest environment. © 2013 Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: Complexes of buildings belonging to vast farms, distributed in the form of islands over a landscape of monoculture farming constituted important occurrence sites of the barn owl and the little owl. During 1999-2012, the fate of 59 farms inhabited by the studied species was observed. Both species of owls preferred using three categories of buildings: cowsheds, warehouses and blocks of flats. Cases have been reported of the same building being simultaneously occupied by two species of owls. The study showed that the disappearance of sites of the studied owls is caused by factors connected with the decreasing intensity of farming. The most common of these factors turned out to be demolitions of buildings occupied by owls and the abandonment of animal production. Cases of predation by carnivore mammals were also reported. The process of disappearance of owl sites appears to manifest itself more intensely on those farms where residential and industrial infrastructure occupies a smaller area.

ABSTRACT: Study analysis the influence of selected factors on the size of tawny owl Strix aluco territories in the forests of Lublin region. The survey was held in years 2005 and 2006 using the voice stimulation. The territory area was determined using Minimum Convex Polygon method. 43 territories with the average size of 18.8 ha were set on 26 study sites. The largest territory was found for birds during laying and incubation period (102.6 ha) and during after-breeding period (98.3 ha). Significant differences in territory size was found depending on the breeding density (high density - average territory size of 5.1 ha, low density - 26.9 ha). The average territory area in winter was 1.5 ha (range 1-2.7 ha), in spring 20.8 ha (1-102.6 ha), in summer 10.8 ha (1-65.5 ha) and in autumn 30.9 ha (1-98.3 ha).

ABSTRACT: The extinct São Miguel Scops Owl Otus frutuosoi n. sp. is described from fossil bones found in Gruta de Água de Pau, a volcanic tube in São Miguel Island (Azores Archipelago, North Atlantic Ocean). It is the first extinct bird described from the Azores and, after the Madeiran Scops Owl (O. mauli Rando, Pieper, Alcover & Olson 2012a), the second extinct spe-cies of Strigiformes known in Macaronesia. The forelimb elements of the new taxon are shorter, the hindlimb elements are longer, and the pelvis is shorter and broader than in the Eurasian Scops Owl (O. scops Linnaeus). The new species differs from O. mauli in the smaller size of many of its bones, especially the ulna and tibiotarsus. Its measurements (esti-mated weight, wing area, and wing loading, and the ratio of humerus + ulna + carpometacarpus length/femur length) in-dicate weak powers of flight and ground-dwelling habits. The latest occurrence of the new species, as evidenced by a radiocarbon date of 1970±40 BP from bone collagen, indicates a Late Holocene extinction event subsequent to 49 cal BC, and was probably linked to human arrival and subsequent habitat alterations.

ABSTRACT: El conocimiento sobre las aves nocturnas del Ecuador, y del Neotrópico en general, es deficiente. Apenas se han documentado ciertos detalles de la historia natural de la mayoría de búhos (Strigidae); mientras, la distribución en este país de al menos 11 especies de las 28 existentes todavía no se comprende bien. Presentamos nuevos registros de distribución de ocho especies de autillos (Megascops) y mochuelos (Glaucidium) en Ecuador, con algunas extensiones de rango altitudinal y geográfico. Además, hacemos una evaluación más detallada del estado de conservación de una especie globalmente amenazada (Mochuelo de Bosque Nublado G. nubicola) y una casi amenazada (Autillo Colombiano M. colombianus). Concordamos que M. colombianus se considere Casi Amenazada en el país porque su declive poblacional aparenta ser leve, el grado de protección es moderado (44%) y las poblaciones colombianas pueden proveer inmigrantes. Por su parte, G. nubicola podría calificar como En Peligro por densidades poblacionales bajas, pocas localidades, declinación moderada y escasa protección; sin embargo, una aproximación más conservadora sería asignarle la categoría Vulnerable, en concordancia con las evaluaciones actuales. Sugerimos una revisión de su categoría global.

ABSTRACT: Fire over the past decade has affected forests in the San Bernardino Mountains of southern California, providing an excellent opportunity to examine how this disturbance, and subsequent post-fire salvage logging, influenced California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) breeding-season site occupancy dynamics there and in the nearby San Jacinto Mountains. Using occupancy survey data from 2003 to 2011 for all-detections and pairs-only data, we estimated annual extinction and colonization probabilities at 71 burned and 97 unburned breeding-season sites before and after fire, while controlling for confounding effects of non-fire-related temporal variation and among-site differences in habitat characteristics. We found no statistically significant effects of fire or salvage logging on occupancy dynamics of spotted owls of southern California. However, we found some evidence that fire and logging effects could be biologically meaningful. For pairs data, the model-averaged mean of fire-related effects on colonization and extinction probabilities resulted in a 0.062 lesser site-occupancy probability in burned sites 1-year post-fire relative to unburned sites. Post-fire salvage logging reduced occupancy an additional 0.046 relative to sites that only burned. We documented a threshold-type relationship between extinction and colonization probabilities and the amount of forested habitat (conifer or hardwood tree cover types) that burned at high severity within a 203-ha core area around spotted owl nests and roost centroids. Sites where approximately 0-50 ha of forested habitat within the core area burned at high severity had extinction probabilities similar to unburned sites, but where more than approximately 50 ha of forested habitat burned severely, extinction probability increased approximately 0.003 for every additional hectare severely burned. The majority (75%) of sites burned below this threshold. Sites where high-severity fire affected >50 ha of forested habitat could still support spotted owls, so all burned sites should be monitored for occupancy before management actions such as salvage logging are undertaken that could be detrimental to the subspecies. We also recommend that managers strive to reduce human-caused ignitions along the wildland-urban interface, particularly at lower elevations where owl sites are at higher risk of extinction from fire. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.

ABSTRACT: Alpha satellite DNA is a repetitive sequence known to be a major DNA component of centromeres in primates (order Primates). New World monkeys form one major taxon (parvorder Platyrrhini) of primates, and their alpha satellite DNA is known to comprise repeat units of around 340 bp. In one species (Azara's owl monkey Aotus azarae) of this taxon, we identified two types of alpha satellite DNA consisting of 185- and 344-bp repeat units that we designated as OwlAlp1 and OwlAlp2, respectively. OwlAlp2 exhibits similarity throughout its entire sequence to the alpha satellite DNA of other New World monkeys. The chromosomal locations of the two types of sequence are markedly distinct: OwlAlp1 was observed at the centromeric constrictions, whereas OwlAlp2 was found in the pericentric regions. From these results, we inferred that OwlAlp1 was derived from OwlAlp2 and rapidly replaced OwlAlp2 as the principal alpha satellite DNA on a short time scale at the speciation level. A less likely alternative explanation is also discussed. © The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Kazusa DNA Research Institute.

ABSTRACT: In the United States, new regulations on second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides will likely be offset by expanded use of first-generation anticoagulant rodenticides. In the present study, eastern screech-owls (Megascops asio) were fed 10μg diphacinone/g wet weight food for 7 d, and recovery was monitored over a 21-d postexposure period. By day 3 of exposure, diphacinone (DPN) was detected in liver (1.63μg/g wet wt) and kidney (5.83μg/g) and coagulopathy was apparent. By day 7, prothrombin time (PT) and Russell's viper venom time (RVVT) were prolonged, and some individuals were anemic. Upon termination of exposure, coagulopathy and anemia were resolved within 4 d, and residues decreased to <0.3μg/g by day 7. Liver and kidney DPN elimination occurred in 2 phases (initial rapid loss, followed by slower loss rate), with overall half-lives of 11.7 d and 2.1 d, respectively. Prolonged PT and RVVT occurred in 10% of the exposed owls with liver DPN concentrations of 0.122μg/g and 0.282μg/g and in 90% of the owls with liver concentrations of 0.638μg/g and 0.361μg/g. These liver residue levels associated with coagulopathy fall in the range of values reported in raptor mortality incidents involving DPN. These tissue-based toxicity reference values for coagulopathy in adult screech-owls have application for interpreting nontarget mortality and assessing the hazard of DPN in rodent-control operations. Diphacinone exposure evokes toxicity in raptors within a matter of days; but once exposure is terminated, recovery of hemostasis occurs rapidly. © 2013 SETAC.

ABSTRACT: This study reports limited ecological information gathered from opportunistic observations and radio-tracking of Masked Owls Tyto novaehollandiae novaehollandiae from coastal forests in East Gippsland, Victoria. Eight mammal species (seven native, one introduced) were detected from 44 dietary items, of which six species and 86% of dietary composition were species that are predominantly terrestrial in habit. Twelve roosting/nesting sites were located; 11 were within eucalypt tree-hollows (of which 10 trees were either dead or partially dead, with significant structural damage), and one roost was within foliage. Observations of apparently aggressive behaviour between the Masked Owl and the Sooty Owl T. tenebricosa, following call-playback, are discussed.

ABSTRACT: Blackflies (Simuliidae) have been shown to influence birds negatively in several ways. In 2011, during a peak lemming year, we found that two of 28 nests of Snowy Owls Bubo scandiacus in Northern Norway and Finland failed due to blackfly attacks on the incubating female. The observations also suggest that adult survival may be influenced by these insects. The owls' choice of breeding habitat can be decisive in their vulnerability to blackflies.

ABSTRACT: Mexican Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis lucida) are common in older forests within their range but also persist in many areas burned by wildfire and may selectively forage in these areas. One hypothesis explaining this pattern postulates that prey abundance increases in burned areas following wildfire. We observed movement to wintering areas within areas burned by wildfire by four radio-marked Mexican Spotted Owls in the Sacramento Mountains, New Mexico. These movements occurred during the winters of 2004-2005 and 2005-2006, with some owls migrating in both winters and others in only one. Wintering areas of these owls occurred within the perimeters of two wildfires that burned in May 2000 and April 2002, respectively. We estimated relative prey abundance and biomass during December 2006 within paired burned wintering areas and nest core areas used by these owls. Species richness and relative abundance of small mammals were greater in the burned wintering areas than in the associated nest core areas for all four owls, and estimated prey biomass ranged from 2-6 times greater in burned wintering areas relative to the paired nest core areas. Burned wintering areas used by these owls were similar in elevation to their nest core areas, and likely experienced similar weather conditions during winter. These results suggest that wintering owls moved to areas with greater food resources, rather than to areas with milder weather. They further suggest that relative prey abundance was greater in burned wintering areas than in the nest core areas >5 years post-fire, and that these burned wintering areas provided important habitat for Mexican Spotted Owls in our study area during an energetically stressful season. © Copyright 2014 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Positive reinforcement training (PRT) techniques enhance the psychological well being of nonhuman primates by increasing the animal's control over his or her environment and desensitizing the animal to stressful stimuli. However, the literature on PRT in neotropical primates is limited. Here PRT data from owl monkeys and squirrel monkeys are presented, including the length of time to train subjects to target, present hand, and present foot, important responses that can be used to aid in health inspection and treatment. A high percentage of the squirrel and owl monkeys were successfully trained on target and present hand. Present foot, a less natural response, was harder to train and maintain. Although squirrel monkeys did learn to target significantly faster than owl monkeys, the 2 genera did not differ on time to train on subsequent behavior. These data demonstrate that although owl monkeys may require slightly more time to acclimate to a PRT program, it is still possible to establish a PRT program with neotropical primates, and once animals have been introduced to the program, they can learn new responses in a relatively few short sessions. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

ABSTRACT: We studied great gray owls (Strix nebulosa Forster) in Yosemite National Park, California, measuring variables that could potentially influence patterns of occurrence and conservation of this stateendangered species. We found that owl presence was closely tied to habitat (red fir (Abies magnified A. Murray) and the abundance of meadows), prey, and snags across the landscape. We also found that indicators of human recreational activities negatively influenced owl distribution and habitat use. Great gray owls appear to prefer mid-elevation red fir forest with meadows that are drier and more productive in terms of small mammal populations. That these areas also have the highest human activity presents a paradox, both for individual owls and for the future conservation and management of this California endangered species. The extent to which human recreation in natural areas affects animal behavior, species distribution, and productivity is a growing issue in natural area management. We present information that will allow land managers to better understand how existing natural resources, coupled with human recreation, influence the distribution and habitat use of the great gray owl.

ABSTRACT: In the temperate zone, food availability and winter weather place serious constraints on European Barn Owl Tyto alba populations. Using data collected over 22 years in a Swiss population, we analysed the influence of early pre-breeding food conditions and winter severity on between-year variations in population size and reproductive performance. To estimate pre-breeding food conditions, we attempted a novel approach based on an index that combines Tawny Owl Strix aluco reproductive parameters and the occurrence of wood mice Apodemus sp. in their diet. Tawny Owls breed earlier in the season than Barn Owls and are strongly dependent on the abundance of wood mice for breeding. This index was strongly positively associated with the number of breeding pairs and early breeding in the Barn Owl. Winter severity, measured by snow cover and low temperatures, had a pronounced negative influence on the size of the breeding population and clutch size. Food conditions early in the breeding season and winter severity differentially affect the Barn Owl life cycle. We were able to use aspects of the ecology and demography of the Tawny Owl as an indicator of the quality of the environment for a related species of similar ecology, in this case the Barn Owl. © 2014 British Ornithologists' Union.

ABSTRACT: A flightless brown hawk owl (Ninox scutulata) weighing 180 g was rescued and referred to the teaching veterinary hospital with humerus open fracture. On physical examination and radiography, open fracture of the left humerus was found. After 3 days, orthopedic surgery was operated with intramedullary pins and wires. The bird died 2 days after surgery with anorexia. On necropsy, multiple green nodules with 2-3 mm in diameter were observed at the surface and inside of the left lung. Numerous conidial heads and spores were seen in the center of foci in the histopathological examination. The mycelia penetrated the surrounding pulmonary parenchyma, showing inflammation and necrosis. The fungus was isolated from the lung and cultured on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar at 30°C for 7 days. The colony was blue-green color with a powdery surface. The fungus was identified as Aspergillus fumigatus by DNA analysis, including the internal transcribed spacer region, partial β-tubulin, and the calmodulin gene. This case was diagnosed as pulmonary aspergillosis secondary to open fracture of pneumatic bone in a brown hawk owl.

ABSTRACT: In literature, contacts between pegylated compounds and blood proteins are generally discussed in terms of excluded volume-related repulsions although adsorption and compatibility have been reported for some of these proteins occasionally. The major problem to investigate the behavior of blood in contact with pegylated surfaces is the complexity of the medium and especially the presence of albumin in large excess. In a model approach, optical waveguide lightmode spectroscopy (OWLS) was used to monitor the fate of albumin, fibrinogen, and γ-globulins at physiological concentrations in pH = 7.4 isotonic HEPES buffer after contact with SiTiO2 chips coated with diblock poly(DL-lactic acid)-block-poly(ethylene oxide)s and triblock poly(DL-lactic acid)-block-poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(DL-lactic acid) copolymers. Corresponding homopolymers were used as controls. The three protein systems were investigated separately, as a mixture and when added successively according to different orders of addition. OWLS gave access to the mass and the thickness of adhering protein layers that resist washing with HEPES buffer. Protein depositions were detected regardless of the presence of poly(ethylene glycol) segments on surfaces. Adsorption depended on the protein, on the surface and also on the presence of the other proteins. Unexpectedly any surface coated with a layer of adsorbed albumin prevented deposition of other proteins, including albumin itself. This outstanding finding suggests that it was the presence of albumin adsorbed on a surface, pegylated or not, that made that surface compatible with other proteins. As a consequence, dipping a device to be in contact with the blood of a patient in a solution of albumin could be a very simple means to avoid further protein deposition and maybe platelets adhesion after in vivo implantation. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

ABSTRACT: The fossil skeletal record of birds from the Cenozoic of Switzerland is rather poor, despite the fact that avian tracks have been described from twenty tracksites. We review the Swiss fossil skeletal avifauna with emphasis put on new material discovered in the collection of the Natural History Museum Basel. This material includes two new owls (Strigiformes), one from a Late Eocene fissure filling from the Gösgen canal, and another from the Late Oligocene of Mümliswil. The Eocene owl specimen consists of a partial, distal tarsometatarsus, and is therefore too incompletely preserved to allow for reliable hypotheses concerning its taxonomic affinities. It does, however, display features resembling members of the extinct family Palaeoglaucidae. The Oligocene specimen is tentatively attributed to the genus Oligostrix, and it is the youngest representative of the extinct family Protostrigidae. Based on the first complete tarsometatarsus for this family, we erect a new species,?Oligostrix bergeri. These two specimens represent the first record of fossil owls from Switzerland. © 2013 Swiss Geological Society.

ABSTRACT: Predation is an important cost of communication in animals and thus a potent selection pressure on the evolution of signaling behavior. Heterospecific eavesdropping by predators may increase the vulnerability of vocalizing prey, particularly during low light, such as at dusk when nocturnal predators are actively hunting. Despite the risk it entails, dawn and dusk chorusing is common in passerines. However, the dusk chorus has not been studied much, neglecting the opportunity for understanding how eavesdropping between predators and prey may shape communication in birds. Here, we report the first demonstration of simulated predation risk (playback of owl vocalizations) altering the dusk chorus of a diurnal passerine, the veery (Catharus fuscescens). Veeries have a pronounced dusk chorus, singing well after sunset and potentially exposing themselves to predation by owls. In response to brief playbacks of owl calls (~30 s of calls presented three times over 25 min), veeries sang fewer songs post-sunset and stopped singing earlier relative to control trials. These changes in singing remained evident 30 min after the last owl stimulus. Although the avian dusk chorus has received relatively little attention to date, our results suggest that the dusk chorus may pose a higher predation risk to singing males that may influence the evolution of singing behavior in diurnal birds. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: The neurophonic potential is a synchronized frequency-following extracellular field potential that can be recorded in the nucleus laminaris (NL) in the brainstem of the barn owl. Putative generators of the neurophonic are the afferent axons from the nucleus magnocellularis, synapses onto NL neurons, and spikes of NL neurons. The outputs of NL, i.e., action potentials of NL neurons, are only weakly represented in the neurophonic. Instead, the inputs to NL, i.e., afferent axons and their synaptic potentials, are the predominant origin of the neurophonic (Kuokkanen PT, Wagner H, Ashida G, Carr CE, Kempter R. J Neurophysiol 104: 2274-2290, 2010). Thus in NL the monaural inputs from the two brain sides converge and create a binaural neurophonic. If these monaural inputs contribute independently to the extracellular field, the response to binaural stimulation can be predicted from the sum of the responses to ipsi- and contralateral stimulation. We found that a linear summation model explains the dependence of the responses on interaural time difference as measured experimentally with binaural stimulation. The fit between model predictions and data was excellent, even without taking into account the nonlinear responses of NL coincidence detector neurons, although their firing rate and synchrony strongly depend on the interaural time difference. These results are consistent with the view that the afferent axons and their synaptic potentials in NL are the primary origin of the neurophonic.© 2013 the American Physiological Society.

ABSTRACT: Background: The owl limpet (Lottia gigantea) is an ectothermic invertebrate that inhabits the rocky intertidal zone where it territorially defends home ranges and grazes algae growing on the rocks. Among endothermic species, home range scales isometrically with body mass. Hypothesis: Home range area scales isometrically (scaling exponent ∼1.0) across individuals of the owl limpet, spanning more than an order of magnitude in body mass. Field sites: Southern and central California rocky intertidal sites (n = 5; ∼32.5-35.5°N). Methods: Measure home range area and body mass of individuals (n = 104). Determine the scaling exponent. Conclusions: Home range scaling across individuals of L. gigantea exhibits the same isometric relationship that is often found across endothermic species. © 2013 Phillip B. Fenberg.

ABSTRACT: Trade-offs between the benefits of current reproduction and the costs to future reproduction and survival are widely recognized. However, such trade-offs might only be detected when resources become limited to the point where investment in one activity jeopardizes investment in others. The resolution of the trade-off between reproduction and self-maintenance is mediated by hormones such as glucocorticoids which direct behaviour and physiology towards self-maintenance under stressful situations. We investigated this trade-off in male and female barn owls in relation to the degree of heritable melanin-based coloration, a trait that reflects the ability to cope with various sources of stress in nestlings. We increased circulating corticosterone in breeding adults by implanting a corticosterone-releasing-pellet, using birds implanted with a placebo-pellet as controls. In males, elevated corticosterone reduced the activity (i.e. reduced home-range size and distance covered within the home-range) independently of coloration, while we could not detect any effect on hunting efficiency. The effect of experimentally elevated corticosterone on female behaviour was correlated with their melanin-based coloration. Corticosterone (cort-) induced an increase in brooding behaviour in small-spotted females, while this hormone had no detectable effect in large-spotted females. Cort-females with small eumelanic spots showed the normal body-mass loss during the early nestling period, while large spotted cort-females did not lose body mass. This indicates that corticosterone induced a shift towards self-maintenance in males independently on their plumage, whereas in females this shift was observed only in large-spotted females. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: The diet of the Eurasian Eagle-Owl (Bubo bubo) was studied in two different land-cover types: wetlands and non-wetlands. We analyzed 1458 prey items obtained from 924 pellets and 534 prey remains collected in 34 territories in west-central Korea. Diet composition differed significantly between the two habitats: diet was mainly birds (68.9% by number; 85.3% by biomass) in wetlands, but was dominated by mammals (38.7% by number; 64.7% by biomass) in non-wetlands. At the species level, ducks such as Eastern Spot-billed Ducks (Anas zonorhyncha) and Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) made up 38.1% by biomass in wetlands, whereas brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) were the most abundant prey by number and biomass in non-wetlands. The mean weight of prey: (a) was greater in wetlands than in non-wetlands; (b) was positively related to the density of wetlands in the study area and (c) negatively related to both the percentage of agricultural land and the density of human settlements. The diet of Eurasian Eagle-Owls apparently reflects the differential abundance of local food resources. The values of diet diversity (H′) and standardized food-niche breadth (Bst) were relatively high in wetland habitats. © 2013 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Capsule: We present a review of the propensity to eat amphibians in the Barn Owl Tyto alba in Europe. Based on the analysis of 596 published studies reporting 3.32 million prey items identified in pellets, 17 869 amphibians (0.54%) were found. An analysis of 9036 amphibians identified to the species level showed that Barn Owls avoid consuming toxic species, and they are able to capture tree frogs (Hylidae) only rarely. The true frogs (Ranidae) are by far the most frequently captured amphibians followed by spadefoot toads (Pelobatidae) and Parsley frogs (Pelodytidae). © 2013 Copyright British Trust for Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: Nest and territory defence are risky and potentially dangerous behaviours. If the resolution of life history trade-offs differs between individuals, the level of defence may also vary among individuals. Because melanin-based colour traits can be associated with life history strategies, differently coloured individuals may display different nest and territory defence strategies. We investigated this issue in the colour polymorphic tawny owl (Strix aluco) for which plumage varies from dark to light reddish melanic. Accordingly, we found that (1) our presence induced a greater response (flying around) from dark-coloured than light-coloured females and (2) dark reddish males suffered lower nest predation rates than light-coloured males. In experimentally enlarged broods, the probability that females reacted after we played back the hoot calls of a stranger male was higher if these females were lighter reddish; the opposite pattern was found in experimentally reduced broods with dark parents being more reactive than light parents. Finally, darker females alarmed more frequently when paired with a light than with a dark male, suggesting that partners adjust their behaviour to each other. We also tested whether colouration is used as a signal by conspecifics to adjust the level of their defensive behaviour. Accordingly, breeding females responded more vigorously to a dark than a light reddish stuffed tawny owl placed beside their nest. We conclude that melanin-based colouration is a signal of alternative nest and territory defence behaviour that depends on ecological factors. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Climate change is predicted to have serious impacts on the conservation status of numerous species of birds, particularly low-density, range-restricted species occupying narrow habitats. One such species is the globally Endangered Sokoke Scops Owl Otus ireneae that currently survives in just two or three small pockets of forest in coastal Kenya and north-eastern Tanzania. We assessed the potential impact of changes in future climate on this species using predictive niche modelling. Distributional data were obtained from various published and unpublished sources, and field surveys. Maximum Entropy (Maxent) was used to model the current distribution of Sokoke Scops Owl. A general circulation model was used to predict the distribution of this species in 2080. This scenario predicts a southward shift in the future distribution of this species in Kenya and a complete disappearance from the Usambara mountains in Tanzania, with a concomitant 64% reduction in areas of high environmental suitability. Considering the isolated nature of the forest fragments in which this owl survives and the sea of inhospitable human-modified habitat which surrounds these fragments, the future conservation prospects of this species are bleak. Close monitoring of the species is strongly recommended and potential conservation interventions are discussed. Copyright © BirdLife International 2012 Â.

ABSTRACT: The adaptive function of melanin-based coloration is a long-standing debate. A recent genetic model suggested that pleiotropy could account for covariations between pigmentation, behaviour, morphology, physiology and life history traits. We explored whether the expression levels of genes belonging to the melanocortin system (MC1R, POMC, PC1/3, PC2 and the antagonist ASIP), which have many pleiotropic effects, are associated with melanogenesis (through variation in the expression of the genes MITF, SLC7A11, TYR, TYRP1) and in turn melanin-based coloration. We considered the tawny owl (Strix aluco) because individuals vary continuously from light to dark reddish, and thus, colour variation is likely to stem from differences in the levels of gene expression. We measured gene expression in feather bases collected in nestlings at the time of melanin production. As expected, the melanocortin system was associated with the expression of melanogenic genes and pigmentation. Offspring of darker reddish fathers expressed PC1/3 to lower levels but tended to express PC2 to higher levels. The convertase enzyme PC1/3 cleaves the POMC prohormone to obtain ACTH, while the convertase enzyme PC2 cleaves ACTH to produce α-melanin-stimulating hormone (α-MSH). ACTH regulates glucocorticoids, hormones that modulate stress responses, while α-MSH induces eumelanogenesis. We therefore conclude that the melanocortin system, through the convertase enzymes PC1/3 and PC2, may account for part of the interindividual variation in melanin-based coloration in nestling tawny owls. Pleiotropy may thus account for the covariation between phenotypic traits involved in social interactions (here pigmentation) and life history, morphology, behaviour and physiology. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ABSTRACT: This study reports the diet of the powerful owl (Ninox strenua) in East Gippsland, from a dataset of 2009 vertebrate prey items collected from 53 sites. Mammals dominated the diet at all sites, but birds were also consumed regularly. The greater glider (Petauroides volans) was the dominant dietary item across the region in terms of both frequency of consumption and biomass contribution. There was geographical dietary variation between coastal and foothill forest sites, with the sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps) and birds consumed more frequently in foothill forests, whereas the common ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus peregrinus) was frequently consumed only in coastal forests. Typically, a higher percentage of powerful owl diet comprised birds closer to cleared land. The dietary reliance upon hollow-dependent mammals in foothill forests (averaging >70%) is of conservation concern, especially when non-hollow-dependent prey are rare. Forest management activities, especially logging, that reduce densities of hollow-bearing trees in the landscape are therefore likely to decrease the long-term carrying capacity of the landscape for the powerful owl. © 2013 CSIRO.

ABSTRACT: Much ambiguity has surrounded the total population size of the threatened Christmas Island Hawk-Owl Ninox natalis, with population estimates ranging anywhere from 10 pairs to 1000 mature individuals. Call-playback surveys were carried out in August and September 2011 along Christmas Island's extensive road network in an attempt to gain insight into the Hawk-Owl's present population size. A total of 10 Hawk-Owls was observed, and a further 22 were heard during our investigation. Hawk-Owls were unevenly distributed throughout the island, with notable concentrations clustered around areas of human settlement on the island's north-western and north-eastern coastline. Our findings suggest that recent estimates of 1000 mature individuals may be a significant overestimate. Further research is urgently needed to determine if this tiny population is presently in decline and if active management should be implemented to ensure the long-term survival of this endemic owl.

ABSTRACT: In polyandrous species females produce successive clutches with several males. Female barn owls (Tyto alba) often desert their offspring and mate to produce a 2nd annual brood with a second male. We tested whether copulating during chick rearing at the 1st annual brood increases the male's likelihood to obtain paternity at the 2nd annual breeding attempt of his female mate in case she deserts their brood to produce a second brood with a different male. Using molecular paternity analyses we found that 2 out of 26 (8%) second annual broods of deserting females contained in total 6 extra-pair young out of 15 nestlings. These young were all sired by the male with whom the female had produced the 1st annual brood. In contrast, none of the 49 1st annual breeding attempts (219 offspring) and of the 20 2nd annual breeding attempts (93 offspring) of non-deserting females contained extra-pair young. We suggest that female desertion can select male counterstrategies to increase paternity and hence individual fitness. Alternatively, females may copulate with the 1st male to derive genetic benefits, since he is usually of higher quality than the 2nd male which is commonly a yearling individual. © 2013 Henry et al.

ABSTRACT: Animals communicate with conspecifics to resolve conflicts over how resources are shared. Since signals reflect individuals' resource-holding potential and motivation to compete, it is crucial that opponents efficiently transmit and receive information to adjust investment optimally in competitive interactions. Acoustic communication is particularly flexible as it can be quickly modulated according to background noise and audience. Diverse mechanisms have evolved to minimize acoustic signal interference, one being the avoidance of signal overlap by adjusting the timing of call production to alternate calls with those of competitors. However, the occurrence and function of overlap avoidance in the resolution of competition among relatives have barely been studied. Using young barn owl siblings, Tyto alba, which vocally negotiate over who will have priority access to food provided by parents, we investigated the extent to which nestlings avoid calling simultaneously and the function of this behaviour. We found that nestlings overlapped both their live siblings' calls and experimentally broadcast calls at least five times less often than expected at random. Furthermore, a focal nestling engaged more intensely in vocal negotiation when competing with nestmates that called simultaneously compared to those that did not overlap their respective calls. This suggests that barn owl nestlings avoid calling simultaneously, as overlapped calls are less efficient at deterring siblings from competing. Overlap avoidance reduces signal interference and, as a consequence, would improve the efficiency of communication among kin. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: We evaluated nest site selection at two spatial scales (microsite, territory) and reproductive success of Western Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia hypugaea) at three spatial scales (microsite, territory, landscape) in the eastern Mojave Desert. We used binary logistic regression within an information-theoretic approach to assess factors influencing nest site choice and nesting success. Microsite-scale variables favored by owls included burrows excavated by desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii), burrows with a large mound of excavated soil at the entrance, and a greater number of satellite burrows within 5m of the nest burrow. At the territory scale, owls preferred patches with greater cover of creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) within 50m of the nest burrow. An interaction between the presence or absence of a calcic soil horizon layer over the top of the burrow (microsite) and the number of burrows within 50m (territory) influenced nest site choice. Nesting success was influenced by a greater number of burrows within 5m of the nest burrow. Total cool season precipitation was a predictor of nesting success at the landscape scale. Conservation strategies can rely on management of habitat for favored and productive nesting sites for this declining species. © 2013.

ABSTRACT: We studied the diet of Ural Owls (Strix uralensis) living in the forests of Mt. Yatsugatake, central Japan, in the context of historic logging activities that have greatly extended the amount of open pasture and consequently modified small mammal availability in the region. We used owl pellets from artificial nest boxes to quantitatively analyze diet composition during the breeding season. We identified 1026 small mammals from 17 owl nests. Mandibles were identified and categorized as wood mice (Apodemus spp.), voles (Microtus sp.), and shrew-moles (Urotrichus talpoides). The small-mammal component of the diet was dominated by wood mice (71%), followed by voles (24%) and shrew-moles (5%). This contrasts sharply with the vole-dominated diets associated with most European Ural Owl populations. We also detected significantly fewer voles among mammalian remains for nests at greater distances from open-pasture habitat. We confirmed previous results from studies of Ural Owls in Japan that suggest elasticity in diet across the country and within regions. © 2013 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: We analyzed mammalian prey from owl pellets recovered at a winter roost of long-eared owls (Asio otus) in northwestern Irion County, Texas. Of 1,232 prey identified, the most common species were cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus, 36%), plains harvest mice (Reithrodontomys montanus, 23%), deer mice (unidentified Peromyscus, 14%), and pygmy mice (Baiomys taylori, 10%). Approximately 80% of the biomass of the diet was the cotton rat. Other important prey were Crawford's gray shrews (Notiosorex crawfordi, 7%), hispid pocket mice (Chaetodipus hispidus, 6%), and Merriam's pocket mice (Perognathus merriami, 2%). These species are rare in the reported diet of long-eared owls and represent the first information on winter food habits in Texas in the southern portion of the range of this owl.

ABSTRACT: Mexican Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis lucida) occupy forest-dominated environments but also inhabit rocky canyonlands. I studied the owls' diet in canyon habitats in southern Utah and northern Arizona (1991-2007), and in mixed-conifer forest in the Rincon Mountains of southeast Arizona (1996-1997). I identified 3,315 prey items in regurgitated pellets from 38 pairs of owls in canyon habitat, and 383 prey items from 5 pairs in the Rincon Mountains. In canyons and forests, vertebrates dominated owl diets (97-99% of total prey biomass) with mammals accounting for 91-92% of prey biomass. In canyons, mammalian prey was primarily woodrats (Neotoma spp., 79% biomass), followed by white-footed mice (Peromyscus spp., 11%), and cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus spp., 5%). In forest habitat, woodrats comprised 54% of biomass, followed by Botta's pocket gophers (Thomomys bottae, 13%), and cottontail rabbits (11%). For nine owl territories in three canyon regions in Utah, diets varied among the owl pairs with contribution to total prey biomass by woodrats ranging from 65-91%, typically followed by white-footed mice ranging from 13-19%. In both canyon and forest study areas, a variety of prey were consumed in addition to murids, including rabbits, pocket gophers, sciurids (Tamias spp.), heteromyids (e.g., Perognathus spp.), various bats (Vespertilionidae), shrews (Sorex spp.), small passerine birds, and numerous arthropods. © 2013 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Reproductive strategies of birds are shaped by patterns of food supply, yet empirical evidence of the consequences and mechanisms of food limitation on reproductive performance is inconsistent, probably due to variable responses from species of differing life-history strategies. We tested the hypothesis that food supplementation would increase reproductive rates of a nonmigratory population of Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia) via direct and indirect pathways. We predicted increasing food availability would directly increase growth and survival of the youngest nestlings and would indirectly decrease predation rates of eggs and nestlings by increasing nest attendance. We experimentally supplemented food from clutch completion through brood-rearing during two breeding seasons (April-July 1999 and 2000) in the agricultural matrix of the Imperial Valley, in southeastern California. In both years, hatching success (hatchlings/egg laid) was similar between supplemented and non-supplemented nests, but the proportion that survived to 28 d was higher in food-supplemented nests. Growth rates and survival rates of last-hatched young were lower in non-supplemented than supplemented nests in only one year of the study. A greater proportion of hatchling deaths were attributed to starvation in non-supplemented nests. Nest attendance was greater in supplemented nests although low predation for supplemented and non-supplemented nests resulted in no effects on reproductive success. Our results were consistent with the brood-reduction hypothesis that predicts that food supplementation would result in a greater number of fledglings by increasing survival of the youngest nestlings through increased growth rates when hatching asynchrony exists and food is limited. © 2013 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Chromatic signals of offspring quality have been shown to play a role in parent-offspring communication in diurnal birds, but are assumed to be useless in dim light conditions because colour-based discrimination probably requires more light. A major ecological and evolutionary conundrum in this scenario is why the nestlings of some nocturnal owls display colourful beaks. Here, we test the hypothesis that yellow bill coloration of owlets of the nocturnal little owl Athene noctua may function as a chromatic signal revealing to parents aspects of quality of their offspring. In a first step, we examined physical variation in bill coloration and its covariation with owlet quality. Secondly, we studied parental provisioning in relation to an experimental manipulation of bill coloration of owlets. Bills of owlets showed higher within-nest variation in yellow-red chroma than in brightness. Plasma carotenoid concentration and nestling immunological status were not associated with chromatic or achromatic features of the bill. Interestingly, however, heavier owlets displayed more yellow bills than lighter ones. The effect of bill coloration on parental favouritism changed with brood size. Parents holding large broods preferentially fed owlets with enhanced over reduced yellow bill coloration, whereas those with small broods did not significantly bias feeding in relation to owlet bill coloration. Our results, based on integration of objective spectrophotometric assessment of colour and experimental procedures, confirm that parent little owls use bill coloration to reveal information on owlet body mass to adjust their feeding strategies, thus highlighting the importance of considering potential chromatic signals for a full comprehension of parent-offspring communication processes in nocturnal bird species. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: Owl pellets have high potential as a source of DNA. However, this noninvasive method of collecting DNA is rarely used, and its methodological aspects are poorly understood. We investigated the methodology for DNA extraction and amplification from owl pellets containing the smallest European rodent-the Harvest mouse Micromys minutus-as an example. We used mandibles identified in owl pellets for mitochondrial and nuclear DNA amplification. For DNA extraction, we tested two commercial protocols and utilized a protocol being a combination of two commercial kits which ensured high efficiency of DNA extraction. Additionally, we recorded that the amount of DNA was five times higher in extracts from teeth as compared to DNA extracts from jawbones derived from the same mandible. The quantity of DNA was significantly positively correlated with biological sample weight; however, the age of the pellet remains had an impact on the level of inhibition. We recorded inhibition in 40 % of mtDNA extracts derived from pellets older than 150 months, whereas in DNA extracts from pellets younger than 80 months, we did not observe a negative impact of inhibition on PCR efficiency. The amplification success rate was 89.9 % for the mitochondrial fragment and 39.4 % in the case of the nuclear fragment. We observed partial degradation of DNA evidenced by the fact that the longest fragments that we were able to amplify in the case of mtDNA were 450 and 200 bp for nuDNA. The study shows that pellets can be considered as a source of DNA and have high potential for molecular research in the case of threatened species and species that are difficult to study using standard field techniques. © 2013 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: From 2004 to 2006 we studied the spatial activity of Long-eared Owls (Asio otus) breeding in the city of České Budějovice, Czech Republic. Two main factors (size and proportion of home range in developed area) clearly distinguished the owls into two groups: urban (n = 5) and suburban (n = 4). Urban owls occupied home ranges >50% in developed area; home ranges of suburban owls were <50% in developed area. We obtained 866 radio fixes from nine individuals while they were feeding offspring, when both males and females participated in hunting. The home ranges of urban owls were larger than those of suburban owls (95% kernels: 446 vs. 56 ha, respectively). Urban males and females used home ranges of similar sizes that overlapped greatly with those of the opposite sex and with those of other breeding pairs. In contrast, suburban male owls had home ranges larger than those of suburban females. Wooded areas and meadows were the vegetation types preferred by both urban and suburban owls, and both groups avoided vegetation types associated with human activities. Six of nine owls preferred the edges of open habitats, such as meadows and fields bordering wooded areas. Urban owls used remnant green spaces (refugia) within the city area to hunt small mammals. Long-eared Owls use nests made by other species, and may profit in urban environments from increased nest sites due to the relatively recent colonization of urban areas by the Common Magpie (Pica pica) and from suitable hunting grounds within the city. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2013.

ABSTRACT: The mitochondrial cytochrome c-oxidase subunit I (cox1) can serve as a fast and accurate marker for the identification of animal species, and for the discovery of new species across the tree of life. Distinguishing species using this universal molecular marker, a technique known as DNA barcoding, relies on the identifying the gap between intra- and interspecific divergence. One of the difficulties could be wide-ranging, cosmopolitan species that show large amounts of morphological variation. The barn owl Tyto alba is a case in point. It occurs worldwide and varies morphologically, leading to the recognition of many subspecies or, more recently, species. We analysed data from the cox1 gene for 31 individuals of seven subspecies, and compared this with 214 sequences from 29 other owl species. Phylogenetic analysis of the T. alba samples gives very strong support for an Old World alba-clade (three subspecies) and a New World furcata-clade (four subspecies) that are genetically equidistant. The amount of intraspecific variation within each of these clades ranges from 0.66-0.99%, but variation among these clades ranges from 5.33-6.20%. Combined these data suggest that barn owl of the Old World is indeed best considered a separate species different from that of the New World. For combined dataset, sample size of owl species (n between 1 and 21 sequences) increased with geographic range size but we did not find significant relationships between interspecific divergence and sample size or between interspecific divergence and geographic range. For 21/24 species of owls with sample sizes of n ≥4 the maximum interspecific divergences was ≤ 3.00%. However, similar to those found in barn owls, the largest amount of divergence (3.23-4.09%) was present in two other wide-ranging species (Strix nebulosa and Aegolius funereus) raising the possibility of multiple species in other wide-ranging owls as well. © 2013 Zoological Society of Japan.

ABSTRACT: The chronotype (morningness/eveningness) relates to individual differences in circadian preferences. Time perspective (past, present, future) refers to the preference to rely on a particular temporal frame for decision-making processes and behavior. First evidence suggests that future time perspective is associated with greater morningness and present time perspective with greater eveningness. However, little is known about how chronotype-time perspective relationships may alter over the life span. This present study investigated links between chronotype and time perspective more thoroughly by taking age and sex into account as well. Seven hundred six participants aged between 17 and 74 completed German adaptations of the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) and Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory (ZTPI). Controlling for age and sex, relationships between morningness and future time perspective as well as between eveningness and present time perspective were replicated. These findings were supported by significant associations between time perspective and midpoint of sleep. Future time perspective was linked to earlier midpoints of sleep, indicating an early chronotype. Present time perspective was associated with later midpoints of sleep, indicating a late chronotype. However, age and sex had an impact on the chronotype-time perspective relationships. In all age groups, male larks were more future-oriented and less present-oriented, male owls more present-oriented and less future-oriented. The same conclusion could be drawn for female adolescents and young adults. For female adults above 30, there was no interrelationship between morningness and future time perspective but between eveningness and past time perspective. Female adult owls were more present-oriented as well as more past-oriented. Female adult larks were less present-oriented and less past-oriented. Findings are discussed in the light of neuroendocrine and serotonergic functioning. © 2013 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Before dispersal, social and spatial behaviour in owls has only been briefly studied. We used radio tracking to monitor age-influenced social and spatial behaviour in 10 juvenile Little Owls (Athene noctua) from nests in Northern Jutland, Denmark. On average, the post-fledging dependency period lasted 35 days (n = 6). Juveniles stayed on the natal territory 45 days (n = 5) from independence to dispersal.Half of the juveniles had dispersed by mid-September, and the other half remained on the natal territory until at leastmid-October. The home range size (minimum convex polygons) was 0.56 ± 0.53 ha (mean ± SD) from fledging to independence and 3.25 ± 4.15 ha from independence to dispersal.Within the first 40 days after fledging, the nightly distance from the nest and the distance between siblings increased, and the frequency and intensity of begging calls decreased. These results were consistent with the notion that food provided by the parents decreased as juvenile foraging skills increased.

ABSTRACT: Recent research has demonstrated the important role of visual communication in nocturnal birds. Achromatic plumage patches (i.e., pigment-free white feathers) with high levels of contrast against dark backgrounds are excellent candidates for visual signaling in the dark or at twilight, when differences in color may be less effective. In this study, with the goal of investigating the signaling role of certain achromatic plumage patches, we examined the characteristics and patterns of the brightness (i.e., total reflectance) of Eurasian Eagle-Owl (Bubo bubo) white feather patches for both young birds and adult individuals. Our results showed that (1) the total reflectance of young birds' white feathers differed significantly from that of adult owls' white feathers; (2) the brightness differed between the sexes in adults only, with females showing a significantly higher reflectance than males; (3) the total reflectance of the white patch around a young bird's mouth was positively correlated with brood size; (4) the total reflectance of the white badge on the throat of adults was positively correlated with their hematocrit values; (5) an assortative mating scenario based on the brightness of an individual's white badge was deemed possible; and (6) we did not detect any significant relationship in the levels of reflectance for related individuals: the young and their parents were not found to be distinguishable based on the brightness of their white feather patches. © The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Liver samples from red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis) and great horned owls (Bubo virginianus) were analyzed for anticoagulant rodenticides. Residues of one or more second generation anticoagulant rodenticides (SGARs) were detected in 81 % of red-tailed hawks and 82 % of great horned owls. The most frequently detected SGAR was brodifacoum, which was detected in 76 % of red-tailed hawks and 73 % of great horned owls. Bromadiolone was detected in 20 % of red-tailed hawks and 27 % of great horned owls. Difenacoum was detected in one great horned owl. No other ARs were detected. There were no significant differences between species in the frequency of detection or concentration of brodifacoum or bromadiolone. There was a marginally significant difference (p = 0.0497) between total SGAR residues in red-tailed hawks (0.117 mg/kg) and great horned owls (0.070 mg/kg). There were no seasonal differences in the frequency of detection or concentration of brodifacoum in red-tailed hawks. The data suggest that SGARs pose a significant risk of poisoning to predatory birds in New Jersey. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: Assessing the amount of rivals is crucial to optimally adjust investment into a contest. If laboratory animals show numerical abilities, little is known about the ecological implications particularly in young animals. The two to nine barn owl (Tyto alba) siblings vocally compete for priority of access to food resources before parents actually deliver them. In dyads, the individual that vocalizes at the highest rate in the absence of parents deters its siblings from competing for next delivered prey. We tested the novel hypothesis that to optimally adjust vocal investment, barn owl nestlings assess how many of their siblings are currently competing. To singleton owlets, we broadcasted a fixed global number of calls emitted by one, two or four pre-recorded unfamiliar nestlings. We could thus distinguish the independent effect on singletons' vocal behavior of the global number of calls produced by a brood from the number of competitors that produced these calls. Overall, nestlings retreated more from vocal contest when facing more competitors. However, in front of one highly motivated competitor, nestlings refrained from vocalizing to a larger extent than when competing against more but less motivated individuals. Therefore, young animals assess variation in the number of currently competing siblings based on individual-specific vocal cues. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

ABSTRACT: We isolated 134 eagle-owl (Bubo bubo) microsatellite sequences. Eight of these newly isolated loci were characterized in 38 Eurasian eagle-owls in a northern European population. Sequence homology was used to assign a predicted chromosome location for the eight loci. We also redesigned primers for four previously isolated eagle-owl sequences and cross-amplified two published primer sets previously characterized in other owl species. These 14 loci were amplified in three multiplex PCR sets and displayed 2-9 alleles with expected and observed heterozygosities ranging from 0.34 to 0.85 and from 0.42 to 0.97, respectively. Estimated frequencies of null-alleles were low and only one locus deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. After correcting for multiple tests, linkage disequilibrium was found for a single pair of loci. The combined probability of identity for the 14 loci was 3.5 × 10-12. These microsatellite loci are expected to be useful for genetic monitoring, parentage analysis and population genetic studies. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

ABSTRACT: Diets of the Long-eared and Short-eared Owls, closely related species with overlapping ranges, have been studied in the south of Western Siberia (the Baraba Lowland) by analyzing bone remains in pellets. The results show that both species in the south of the Baraba Lowland employ similar strategies of food resource use, which, however, differ in some aspects. In the Short-eared Owl, the hunting range is apparently more restricted. During the nesting period, these birds occupy relatively moist habitats along riverbanks and protect their hunting grounds. The Long-eared Owl nests in mainly mesic habitats, in forest outliers, and can supplement its diet with shrews (Sorex) and steppe rodent species. The diets of both species largely consist of murine rodent species that are dominant or subdominant in the small mammal community of the Baraba forest-steppe. Seasonal and interannual variations in the food spectra of both species have been revealed. © 2013 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: In recent years, developing urban areas have affected food abundance and the feeding grounds of birds. The article contains analysis of the Tawny owl's diet during four years (2006-2009) from different types of the urbanized area: city, town (much smaller than city) and countryside - based on 356 pellets with 726 prey items. The main group of victims was Rodentia, common were also Apodemus agrarius and Apodemus sylvaticus. Other important groups in the diet were: Microtidae (especially species Microtus arvalis) and Aves. As a generalist, Tawny owl fits the diet to the actual resources in a very flexible way. The main goal of the present work was to describe the food composition variability of the Tawny owl along with the degree of urbanization. Percentages of Microtus arvalis, Micromys minutus, Talpa europaea depended on the urbanization level, while Apodemus flavicollis, Insecta and Amphibia were related to the distance to nearest city centre. The study has shown that the diet of the Tawny owl has been changing along the urbanization gradient. It confirms earlier findings on high plasticity of foraging of this species in urbanized landscape.

ABSTRACT: The vocal behaviour of birds may be influenced by many factors, including the risk of being detected by a predator. In Doñana Protected Area, the tawny owl co-exists alongside its intraguild predator, the eagle owl Bubo bubo. We considered four scenarios to study the vocal behaviour of tawny owls at dusk by analysing: A) the calling rate of all males in 29 sites; B) the calling rate at dusk of males living within the home range of the intraguild predator; C) the calling rate of males living within the home range of the intraguild predator between 60 and 90 min after sunset; and D) the duration of male vocal bouts in visits where eagle owls have called. In scenario A we found that only the number of conspecific males affected the calling rate of tawny owls. In scenario B we observed that the presence of an eagle owl calling constrained the calling rate of the intraguild prey. In scenario C we found that this effect seemed mostly associated to a contemporaneous detection of the intraguild predator's calls. Finally, in scenario D we found no significant effects on bout duration. These results seem to indicate that tawny owls use their intraguild predator's calls as a cue to assess predation risk, and then adjust their vocal behaviour in order to minimize predation risk by a predator that may locate its prey by its vocalizations. © 2013 the Authors.

ABSTRACT: We investigated the factors influencing the dynamics of Long-eared Owls Asio otus wintering in Moscow. The study was carried out in 2001-2011. Twelve communal roosts and 14 solitary wintering owls were found. Number of active roosts was positively correlated with the total number of wintering owls per year. The four largest roosts were active for many years, with up to 16 individuals in a single winter (9.9 ± 1.3 on average). Generalized linear models indicated that the number of wintering owls was influenced simultaneously by the abundance of Common Vole Microtus arvalis in the previous autumn and in spring, and the owls' breeding numbers in the study plot. The most important factor was vole abundance in early spring indirectly indicating food supply in late winter. The influence of weather was investigated on the regularly surveyed local site in Moscow. The maximum number of owls at the roosting site varied from 0 to 9 individuals (2.1 ± 0.4 on average). Among weather factors, the most important influence on the dynamics of owls was by snow cover and wind jointly, though the snow was undoubtedly of greatest significance. Air temperature and precipitation turned out to be almost of no importance for owl dynamics at the roosting site.

ABSTRACT: Fire is pervasive in forests used by California Sported Owls (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) and their prey species. We assessed the diets and sizes of the breeding-season home ranges of seven Spotted Owls occupying burned forests in the southern Sierra Nevada 4 years after a fire and compared the results with data from previous studies in unburned forests within the range of the subspecies. Prey captured by owls in the burned area comprised 40.3% (by biomass) pocket gophers (Thomomys spp.) and 25.9% northern flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus). In contrast, in unburned areas of the Sierra Nevada Spotted Owls fed primarily on flying squirrels, or on both flying squirrels and woodrats (Neotoma spp); in unburned southern California forests they fed overwhelmingly on woodrats. The owls' mean home range in the burned forest covered 402 ha, an area similar to that recorded in unburned forests of the Sierra Nevada. Our results are consistent with hypotheses that the burned habitat in our study area was rich in gophers and that Spotted Owls foraging on gophers in burned forests do not require home ranges substantially larger than do owls in unburned forests. With currently available data we could not conclusively attribute variation in diet or home-range size to the influence of fire, so further testing is warranted. Use of rodenticides and herbicides in managing burned Spotted Owl habitat may reduce the owl's key prey.

ABSTRACT: Summary: Typically in resource selection studies, the spatial extent of a home range is defined first and then the available resources within that perimeter are estimated. However, the home ranges (or habitats) of some animals are constrained by linear environmental features (e.g. rivers, shorelines). Traditional home range estimators often overestimate home range extent for such species, which can lead to spurious estimation of resource availability and selection. We used a synoptic model of space use to explicitly account for resource selection of a species constrained by linear features in its environment to compare with traditional home range estimators. We used the endangered Blakiston's fish owl Bubo blakistoni in the Russian Far East as our example. Mean annual home range size (± standard error) was more than three times larger when using kernel methods (30·3 ± 15·1 km2) than when using the synoptic model (9·4 ± 2·0 km2, n = 7). Fish owls showed strong selection for areas within valleys, closer to waterways, closer to patches of permanently open water and with greater channel complexity than available sites. Synthesis and applications. The synoptic model solves a long-standing problem in home range and resource selection studies because it provides an objective way to estimate the space use of a species whose habitat is constrained by linear features in its environment. Improvements in the accuracy of such estimations can lead to identification of important resources across landscapes, the development of more rigorous site-specific or landscape-scale management plans, and to scientifically defensible conservation or threat mitigation measures.

ABSTRACT: In the last years, a new group of enzymes, the so-called silicateins, have been identified and characterized, which form the axial filaments of the spicules of the siliceous sponges, consisting of not only amorphous silica among others. These enzymes are able to catalyze the polycondensation and deposition of silica at mild conditions. Silicateins can be expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant proteins are expressed on the surface of the cell wall and are able to catalyze the formation of a polysilicate net around the bacterial cells providing the possibility for further attachment to the surface of SiO2 containing sensor chips. With this mild immobilization process it is now possible to prepare novel microbial sensors based on Optical Waveguide Lightmode Spectroscopy.In the present study, the immobilization of silicatein modified E. coli BL21AI cells onto the SiO2-type chips was optimized (buffer concentration, pH, temperature, reaction time, and so on) and then the biological properties, in particular the inhibitory effect of stressors/environmental pollutants on the novel bacterial sensor were studied in real time.The effect of oxidative stress was investigated by exposing the sensors containing biosilica-immobilized E. coli BL21AI cells to various concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. The effect of antibiotics was tested using chloramphenicol (CAP) which is effective against a variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and penicillin G which destroys the bacterial cell wall. In addition, the inhibition by carbofuran (CF) pesticide was also tested. CF is a highly toxic compound which inhibits cholinesterase activity. According our results we can conclude that the novel bacterial sensor consisting of the silicatein modified E. coli BL21AI cells immobilized on OWLS sensor surface could be an effective tool to detect the presence of different type of pollutants in real time measurement. However penicillin G and CF are not specifically inhibitors of E. coli strain, but some inhibitory effect could be still determined beside the well expressed signals for H2O2 and CAP obtained with the novel microbial sensor. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: This study investigated the distribution of the Tawny Fish Owl Ketupa flavipes, a rare top predator in Taiwan, and examined natural and man-made factors that affect it. Records of Tawny Fish Owls from 1993 to 2006 were compiled from field studies, literature surveys, museum notes and specimens, and interviews with researchers, birdwatchers and indigenous hunters. In total, 91 Tawny Fish Owl territories were identified, widely distributed along mountain streams in the Central Mountain Range between 48 and 2,407 m-more than half of them were below 700 m. The upper altitudinal range of the owls is probably limited by food availability and stream size. Territories were on average 431 m higher on the west side of the Central Mountain Range than on the east. Habitat selection analysis further indicated that, in proportion to the land area available, the Tawny Fish Owl was absent from areas below 500 m. This is apparently due to extensive deforestation of lowlands for agriculture and urbanisation on the west side of the island. It is recommended that a protected area be established in the north-east part of Taiwan, to preserve the remaining lowland streams and riparian forests still inhabited by the species.

ABSTRACT: The largely deforested island of Cebu, Philippines, hosts a forest-dwelling hawk-owl identified in the literature as Ninox philippensis spilonota but which is in fact a Cebu island endemic species, soon to be named. To determine the current distribution and habitat requirements of this hawk-owl, the five largest of 11 remaining forest patches on Cebu were surveyed between March and June 2011, involving 64 post-sunset 500-m walked transects with playback and habitat assessments. Radio-telemetry studies were also conducted on 10 owls but only for 3-5 days per owl as they removed the transmitters. A total of 52 owls were located across all five forests (at 16 sites two owls responded together to playback) but only the largest forest, Alcoy, contained enough transects for analyses of habitat in relation to owl distribution. Alcoy stands on steep-sided hills and some planting of exotic species occurs within it. Owls were detected in forest interior, forest edge and forest-plantation mix in Alcoy, and on ridges and in gullies despite lower tree densities and greater proximity to clearings in the gullies. However, parts of Alcoy experience strong winds, and owl occupancy decreased significantly with increasing wind speed. Home ranges for the 10 radio-tagged owls were estimated to cover ∼10 ha, although given the short tracking periods this may be an underestimate. Suitable forest studied covers roughly 1,670 ha, with six unstudied forests totalling 250 ha, so assuming a pair every 10 ha would give a tentative global population estimate of ∼ 200 pairs of Cebu Hawk-owls, and even fewer if home ranges are larger than estimated. This, coupled with continuing habitat degradation, triggers the IUCN Red List category 'Endangered'. Tree cavities suitable for nests may be limiting, and nest-box provision could be explored, provided this does not increase predator pressure on other rare species. © BirdLife International 2012.

ABSTRACT: Between 2004 and 2008 the diet and breeding success of a pair of Powerful Owls Ninox strenua were studied near Lakes Entrance, Victoria. In early November 2006 the adult female Powerful Owl was captured and radio-tracked for a period of 7.5 months. During this time the Owl's location was recorded on 111 occasions, including 65 nocturnal locations over 29 nights. Her home-range was calculated as 1589 ha using the Minimum Convex Polygon (MCP) method, or 871 ha based on the 95% Adaptive Kernel method. The area of forested habitat within the MCP home-range was 896 ha (the remainder representing cleared land). Her activity was centred primarily on the nesting gully where two dependent juveniles roosted, but several long-distance foraging expeditions (including roosting) that occurred more than 2.5 km from the juveniles were recorded. Arboreal mammals and birds dominated the Owls' diet. Low prey availability is suggested as being responsible for the single successful breeding event recorded in four nesting seasons.

ABSTRACT: Cardiac hypertrophy is a common postmortem finding in owl monkeys. In most cases the animals do not exhibit clinical signs until the disease is advanced, making antemortem diagnosis of subclinical disease difficult and treatment unrewarding. We obtained echocardiograms, electrocardiograms, and thoracic radiographs from members of a colony of owl monkeys that previously was identified as showing a 40% incidence of gross myocardial hypertrophy at necropsy, to assess the usefulness of these modalities for antemortem diagnosis. No single modality was sufficiently sensitive and specific to detect all monkeys with cardiac hypertrophy. Electrocardiography was the least sensitive method for detecting owl monkeys with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Thoracic radiographs were more sensitive than was electrocardiography in this context but cannot detect animals with concentric hypertrophy without an enlarged cardiac silhouette. Echocardiography was the most sensitive method for identifying cardiac hypertrophy in owl monkeys. The most useful parameters suggestive of left ventricular hypertrophy in our owl monkeys were an increased average left ventricular wall thickness to chamber radius ratio and an increased calculated left ventricular myocardial mass. Parameters suggestive of dilative cardiomyopathy were an increased average left ventricular myocardial mass and a decreased average ratio of left ventricular free wall thickness to left ventricular chamber radius. When all 4 noninvasive diagnostic modalities (physical examination, echocardiography, electrocardiography, and thoracic radiography) were used concurrently, the probability of detecting hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in owl monkeys was increased greatly.

ABSTRACT: Conservation efforts for Blakiston's fish owl Bubo blakistoni in Russia are limited, partly because habitat use by these rare owls is poorly known. We therefore studied nesting and foraging habitat characteristics of Blakiston's fish owls in Primorye, Russia. We sampled habitat at 14 nest sites, 12 nest stand sites and 13 random sites; we also sampled rivers within 14 fish owl home ranges across our 20,213 km2 study area. We found that large old trees and riparian old-growth forest were the primary characteristics of nest and foraging sites, respectively. Large trees were probably used as nest sites because they have cavities large enough to accommodate these birds. Big trees are also important because they are primary sources of large woody debris in rivers, which enhances suitable habitat for salmon, the owl's primary prey. Based on habitat characteristics, nest sites were correctly distinguished from random sites 74% (Kappa = 0.48) of the time, nest stands from random sites 56% (Kappa = 0.12) of the time, and used sites from available foraging sites 68% (Kappa = 0.36) of the time. The management and conservation of old-growth forests is essential for sustaining this species because they are central to the owls' nesting and foraging behaviour. Moreover, conservation of these forests sustains habitat for many other species. © 2013 Fauna & Flora International.

ABSTRACT: The annual rate of population change (λt) is a good metric for evaluating population performance because it summarizes survival and recruitment rates and can be used for open populations. Another measure of population performance, realized population change (Δt) is an encompassing metric of population trend over a period of time; it is the ratio of population size at an end time period relative to the initial population size. Our first goal was to compare mean λ and Δt as summaries of population change over time. Our second goal was to evaluate different methods for estimating these parameters; specifically we wished to compare the value of estimates from fixed effects models, random effects estimates from mixed effects models, and Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Our final goal was to evaluate the use of the posterior distribution of Δt as a means for estimating the probability of population decline retrospectively. To meet these goals, we used California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) data collected on 3 study areas from 1990 to 2011 as a case study. The estimated MCMC median λs for 2 of the study areas were 0.986 and 0.993, indicating declining populations, whereas median λ was 1.014 for the third study area, indicating an increasing population. For 2 of the study areas, estimated MCMC median Δts over the 18-year monitoring period were 0.78 and 0.89, suggesting 21% and 11% declines in population size, whereas the third study area was 1.22 suggesting a 22% increase. Results from Δt analyses highlight that small differences in mean λ from 1.0 (stationary) can result in large differences in population size over a longer time period; these temporal effects are better depicted by Δt. Fixed effects, random effects, and MCMC estimates of mean and median λ and of Δt were similar (≤9% relative difference). The estimate of temporal process variance was larger for MCMC than the random effects estimates. Results from a Bayesian approach using MCMC simulations indicated that the probabilities of a ≥15% decline over 18 years were 0.69, 0.40, and 0.04 for the 3 study areas, whereas the probabilities the populations were stationary or increasing were 0.07, 0.22, and 0.82. For retrospective analyses of monitored populations, using Bayesian MCMC methods to generate a posterior distribution of Δt is a valuable conservation and management tool for robustly estimating probabilities of specified declines of interest. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.

ABSTRACT: Summary: The Web Ontology Language (OWL) provides a sophisticated language for building complex domain ontologies and is widely used in bio-ontologies such as the Gene Ontology. The Protégé -OWL ontology editing tool provides a query facility that allows composition and execution of queries with the human-readable Manchester OWL syntax, with syntax checking and entity label lookup. No equivalent query facility such as the Proté gé Description Logics (DL) query yet exists in web form. However, many users interact with bio-ontologies such as chemical entities of biological interest and the Gene Ontology using their online Web sites, within which DL-based querying functionality is not available. To address this gap, we introduce the OntoQuery web-based query utility. © The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Two new species of miniature owls are described from the upper Pleistocene asphalt deposits of Rancho La Brea, California. The first is assigned to the extant genus Glaucidium, as Glaucidium kurochkini sp. nov., and the second is placed in a new genus Asphaltoglaux, as Asphaltoglaux cecileae sp. nov. Both new species are based on tarsometatarsi, and each is represented by various elements. These are the second and third extinct owls to be described among the nine strigiform species from Rancho La Brea. The new species of Glaucidium is also recognized from the upper Pleistocene asphalt deposits of Carpinteria, California, which lends support to the hypothesis that southwestern coastal California was comparable to an island in the late Pleistocene. Recognition of these two new strigiform taxa brings to 22 the number of known extinct avian species from Rancho La Brea. Copyright © 2013 K.E. Campbell, Jr. and Z.M. Bochenski.

ABSTRACT: Grassland bird species frequently respond to habitat characteristics at multiple spatial scales when selecting nest sites. The Western Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia hypugaea) is a grassland bird species of conservation concern across much of its range, but most studies of its habitat needs have been restricted to relatively small geographical areas and have not integrated multiple spatial scales. Our study examined habitat characteristics at three spatial scales-local (near the burrow), colony, and landscape-across western South Dakota. We searched for Burrowing Owls in 107 prairie dog colonies from May to August 2011. We located nest burrows in owl-occupied colonies, and we randomly selected non-nest burrows in colonies that were not occupied by owls for comparison. We collected data for local habitat variables in the field. Ground truthing and aerial imagery were used to calculate colony and landscape variables. We used logistic regression to identify variables that impacted nest site selection. Variables at multiple scales were important, with percent tree cover within 800 m of the burrow and visual obstruction at the burrow having the greatest effect on nest site selection. Burrowing Owls in western South Dakota were most likely to nest in landscapes with little tree cover, perhaps to avoid large avian predators associated with trees. At the local scale, Burrowing Owls were most likely to nest in regions of prairie dog colonies with relatively low visual obstruction. Burrowing Owls may benefit from prairie dogs maintaining vegetation at a short height, which allows the owls to easily detect prey and predators. Maintaining active prairie dog colonies in open landscapes across western South Dakota and preventing the establishment of trees near prairie dog colonies is necessary to ensure preferred breeding habitat remains for Burrowing Owls. © 2013 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Winter weather has a strong influence on Barn Owl (Tyto alba) breeding biology. Here, we analyzed the impacts of weather conditions on reproductive performance during the breeding season using data collected over 22 years in a Swiss Barn Owl population. Variations in rain and temperature during the breeding season played an important role in within-year variation in Barn Owl reproduction. An increase in rainfall during the period from 4 to 2 weeks preceding egg laying had a positive effect on clutch size. In contrast, fledgling body mass was negatively influenced by rainfall during the 24 h preceding the measurements. Finally, ambient temperature during the rearing period was positively associated with brood size at fledging. In conclusion, weather conditions during the breeding season place constraints on Barn Owl reproduction. © 2013 Dt. Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.

ABSTRACT: In this activity for the beginning of a high school Biology 1 evolution unit, students are challenged to reconstruct organisms found in an owl pellet as a model for fossil reconstruction. They work in groups to develop hypotheses about what animal they have found, what environment it inhabited, and what niche it filled. At the end of the activity, the groups participate in a defense and peer review of their findings. This activity develops students' knowledge of the nature of science, evidence for evolution, and individual thinking and reasoning skills.

ABSTRACT: The Ryukyu Scops Owl, Otus elegans, is distributed over a 1,200-km area, only inhabiting islands. Within this range, I studied this species across 20 continental islands in the Ryukyu Archipelago and two oceanic islands. Although most studies recently use quantitative continuous measurements of many specific aspects of the vocalization, I introduced a new method, "typological analysis" to visually classify variation of spectrograms according to the shape of syllable in the owl species, examining their dialects in relation to their geographical distribution. In the typological analysis, hoot, syllable, and element types were defined according to the number of syllables, the degree of timescale overlap of the first and second elements in the second syllable, and relative differences of duration and frequency of two elements in the second syllable, respectively. Although frequencies of hoot and element types in each island population were significantly different between the island groups north and south of the Kerama Gap across the archipelago, hoot and element types were shared between the island groups. Furthermore, typological variation occurred in syllable types, however there were no differences in frequencies of syllable types between the island groups. Geographic structure in vocal parameters as steep clines with stepped variation is represented as a dialect. According to the definition, this study found that no unique dialects in hoots occurred between the different island populations of Ryukyu Scops Owls. The Kerama Gap might act as a biogeographical barrier, contributing to the differentiation between owl hoots according to spectrotemporal analyses; however, the typological analysis detected the distribution of typological characteristics of hoots on the small islands north of the Kerama Gap that contradicts this concept of a biogeographical barrier. Because the typological analysis needs to visually examine each individual by careful attention to detail, it is a good method for discovering minor geographic variations and patterns in bird vocalizations. © 2013 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Ultrasound (B-mode) was used to analyze follicular events in 12 trained female owl monkeys (Aotus azarai infulatus). The animals were examined every 48 hours for over 90days to measure and map follicular growth in both ovaries and to measure (using Doppler velocimetry) local hemodynamic changes during the peri-ovulatory stage. There were 44 follicular growth events, each with two or three follicular waves, and a mean ± SEM interval between events of 17 ± 1.13 days. There were various hemodynamic changes during follicular growth; both vascular resistance index and pulsatility index decreased during the time when the follicle diameter peaked. Thus, both B-mode and Doppler ultrasound were useful for monitoring ovarian follicular events in owl monkeys. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Fledgling behaviour and movement patterns throughout the post-fledging dependence period (PFDP), especially in relation to changing environmental conditions, have been rarely studied, despite the fact that this period is recognized as of crucial significance in terms of high mortality of juveniles. The PFDP can extend over quite a protracted period, particularly in birds of prey, and a knowledge of the movement patterns of individuals is fundamental for understanding mechanisms underlying survival, habitat use and dispersion. We radiotracked 39 fledglings of the Tengmalm's owl (Aegolius funereus) in two years with different availability of prey: 2010 (n = 29) and 2011 (n = 10) and obtained 1455 daily locations. Fledglings reached independence on average in 45 days after fledging in 2010 (n = 22) and 57 days in 2011 (n = 6). Within years, the most important measures influencing the distance moved from the nest box were age of fledglings and number of surviving siblings present. Individual home range size and duration of PFDP in particular were dependent on maximal number of siblings seen outside the nest box. In the season with low prey availability fledglings were observed at greater distances from the nest box than in the year with higher prey availability (mean distance: 350 m in 2010 and 650 m in 2011) and occupied larger home ranges (mean: 30.3 ha in 2010 and 57.7 ha in 2011). The main factor causing these differences between years was probably the different availability of prey in these two years, affecting breeding success and post-fledging survivorship of the Tengmalm's owls. © 2013 Kouba et al.

ABSTRACT: Capsule We report a review of the occurrence of bats in the Barn Owl diet Tyto alba in Europe. Based on 802 studies reporting 4.02 million prey items identified in pellets, 4949 were bats (0.12%). We found that bat predation decreased during the last 150 years, is more frequent on islands than mainland, and is higher in eastern than western Europe and in southern than northern Europe. Although Barn Owls usually capture bats opportunistically, they can sometimes specialize on them. © 2013 © 2013 British Trust for Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: The Dusky Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus saturatus) of the Pacific Northwest region of North America is generally considered to be nonmigratory. Here we report a specimen of a Dusky Great Horned Owl that was salvaged in New Mexico and identified based on comparison of its plumage with a large series of museum skins. We attempted to corroborate this identification by comparing mitochondrial DNA sequences between the specimen and a representative sample of 5 Great Horned Owl subspecies from western North America. This analysis revealed minimal mitochondrial genetic variation and no evidence of population genetic structure, suggesting that the marked plumage differences among subspecies evolved since the late Pleistocene. To evaluate the possibility that the salvaged specimen was transported after death, we analyzed its stomach contents. The stomach contained remains of a desert cottontail (Sylvilagus audubonii), a locally abundant rabbit species in central New Mexico. The mitochondrial haplotype of the rabbit was novel but closely related to haplotypes found in New Mexico and west Texas. This is the first report of long distance movement in the Pacific Northwest subspecies of Great Horned Owl, though we cannot rule out the possibility of anomalous melanism. Although there is tremendous potential for forensic-style phylogeographic investigation of animal movements, this study illustrates that sequence databases are not yet adequate to the task, even for common North American vertebrate species. © 2013.

ABSTRACT: Located in the Atacama desert of northern Chile, Pampa del Tamarugal is a hyperarid ecosystem characterized by extreme arid conditions (<0.7mm of annual precipitation) and relatively scarce vegetation, dominated by arboreal species of Prosopis tamarugo. These unfavorable environmental conditions can affect the quantity and diversity of prey available for carnivores, making Pampa del Tamarugal an interesting environmental scenario for the study of the trophic ecology of raptors. Our analyses of the seasonal diet of the burrowing owl Athene cunicularia (Molina, 1782) indicate that insects and scorpions were the most common prey (58.3% and 27.5%, respectively). However, the rodent Phyllotis darwini was the most important prey in biomass (49.5%). Significant differences were observed in diverse trophic statisticians between summer and winter seasons. Unlike similar studies carried out in arid areas of South America and North America, we observe that the diet of the burrowing owl in Pampa del Tamarugal shows a higher trophic niche breadth and trophic diversity, but a lower species-prey richness. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Correlative species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly widespread in the conservation literature. They can be used for a variety of purposes, including addressing practical conservation tasks on the basis of a spatially explicit assessment of environmental suitability for target taxa, which in turn allows for a transparent evaluation of needs and opportunities. Here we used the maximum entropy method (by means of the software MaxEnt) to model distribution of the rare Boreal Owl Aegolius funereus and the Black Woodpecker Dryocopus martius, which excavates the nest-holes used by the owl for breeding. We believe that monitoring surveys for Boreal Owl should consider areas suitable for both species as priority sites, whereas the provision of nest-boxes for the owl may be particularly desirable in habitat patches that are suitable for that species but not for the keystone species whose nest-holes represent the usual nest site for the owl. Finally, areas suitable for both species can represent priority areas for the conservation of forest birds in the Alps, as both species have been reported as umbrella and/or keystone species. Our example provides a possible framework to model management and monitoring opportunities in other species or species pairs, but such an approach can be used to infer the need for particular management options when both limiting factors and species distribution can be spatially modelled, and also to model the areas where different target species are more likely to overlap and interact. The use of distribution models as tools to address practical conservation tasks should also be encouraged in order to accomplish practical tasks according to sound knowledge and transparent methods. © BirdLife International 2013.

ABSTRACT: In a one-year study on the diet of the Long-eared Owl, Asio otus, in the area of Karapi{dotless}nar in Central Anatolia, 5324 prey items were recovered from 3314 pellets collected at monthly intervals. At least 7 species of mammals belonging to Insectivora (Crocidura suaveolens) and Rodentia (Allactaga williamsi, Cricetulus migratorius, Meriones tristrami, Mescocricetus brandti, Microtus guentheri, M. sp., Mus macedonicus) were identified. Rodentia were dominant and contributed 93.8% of the number of prey items of the Long-eared Owl. Microtus guentheri accounted for 83.9% of the rodent remains. The diet pattern was more diverse in summer, when some 24% of the diet consisted of non-mammal prey items (birds, insects). © Zoology in the Middle East, 2013.

ABSTRACT: Pharmacokinetic data were determined after a single dose of meloxicam in red-tailed hawks (RTH; Buteo jamaicensis) and great horned owls (GHO; Bubo virginianus). In a nonrandomized crossover design, individual birds of each species received 1 dose of intravenous meloxicam (0.5 mg/kg IV; n = 7 for each species) followed by a 2-week washout period, and then each received 1 dose of oral meloxicam (0.5 mg/kg PO; n = 5 for each species). Blood samples were collected intermittently after administration, and meloxicam was detected in plasma by high-performance liquid chromatography. Time versus plasma concentration data were subjected to noncompartmental analysis. Red-tailed hawks were determined to have the shortest elimination half-life for meloxicam (0.49 ± 0.5 hours) of any species documented. Great horned owls also eliminated meloxicam very rapidly (0.78 ± 0.52 hours). Great horned owls achieved higher plasma concentrations (368 ± 87 ng/mL) of meloxicam than RTH (182 ± 167 ng/mL) after oral administration, although RTH had a markedly higher volume of distribution (832 ± 711 mL/kg) than GHO (137.6 ± 62.7 mL/kg). The differences in meloxicam pharmacokinetics between these 2 raptor species supports the need for species-dependent studies and underlines the challenges of extrapolating drug dosages between species. Results of this study suggest that the current recommended once-daily dosing interval of oral meloxicam is unlikely to maintain plasma concentrations anticipated to be therapeutic in either RTH or GHO, and practical dosing options are questionable for this nonsteriodal anti-inflammatory drug in these raptor species. © 2013 by the Association of Avian Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: Few studies have quantified metals in South African species and no published data on residues specifically in South African owl feathers exist. Tyto capensis is listed as vulnerable within South Africa, making it preferable to use a non-invasive technique to determine metal bioaccumulation for this species. Comparisons are made with the cosmopolitan T. alba to determine whether this species could be used as a surrogate. Concentrations of various metals were thus determined in feathers of the two species and compared with liver and muscle samples. Samples were taken from 119 owls collected as road kill along a national road. A comparison of concentrations in feathers revealed similarly higher concentrations of aluminium, antimony, lead, nickel, and strontium, whereas concentrations of chromium, copper, iron, manganese, selenium, titanium and zinc were similarly higher in internal tissues for both species. Metal concentrations of owls were comparable to those reported in literature and below toxic levels, suggesting that these metals were not likely to impact the owls. Further regressions between feathers and corresponding livers were examined to determine if feathers were indicative of internal metal burdens. Significant positive relationships were found for aluminium, copper, lead, nickel and vanadium in T. alba and nickel, manganese and vanadium in T. capensis. Preliminary results support the feasibility of using feathers as non-destructive indicators of environmental contamination in T. capensis although caution needs to be taken when interpreting the results. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: The decision to emigrate from the natal area can influence future fitness prospects, yet detailed data on sex-specific juvenile dispersal behaviour is still lacking for most bird species. We tracked 13 radio-tagged Tengmalm's Owl Aegolius funereus juveniles from 13 different nests from fledging to independence and onwards. Six out of the seven female juveniles departed abruptly and disappeared from the natal area. In contrast, only one male juvenile departed abruptly, whereas the other five males and one female remained in the study area until tracking was terminated. We propose two alternative interpretations: (1) females initiated natal dispersal earlier than males, or (2) the manner of dispersal differed between the sexes, with females departing abruptly, and males moving gradually out of the natal area. We found no statistically significant influence of body condition or date of independence on dispersal behaviour. We suggest that early onset of dispersal and fast movements out of the natal area may increase a juvenile female's chances of successful breeding in the following spring. In contrast to females, male Tengmalm's Owls rarely breed as 1-year-olds, and the benefits of early/abrupt dispersal may be lower for juvenile males. We suggest that female-biased natal dispersal in Tengmalm's Owl may come about through relatively higher lifetime reproductive success of early dispersing in females than in males. © 2013 Dt.

ABSTRACT: The distribution of the Ural Owl (Strix uralensis) in Europe shrank dramatically at the end of the nineteenth century, largely through direct persecution. No genetic information on this species is available that could provide a basis for ongoing conservation and breeding programs. Here, we genetically analyzed wild and captive populations of European Ural Owls to provide data that can be used to establish sound and sustainable management strategies. We analyzed mitochondrial and nuclear markers to evaluate the morphology-based concept of two subspecies (Strix uralensis liturata and Strix uralensis macroura), to gain insights into the phylogeographic population structure, and to determine genetic clusters for management implications. Our results supported neither the morphological subspecies concept nor a strong phylogeographic population structure. However, they pointed toward a noteworthy genetic exchange in the western range of the distribution of this species. Structure analysis revealed five genetic clusters. We propose that genetic-cluster-based management is better suited to the conservation of European Ural Owls than the separate consideration of each local population. If applied in supportive breeding programs, genetic cluster recognition and its contribution to divergence and diversity would help to preserve the genetic variability of the captive breeding population and enable optimal genetic tuning of the captive population to correspond to the genetic constitution of the supported population. © 2013 Dt.

ABSTRACT: Northern Saw-whet Owls (Aegolius acadicus) breed throughout the boreal forest of North America, but little is known about their population trends or distribution within this region. Analysis of stable hydrogen isotopes (σ2H) in feathers can delineate origins of a variety of avian migrants, but raptors are reported to have high intrafeather isotopic variance and mean σ2H values higher than predicted from σ2H isoscapes specific to raptor feathers, making assignment of geographic origin sometimes difficult. We examined the applicability of σ2H analysis of sawwhet owl feathers to delineating origins of migrants and to assessing differences in the migratory behavior of adult and young owls by using multiple generations of feathers from owls captured during fall migration at the Delta Marsh Bird Observatory, Manitoba, 2006-2007. Values of σ2H in saw-whet owl feathers were higher than predicted from a σ2H isoscape specific to raptor feathers and from patterns of movements inferred from analysis of band recoveries. This effect was pronounced in adults, while values of σ2H in feathers of hatching-year owls fell primarily within the range predicted for the boreal forest northwest of Delta Marsh. Significant differences in σ2H values among feather generations suggest that physiological or behavioral differences between adults and young give rise to greater 2H enrichment in adult feathers. These results indicate that current σ2H isoscapes for feathers cannot be used to track adult saw-whet owls reliably and further research into the mechanisms of 2H enrichment in owl feathers is required. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2013.

ABSTRACT: Feathers confer protection against biophysical agents and determine flying ability. The geometry and arrangement of the barbs, together with the keratin and pigments deposited in the feathers, determine the mechanical stability of the vane, and its stiffness and resistance to abrasive agents. In colour-polymorphic species, individuals display alternative colour morphs, which can be associated with different foraging strategies. Each morph may therefore require specific flying abilities, and their feathers may be exposed to different abrasive agents. Feathers of differently coloured individuals may thus have a specific structure, and colour pigments may help resist abrasive agents and improve stiffness. We examined these predictions in the barn owl (Tyto alba), a species for which the ventral body side varies from white to dark reddish pheomelanic, and in the number and size of black spots located at the tip of the feathers. White and reddish birds show different foraging strategies, and the size of black feather spots is associated with several phenotypic attributes. We found that birds displaying a darker reddish coloration on the ventral body side deposit more melanin pigments in their remiges, which also have fewer barbs. This suggests that wear resistance increases with darkness, whereas feathers of lighter coloured birds may bend less easily. Accordingly, individuals displaying a lighter reddish coloration on the ventral body side, and those displaying larger black spots, displayed more black transverse bars on their remiges: as larger-spotted individuals are heavier and longer-winged birds also have more transverse bars, these bars may reduce feather bending when flying. We conclude that differently coloured individuals produce wing feathers of different strengths to adopt alternative behavioural and life history strategies.© 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 109, 562-573. © 2013 The Linnean Society of London.

ABSTRACT: Limited food resource availability during yearly dry seasons can influence population dynamics and direct life-history evolution. We examined actual food production during two dry seasons and its relationship to feeding, life history, and demography in territorial, monogamous, and pair-living owl monkeys (Aotus azarae azarae). To quantify food availability in 16.25 ha of gallery forest in the Argentinean Chaco, we collected phenological data, from dry season fruit sources (N = 894), twice a month, during July and August of 2008 and 2009. At the same time, we collected feeding data from the four groups (N = 1448 h) inhabiting that forest portion. We also examined demographic data on births, natal dispersal, and group size. Our data show that owl monkeys occupy territories, and core areas, that produce food consistently, even during harsh times. Following the 2009 drought, less fruit was available than in 2008, but the 50 % core areas produced fruit amounts comparable to the 80 % territories. Owl monkeys showed dietary flexibility; fruits were the most frequent food item in 2008, whereas all groups increased their consumption of leaves in 2009. Infant production was lower in 2008 than after the drought of 2009. Interbirth intervals between the 2 yr were longer than the mean for the population, and more individuals dispersed in 2008 than in 2009. Our study suggests that owl monkeys occupy territories that provide similar amounts of reliable dry season foods within the core areas. Although access to these core areas may allow them to overcome severe dry seasons, our findings underscored the difficulties of understanding the potential causal relationships between ecological factors and demographic and life-history parameters. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: The results of research that was performed in central Poland in 2006-2011 on colour morphs in tawny owl (Strix aluco) are presented. Specifically, the work soughts to determine which of the two main colour morphs (rufous or grey) is most prevalent in the study area. The results revealed similar proportions of both morphs in the study population: of 107 tawny owls that were observed, 51.4% were rufous and 46.7% were grey; two birds (1.9%) represented a transitional form.

ABSTRACT: Food availability is an important limiting factor for avian reproduction. In altricial birds, food limitation is assumed to be more severe during the nestling stage than during laying or incubation, but this has yet to be adequately tested. Using food-supplementation experiments over a 5-year period, we determined the degree and timing of food limitation for burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia) breeding in Canada. Burrowing owls are an endangered species and food limitation during the nestling stage could influence reproductive performance of this species at the northern extent of their range. Supplemented pairs fledged on average 47% more owlets than unfed pairs, except during a year when natural food was not limiting (i.e., a prey irruption year). The difference in fledgling production resulted from high nestling mortality in unfed broods, with 96% of all nestling deaths being attributed to food shortage. Supplemental feeding during the nestling period also increased fledgling structural size. Pairs fed from the start of laying produced the same number of hatchlings as pairs that received no supplemental food before hatch. Furthermore, pairs supplemented from egg laying to fledging and pairs supplemented during the nestling period alone had the same patterns of nestling survival, equal numbers of fledglings, and similar fledgling mass and structural size. Our results provide empirical support for the hypothesis that the nestling period is the most food-limited phase of the breeding cycle. The experimental design we introduce here could be used with other altricial species to examine how the timing of food limitation differs among birds with a variety of life-history strategies. For burrowing owls, and other species with similar life histories, longterm, large-scale, and appropriately timed habitat management increasing prey abundance or availability is critical for conservation. © 2013 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The Scops Owl Otus scops (L., 1758) is a species of European concern, which suffered a noticeable decrease in distribution in the last decades, and changes in agricultural practices have been proposed as a major threat for this owl. We studied the habitat preference of the Scops Owl by assessing the habitat occupancy of 401 territories distributed in a large area in northwest Italy, with a special focus on 98 territories located in a high-density area (Monferrato). Habitat characteristics were analyzed with maximum entropy (MAXENT) models that included both vegetational (16 land use categories) and physical features estimated from a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) (altitude, slope, hillshade). In the Monferrato area, a comparison of 2009 landcover was also made with year 1954/55 characteristics obtained from aerial photographs. In the full northwest Italy area, the Scops Owl preferred areas located at middle altitude with intermediate slope. The preferred habitats included riparian areas and pasture-grassland, while woodlands and zones with Robinia pseudoacacia shrublands were avoided. In the Monferrato area, Scops Owl occupancy occurred in sites where the landuse (croplands/vineyard mosaic) had changed little since the mid-1950s. Our study suggests that conservation activity should focus on interventions halting riparian zone transformation and subsidies promoting agricultural practices favouring pastures and grassland. © 2013 Unione Zoologica Italiana.

ABSTRACT: Scavenging is a common behavior in many animal species and can increase the fitness of individuals and populations. Scavenging has been documented more commonly in recent years with advances in technology, including in difficult to observe avian species. Four North American owl species have been documented scavenging, and here we relate the first documented scavenging by a Western Screech-Owl (Megascops kennicottii), which was video-documented with a motion-triggered camera. The screech-owl visited a Virginia Opossum (Didelphus virginiana) carcass seven times over an 11-hr period, with the longest visit lasting 7 mins (mean = 3.14 ± SD 2.34 mins); during the visits the owl actively fed on the carcass. The most common prey of Western Screech-Owls are small mammals, insects, arthropods, and small birds. No mesocarnivore or large mammal has ever been detected in diet studies of screech-owls, though screech-owls have been shown to attack and kill prey larger than themselves. The importance of carrion in owl diets is largely unexplored, and the scavenging behavior of owls could be more significant than currently believed depending on its availability and the presence of competing scavengers. Further research is needed to establish the commonality of scavenging by owls, and its various ecological effects. © 2013 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: The 2011 Revised Recovery Plan for the northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) declared that active forest management is compatible and consistent with recovery goals. The plan indicated that ecologically motivated silvicultural treatments should improve stand conditions, promote forest resiliency, and develop late-successional structural complexity over the long term. Yet most biologists believe that intensive, even-aged silvicultural systems (i.e., clearcut, seed-tree, or shelterwood regeneration methods) degrade habitat for northern spotted owls. Only for the coastal redwood forests of California is it broadly accepted that small-patch clearcut harvest units interspersed within a landscape containing significant large stands of large, old trees can provide adequate habitat. Spotted owls prey upon ground-dwelling prey, such as dusky-footed woodrats (Neotoma fuscipes), in these situations, primarily along edges of 6-30year old clearcuts that contain dense patches of shrubs and hardwoods as well as woody debris. Demographic pressures presumably cause surplus prey to emigrate into adjacent older stands with sparse understories, where they may be more vulnerable to predation by spotted owls. During 5 radio-telemetry studies in both the Klamath and Coastal Redwood Physiographic Provinces, we detected and observed northern spotted owls foraging as far as 600m from forests within harvest-created hardwood/shrub patches that contained scattered conifers and snags. Preferential use of such areas occurred in winter, especially in patches with conifer basal area of 9-18m2/ha that were outside of dense nesting areas. In areas where ground-dwelling small mammals comprise a significant proportion of the owl's prey base, we hypothesize that use of young harvest units with retained conifers may contribute to spotted owl conservation. Such treatments may promote greater prey biomass, which could assist females to attain a high plane of nutrition prior to nesting. This hypothesis should be tested and refined via adaptive management experiments. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Information on population dynamics is key to gauging the status of threatened or endangered species. We monitored demography of a population of threatened Mexican spotted owls (Strix occidentalis lucida) in the Sacramento Mountains, New Mexico from 2003 to 2011. We estimated reproductive output for territorial pairs of owls; used mark-recapture methodology and Pradel's reparameterized Jolly-Seber models to estimate annual apparent survival rates, recapture rates, recruitment rates, and annual rate of population change (λRJS) for 2005-2009; and used estimates of λRJS to assess short-term population viability. Reproductive output was highly variable for 2004-2011, whereas annual apparent survival and recapture rates were less variable among years. Annual rates of population change exceeded 1.0 for both sexes from 2005 to 2009, and empirical observations of numbers of territorial owls supported the model-based trend estimate. Abundance of territorial owls was strongly related to reproduction within the study area, suggesting that population change was driven largely by internal processes. Population viability analyses suggested that population growth was likely to continue in the short term if current conditions persist. The positive growth rates observed in our study populations are encouraging, and may indicate that current recommendations for recovering this owl are succeeding. However, our estimates of λRJS covered a very short time period, given both the potential lifespan of Mexican spotted owls and the extent of temporal variability in weather typical of the southwestern United States. Longer studies of owl demography than we present will be required to understand long-term population trends, and such studies should extend across the range of the subspecies. Published 2013.

ABSTRACT: A ural owl (Strix uralensis) was presented with reduced activity, emaciation and respiratory distress. The bird was severely emaciated and had an enlarged vent with a soft to fiuctuant consistency. The differential blood count revealed a severe relative lymphopenia and monocytosis as well as a moderate leucocytosis. Radiographs showed increased opacity of the entire coelomic cavity. Ultrasonography revealed a mass with an echogenicity similar to that of liver parenchyma, with multiple cystic inclusions in the abdomen. At necropsy, the soft mass, initially suspected to be a cystic neoplasm of the liver, filled almost the entire body cavity. Histopathology of the structure identified a large blood clot demarcated by a broad band of infiammatory cells and giant cell granulomas from compressed liver tissue. Further granulomas were found in the spleen. Acid fast rods in the necrotic areas of the granulomas were visualized after Ziehl-Neelsen staining. Culture and PCR of liver and spleen demonstrated the presence of M. avium subsp. silvaticum in all samples tested. In all published cases of mycobacteriosis in Strigiformes, classical tubercles were reported. In the present case, radiographs and computed tomography, as well as gross necropsy, initially indicated a cystic neoplasia. The typical changes associated with mycobacteriosis were only seen in histopathology and were confirmed by microbiology and PCR. M. avium subsp. silvaticum is a pathogen that may occur in immunocompetent hosts, although infection has not yet been reported in humans. Nevertheless, the possibility that the agent has a zoonotic potential cannot be excluded.

ABSTRACT: To compete over limited parental resources, young animals communicate with their parents and siblings by producing honest vocal signals of need. Components of begging calls that are sensitive to food deprivation may honestly signal need, whereas other components may be associated with individual-specific attributes that do not change with time such as identity, sex, absolute age and hierarchy. In a sib-sib communication system where barn owl (Tyto alba) nestlings vocally negotiate priority access to food resources, we show that calls have individual signatures that are used by nestlings to recognize which siblings are motivated to compete, even if most vocalization features vary with hunger level. Nestlings were more identifiable when food-deprived than food-satiated, suggesting that vocal identity is emphasized when the benefit of winning a vocal contest is higher. In broods where siblings interact iteratively, we speculate that individual-specific signature permits siblings to verify that the most vocal individual in the absence of parents is the one that indeed perceived the food brought by parents. Individual recognition may also allow nestlings to associate identity with individual-specific characteristics such as position in the within-brood dominance hierarchy. Calls indeed revealed age hierarchy and to a lower extent sex and absolute age. Using a cross-fostering experimental design, we show that most acoustic features were related to the nest of origin (but not the nest of rearing), suggesting a genetic or an early developmental effect on the ontogeny of vocal signatures. To conclude, our study suggests that sibling competition has promoted the evolution of vocal behaviours that signal not only hunger level but also intrinsic individual characteristics such as identity, family, sex and age. © 2013 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

ABSTRACT: Since 1997, it has been observed that fledging scops owls often develop necrotic plaques in their oral cavities, which in severe cases can even affect bone tissue. This condition has been defined as a necrotic oropharyngeal disease based on gross lesions. In 2011 alone, thirty-five cases were identified at the Brinzal Owl Rescue Centre (Madrid, Spain), of which four were chosen to perform a complete diagnostic study. Histopathology was carried out in three cases and cytology in one case. Using morphological traits cytology identified two larvae as third-stage larvae of a Spiruridae nematode. Histology detected parasite sections in the mucosal epithelium of the mouth of one owl. In addition, four samples of mucosal lesions were subjected to a PCR amplification of the nematode ribosomal RNA gene using a pair of universal primers, three of which were positive. Of available sequences, the sequence obtained showed the closest affinity to that of Gongylonema pulchrum (97.8-98.0%). Clinical treatment was based on supportive therapy, the daily removal of caseous material from the oral cavity and the administration of fenbendazol (50. mg/kg PO for 5. days). Approximately 60% of the affected scops owls that arrived at the rescue centre in 2011 were cured and released back into the wild. Clinical, pathological and molecular findings are consistent with Gongylonema sp. infection. Since no evidence of the presence of adult parasites was found, we suggest that these scops owls should be considered as accidental hosts. This is the first description of severe Gongylonema infection in fledgling scops owls, a disease can lead to starvation and death if proper treatment is not provided. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The onset of breeding in boreal owls might be linked to food supply, weather conditions or both, but the relative importance of each is poorly understood. The primary goal of this study was to discuss the impact that fluctuating food supply and various climatic factors have on the timing of breeding in northern Tawny Owls Strix aluco in rural and urban environments. The timing of breeding was significantly earlier in urban territories than in rural ones. In accordance with earlier findings, very early clutches occurred mainly in urban habitats. In association with being significantly earlier in urban than in rural habitats, the breeding of Tawny Owls began earlier the higher the (autumn) vole levels and the milder the preceding winter. Owls bred earlier the more there were voles and snow simultaneously. It seems that the state of readiness to start egg laying in urban habitats is in general higher than elsewhere and therefore favourable large-scale environmental conditions may also activate breeding earlier there than in rural areas. © 2013 Dt.

ABSTRACT: Background: Intra-specific variation in melanocyte pigmentation, common in the animal kingdom, has caught the eye of naturalists and biologists for centuries. In vertebrates, dark, eumelanin pigmentation is often genetically determined and associated with various behavioral and physiological traits, suggesting that the genes involved in melanism have far reaching pleiotropic effects. The mechanisms linking these traits remain poorly understood, and the potential involvement of developmental processes occurring in the brain early in life has not been investigated. We examined the ontogeny of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, a state involved in brain development, in a wild population of barn owls (Tyto alba) exhibiting inter-individual variation in melanism and covarying traits. In addition to sleep, we measured melanistic feather spots and the expression of a gene in the feather follicles implicated in melanism (PCSK2).Results: As in mammals, REM sleep declined with age across a period of brain development in owlets. In addition, inter-individual variation in REM sleep around this developmental trajectory was predicted by variation in PCSK2 expression in the feather follicles, with individuals expressing higher levels exhibiting a more precocial pattern characterized by less REM sleep. Finally, PCSK2 expression was positively correlated with feather spotting.Conclusions: We demonstrate that the pace of brain development, as reflected in age-related changes in REM sleep, covaries with the peripheral activation of the melanocortin system. Given its role in brain development, variation in nestling REM sleep may lead to variation in adult brain organization, and thereby contribute to the behavioral and physiological differences observed between adults expressing different degrees of melanism. © 2013 Scriba et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Pulmonary thromboembolism associated with pancreatic endocrine neoplasia is extremely uncommon in man and animals. Post-mortem examination of an adult owl monkey (Aotus nancymae) revealed extensive pulmonary arterial thromboembolism and a well-demarcated mass attached to the pancreas. Microscopically, the mass consisted of areas of interstitial fibrosis with loss of acini and islets and replacement by nests and sheets of polygonal cells with amphophilic cytoplasm, an eccentric round nucleus with stippled chromatin and, in some cells, with a single prominent eccentric nucleolus. Clusters of these cells were noted within vessels and adjacent lymph nodes. The cells did not express S100 or insulin, but were labelled strongly with SP-1/chromogranin. Rare individual cells expressed glucagon and somatostatin. A few cells in pulmonary thrombi/emboli and the adjacent lymph node also expressed SP-1/chromogranin. Based on cell morphology, location and immunohistochemistry the tumour was classified as pancreatic endocrine (islet cell) carcinoma with metastasis to regional lymph nodes and lung. © 2012.

ABSTRACT: Understanding the habitat relationships of rare species is critical to conserving populations and habitats of those species. Nesting habitat is suspected to limit distribution of the threatened Mexican spotted owl (Strix occidentalis lucida), and may vary among geographic regions. We studied selection of nesting habitat by Mexican spotted owls within their home ranges in the Sacramento Mountains, New Mexico. We compared characteristics of owl nest trees and nest sites to characteristics of randomly located trees and sites at 2 spatial scales: the general nest vicinity and within activity centers used by spotted owls. Owls nested primarily in mixed-conifer forest (92%), and most nested in cavities in trees or snags (48%), or in dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium spp.) witches' brooms (36%). Owl nest trees had greater levels of dwarf mistletoe infection and were larger in diameter than random trees at both of the evaluated spatial scales. Nest trees also were more likely than random trees to be in white fir (Abies concolor) or Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), and in trees or snags with broken tops. Differences between owl nest sites and random sites differed with the scale at which we selected random sites, but at both scales examined, owl nest sites had greater canopy cover and more basal area contributed by large trees and white fir than random sites. In addition, most nest sites occurred in drainage bottoms or on the lower 2 thirds of north- or east-facing slopes. Conservation of owl nesting habitat in this area will require retaining forest patches with high canopy cover and large trees containing cavities or large dwarf mistletoe witches' brooms. Locating forest management treatments on ridgetops or the upper third of slopes and/or on south- or west-facing slopes may reduce impacts to owl nesting habitat while simultaneously targeting the drier forest types most in need of restoration. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.

ABSTRACT: Capsule We present a review of the propensity to eat reptiles in the Barn Owl Tyto alba in Europe. Based on the analysis of 591 published studies reporting 3.07 million prey items identified in pellets, only 2402 reptiles (0.08%) were found. Reptiles were most often captured in southern parts of the European continent and on islands. A large proportion of the 1304 identified reptiles to the species level were nocturnal Gekkonidae (77.1%). © 2012 Copyright British Trust for Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: We studied geographic variation in the diet of Western Barn Owls (Tyto alba) along a urban-rural gradient in central-eastern Argentina and identified 5,231 prey items. Mammals were present in all samples, whereas birds and amphibians were present in 79.1 and 50.0% of the samples, respectively. There were significant differences in vertebrate assemblages consumed by Barn Owls at the opposite extremes of the gradient. Native sigmodontine rodents comprised 85.8 of the total prey items, especially towards periurban and rural areas. Exotic murid rodents were the main prey item in urban sites, while birds increased in frequency in urban and periurban areas. Food niche breadth and standardized food niche breadth values were higher at intermediate levels of urbanization (= periurban). This 'periurban peak' in species diversity is a relatively well-known pattern, previously reported for taxa such as birds, lizards, bumblebees, and butterflies among others. The trophic habits of Barn Owls along this gradient were mostly similar to those reported in other studies in southern South America, where the main prey items were native rodents and food niche breadth values (measured at the level of Orders) were low. Western Barn Owls in our study maintained specialization as a micromammal predator. © 2012 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Masked owls, reputedly all of the Tasmanian race (Tyto novaehollandiae castanops) were introduced onto Lord Howe Island (LHI) in the 1920s in an attempt to control the black rat (Rattus rattus). This attempt, however, has been unsuccessful and a co-eradication of the rats and masked owls has been planned to reduce the threat to endemic species and breeding seabirds on the island. As the Tasmanian masked owl is considered endangered, translocation of LHI masked owls to Tasmania has been suggested. Before translocation is considered the ancestry of the LHI masked owl needs to be confirmed, as LHI masked owls are typically smaller and paler than individuals occurring in Tasmania. Here we sequenced three sections of mitochondrial gene regions: cytochrome b, ATP6 and ND3 to assess the provenance of the LHI masked owl and screened a suite of microsatellite loci isolated from the barn owl (Tyto alba) to assess contemporary divergence. Phylogenetic analysis revealed two clades, one exhibited by individuals from LHI and south-eastern mainland Australia and the second by those from Tasmania. Cross species amplification of microsatellite loci was successful, with 18 loci polymorphic. Genotypic data revealed significant sub-structuring between LHI, south-eastern mainland Australia and Tasmania. Data presented here indicate that the south-eastern mainland masked owl was introduced to LHI and subsequently reproduced. The genetic integrity of the LHI masked owl population is therefore questionable and as such LHI individuals may not be suitable for translocation to Tasmania. © 2012.

ABSTRACT: African owls are relatively little known and studying them is difficult due to negative effects of cultural beliefs and consumptive uses of owls. Over a 5-yr period from 2004-08, we studied the breeding ecology of 13 pairs of Mackinder's Eagle-Owls (Bubo capensis mackinderi), a subspecies of the Cape Eagle-Owl (B. capensis), inhabiting a densely populated farming community in central Kenya. Mean owl density was 0.24 pairs/km2 and mean nearest neighbor distance averaged over all years was 1.9 km. Most nests (65%) were located in a cave or on a covered ledge, and mean nest site elevation was 2191 m asl. Nests were located close to farms and grasslands, but far from forests. Initiation of breeding was associated with rainfall patterns. Mean breeding success was 51% and reproductive rate was 1.36 young fledged per successful pair. Increased reproductive success was associated with breeding after the long rainy season, nesting on cliffs or covered ledges, and nesting close to grasslands and human habitation. The majority (59%) of recorded owl deaths were caused by human activities and poisoning was the most common source of mortality. Compared to other populations of Bubo spp., the birds in our study area had a high breeding density but a low reproductive output. Human-induced mortality may be negatively affecting productivity in this population. © 2012 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: In this paper, we modify dynamic occupancy models developed for detectionnondetection data to allow for the dependence of local vital rates on neighborhood occupancy, where neighborhood is defined very flexibly. Such dependence of occupancy dynamics on the status of a relevant neighborhood is pervasive, yet frequently ignored. Our framework permits joint inference about the importance of neighborhood effects and habitat covariates in determining colonization and extinction rates. Our specific motivation is the recent expansion of the Barred Owl (Strix varia) in western Oregon, USA, over the period 1990-2010. Because the focal period was one of dramatic range expansion and local population increase, the use of models that incorporate regional occupancy (sources of colonists) as determinants of dynamic rate parameters is especially appropriate. We began our analysis of 21 years of Barred Owl presence/nondetection data in the Tyee Density Study Area (TDSA) by testing a suite of six models that varied only in the covariates included in the modeling of detection probability. We then tested whether models that used regional occupancy as a covariate for colonization and extinction outperformed models with constant or year-specific colonization or extinction rates. Finally we tested whether habitat covariates improved the AIC of our models, focusing on which habitat covariates performed best, and whether the signs of habitat effects are consistent with a priori hypotheses. We conclude that all covariates used to model detection probability lead to improved AIC, that regional occupancy influences colonization and extinction rates, and that habitat plays an important role in determining extinction and colonization rates. As occupancy increases from low levels toward equilibrium, colonization increases and extinction decreases, presumably because there are more and more dispersing juveniles. While both rates are affected, colonization increases more than extinction decreases. Colonization is higher and extinction is lower in survey polygons with more riparian forest. The effects of riparian forest on extinction rates are greater than on colonization rates. Model results have implications for management of the invading Barred Owl, both through habitat alteration and removal. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.

ABSTRACT: One suggested anti-predator function of alarm calls is to deliver a message to a predator that it has been detected. Moreover, giving the alarm call could provide a signal to the predator that capturing the individual giving the alarm is more difficult than capturing its silent group members, as the caller is probably the most aware of the predator's location. In an aviary experiment using stuffed dummy Willow Tits Poecile montanus, we assessed whether an authentic alarm call given by Willow Tit affected Pygmy Owl Glaucidium passerinum prey preference. In the experiment, the Owls attacked only the 'silent' dummy individuals, suggesting that alarm calling could offer direct fitness benefits to the caller by decreasing the attack risk of the caller relative to its group members. © 2013 British Ornithologists' Union.

ABSTRACT: The concentration of Pb was determined in feathers (contour feathers: mantle, pectoral, ventral, and primary- and secondary-coverts) of two sedentary species of raptors in Galicia (NW Spain): the tawny owl (Strix aluco) and the Northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis). A high degree of intraindividual variability was observed in all types of feathers, with coefficients of variation exceeding 100 percent. The correlations between feather types were too low to enable use of a single type of body feather to predict the concentration of Pb in the other feathers. The number of body feathers required to differentiate individuals on the basis of the concentration of Pb was extremely high, in some cases higher than the number of the particular type of feather in the bird. All of this provides clear evidence that the contour and covert feathers of the raptor species considered cannot be used to biomonitor contamination by Pb, at least in this sample where the overall feather concentration were fairly uniform. © 2012.

ABSTRACT: Understanding how survival is affected by the environment is essential to gain insight into population dynamics and the evolution of life-history traits as well as to identify environmental selection pressures. However, we still have little understanding of the relative effect of different environmental factors and their interactions on demographic traits and population dynamics. Here we used two long-term, individual-based datasets on Tawny Owl Strix aluco (1981-2010) and Ural Owl S. uralensis (1986-2010) to undertake capture-mark-recapture analysis of annual survival of adult females in response to three biologically meaningful environmental variables and their two-way interactions. Despite the similar ecology of these two species, their survival was associated with different and uncorrelated environmental drivers. The main correlate of Tawny Owl survival was an inverse association with snow depth (winter severity). For Ural Owl, high food (vole) abundance improved survival during years with deep snow, but was less important during years with little snow. In addition, Ural Owl survival was strongly density-dependent, whereas Tawny Owl survival was not. Our findings advise caution in extrapolating demographic inferences from one species to another, even when they are very closely related and ecologically similar. Analyses including only one or few potential environmental drivers of a species' survival may lead to incomplete conclusions because survival may be affected by several factors and their interactions. © 2013 British Ornithologists' Union.

ABSTRACT: Information on habitat requirements and spatial ecology is vital in conservation strategies and management of particular species. Little Owl Athene noctua is a highly threatened owl species whose populations have significantly decreased or are locally extinct in many European countries. In this study we report on spatial ecology and habitat selection of Little Owls during their breeding season in an agricultural landscape and discuss key management actions for its conservation. The mean home range size of radio-tracked Little Owls, determined by the kernel method, was 0.94 ha (SD = 0.95, 0.24-2.72 ha) and 4.30 ha (SD = 3.75, 0.88-11.70 ha) for 50% and 95% home range, respectively. The smallest home ranges were recorded in April-June (incubation and nesting period) with a significant increase in July-August (fledging season). The most important foraging habitat during the entire breeding season was grassland (especially pastures) reaching 90% for all locations. Vegetation height and cover were the main factors determining habitat selection: Little Owls significantly preferred sparse and short sward vegetation patches that enabled hunting of ground-dwelling prey. Conservation efforts for Little Owls should focus on the active management of prey-rich grassland habitats in the vicinity of breeding sites. © 2011 BirdLife International.

ABSTRACT: Background: Sex-specific parental roles of most raptors allow mates to cooperate during breeding; while females incubate and brood, males provide food. If one partner fails in its parental duties, however, sex-specific parental roles can limit the ability of each sex to carry out the role normally performed by its partner. We observed the effect of male food provisioning on female parental care in Boreal Owls Aegolius funereus using cameras at 12 nests in western Finland in 2005. We compared the parental care of eight females in nests with a high male feeding rate (successful nests) with that of the females in four nests with a low or zero male feeding rate (failed nests). Results: Females brooded more intensively in nests where males provided sufficient food for the family. These females continually stayed with the young until the late brooding stage (18 days after hatching). After completing the brooding period (21 days after hatching), they either no longer visited their nests or began to provide food to their young together with males. Females exposed to a low or zero male feeding rate left their young for long periods without brooding during the early brooding stage (8 days after hatching) and provisioned nestlings at a mean rate of 0.6 ± 0.8 prey items/night. As a consequence, all of these nesting attempts failed. One female that was widowed 21 days after hatching stopped brooding and began food provisioning alone, but only one of six young successfully left the nest. Body masses of females in successful and unsuccessful nests were similar, indicating that females in nests with insufficient provisioning did not markedly suffer from a lack of food. Conclusions: Female Boreal Owls adjusted their parental care based on the level of parental effort of their mates and the nesting phase. The nesting attempts, in which males did not provide enough food for the family during the early brooding stage, failed. We concluded that bi-parental care in northern populations of Boreal Owls is essential until brooding is completed. © 2013 Zárybnická and Vojar; licensee Springer.

ABSTRACT: Pellets produced and accumulated by owls are subject to biological and atmospherical agents, and may be dispersed before their disaggregation. Observations on dispersion of Athene cunicularia and Tyto alba (Aves, Strigiformes) pellets were performed in a natural environment (Pampean region, Argentina) and in a wind tunnel. Ten burrows were visited, and the distances of pellets and isolated bones from the burrow entrance holes were registered. Intact pellets predominated between 0 and 1 m from the entrance holes. Partially disaggregated and disaggregated pellets showed similar distributions. In two burrows, the transport of new pellets and incorporated bones was observed during one month. Only in a few cases were the pellets mobilized and reoriented according to the predominant winds. Substrate features or the presence of vegetation favored fixing of their positions and prevented their mobility. Many of the pellets suffered total disaggregation or burial within the first 20 days to 1 month. Evaluated isolated bones showed a greater representation of mandibles and long bones, as well as skeletal elements with low susceptibility to wind transport. Pellets evaluated in the wind tunnel, at low wind speed (2.70 m/s), were mobilized very short distances. At high wind speed (4.70 m/s), transport distance was greater. The distances travelled could be related to their initial orientation at the beginning of the experiments, as those that were placed at 90° to the wind flow showed greater transport. The observations showed that there were some differences in mobility between pellets of A. cunicularia and T. alba, as A. cunicularia were more susceptible to transport at each wind speed, likely attributed to their smaller size. Wind increased bone dispersion from partially disaggregated pellets, causing the loss of some of them. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

ABSTRACT: Microfilariae are considered non-pathogenic in wild birds. The objective of the current communication is to report host reactions to microfilarial infection of unusual intensity in emaciated boreal owls (Aegolius funereus). An unusually large number of boreal owls (n = 21) were submitted to the Canadian Cooperative Wildlife Health Center-Quebec Region for post-mortem examination during the winter of 2009. Nineteen out of 21 birds were considered emaciated based on atrophy of adipose tissue and pectoral muscles and suboptimal weight. A microscopic examination of a subset of nine owls revealed the presence of microfilariae in six owls. Three of the birds with a heavy parasite burden had masses of larval nematodes obstructing large vessels of the lungs. The emaciated owls are believed to have died from starvation due to a cyclic decrease in prey abundance in the boreal forest. This cycle also drives winter movements of boreal owls to urbanized areas of southern Quebec, presumably accounting for the large number of birds submitted in 2009. In the most severely infected owls, the extreme microfilarial burden might have caused an alteration in circulatory dynamics, gaseous exchanges and also probably some metabolic cost. Consequently, microfilariae could have significantly contributed to the death of some of these owls. © 2012 Copyright Houghton Trust Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) is one of the most intensively studied raptors in the world; however, little is known about the impacts of wildfire on the subspecies and how they use recently burned areas. Three large-scale wildfires in southwest Oregon provided an opportunity to investigate the short-term impacts of wildfire and salvage logging on site occupancy of spotted owls. We used Program MARK to develop single-species, multiple-season models of site occupancy using data collected during demographic surveys of spotted owl territories. In our first analysis, we compared occupancy dynamics of spotted owl nesting territories before (1992-2002) and after the Timbered Rock burn (2003-2006) to a reference area in the south Cascade Mountains that was not affected recently by wildfire. We found that the South Cascades had greater colonization probabilities than Timbered Rock before and after wildfire (β̌ = 1.31, 95% CI = 0.60-2.03), and colonization probabilities declined over time at both areas (β̌ = - 0.06, 95% CI = -0.12 to 0.00). Extinction probabilities were greater at South Cascades than at Timbered Rock prior to the burn (β̌ = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.23-2.62); however, Timbered Rock had greater extinction probabilities following wildfire (β̌ = 1.46, 95% CI = 0.29-2.62). The Timbered Rock and South Cascades study areas had similar patterns in site occupancy prior to the Timbered Rock burn (1992-2001). Furthermore, Timbered Rock had a 64% reduction in site occupancy following wildfire (2003-2006) in contrast to a 25% reduction in site occupancy at South Cascades during the same time period. This suggested that the combined effects of habitat disturbances due to wildfire and subsequent salvage logging on private lands negatively affected site occupancy by spotted owls. In our second analysis, we investigated the relationship between wildfire, salvage logging, and occupancy of spotted owl territories at the Biscuit, Quartz, and Timbered Rock burns from 2003 to 2006. Extinction probabilities increased as the combined area of early seral forests, high severity burn, and salvage logging increased within the core nesting areas (β̌ = 1.88, 95% CI = 0.10-3.66). We were unable to identify any relationships between initial occupancy or colonization probabilities and the habitat covariates that we considered in our analysis where the β coefficient did not overlap zero. We concluded that site occupancy of spotted owl nesting territories declined in the short-term following wildfire, and habitat modification and loss due to past timber harvest, high severity fire, and salvage logging jointly contributed to declines in site occupancy. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.

ABSTRACT: Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) were investigated in tail feathers and soft tissues (liver, muscle, preen gland and adipose tissue) of barn owl (Tyto alba) road-kill victims (n = 15) collected in the province of Antwerp (Belgium). A major PFAS producing facility is located in the Antwerp area and levels of PFASs in biota from that region have been found to be very high in previous studies. We aimed to investigate for the first time the main sources of PFASs in feathers of a terrestrial bird species. Throughout this study, we have used statistical methods for left-censored data to cope with levels below the limit of detection (LOD), instead of traditional, potentially biased, substitution methods.Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was detected in all tissues (range: 11. ng/g ww in muscle-1208. ng/g ww in preen oil) and in tail feathers (< 2.2-56.6. ng/g ww). Perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) was measured at high levels in feathers (< 14-670. ng/g ww), but not in tissues (more than 50% < LOD). Perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) could only be quantified in liver and preen oil, while other PFASs were sporadically detected in liver. PFOS levels in feathers and liver were highly correlated (r=. 0.78, p< 0.01), in contrast to PFOA (r=. -0.11, p=. 0.78). Combined with high PFOA levels in feathers this suggests that PFOA may be present on the external surface of feathers, due to external contamination originating from the air in the vicinity of point sources. Therefore the possibility of using feathers as a passive air sampler for high PFOA levels should be investigated in the future. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Reviews of hatching asynchrony in birds recommended more studies on intraspecific variation in the extent of hatching asynchrony. We examined intraspecific variation in clutch size, laying chronology, onset of incubation, incubation period, and hatching asynchrony in burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia) in the Imperial Valley of California. Mean clutch size was 7.4 eggs and owls averaged 0.5 eggs laid per day. Females varied considerably in laying interval and onset of incubation (range = 1st to 9th egg in the clutch). The mean incubation period was 21.9 days. Hatching interval also varied greatly among females (x̄ = 0.8, range 0.1-2.0 days between successively hatched eggs). Past burrowing owl studies have largely overlooked the substantial intraspecific variation in these traits or have reported estimates that differ from ours. Future studies designed to identify the environmental factors that explain the large intraspecific variation in these traits will likely provide insights into the constraints on local abundance. © 2012 Japan Ethological Society and Springer.

ABSTRACT: Source-sink dynamics refer to systems with some units as sources of juveniles, and others as sinks. The same pattern can theoretically occur at a small spatial scale, within single populations. Under these circumstances, varying quality of breeding habitats/territories determines different levels of survival and/or reproduction, which in turn result in varying contributions of territories to the population dynamics. Territory occupancy has been proposed as an indirect measure of habitat quality. Here, we used territory occupancy and productivity from a long-termmonitoring of an Eagle Owl Bubo bubo population in NW Italy to (i) show how different contributions to population dynamicsmay characterize territories over limited geographical scale in a strongly territorial species, and (ii) investigate the potential use of territory occupancy as a proxy for habitat quality in this species. Three out of 10 territories appeared to producemost fledglings (potential sources), whereas the others were characterized by extremely low productivity (possible sinks). The overall productivity is likely to nearly balancemortality, but the general equilibriummasks complex variation in the contributions of territories to the population dynamic. Territory occupancywas affected by average productivity, and thus long-term occupancy could be used as a proxy for habitat quality. In long-lived and scarce territorial species, such as the Eagle Owl, preservation of suitable conditions at key territories can be crucial for the population survival.

ABSTRACT: Two Short-eared Owl, Asio flammeus, nests were discovered in the summer of 2000 along the Thomsen River in Aulavik National Park of Canada on Banks Island, Northwest Territories. One other sighting of a Short-eared Owl suggests the possibility of a third breeding pair. These nests are the first confirmed breeding evidence from islands in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago.

ABSTRACT: An adult male barred owl (Strix varia) was found unable to fly on a pasture during the day. On presentation, several lacerations were noted on the left wing. The animal was anesthetized for radiographic examination, which revealed mild swelling and irregularity of the soft tissues of the left wing. Over the plane of the syrinx and great vessels, ill-defined soft tissue opacity was present. The anesthetic recovery was unsuccessful, and the patient died. On gross necropsy, a 1 cm in diameter, round, soft, red-tan nodule, with scattered light tan to white foci was noticed between the right subclavian artery and the syrinx. The histopathology of this structure was characteristic of a thyroid follicular carcinoma. Neoplastic cells were immunoreactive to thyroglobulin and pancytokeratin proteins. A blood sample, taken antemortem, was analyzed for total and free thyroxine. Due to the lack of reference intervals for the current species, 4 blood samples from other barred owls were taken, 2 of which were clinically normal and 2 with an unhealthy status. The thyroid values were higher than the controls (total thyroxine by radioimmunoassay [μg/dl] 1.1 vs. <0.2, <0.2, 0.6, <0.2; free thyroxine by equilibrium dialysis [ng/dl] >10 vs. <0.3, <0.3, 2.1, <0.3). Although the other 4 birds are not intended to serve as a reference interval because of the low number and unhealthy status, findings are indicative of a productive thyroid follicular carcinoma. © 2012 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Background: The aim of this study was to identify the aerobic bacteria of the preputial and vaginal microbiota in owl monkeys that have been raised in captivity and to evaluate the antimicrobial susceptibility of these bacteria by gender and social organization. Methods: Thirty clinically healthy Aotus azarai infulatus were used. A total of 134 samples were collected, 60 from the preputial mucosa and 74 from the vaginal mucosa. An automated system of bacterial identification was used. Results and Conclusions: Staphylococcus intermedius and Proteus mirabilis were the microorganisms that were most frequently identified according to gender and social organization. The antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolated gram-positive bacteria was similar in both sexes. However, the gram-negative strains had some differences. The aerobic bacterial population of the vaginal and preputial microbiota is similar in owl monkeys, and there are no differences in the number and bacterial species according to sex and social organization. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

ABSTRACT: We describe a new species of masked-owl from the lower montane forest of Seram, one of the largest islands in the Moluccas of eastern Indonesia, for which we propose the name Tyto almae (Seram Masked-Owl), sp. nov. Molecular (mitochondrial cyt-b) differences show that Tyto sororcula of Buru and Tanimbar is closely related to T. novaehollandiae of Australia and New Guinea (∼1% uncorrected pairwise distance), and that Tyto almae of Seram differs by ∼3% (uncorrected pairwise distance) from both of them. These differences are further corroborated by morphology and colouration. Although a photograph from Seram published in 1987 had already established the presence of a Tyto owl on the island, ours represents the first specimen of this species. The bird was mist-netted in wet, mossy lower montane forest at an elevation of 1,350 m. No further observations of the owl were made during four weeks of fieldwork in Seram.

ABSTRACT: Land and resource managers often use detection-nondetection surveys to monitor the populations of species that may be affected by factors such as habitat alteration, climate change, and biological invasions. Relative to mark-recapture studies, using detection-nondetection surveys is more cost-effective, and recent advances in statistical analyses allow the incorporation of detection probability, covariates, and multiple seasons. We examined the efficacy of using detection-nondetection data (relative to mark-recapture data) for monitoring population trends of a territorial species, the California Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis). We estimated and compared the finite annual rates of population change (λt) and the resulting realized population change (Δt) from both occupancy and mark-recapture data collected over 18 years (1993-2010). We used multiseason, robust-design occupancy models to estimate that territory occupancy declined during our study (Δt = 0.702, 95% CI 0.552-0.852) due to increasing territory extinction rates (e{open}̂1993 = 0.019 [SE 0.012]; e{open}̂2009 = 0.134 [SE 0.043]) and decreasing colonization rates (γ̂1993 = 0.323 [SE 0.124]; γ̂2009 = 0.242 [SE 0.058]). We used Pradel's temporal-symmetry model for mark-recapture data to estimate that the population trajectory closely matched the trends in territory occupancy (Δt = 0.725, 95% CI 0.445-1.004). Individual survival was constant during our study (φ{symbol}̂1993 = 0.816 [SE 0.020]; φ{symbol}̂2009 = 0.815 [SE 0.019]), whereas recruitment declined slightly (f̂1993 = 0.195 [SE 0.032]; f̂2009 = 0.160 [SE 0.023]). Thus, we concluded that detection-nondetection data can provide reliable inferences on population trends, especially when funds preclude more intensive mark-recapture studies. © 2013 Society for Conservation Biology.

ABSTRACT: Tradeoffs among life-history traits have long provided material for evolutionary studies of life-history strategies but can also have practical implications for assessments of habitat and territory quality in species of conservation concern. Here, we characterize tradeoffs between parental reproductive output and offspring fitness in a closed population of California Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) using multistratum mark-recapture models and evaluate how potential tradeoffs influenced measures of territory quality. We detected heterogeneity in offspring survival associated with parental reproductive output; individuals that fledged in pairs had a greater probability of surviving than individuals that fledged either as singletons or in triplets, an advantage that was evident in juvenile, subadult, and adult life stages. Thus, the survivorship of offspring that fledged in pairs was high despite costs associated with producing a second fledgling, but the demands of producing a third fledgling came at a cost to offspring survival. Age of recruitment into the territorial population and the future reproductive output of offspring were not related to parental reproductive output in the year of birth. Indices of territory quality based on parental reproductive output were correlated with indices of territory quality based on offspring fitness despite the heterogeneity in offspring fitness associated with parental reproductive output. Our results suggest that ranking territories for conservation planning on the basis of parental reproductive output can be useful in territorial species, but the generality of this finding should be evaluated across a range of life histories.

ABSTRACT: Effects of suburban development (sprawl), concurrent climate and increasing avian food on a population of Eastern Screech-Owls (Megascops asio) were studied for three decades using nest boxes and natural tree-cavity nests in residential yards and adjoining natural forest in central Texas. The suburban climate was warmer by 5.7°C associated with suburbia's heat-island effect by the last decade of study. Nesting started earlier by an average of 4.5 days annually and fledgling productivity increased by 31.4%. Avian prey increased and contributed to 93% successful annual nests in a more stable population. Bird feeders and bird baths were likely enhancing factors at residences, where owls obtained prey and used bird-bath water for drinking and bathing. © 2012 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Several boreal taxa can be found in southern latitudes in fragments of high altitude alpine habitat. Some of these taxa have remained isolated from the main populations in northern latitudes as a result of the distribution changes during the last glaciations, being known as glacial relict populations. Such relict populations have often differentiated from the main population as a result of isolation and genetic drift. The Tengmalm's owl Aegolius funereus is a widespread boreal forest species distributed throughout boreal Eurasia and North America. The westernmost Eurasian breeding population is located in the Pyrenees Mountains, and was discovered less than 50 years ago. We studied the genetic structure of this Pyrenean population of Tengmalm's owl, and compared it with a northern latitude population from Fennoscandia. Despite being isolated by several hundred kilometres from the closest breeding grounds, we found no differences in the genetic structure of the mitochondrial DNA when compared with the central population. Our results suggest that this population has been recently, or still is connected with the main population.

ABSTRACT: The analysis of the pellets belonging to two sympatric owls (long-eared owl Asio otus and barn owl Tyto alba) from the Cefa Nature Park in the northwestern part of Romania) showed a clear predominance of small mammals, in diet of both species. A certain degree of specialization can be noted in the case of A. otus preying preferentially on Microtus arvalis. On the other hand, T. alba, consumes large quantities of common voles and constitutes only 31% of its total food source. Both species consume the occasional bird and represents less than 1% of its total prey. The standard Levins Index of the niche for T. alba (0.37) shows that the trophic niche-width is considerably larger in the case of A. otus (0.17). The barn owl subsists offof a much more diverse diet compared to the long-eared owl (16 vs 9 prey species). The two owl species live sympatricaly, using the same habitats, despite the existence of a considerable dietary overlap, but they avoid competing with each other by using different niches. © NwjZ, Oradea, Romania, 2013.

ABSTRACT: Population declines of farmland birds have been linked to the loss and fragmentation of grassland habitats resulting from changes in agricultural practices and urbanization. We investigated how changes to landscape attributes in the Fraser Valley, British Columbia, Canada, influenced the persistence and current occupancy by barn owls at roosting and nesting sites. There has been considerable development in the agricultural landscape of the Fraser Valley between the early 1990's and 2007/2008: grassland cover declined by 53%, the area of urban cover increased by 133%, length of secondary roads increased by 18%, and the volume of highway traffic increased by 33%. We also found that 30% of the sites used by barn owls in the early 1990s have been lost. Although the availability of grasslands are thought to influence the distribution of barn owls, in our study, barn owls were not more likely to persist at sites with little loss of grass cover, or to currently occupy sites surrounded by more grassland. The only variables that predicted the continued use and current occupancy of sites were traffic exposure and the length of highways. Barn owls were most likely to persist at sites with lower increases in traffic exposure and occupied sites containing fewer kilometers of highway within a 1-km radius. We conclude that the distribution of barn owls in the Fraser Valley is influenced by the loss of suitable roosting and nesting sites and location of highways. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Among the more than 40 genera of anthropoid primates (monkeys, apes, and humans), only the South American owl monkeys, genus Aotus, are nocturnal. However, the southernmostly distributed species, Aotus azarai azarai, of the Gran Chaco may show considerable amounts of its 24-h activity during bright daylight. Due to seasonal changes in the duration of photophase and climatic parameters in their subtropical habitat, the timing and pattern of their daily activity are expected to show significant seasonal variation. By quantitative long-term activity recordings with Actiwatch AW4 accelerometer data logger devices of 10 wild owl monkeys inhabiting a gallery forest in Formosa, Argentina, the authors analyzed the seasonal variation in the temporal niche and activity pattern resulting from entrainment and masking of the circadian activity rhythm by seasonally and diurnally varying environmental factors. The owl monkeys always displayed a distinct bimodal activity pattern, with prominent activity bouts and peaks during dusk and dawn. Their activity rhythm showed distinct lunar and seasonal variations in the timing and daily pattern. During the summer, the monkeys showed predominantly crepuscularnocturnal behavior, and a crepuscularcathemeral activity pattern with similar diurnal and nocturnal activity levels during the cold winter months. The peak times of the evening and morning activity bouts were more closely related to the times of sunset and sunrise, respectively, than activity-onset and -offset. Obviously, they were better circadian markers for the phase position of the entrained activity rhythm than activity-onset and -offset, which were subject to more masking effects of environmental andor internal factors. Total daily activity was lowest during the two coldest lunar months, and almost twice as high during the warmest months. Nighttime (21:0006:00h) and daytime (09:0018:00h) activity varied significantly across the year, but in an opposite manner. Highest nighttime activity occurred in summer and maximal daytime activity during the cold winter months. Dusk and dawn activity, which together accounted for 43 of the total daily activity, barely changed. The monkeys tended to terminate their nightly activity period earlier on warm and rainy days, whereas the daily amount of activity showed no significant correlation either with temperature or precipitation. These data are consistent with the dual-oscillator hypothesis of circadian regulation. They suggest the seasonal variations of the timing and pattern of daily activity in wild owl monkeys of the Argentinean Chaco result from a specific interplay of light entrainment of circadian rhythmicity and strong masking effects of various endogenous and environmental factors. Since the phase position of the monkeys' evening and morning activity peaks did not vary considerably over the year, the seasonal change from a crepuscularnocturnal activity pattern in summer to a more crepuscularcathemeral one in winter does not depend on a corresponding phase shift of the entrained circadian rhythm, but mainly on masking effects. Thermoregulatory and energetic demands and constraints seem to play a crucial role. © 2012 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Norman Wakefield wrote two papers published in The Victorian Naturalist in 1960 that examined four subfossil deposits from caves in the Buchan district, East Gippsland, Victoria. Wakefield suggested that Eastern Quolls Dasyurus viverrinus were responsible for their accumulation in two caves, M-27 and M-28 (cave tag numbers). There is, however, limited evidence to support Wakefield's conclusion. Instead, there is convincing evidence that the Sooty Owl Tyto tenebricosa was responsible. This is based on the structural integrity of the sub-fossil bones, apparent digestive erosion on bones (indicating partial digestion and regurgitation by owls), characteristics of the caves, location of sub-fossils, surrounding habitat, body size-range of mammals within the sub-fossil deposits and known feeding ecology of all owl species. This is an important finding because analysis of the prehistoric and contemporary Sooty Owl diet can provide valuable information for our understanding of the small mammal palaeocommunity, recent declines and mammal conservation.

ABSTRACT: Many animals have vocalizations that are individually distinguishable. Researchers can use these differences to facilitate monitoring of individuals. To be an effective monitoring tool, vocalizations must be recognizable throughout a season and preferably throughout an animal's lifetime. We assessed whether the territorial calls of Great Horned Owls (Bubo virginianus) are individually distinct, both within a season and over several years. Both males and females could be readily identified by their territorial calls. Based on a comparison of within-to between-individual coefficients of variation and a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), nearly all vocal characteristics we measured carried individually distinct information. Using forward stepwise discriminant function analysis (DFA), we found that the internote interval between the last short and first long note of the call was the most useful for identifying both individual males and females. The duration and minimum and maximum frequency of long notes were important for discriminating among individual males whereas the number of notes and total call duration were important characteristics for identifying individual females. Using cross-validation DFA, both male and female Great Horned Owls were accurately assigned to location both throughout a season and among years. Correct assignment of males was reduced across recording sessions and among years compared to within a recording session, but was still greater than expected by chance. Together, our results suggest that individually distinct vocalizations could be an effective tool for identification of Great Horned Owls for long-term monitoring. © 2013 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: To investigate the phylogenetic position of Blakiston's fish owl (Bubo blakistoni), we sequenced the mitochondrial (mt) DNA control region and cytochrome b (cyt b) for nine Bubo species. Maximum-likelihood analyses of combined control region and cyt b sequences, and cyt b sequences alone, showed that species formerly placed in genus Ketupa comprise a monophyletic group. Unexpectedly, we discovered a long cluster of 20-25 tandem repeat units 77 or 78. bp long in the third control region domain in four of the nine Bubo species for which the control region was sequenced (B. blakistoni, B. flavipes, and B. ketupu in the Ketupa clade; B. lacteus), leading to overall control region lengths of 3.0-3.8. kpb estimated from agarose gel electrophoresis. The control region in B. lacteus is the longest (3.8. kbp) reported to date in vertebrates. Sequencing of eight repeat units at each end of the cluster in 20 B. blakistoni individuals detected several types of repeat units 77 or 78. bp long, and six patterns in the order of unit types. The occurrence of a repeat cluster in all three species examined in the Ketupa clade suggests their common ancestor also had a cluster, whereas a maximum parsimony tree showed repeat-unit types grouping by species, rather than by paralog groups, suggesting independent origins of the clusters. We reconcile these results with a turnover model, in which the range in cluster-length variation and unit types at the 5' end are hypothetically functionally constrained by the protein-binding function of the control region, but otherwise there is a continual turnover of units in evolutionary time, with new unit types arising through mutations, proliferating by duplication of single and double repeat blocks, and being lost through deletion. Estimated free energies for reconstructed secondary structures of single and especially pairs of repeat units were higher than for homologous single-unit blocks in species lacking a repeat cluster, supporting slipped-strand mispairing as the mechanism of cluster turnover. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Survival rate is an essential component of population dynamics; therefore, identification of variation in mortality rates and the factors that influence them might be of key importance in understanding why populations increase or decrease. In Denmark, the Little Owl Athene noctua, a species strongly associated with anthropogenically modified landscapes, is declining fast and may soon face extinction. The population decline is ultimately associated with reduced survival of independent offspring, but reduced survival rates of adults may possibly contribute to the observed decline. To explore the causes of current survival rates, we estimated age- and season-specific survival rates and causes of mortality in Danish Little Owls on the basis of ringed birds 1920-2002, radio tagged adult and juveniles 2005-2008 and nest surveys 2006-2008. We estimate that 32 % of all eggs fledge and survive to 2 weeks post hatching (age of ringing) and 47 % of the nestlings from ringing to fledging. Fifty-five percentage of the radio-tracked fledged young survived to dispersal, i. e. a total survival rate from egg to dispersal of 8 %. Analyses of combined ringing and radio tracking data showed a lower survival rate in the 1st year of life and a much lower rate in the first 3 months of life. Furthermore, the analyses indicated that survival was lower in the winter months for ringing data during 1920-2002 but not for radio-tagged owls during 2005-2008 that experienced the highest mortality rates during the breeding season. In radio-tagged adults and fledged juveniles, accidents in buildings and other human infrastructures were responsible for two-thirds of all fatalities. Anthropogenic habitats currently comprise the nesting and roosting habitats for the last Danish Little Owls. The accidental deaths associated with these might to some extent be considered as a contributing factor to the present negative population growth rate of this population. © 2012 Dt.

ABSTRACT: Differential migration of the sexes is known in over 60 bird species and may be the predominant pattern in migratory birds, identifying the causes of differential migration has been difficult, in part because sex-specific migratory patterns have yet to be described for a majority of species. We used the Internet specimen-data portal Ornis to compile sex-specific data on the seasonal distribution of the Short-eared Owl (Asio flammeus), a species that cannot be reliably sexed by external characteristics. We found 1188 specimen records from North America with data on sex, locality, and date of collection. Although the winter distributions of males and females overlapped almost entirely, the mean latitude of females was significantly lower than that of males for the months of November to March. The magnitude of the difference averaged 3.1° between December and February but increased to a peak of 6.0° in March, reflecting earlier onset of spring migration in males. The pattern of differential migration in the Short-eared Owl is compatible with the widely accepted hypothesis that males winter closer to breeding areas because they gain a reproductive advantage from early arrival and establishment of breeding territories (arrival-time hypothesis). Female specimens predominate during late fall and winter and male specimens predominate during the nesting season, suggesting differential seasonal mortality by sex. The skewed sex ratio suggests that differential migration may be caused in part by intrinsic sex differences in foraging efficiency, cold tolerance, or dominance. Comparisons with other raptors reveal that patterns of differential migration are highly species-specific. We conclude, conservatively, that the longer distance female Short-eared Owls migrate is the result of each sex optimizing its migration strategy in light of the higher likelihood of fall and winter mortality of females and the reproductive benefits to males of early arrival on breeding territories.

ABSTRACT: Searching for a suitable breeding site is an important decision in the life of most animals. The decisions where to settle and how far to travel before doing so depend on many factors. Individual differences in dispersal distance could result from different strategies (e.g. specialists versus generalists), which might result in similar reproductive success in different habitats, or different competitive abilities to acquire a territory close to the natal site. The barn owl is polymorphic in melanic coloration, which is associated with many physiological and behavioural traits such as habitat choice, stress response and docility, raising the possibility that the coloration is also related to dispersal. We studied natal dispersal (from rearing site to site of first breeding attempt) and breeding dispersal (from one breeding site to the next) in barn owls using a long-term data set. Darker reddish individuals moved further than paler individuals during natal dispersal, but not during breeding dispersal. A cross-fostering experiment showed that the colour of the biological and foster parents had no influence on dispersal distance. The distance dispersed by parents and same-sex offspring was correlated, whereas natal and breeding dispersal were not repeatable within individuals, indicating that they are two different processes. Given that the distance travelled in natal dispersal appears to be heritable, the underlying genes might be coupled to those related to coloration. We discuss hypotheses to explain the potential adaptive function of the link between coloration and natal dispersal. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: Echoes and sounds of independent origin often obscure sounds of interest, but echoes can go undetected under natural listening conditions, a perception called the precedence effect. How does the auditory system distinguish between echoes and independent sources? To investigate, we presented two broadband noises to barn owls (Tyto alba) while varying the similarity of the sounds' envelopes. The carriers of the noises were identical except for a 2- or 3-ms delay. Their onsets and offsets were also synchronized. In owls, sound localization is guided by neural activity on a topographic map of auditory space. When there are two sources concomitantly emitting sounds with overlapping amplitude spectra, space map neurons discharge when the stimulus in their receptive field is louder than the one outside it and when the averaged amplitudes of both sounds are rising. A model incorporating these features calculated the strengths of the two sources' representations on the map (B. S. Nelson and T. T. Takahashi; Neuron 67: 643-655, 2010). The target localized by the owls could be predicted from the model's output. The model also explained why the echo is not localized at short delays: when envelopes are similar, peaks in the leading sound mask corresponding peaks in the echo, weakening the echo's space map representation. When the envelopes are dissimilar, there are few or no corresponding peaks, and the owl localizes whichever source is predicted by the model to be less masked. Thus the precedence effect in the owl is a by-product of a mechanism for representing multiple sound sources on its map. © 2013 the American Physiological Society.

ABSTRACT: Owls use interaural time differences (ITDs) to locate a sound source. They compute ITD in a specialized neural circuit that consists of axonal delay lines from the cochlear nucleus magnocellularis (NM) and coincidence detectors in the nucleus laminaris (NL). Recent physiological recordings have shown that tonal stimuli induce oscillatory membrane potentials in NL neurons (Funabiki K, Ashida G, Konishi M. J Neurosci 31: 15245-15256, 2011). The amplitude of these oscillations varies with ITD and is strongly correlated to the firing rate. The oscillation, termed the sound analog potential, has the same frequency as the stimulus tone and is presumed to originate from phase-locked synaptic inputs from NM fibers. To investigate how these oscillatory membrane potentials are generated, we applied recently developed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) analysis techniques (Kuokkanen PT, Wagner H, Ashida G, Carr CE, Kempter R. J Neurophysiol 104: 2274-2290, 2010) to the intracellular waveforms obtained in vivo. Our theoretical prediction of the band-limited SNRs agreed with experimental data for mid- to high-frequency (>2 kHz) NL neurons. For low-frequency (≤2 kHz) NL neurons, however, measured SNRs were lower than theoretical predictions. These results suggest that the number of independent NM fibers converging onto each NL neuron and/or the population-averaged degree of phase-locking of the NM fibers could be significantly smaller in the low-frequency NL region than estimated for higher best-frequency NL. © 2012 the American Physiological Society.

ABSTRACT: The short-eared owl is a regular migrant and hibernant in the Záhorie region (SW Slovakia), though this species mostly escapes attention. In 1998 the species was found nesting in this region, and in 2012 individuals showing territorial behaviour were regularly observed, with high probability of nesting. Nesting habitats were localities with a high representation of meadows, corresponding to the preferred nesting sites in Slovakia. The foraging range of wintering birds was comparable with those from neighbouring regions (W Slovakia, Hungary), but with a higher number of harvest mice Micromys minutus and long-tailed field mice Apodemus sylvaticus. In both years when the nesting of birds was recorded, snowfall was significantly lower. Food sources were not monitored at these localities. © 2013 Raptor Protection of Slovakia (RPS).

ABSTRACT: The correlated discharges of cortical neurons in primary somatosensory cortex are a potential source of information about somatosensory stimuli. One aspect of neuronal correlations that has not been well studied is how the spatiotemporal properties of tactile stimuli affect the presence and magnitude of correlations. We presented single- and dual-point stimuli with varying spatiotemporal relationships to the hands of three anesthetized owl monkeys and recorded neuronal activity from 100-electrode arrays implanted in primary somatosensory cortex. Correlation magnitudes derived from joint peristimulus time histogram (JPSTH) analysis of single neuron pairs were used to determine the level of spike timing correlations under selected spatiotemporal stimulus conditions. Correlated activities between neuron pairs were commonly observed, and the proportions of correlated pairs tended to decrease with distance between the recorded neurons. Distance between stimulus sites also affected correlations. When stimuli were presented simultaneously at two sites, ~37% of the recorded neuron pairs showed significant correlations when adjacent phalanges were stimulated, and ~21% of the pairs were significantly correlated when nonadjacent digits were stimulated. Spatial proximity of paired stimuli also increased the average correlation magnitude. Stimulus onset asynchronies in the paired stimuli had small effects on the correlation magnitude. These results show that correlated discharges between neurons at the first level of cortical processing provide information about the relative locations of two stimuli on the hand. © 2012 the American Physiological Society.

ABSTRACT: Optical waveguide lightmode spectroscopy (OWLS) is usually applied as a biosensor system to the sorption-desorption of proteins to waveguide surfaces. Here, we show that OWLS can be used to monitor the quality of oxide thin film materials and of coatings of pulsed laser deposition synthesized CdSe quantum dots (QDs) intended for solar energy applications. In addition to changes in data treatment and experimental procedure, oxide- or QD-coated waveguide sensors must be synthesized. We synthesized zinc stannate (Zn2SnO4) coated (Si,Ti)O2 waveguide sensors, and used OWLS to monitor the relative mass of the film over time. Films lost mass over time, though at different rates due to variation in fluid flow and its physical effect on removal of film material. The Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) technique was used to deposit CdSe QD coatings on waveguides. Sensors exposed to pH 2 solution lost mass over time in an expected, roughly exponential manner. Sensors at pH 10, in contrast, were stable over time. Results were confirmed with atomic force microscopy imaging. Limiting factors in the use of OWLS in this manner include limitations on the annealing temperature that maybe used to synthesize the oxide film, and limitations on the thickness of the film to be studied. Nevertheless, the technique overcomes a number of difficulties in monitoring the quality of thin films in-situ in liquid environments. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: Numbers of Boreal Owls (Aegolius funereus) breeding in nest boxes in northern Sweden have declined since the 1980s. The main cause of this decline is thought to be a similar decline in voles, the owls' main prey. However, an alternative reason for the decline might be the aging of nest boxes and the owls' avoidance of old nest boxes to reduce the risk of predation. In this study we tested this alternative hypothesis in an experiment during the first two years of a 3-yr vole cycle by comparing predation and the number of breeding owls in old and new nest boxes at their original location, and old and new nest boxes placed at new locations. Predation was lower at relocated nest boxes, but Boreal Owls showed no preference for any of the four nest-box treatments, and breeding parameters did not vary between treatments. We conclude that the decline in the number of Boreal Owls breeding in nest boxes is real, and not caused by aging of nest boxes. © 2013 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: About 600 burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia) are killed annually at wind turbines in the Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area (APWRA), California, USA. Understanding the biological significance of this toll requires population data, including an estimate of the number of breeding pairs in the APWRA. An empirical model of breeding density predicted 35-75 pairs within the 16,760 ha of the APWRA, but that prediction proved low in spring 2011, when we detected 78 breeding pairs of burrowing owls in 46 randomly selected plots totaling 2,563 ha. We estimated that 3.201 breeding pairs/km2 occupied the 46 plots we surveyed in April-May. Extrapolating this density to the area of the APWRA led to an estimate of 537 pairs (90% CI=320-753 pairs) across the APWRA, or 10x the model prediction. Counts of chicks emerged from burrows averaged 1.2 chicks/nest on the 46 plots, but these counts were minimum numbers. We estimated the APWRA supported at least 1,836 burrowing owls in 2011 (90% CI=1,082-2,590), indicating the local population could conceivably be the sole source of fatalities attributed to wind turbines in the APWRA. Measures to conserve burrowing owls in the APWRA could include ground squirrel conservation and repowering to safer wind turbine models and careful siting to avoid areas densely populated with burrowing owls. More generally, management decisions based on comparisons of breeding-pair density should also consider whether the density estimates were made in habitat fragments, sites selected for known high density, or in randomly or systematically selected plots sampling large areas, because the type of study area strongly influences the density estimate. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.

ABSTRACT: Semantic models are very important in many applications for describing relationships between concepts or entities. In the geospatial domain, geospatial semantic is the mapping relationship between the description of geospatial data and entities of reality world. The formal description of ontology is fundamental to data exchange standards. Geographical ontology defines the important geographical concepts in the geospatial domain. Ontology semantic modeling is more similar with geographical cognitive modeling. This paper proposed the OWL-based semantic model for spatio-temporal geographic ontology. The semantic model based on the methodology of ontology not only depicts the inner change detail of event and the relationships between events, but also describes the implicit semantic reasoning. Moreover the paper uses the Protégé v3.3.1, which was developed by Stanford Medical Informatics and was based on OWL, to construct the ontology semantic model. And then the subsumption checking and consistency maintenance of the model is reasoned using Racer software and the model is optimized gradually. © 2012 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: We assembled Short-eared Owl (Asio flammeus) abundance data from Buena Vista Grassland, Wisconsin, for the period 1955-2011, primarily from the Hamerstrom (1955-94) and Swengel (1997-2011) research teams. We also gathered owl breeding-season observation data from the Wisconsin state ornithology journal (Passenger Pigeon). We tabulated the number of owl breeding areas based on adult territoriality, nests, and family groups, and classified each year's breeding season by abundance categories. Summer detections and evidence of breeding for Short-eared Owls at Buena Vista varied greatly among years in both the Hamerstrom and Swengel datasets. Peak owl years occurred rarely and unpredictably. During the 57 yr of this study we report three very high peak years of owl abundance (1970, 1974, 2000), three high years (2001, 2006, 2009), 11 mid-range years, 13 low years, 14 no-owl years, and 13 years with missing data inferred from corroborative analysis to be low or no-owl years. The data did not reveal a strong cyclical pattern in owl abundance or suggest a directed population trend. We extracted vole (Microtus) abundance data for 1964-83 from the Hamerstrom dataset. All pairwise correlations of owl abundance (abundance categories, number of breeding areas) and vole abundance (ranking, abundance categories) were strongly and positively significant. © 2013 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Buff-fronted Owl Aegolius harrisii is a poorly known species. Field records are rare and sparse, with large gaps throughout its distribution. We present five new records of A. harrisii in south-east Brazil, in the states of São Paulo and Minas Gerais, and the second ever nest description. In São Paulo, records from Franca are >300 km from previous records, while the new record in Minas Gerais is 600 km from the only previous state record. More nocturnal field work is required to better evaluate the true distribution of A. harrisii. © 2012 British Ornithologists' Club.

ABSTRACT: The Collared Scops Owl (Otus bakkamoena) is not sexually dimorphic, which makes it difficult to discriminate between sexes. Hence, it is difficult to establish a breeding and conservation program. This study report, the identification of a novel random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) marker for sexing the species O. bakkamoena. A novel 1,307-bp sex-specific fragment, AN15, in females was initially generated by RAPD fingerprinting using the primer OPAN15. We then designed the nested primer set, CsoAN15-6F/R, and amplified a sex-specific fragment of 349 bp in females, as well as a 796-bp fragment shared by both sexes. The latter fragment can serve as an internal control for monitoring both the PCR reaction and preventing false sex assignment. Our current study accurately identified the sex of each individual (including 8 males and 8 females) using this primer set. This novel primer set, thus, provides a sex-specific DNA marker for accurate sex identification in this species. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

ABSTRACT: 10.1080/03014223.2011.627565 A large sample of bones representing prey remains of barn owls (Tyto alba) was collected from the surface of the floor of a cave on Toga Island, Torres Islands, a remote island of northern Vanuatu. These remains allowed us to obtain a first overview of the prey of barn owls on that island, knowing that elsewhere mammals constitute the major prey group. The dominant prey species were banded geckos (Gekko vittatus-47% of prey individuals found in our bone sample) followed by rats (Rattus spp.-35%). Also present were lesser numbers of other gecko species (Gehyra oceanica, Nactus multicarinatus), skinks (Emoia spp.), birds, and bats. Data show that nocturnal birds of prey remain important predators of large geckos on Toga Island. This finding contradicts interpretations of other late historical (following human colonisation), non-cultural bone assemblages from barn owls from other Pacific islands, where rats have replaced geckos as primary prey. The same situation as reported on Toga Island occurs in other places like the Canary Islands where barn owls also prey predominantly on an endemic gecko species. These observations suggest that the barn owl is an opportunistic predator taking whatever prey is available. The unanswered question is why geckos are the most frequent prey of barn owls on some islands and not on others. ©2012 The Royal Society of New Zealand.

ABSTRACT: The small mammal composition in the diet of barn owls from the Drinos River valley, southern Albania, was studied over the period of 1 year (September 2010-September 2011). A total of 662 pellets was collected and analyzed, and 1951 prey items were identified. Fourteen different small mammal species were identified (5 insectivores and 9 rodents), among which Microtus thomasi (frequency, F = 32.9%; biomass, B = 45.5%), Crocidura suaveolens (F = 23.5%; B = 9.4%), and Mus macedonicus (F = 17.8%; B = 16.3%) were the most abundant. In winter, Rattus rattus increased significantly in the consumed prey biomass (18.1%), while in spring Apodemus sylvaticus (9.4%) ranked third most common among the prey species. Neomys anomalus was more frequent in the diet in autumn and winter than in spring and summer. Suncus etruscus had low percentages in the barn owl diet, but was preyed upon during all seasons, confirming the presence of the species in the Drinos valley. Significant seasonal variations in small mammals in the diet of the barn owl were detected. Environmental index (i/r) values indicate that the Drinos valley is mainly an agrocenosis of nonintensive land-use practices. © TÜBİTAK.

ABSTRACT: Capsule The total area encapsulated by the hunting ranges of breeding Short-eared Owls Asio flammeus was broadly similar between day and night and also through the season, but activity was concentrated more on lower altitude graminoid-dominated areas during daylight and early in the breeding season. Aims To assess the representativeness of diurnal observations alone for determining ranging behaviour and habitat-use of breeding Short-eared Owls. Methods The diurnal and nocturnal ranging behaviours of four radiotagged Short-eared Owls were compared. Further diurnal field observations were used to assess the representativeness of the behaviour of the radiotagged birds. Results Short-eared Owls tended to hunt more over higher ground (where there was a greater ericaceous component within the moorland vegetation) at night and also later in the breeding season; the area of the total hunting range remained similar through the season (mean about 200 ha). Nocturnal activity rates closely matched those during peak diurnal activity periods. Conclusion Diurnal observations of breeding Short-eared Owls could provide representative data to inform breeding population densities and distribution but they may not be representative of overall habitat-use or ranging behaviour within home-ranges. Assessments of the risks to breeding Short-eared Owls of developments on moorland (e.g. forestry, wind turbine construction, grazing changes) based on diurnal observations alone may not reflect the true scale of potential impacts, which would also need to consider nocturnal behaviour. © 2013 British Trust for Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: We report an observation of a Powerful Owl Ninox strenua preying on an almost fully-grown Australian Brush-turkey Alectura lathami in Pymble, a northern suburb of Sydney, NSW. This adds to the few observations of Powerful Owls preying on large birds, as this prey species weighed at least 103% of the Owl's body weight. Australian Brush-turkeys have only recently moved into Sydney's suburbs, and this observation shows that Powerful Owls can shift their choice of prey to the species present at a given location.

ABSTRACT: During reproduction, birds are confronted with two requirements: building up their energetic reserves during the activity period, and provisioning the nest. Storing reserves imposes a higher flight cost and a lower hunting efficiency. This conflict is accentuated in species such as the Barn Owl (Tyto alba), where the nest food supply is entirely taken in charge by the male during a long period (ca. 37 days). We tested the prediction that Barn Owl males were postponing their meal to the end of the night in order to fly with a low body mass. Nocturnal changes in body mass (i.e., estimates of feeding events) were monitored remotely on six free-ranging Barn Owl pairs nesting in eastern France using an automated weighing system. Male Barn Owls were gaining the more weight at the end of the night, supporting the prediction that they make their biggest meal after the nest provisioning activities hunting period that is taking place at the beginning of the night. © 2013 Dt.

ABSTRACT: Variation in melanin coloration is widespread and often associated with other phenotypic traits. A recent study showed that darker-reddish pheomelanic Barn Owls (Tyto alba) move longer distances between birth and breeding sites. Because this study considered only individuals recovered within a limited study area, it remains unclear whether the association between melanism and dispersal applies to a larger geographic scale. I analysed an independent dataset of birds ringed in the same study area but recovered dead along roads within and outside this area. As expected, dark pheomelanic owls dispersed further than lighter reddish conspecifics at a larger spatial scale. © 2013 Dt. Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.

ABSTRACT: The USDA Forest Service has adopted a management strategy for the California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) in the Sierra Nevada that relies on protecting habitat (Protected Activity Centers [PAC]) around suspected owl territory centers. We discuss the history of the PAC concept and evaluate its efficacy by comparing owl core areas of use, derived from usage distributions based on long-term location data of territorial owls, with their associated PACs. The average size of core areas used by spotted owls (334.7 ac; SE = 40.2; N = 29; 95% usage distribution for roost and nest locations) was similar to the average PAC size (287.5 ac; SE = 4.3; N = 29; t = 1.16; P < 0.25; 28 df). The 50 and 90% usage distributions for owl use area were smaller than their corresponding PACs (t = 38.88, P < 0.0001, and 28 df; t = 2.31, P < 0.03, and 28 df, respectively). The spatial overlap between owl core areas of use and PACs was also high. The average proportions of each core area that coincided with a PAC area was 0.84, 0.70, and 0.61 for the 50, 90, and 95% usage distributions, respectively. Moreover, there were more owl locations found inside (x = 36.0; range, 8 -76; SE = 2.96) than outside (x = 6.9; range, 0 -26; SE = 1.03) of PACs (t = 9.289; P < 0.0001; 68 df). We concluded that PACs, even though derived through an ad hoc but reasoned method, appear to be a key element for conservation of California spotted owls because owls have used these areas over long periods of time (up to 24 years). We also suggest that location data collected during long-term monitoring programs may be useful for identifying core areas for habitat protection not only for spotted owls but also for other species. © 2012 Society of American Foresters.

ABSTRACT: The Snowy Owl needs little introduction. This massive white owl breeds throughout the Arctic, wherever there are voles or lemmings to hunt, from Scandinavia through northern Russia to Canada and Greenland. Southerly movements in winter see North American birds travel as far south as the northern United States, while infrequent vagrants on the Shetlands and other northern isles are a magnet for birders. The Snowy Owl gives this popular bird the full Poyser treatment, with sections on morphology, distribution, palaeontology and evolution, habitat, breeding, diet, population dynamics, movements, interspecific relationships and conservation, supported by some fabulous photography. The award winning author team also had access to Russian research literature, which is generally out of reach for Western scientists. © 2012 text by Eugene Potapov and Richard Sale.

ABSTRACT: Abundance/biomass comparisons (or ABC curves) allow to obtain information on the level of (anthropogenic or natural) disturbance that may sensu lato affect specific communities. In order to verify the general validity of the ABC curves, we applied these comparisons to a small mammal dataset obtained by a sample of Barn owl (Tyto alba) pellets collected in a nature reserve of central Italy (Monte Soratte). From 43 pellets, we obtained 111 individuals belonging to 11 shrews and rodents species. Microtus savii, Apodemus sylvaticus, and Apodemus flavicollis were the species most frequently preyed upon by owls. Indices such as absolute (and normalized) species richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity consistently showed higher values than those obtained in similar studies in central Italy, highlighting the complex structure of this assemblage occurring in a landscape with low anthropization. From ABC curves, abundance was slightly lower than biomass, even though differences between paired cumulative frequencies were not significant. This pattern suggests that the small mammal community in our study area features a low level of disturbance. Nevertheless, whereas in undisturbed assemblages a higher biomass in ABC curves indicate a higher frequency of larger species at higher trophic level, in small mammal assemblages such as those revealed by owl pellets, large-sized species are herbivorous, synanthropic and typical of disturbed habitats. Accordingly, we caution that in disturbed habitats an increase of small mammals with high body mass may results in ABC curves with biomass higher than abundance. Our results therefore suggest that there might be relevant exceptions to the general patterns so far developed for ABC curves. © 2012 © Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei.

ABSTRACT: Context Predictive modelling of the impacts of climate change has highlighted a need for on-ground monitoring of mammal communities within the Wet Tropics bioregion of Queensland to inform wildlife conservation management. Standard mammal-survey techniques are labour intensive and often incapable of detecting rare, trap-shy or otherwise elusive species, effectively rendering them invisible to researchers even when substantial resources are applied. Aims To assess the utility of feeding remains (regurgitated pellets) from lesser sooty owls, Tyto tenebricosa multipunctata, for monitoring populations of small to medium-sized mammals within the Wet Tropics. Methods Three female lesser sooty owls were radio-tracked to determine home-range areas. Radio-tracking and targeted systematic searches were used to locate diurnal roosts containing owl pellets from which prey species were identified. Owl-pellet data were directly compared with live-trap data within three putative owl home ranges. Additionally, analyses of a dataset spanning more than 15 years demonstrated the utility of owl-pellet data for monitoring mammal communities. Key results Owl-pellet surveys yielded 14 mammal species (840 individuals) from 152 man-hours, compared with six mammal species (361 individuals) from 194 man-hours of live trapping. Both survey methods identified Rattus fuscipes, Melomys spp. and Antechinus spp. as the most abundant species but live-trap data were found to under-represent relative abundance of Melomys spp. and over-represent relative abundance of R. fuscipes in comparison to owl-pellet data. Conclusions Analysis of lesser sooty owl pellets is a particularly useful method for compilation of species inventories of small to medium-sized mammals, being more effective than standard live-trapping surveys within the rainforests of the Wet Tropics. Implications Owl-pellet analysis is well suited for monitoring mammal communities, as long as periodic data are collected from the same roost(s) and the pellets have been deposited by the same individual bird(s). Additional research relating to variability in behavioural traits between individual lesser sooty owls that have potential to confound results via sampling bias must be undertaken before owl-pellet data can be used for comparison of mammal community structure among sites, or for monitoring a site over a period spanning a change in the individual owls that are depositing pellets at that site.

ABSTRACT: Many bird species do not make their own nests; therefore, selection of existing sites that provide adequate microclimates is critical. This is particularly true for owls in north temperate climates that often nest early in the year when inclement weather is common. Spotted owls use three main types of nest structures, each of which are structurally distinct and may provide varying levels of protection to the eggs or young. We tested the hypothesis that spotted owl nest configuration influences nest microclimate using both experimental and observational data. We used a wind tunnel to estimate the convective heat transfer coefficient (hc) of eggs in 25 potential nest configurations that mimicked 2 nest types (top-cavity and platform nests), at 3 different wind speeds. We then used the estimates of hc in a biophysical heat transfer model to estimate how long it would take unattended eggs to cool from incubation temperature (~36°C) to physiological zero temperature (PZT; ~26°C) under natural environmental conditions. Our results indicated that the structural configuration of nests influences the cooling time of the eggs inside those nests, and hence, influences the nest microclimate. Estimates of time to PZT ranged from 10.6 minutes to 33.3 minutes. Nest configurations that were most similar to platform nests always had the fastest egg cooling times, suggesting that platform nests were the least protective of those nests we tested. Our field data coupled with our experimental results suggested that nest choice is important for the reproductive success of owls during years of inclement weather or in regions characterized by inclement weather during the nesting season.

ABSTRACT: We examined the temporal, spatial, and demographic factors that influenced roadway mortality of barn owls (Tyto alba) along a 248-km stretch of Interstate 84 in southern Idaho using systematic road surveys. Counts of dead animals from surveys can be underestimated because of sampling biases; therefore, we also conducted experiments to assess the effects of search and removal bias on the estimates of roadway mortality of owls. We conducted surveys every 2 weeks over a 2-year period and detected 812 dead barn owls (unadjusted mortality rate of 1.64owls/km/yr). After adjusting this estimate for search and removal bias, we documented mortality rates of up to 5.99owls/km/year. Owl mortality was not random in relation to sex, age class, or location along the highway. Females and juveniles, which represent individuals more likely to disperse long distances, were killed more frequently than males and adults. During the nonbreeding season, owls were killed more often near agricultural lands than in shrub-steppe, but this pattern was not apparent during the breeding season. Owls were also killed more often on portions of the roadway closer to the Snake River canyon, perhaps because of the availability of nest and roost sites. Mortality rates differed markedly between the 2 years of study, which could have been related to variability in weather and its subsequent effect on owl productivity. Our data suggest that barn owls in this region may not persist under this level of mortality without significant immigration or management. Thus, roadway management to reduce or prevent owl use of roadways, reduce rodent populations near major roads, alert motorists to the presence of owls, or otherwise reduce the chances that vehicles and owls collide would improve barn owl survival and population persistence. © 2012 The Wildlife Society.

ABSTRACT: We investigated phylogenetic relationships among Otus scops owls from Socotra Island, the Arabian Peninsula and East Africa using molecular, vocalization and biometric data. The Socotra Scops Owl Otus senegalensis socotranus, currently treated as a subspecies of the African Scops Owl Otus senegalensis, is more closely related to the Oriental Scops Owl Otus sunia and to the endemic Seychelles Scops Owl Otus insularis. Considerable mitochondrial genetic distance and significant morphological differentiation from its two closest relatives, as well as its distinctive vocalizations compared with O. insularis, strongly support recognition of Socotra Scops Owl as a full species. Unexpectedly, two taxa from the Arabian Peninsula, Pallid Scops Owl Otus brucei and African Scops Owl Otus senegalensis pamelae, represent very distinct lineages; O. brucei is basal to a clade that includes taxa found in the Indo-Malayan region and on Indian Ocean islands. In contrast, O. s. pamelae occupies a well-supported basal position within a clade of continental Afro-Palaearctic taxa. The uncorrected-p genetic distance between O. s. pamelae and its closest relatives (other populations of senegalensis from mainland Africa) is c. 4%. As O. s. pamelae is also well differentiated phylogenetically, morphologically and vocally from O. s. senegalensis, we recommend its elevation to species status, as Otus pamelae. Among mainland African O. senegalensis subspecies, Ethiopian populations appear to represent the most divergent lineage, whereas other lineages from Somalia, Kenya and South Africa are poorly differentiated. The large genetic distance between the Ethiopian haplotype and other African haplotypes (3.2%) suggests that the Ethiopian Otus may represent a cryptic taxon, and we recommend that more individuals be sampled to assess the taxonomic status of this population. © 2013 British Ornithologists' Union.

ABSTRACT: Diet variation of the long-eared owl (Asio otus Linnaeus, 1758) was investigated on the basis of pellets collected in winter season 2007/2008 from a communal roosting site in a municipal cemetery in Rzeszów (a city in south-eastern Poland). We assumed that the proximity of human settlements would affect the diet composition of this predator, resulting in a higher proportion of species associated with urban habitats. Although voles, especially the common vole Microtus arvalis, were still the most important prey, mice constituted approximately 17% of all prey items, with the field mouse Apodemus agrarius being most frequent. Food niche breadth was wider in December than in March. Our results suggest that owls from Rzeszów hunt mostly in open habitats surrounding the city, where they can still capture their basic prey species. Yet, they can broaden their diet with species of murids associated with the mosaic urban and suburban habitats.

ABSTRACT: The Long-eared Owl (Asio otus) is a widely distributed predator with plastic foraging habits. Its diet has been studied across most of Europe and North America, but little information is available on intra-seasonal diet variation. We studied the winter diet of Long-eared Owls in a Mediterranean fragmented farmland. Diet was dominated by small mammals (mostly Apodemus spp.), with birds the second most abundant group. In our landscape, the amount of bird prey items in the diet was higher compared to values reported from other areas of Italy. There was relatively large variation in the diet among the three months of study. Our study confirms the pattern of higher Long-eared Owl diet diversity in a Mediterranean landscape compared to that reported for other regions of Europe where the diversity of prey species may be lower. The findings suggest that extensively-managed Mediterranean rural landscapes can provide habitat suitable for the Long-eared Owl, as they offer a wide diversity of food sources that may be exploited by this nocturnal predator. © 2013 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: This case report describes suspected electrocution in a juvenile female Great Horned owl (Bubo virginianus) with subsequent bilateral cataract formation. The bird flew into a high-voltage power line and was immediately rescued. Burn wounds of the head and ataxia with apparent blindness were noted. Initial ophthalmic examination 5days after the incident revealed bilaterally symmetrical anterior subcapsular vacuolar cataracts with absence of intraocular inflammation and a predominantly clear view to the normal appearing fundus. The bird appeared to be nonvisual. No ophthalmic medications were prescribed at initial examination. Subsequent recheck examination at 8weeks revealed moderate resolution of the cataracts and improved vision. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first published report of suspected electric cataracts in an avian species. © 2012 American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists.

ABSTRACT: Little empirical evidence has ever been presented to justify the taxonomie ranking of Koepcke's Screech Owl Megascops koqjckeae. We summarise current knowledge of its distribution and ecology, and provide detailed information concerning its distinctive vocalisations. There is no evidence to support its asserted occurrence in Bolivia, but two distinctive populations can be recognised in Peru. A new subspecies is described here from the rainshadow valleys of south-central Peru. © 2012 British Ornithologists' Club.

ABSTRACT: Avian blood parasites have been intensively studied using morphological methods with limited information on their host specificity and species taxonomic status. Now the analysis of gene sequences, especially the mitochondrial cytochrome b (mt-cytb) gene of the avian haemosporidian species of Plasmodium, Haemoproteus, Fallisia and Leucocytozoon, offers a new tool to review the parasite specificity and status. The material of this study was a Tawny Owl (Strix aluco) which brought to an animal hospital with broken wings in Mugla province. Meanwhile blood smears were prepared from peripheral blood sample which was taken from the wing vein. Blood sample for genetic analyses was obtained by brachial venipuncture and genomic DNA extraction was conducted. The extracted genomic DNA was analyzed by Nested Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for the amplification of partial avian haemosporidian mt-cytb gene. The final PCR product was gel purified and sequenced. The obtained isolate was deposited in GenBank International Nucleotide Sequence Database with the accession number JQ768232. Intraerytrocytic stages of Haemoproteus sp. were detected in the examination of the blood smears. The phylogenetic analyses of the amplified sequence confirmed that the owl was infected with Haemoproteus sp. According to the phylogenetic comparisons the Haemoproteus lineage showed the highest identity (99.8%) with the "H-STAL2" lineage isolated from an owl (Strix aluco) in Germany among the Haemoproteus lineages available in GenBank. In conclusion, this study reports the first microscopic and molecular detection of Haemoproteus infection in an owl in Turkey. The lineage characteristics and phylogenetic relationships among several Haemoproteus lineages were also evaluated in this study.

ABSTRACT: Northern spotted owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) have received intense research and management interest since their listing as a threatened species by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in 1990. For example, public and private forest managers in the Pacific Northwest, USA, conduct surveys to determine presence or absence of spotted owls prior to timber harvest operations. However, although recently developed statistical methods have been applied to presence-absence data collected during research surveys, the effectiveness of operational surveys for detecting spotted owls and evaluating site occupancy dynamics is not known. We used spotted owl survey data collected from 1995 to 2009 on a study area in interior northern California, USA, to evaluate competing occupancy models from Program PRESENCE using Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC). During 1,282 individual surveys, we recorded 480 spotted owl detections (37.4%) and 13 barred owl (1.0%) detections. Average per visit detection probability (85% CL) for single and paired spotted owls was 0.93 (0.90-0.96) for informed daytime, stand-based searches and 0.47 (0.43-0.51) for nighttime, station-based surveys (estimated from the best model); the average per visit detection probability from the null model was 0.67 (0.64-0.70). Average pair-only detection probabilities were 0.86 (0.81-0.90) for informed daytime, stand-based searches and 0.23 (0.18-0.29) for nighttime, station-based surveys; the average per visit detection probability from the null model was 0.63 (0.58-0.68). Site occupancy for any owl declined from 0.81 (0.59-0.93) in 1995 to 0.50 (0.39-0.60) in 2009; pair occupancy declined from 0.75 (0.56-0.87) to 0.46 (0.31-0.61). Our results suggest that a combination of 1 informed stand and 2 station-based operational surveys can support determinations of spotted owl site status (either a single or a pair) at desired levels of confidence. However, our information was collected in an area where barred owls were rarely detected. Surveys conducted in areas that support well-established barred owl populations are likely to be less effective for determining presence or absence of spotted owls and may require more surveys and/or different survey methods to determine site status with confidence. © 2012 The Wildlife Society.

ABSTRACT: The mechanisms by which melanin-based colour polymorphism can evolve and be maintained in wild populations are poorly known. Theory predicts that colour morphs have differential sensitivity to environmental conditions. Recently it has been proposed that colour polymorphism covaries genetically with intrinsic and behavioural properties. Plumage moult is a costly and crucial somatic maintenance function in birds. We used a long-term data set consisting of 761 observations on 307 individuals captured between 1985 and 2010 to examine differences in partial flight feather moult between grey (pale) and brown (pheomelanic dark) colour morphs of the tawny owl. We find that the brown morph consistently moult more primary flight feathers than the grey morph whereas there is no clear difference between colour morphs in the moulting of secondary feathers. Contrary to expectations, the difference in the number of moulted flight feathers between the morphs was independent of environmental conditions, as quantified by the abundance of prey. We discuss the potential physiological and behavioural causes for and costs of the observed difference in maintenance functions between colour morphs. © 2013 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Background: Danish populations of the little owl (Athene noctua) have experienced dramatic declines in size over the past century. Before 1960 the little owl population was abundant in Denmark (estimated N>2000), but between 1960 and 1980 the population declined rapidly, and since 1980 the little owl population has survived only in small and fragmented areas. Question: Is the decline in population size associated with reduced genetic variation in these Danish populations of the little owl? Are the populations genetically fragmented? Field site: Samples were collected from birds in Denmark (from 57°45′7″N to 54°33′35″N). Methods: We extracted DNA from the feathers of museum specimens of Danish little owls collected between 1918 and 1980. We also extracted DNA from feathers collected between 1984 and 2010. We performed a genetic analysis of 15 microsatellites on these samples. Conclusions: Older samples showed relatively little genetic variability, with more recent ones showing even less. In addition, pairwise FST values showed evidence for genetic substructuring with small but significant genetic differences between the extant population and the extinct owl populations on the Danish isle of Funen. The modest loss of genetic variability observed since the 1960s and 1970s may be associated with a diminished distributional range and population bottlenecks. © 2012 Volker Loeschcke.

ABSTRACT: Fossil remains of a small owl found in eight separate localities on Bermuda ranging in age from the end of the last interglacial period (Marine Isotope Stage 5a, ca. 80,000 years ago) and up into the Holocene are described here as a new species, Aegolius gradyi, the only representative of its genus known from a remote oceanic island. This differed from its probable North American ancestor, A. acadicus, in its more robust hindlimb elements, smaller head, and a possible tendency for smaller wing elements. Its colonization was probably made possible by the unique conditions of suitable habitat for hunting, roosting, and nesting afforded by Bermuda, including the presence of woodpeckers (Picidae) that would have excavated nest sites suitable for the owls in the endemic palm trees (Sabal bermudana). From accounts dating to the early 1600s, the species appears likely to have persisted into the historic period.

ABSTRACT: The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) was passed with bipartisan support as part of a broad environmental program during the 1960s and 1970s. The ESA sought to promote biodiversity and restore ecological balance to U.S. environments. But, as ancient forests disappeared in the American West, environmentalists began to use the ESA as a blunt instrument to save the wildlife of America's remaining forests. Their program included using the courts to save two owl species, the northern spotted owl in the Northwest and the Mexican spotted owl in the Southwest. The use of the ESA as a legal hammer severed traditional relationships between working-class people and the forests, and created a wedge between environmentalists and the working-class as environmentalists devalued human labor in the forests. In this article, two environmental historians have a conversation about the long-term implications of environmentalists' strategy of using the ESA to save western forests. They demonstrate that local people in the Pacific Northwest and New Mexico have long and complex histories of work in the forest that may not be inherently opposed to environmental goals. While the ESA is an important instrument in the environmentalist toolkit, in order to create a broad-based program which will protect forests in the long-term, working-class people must have a say in forest management.

ABSTRACT: Axons from the nucleus magnocellularis (NM) and their targets in nucleus laminaris (NL) form the circuit responsible for encoding interaural time differences (ITDs). In barn owls, NL receives bilateral inputs from NM such that axons from the ipsilateral NM enter NL dorsally, while contralateral axons enter from the ventral side. These afferents and their synapses on NL neurons generate a tone-induced local field potential, or neurophonic, that varies systematically with position in NL. From dorsal to ventral within the nucleus, the best interaural time difference (ITD) of the neurophonic shifts from contralateral space to best ITDs around 0 μs. Earlier recordings suggested that in NL, iso-delay contours ran parallel to the dorsal and ventral borders of NL (Sullivan WE, Konishi M. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 83:8400-8404, 1986). This axis is orthogonal to that seen in chicken NL, where a single map of ITD runs from around 0 μs ITD medially to contralateral space laterally (Köppl C, Carr CE. Biol Cyber 98:541-559, 2008). Yet the trajectories of the NM axons are similar in owl and chicken (Seidl AH, Rubel EW, Harris DM, J Neurosci 30:70-80, 2010). We therefore used clicks to measure conduction time in NL and made lesions to mark the 0 μs iso-delay contour in multiple penetrations along an isofrequency slab. Iso-delay contours were not parallel to the dorsal and ventral borders of NL; instead the 0 μs iso-delay contour shifted systematically from a dorsal position in medial NL to a ventral position in lateral NL. Could different conduction delays account for the mediolateral shift in the representation of 0 μs ITD? We measured conduction delays using the neurophonic potential and developed a simple linear model of the delay-line conduction velocity. We then raised young owls with time-delaying earplugs in one ear (Gold JI, Knudsen EI, J Neurophysiol 82:2197-2209, 1999) to examine map plasticity. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.

ABSTRACT: To more easily and non-invasively monitor urban Eastern Screech-Owl populations, we developed a method of distinguishing individual owls using their calls. A set of seven variables derived from recordings of 'bounce' calls taken from 10 known (either free ranging birds recorded at a single site on a single night or identifiable captive owls) owls was tested using a model-based clustering analysis (Mclust) as a method of discriminating individual owls. The cluster analysis correctly classified these calls with 98% accuracy. A second set of calls from nine owls was used to further test the method and correctly classified 84% of the calls using the same variables. Four owls were recorded repeatedly from 2008 to 2010 to determine the extent to which calls changed over time; the cluster analysis correctly assigned 89% of the calls to the correct owl regardless of the year the recordings were made. Based on these results, we are confident that the Mclust analysis can be used to reliably and safely estimate abundance and survival of Eastern Screech-Owls within the time frame of a few years and of population sizes < 15 owls. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.

ABSTRACT: The Austral Pygmy Owl (Glaucidium nana) is usually recorded as actively calling and foraging during daylight. We studied the diurnal activity of the Austral Pygmy Owl over 1 year in Cerro Ñielol Natural Monument in southern Chile totaling 339 hrs of observation. The most intense activity was recorded at mid-morning between 0900 to 1200 hrs when conspicuous perching and foraging attempts were observed. Vocalizations showed a pattern associated with the reproductive season. The contact pair call was most used throughout the year (54%), slightly less than the territorial call (46%). © 2012 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Wildfires remain a major threat to Northern Spotted Owl habitat in Cen-tral Oregon, and there is an urgent need for tools to support the development of effective conservation planning strategies. We describe the managed forest eco-system in Central Oregon as a coupled human and natural system and apply the agent-based modelling framework ENVISION for quantifying the integrated effects of wildfires, vegetative succession, and human decisions regarding forest and fire management on the suitability of owl habitat. Our simulation results show that ENVISION is suitable for the simulation of complex system feedbacks and links over different spatial and temporal scale levels. It is applicable to generate interdis-ciplinary insights for policy research and application planning that cannot be gained from ecological or social research alone. However, modelling approaches such as ENVISION require a better empirical foundation in order to be able to utilize their full potential for the development of effective conservation planning strategies.

ABSTRACT: Only a few studies, and mostly in temperate climates in Europe, have examined the breeding and diet of long-eared owls (Asio otus) compared to studies of cavity-breeding owls, possibly because of the difficulties in reaching the nests of the former. Here we studied a population of long-eared owls, monitoring the diet of breeding owls and that of owls at a communal roost, every two to three months during 2006-2009, in a semi-arid region in Israel. It was found that the studied owls produced more young than in most countries in Europe. Diet was not associated with breeding parameters of the owls, whereas laying date was negatively correlated with both clutch size and number of nestlings. We found that more social voles (Microtus socialis) and fewer birds and house mice (Mus musculus) made up the diet at nests than that of adults at the roosts. The diet and breeding of long-eared owls in Israel differ from that in Europe, with birds and mice comprising an important part of the diet, in addition to voles. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: With the aim of quantifying spatio-temporal and social factors affecting territorial calls in LittleOwls,we collected data on the calling behaviour of radio tracked individuals froma low-density population in Northern Jutland, Denmark. There was considerable seasonal variation in calling activity.During the breeding season,males calling away fromthe nest were located in the direction of the neighbouring nesting site, andmaleswith a neighbour within hearing distance called more often than those with a longer distance to the nearest neighbour. Call posts were on average closer to the nest than telemetry observations, but did not appear to be related tomate distance.With a sound pressure level of 82 dB(A) at 1- m distance, the territorial calls were estimated to be audible to a distance of 4.4 km. Call posts were on average 4.1 mabove the ground, which probably maximizes the transmission distance.

ABSTRACT: In species with parental care, siblings compete for access to food resources. Typically, they vocally signal their level of need to each other and to parents, and jostle for the position in the nest where parents deliver food. Although food shortage and social interactions are stressful, little is known about the effect of stress on the way siblings resolve the conflict over how food is shared among them. Because glucocorticoid hormones mediate physiological and behavioral responses to stressors, we tested whether corticosterone, the main glucocorticoid in birds, modulates physical and vocal signaling used by barn owl siblings (Tyto alba) to compete for food. Although corticosterone-implanted (cort-) nestlings and placebo-nestlings were similarly successful to monopolize food, they employed different behavioral strategies. Compared to placebo-nestlings, cort-individuals reduced the rate of vocally communicating with their siblings (but not with their parents) but were positioned closer to the nest-box entrance where parents predictably deliver food. Therefore, corticosterone induced nestlings to increase their effort in physical competition for the best nest position at the expense of investment in sib-sib communication without modifying vocal begging signals directed to parents. This suggests that in the barn owl stress alters nestlings' behavior and corticosterone could mediate the trade-off between scramble competition and vocal sib-sib communication. We conclude that stressful environments may prevent the evolution of sib-sib communication as a way to resolve family conflicts peacefully. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

ABSTRACT: It was shown that in the years when the numbers of the Arctic foxes are high, even though the lemming numbers are high as well, Brent geese nest considerably closer to owls' nests than in the years with low Arctic fox numbers. At values of the Arctic fox densities greater than one breeding pair per 20 km2, the factor of lemming numbers ceases to affect the distance between owl and geese nests. This distance becomes dependent on the Arctic fox density (numbers). When the Arctic fox density is greater than the pronounced threshold, the owl-Brent internest distance is inversely and linearly related to the Arctic fox density. © 2013 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Prey use is compared between barn owl and long-eared owl from pellets sampled at six sites in eastern Poland. Mammals made up 97.3% of long-eared owl diet by biomass. The most important species were voles Microtus spp. and mice Apodemus spp., constituting 79.9% and 13.0% by biomass, respectively. Their average prey weight was 19.9 g. Mammals made up 99.6% of barn owl diet by number and 99.2% by biomass. The most important were voles Microtus spp. and mice Apodemus spp., constituting 79.9% and 13.0% by biomass, respectively. Average prey weight was 12.3g. A significant difference was found in the mean weight of prey taken by the two owl species. barn owls took less avian prey compared to long-eared owls. Birds caught by long-eared owls were also heavier than those caught by barn owls, though the difference was not significant. The median weight of bird prey for barn owls and long-eared owls was 23 g and 32 g, respectively. The similarity of diet of the wintering owls in particular sites was in the range: 9.0%-98.4%. The total prey overlap of the two wintering species was 83.2%. © NwjZ, Oradea, Romania, 2013.

ABSTRACT: Roost site selection is a state-dependent process, affected by the individual's costs and benefits of roosting at a specific site in the available environment. Costs and benefits of different roost sites vary in relation to intrinsic factors and environmental conditions. Thus, the cost-benefit functions of roost sites are expected to differ between seasons and life-history stages, resulting in adjustments in roost site selection. Studying roost site selection throughout the year therefore provides information about year-round habitat requirements at different life-history stages. However, little is known about the roosting behaviour of birds. Here, the roost site selection of Little Owls Athene noctua was studied by repeated daytime location of 24 adult and 75 juvenile radiotagged individuals from July to November. Little Owls preferred sheltered roost sites such as tree cavities with multiple entrances. They increasingly used sheltered sites from summer to winter and preferentially used sheltered roost sites with low ambient temperatures. Juveniles used significantly less sheltered sites during dispersal than before and afterwards, and used less sheltered sites than adults within their home-range. The survival probability of birds roosting frequently at exposed sites was reduced. Roost site selection is probably driven by the two mechanisms of predator avoidance and thermoregulation, and the costs of natal dispersal may include increased predation threat and higher energy expenditure for thermoregulation. We suggest that adequate roost sites, such as multi-entrance tree cavities, are an important habitat requirement for Little Owls and that habitat quality can be affected by manipulating their availability. © 2013 British Ornithologists' Union.

ABSTRACT: Capsule The presence of Ferruginous Pygmy Owls Glaucidium brasilianum breeding in the xerophytic forest of Caldén Prosopis caldenia in central Argentina was slightly affected by forest maturity but neither by the structure of vegetation strata at the micro-habitat scale, nor by forest composition (mosaic of forest-grassland or shrubland) or proximity of water bodies at the macro-habitat scale. Aims To assess the habitat characteristics selected by Ferruginous Pygmy Owls during the breeding season. Methods Random transects were performed across a portion of the Luro Natural Reserve by broadcasting Ferruginous Pygmy Owl calls. Locations along these transects were used to carry out a presence/absence habitat analysis at micro-and macro-habitat levels. Results Ferruginous Pygmy Owls were found in the majority of sampled locations. However, their presence was not associated with the vegetation structure and composition around sampled locations. Model outputs suggested similarity among presence and absence locations at both spatial scales, though owls showed a slight preference for areas with older trees and higher edge-density values. Conclusion The Ferruginous Pygmy Owl was more abundant than previously thought in the Caldén xerophytic forest, emphasizing the habitat's conservation importance, particularly because of the land-use changes that the La Pampa region is experiencing (e.g. forest exploitation). © 2013 British Trust for Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: Understanding how habitat disturbances such as forest fire affect local extinction and probability of colonization-the processes that determine site occupancy-is critical for developing forest management appropriate to conserving the California Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis), a subspecies of management concern. We used 11 years of breeding-season survey data from 41 California Spotted Owl sites burned in six forest fires and 145 sites in unburned areas throughout the Sierra Nevada, California, to compare probabilities of local extinction and colonization at burned and unburned sites while accounting for annual and site-specific variation in detectability. We found no significant effects of fre on these probabilities, suggesting that fire, even fire that burns on average 32% of suitable habitat at high severity within a California Spotted Owl site, does not threaten the persistence of the subspecies on the landscape. We used simulations to examine how different allocations of survey effort over 3 years affect estimability and bias of parameters and power to detect differences in colonization and local extinction between groups of sites. Simulations suggest that to determine whether and how habitat disturbance affects California Spotted Owl occupancy within 3 years, managers should strive to annually survey ≥200 affected and ≥200 unaffected historical owl sites throughout the Sierra Nevada 5 times per year. Given the low probability of detection in one year, we recommend more than one year of surveys be used to determine site occupancy before management that could be detrimental to the Spotted Owl is undertaken in potentially occupied habitat. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2012.

ABSTRACT: Differential predation on certain classes of individuals within prey populations might make owls strong selective agents on their prey. We investigated selective predation of tawny owls (Strix aluco) on yellow-necked mice (Apodemus flavicollis, A.f.) and bank voles (Myodes glareolus, M.g.) for two years by comparing prey from owl nests with live-trapped individuals. The owls killed significantly more male M.g. (73%) than females, but not more than expected from traps (57%). For A.f., owls selected adults in favour of subadults, and for adults, individuals with longer femurs. Adult males of A.f. killed by owls had significantly heavier testes in relation their size than the trapped males. Prey selection did not correlate with size-adjusted body or spleen mass. Owl-killed A.f. had higher prevalences of the intestinal helminth Heligmosomoides sp. than trapped individuals, but hosted similar numbers of parasite species. Differential predation of tawny owls on yellow-necked mice and bank voles seems to reflect higher exposure to predator encounters of prime individuals rather than selection for substandard individuals. © 2012 Finnish Zoological and Botanical Publishing Board.

ABSTRACT: Thinning has been promoted as a method for accelerating the development of late-seral habitat and improving the overall health and function of young forests in the Pacif c Northwest. Population studies have shown early and positive responses to thinning by some small forest-f oor mammals (primarily mice, terrestrial voles, and shrews). However, thinning reduces the abundance of some tree-dwelling rodents, especially Northern Flying Squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus) and Red Tree Voles (Arborimus longicaudus), that are important prey species for Northern Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis caurina). Recent studies suggest that reductions in Northern Flying Squirrel abundance following thinning may be driven by increased susceptibility to predation created by removal of critical above-ground cover. Predation, lack of canopy connectivity, and reduction in suitable nest substrates may all contribute to reduced Red Tree Vole abundance following thinning. T e long-term benef ts of some thinning treatments may be positive for both flying squirrels and Red Tree Voles, but may not be realized for several decades or more, as the development of a midstory layer of trees may be critical to the success of thinning in promoting habitat for these species. Additional research into the ecology of the two woodrat species (Neotoma fuscipes and N. cinerea) found in the Pacif c Northwest is needed to provide a more complete understanding of the ef ects of forest management activities on spotted owls and their prey. It may be possible to design thinning prescriptions that lessen the short-term negative ef ects on arboreal rodents. Long-term goals should focus on creating more structurally and biologically complex forests across the landscape at scales and patterns compatible with the ecologies of spotted owl prey and other organisms. Joint research-management ef orts to test new silvicultural prescriptions, expand current predictive models of high-quality prey habitat, and develop management strategies that consider the temporal ef ects of management on owl prey at the stand, landscape, and regional levels, could advance our understanding of owl prey ecology and help ensure that healthy populations of spotted owls and their prey persist on the landscape over the long term.

ABSTRACT: In this study, we report hematocrit and plasma chemistry values for adult captive collared scops owls (Otus lettia) and crested serpent eagles (Spilornis cheela hoya). In particular, we address the gender-specific differences within these values. We measured hematocrit (HCT) and plasma chemistry values for uric acid (UA), plasma urea nitrogen (BUN), total protein (TP), albumin (ALB), glucose (GLU), cholesterol (CHO), triglyceride (TG), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin (TBIL), creatine (CRE), creatine phosphokinase (CPK), amylase (AMY), calcium (CA), ionic phosphorous (IP) and sodium (NA), potassium (K) and chloride ions (CL) in 37 adult captive collared scops owls and 39 adult captive crested serpent eagles. Significant differences between the sexes were found for UA, GLU and CPK in the collared scope owls. UA and GLU concentrations were significantly higher (P<0.01 and P<0.05) among males than females, while the CPK concentration was significantly lower (P<0.05) in males. There were no significant differences in of all of the measured parameters between male and female eagles. These finding suggested that HCT and plasma chemistry values of raptors vary individually according to species and sex. Our results provide the 1st available reference data for ranges of plasma values in adult captive collared scops owls and crested serpent eagles, making them a potentially useful complementary diagnostic tool for veterinary care of individuals for both species in captivity. ©2012 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

ABSTRACT: A Central European subspecies of the Ural owl Strix uralensis macroura (Wolf, 1810) is widespread in the territory of Slovakia. The work presents unpublished data on the diet of this subspecies from several territorial units of eastern and northern Slovakia, obtained from pellets and the nest linings in boxes (1,564 pieces). There is less data about prey brought to young in the nest but still not yet consumed (137 pieces). Published data from analysis of the stomachs of dead and shot owls come from the first six decades of the 20th century. Together with existing published data, 2,134 pieces of the diet of S. uralensis from Slovakia are evaluated. They indicate the dominance of non-forest species Microtus arvalis and a more plentiful representation of larger species of prey: Lepus europaeus, Sciurus vulgaris and Corvus sp. In upper Orava the diet of young S. uralensis also consists of frogs Rana temporaria, moles Talpa europaea and mountain species of rodents: Microtus agrestis, M. subterraneus, Sicista betulina and Arvicola amphibius. In data from the mountains of central Slovakia the Clethrionomys glareolus has high abundance, and in eastern Slovakia the Apodemus flavicollis and A. agrarius are more represented, and in the lowlands also the Cricetus cricetus. Upon evaluation ofmaterial from the entire breeding grounds of S. uralensis it can be deduced that the basic diet consist of mammals (88.6%) from the orders Soricomorpha and Rodentia. In the countries of Central Europe the species M. arvalis, M. subterraneus, A. flavicollis and Muscardinus avellanarius are more abundantly represented, and in the Baltic states the species Sorex araneus, M. agrestis, M. oeconomus and M. rossiaemeridionalis. The species S. betulina and A. agrarius occur in the diet of S. uralensis from Central Europe up through the Far East. © 2013 Raptor Protection of Slovakia (RPS).

ABSTRACT: In the Klamath province of southwestern Oregon, Northern Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) occur in complex, productive forests that historically supported frequent fires of variable severity. However, little is known about the relationships between Spotted Owl survival and home-range size and the characteristics of fire-prone, mixed-conifer forests of the Klamath province. Thus, the objectives of this study were to estimate monthly survival rates and home-range size in relation to habitat characteristics for Northern Spotted Owls in southwestern Oregon. Home-range size and survival of 15 Northern Spotted Owls was monitored using radiotelemetry in the Ashland Ranger District of the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest from September 2006 to October 2008. Habitat classes within Spotted Owl home ranges were characterized using a remote-sensed vegetation map of the study area. Estimates of monthly survival ranged from 0.89 to 1.0 and were positively correlated with the number of late-seral habitat patches and the amount of edge, and negatively correlated with the mean nearest neighbor distance between late-seral habitats. Annual home-range size varied from to 189 to 894 ha ( 576; SE = 75), with little difference between breeding and nonbreeding home ranges. Breeding-season home-range size increased with the amount of hard edge, and the amount of old and mature forest combined. Core area, annual and nonbreeding season home-range sizes all increased with increased amounts of hard edge, suggesting that increased fragmentation is associated with larger core and home-range sizes. Although no effect of the amount of late-seral stage forest on either survival or home-range size was detected, these results are the first to concurrently demonstrate increased forest fragmentation with decreased survival and increased home-range size of Northern Spotted Owls. © 2013 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Starting in late November 2010, the H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus was isolated from many types of wild ducks and raptors and was subsequently isolated from poultry in Korea. We assessed the genetic and pathogenic properties of the HPAI viruses isolated from a fecal sample from a mandarin duck and a dead Eurasian eagle owl, the most affected wild bird species during the 2010/2011 HPAI outbreak in Korea. These viruses have similar genetic backgrounds and exhibited the highest genetic similarity with recent Eurasian clade 2.3.2.1 HPAI viruses. In animal inoculation experiments, regardless of their originating hosts, the two Korean isolates produced highly pathogenic characteristics in chickens, ducks and mice without pre-adaptation. These results raise concerns about veterinary and public health. Surveillance of wild birds could provide a good early warning signal for possible HPAI infection in poultry as well as in humans. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: Based on a long-term dataset (1999-2010), we investigated how the availability of main prey affects the breeding density and food ecology of the Tengmalm's owl (Aegolius funereus) in the Czech Republic. In particular, we assessed the role of Microtus voles and Apodemus mice in the diet, based on the main predictions of the optimal diet theory that the diet composition depends on the availability of the main prey. We found that (i) the Tengmalm's owl exhibited no numerical response to the availability of Microtus voles and Apodemus mice in the field; (ii) the availability of Apodemus mice in the field positively affected their proportion in the diet (26 %), and despite a high proportion of Microtus voles in the owls' diet (47 %), no relationship was found between their availability in the field and proportion in the diet; (iii) the proportion of Apodemus mice was negatively correlated to the proportion of Microtus voles, Sorex shrews and birds in the diet, but no similar relationship was detected for Microtus voles; (iv) the reproductive output of Tengmalm's owls was positively correlated to the proportion of Apodemus mice in the diet, as well as to Apodemus mice and Microtus vole availability in the field; and (v) diet diversity and diet overlap were not significantly affected by the abundance of Apodemus mice and Microtus voles. Therefore, the validity of these main optimal diet theory predictions was not confirmed, especially for Microtus vole prey, due to an opportunistic choice between Apodemus mice and Microtus voles. We suggest that the reproductive output of nocturnal raptors in Central Europe may be less dependent on Microtus vole supply than that of their northern counterparts. © 2013 The Society of Population Ecology and Springer Japan.

ABSTRACT: When competing over parental resources, young animals may be typically selfish to the point of siblicide. This suggests that limited parental resources promote the evolution of sibling competition rather than altruistic or cooperative behaviours. In striking contrast, we show here that in 71% of experimental three-chick broods, nestling barn owls, Tyto alba, gave food to their siblings on average twice per night. This behaviour prevailed in the first-born dominant nestlings rather than the last-born subordinate nestlings. It was also more prevalent in individuals displaying a heritable dark phaeomelanin-based coloration, a typical female-specific plumage trait (owls vary from dark reddish to white, females being on average darker reddish than males). Stealing food items from siblings, which occurred in 81% of the nests, was more frequent in light than dark phaeomelanic dominant nestlings. We suggest that food sharing has evolved in the barn owl because parents store prey items in their nest that can be used by the offspring to feed their nestmates to derive indirect (kin selection) or direct benefits (pseudoreciprocity or by-product mutualism). The cost of feeding siblings may be relatively low for dominant individuals while the indirect genetic benefits could be high given that extrapair paternity is infrequent in this species. Thus, in situations in which young animals have access to more food resources than they currently need, they can altruistically share them with their siblings. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: We studied the diet of the little owl, Athene noctua, in an agricultural lands of Central Poland. In total, 642 pellets were collected in the years 1995-1997 and 3090 prey items were identified. In the diet, Coleoptera dominated by number (62.4%), but vertebrates dominated in terms of biomass (98%). The most frequently found vertebrate prey was the common vole, Microtus arvalis, and Muridae. Birds and amphibians were found in pellets only occasionally, mostly in summer. Contribution to the main prey categories of little owl diet differed seasonally: mammals were preyed upon more frequently in winter, while invertebrates in autumn. Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed preferences of little owl to common voles in winter and summer, house mouse (Mus musculus) in spring, and Apodemus mice in autumn-winter periods. Share of particular invertebrate groups in the diet was not random over the year. Carabid beetles were preyed upon all year round and together with cantharid larvae made up an important component of the winter diet. The high proportion of invertebrates as well as the presence of synantropic rodents in the winter diet suggests that in the winter, little owl utilise buildings as hunting sites. From the analysed pellets we noted that a high frequency of lumbricid earthworms, was present in up to 53% of the pellets in the autumn. Assuming different numbers and individual body mass of an earthworm, we estimated that the contribution of lumbricids may reach from 5 to 40% of the total prey biomass consumed by little owl in autumn. © NwjZ, Oradea, Romania, 2013.

ABSTRACT: Aotus nancymaae, the owl monkey, provides a useful laboratory model for research to develop drugs and vaccines against human falciparum malaria; however, many Plasmodium falciparum parasites are unable to invade A. nancymaae erythrocytes, rendering the parasites noninfective to the monkeys. In previous work, we identified a key polymorphism that determined the inheritance of erythrocyte invasion in a genetic cross of two P. falciparum clones that were virulent (GB4) or noninfective (7G8) to A. nancymaae. This polymorphism, an isoleucine-to-lysine polymorphism at position 204 (I204K) of the GB4 erythrocyte binding protein PfRH5, was nevertheless not found in several other P. falciparum lines that could also invade A. nancymaae erythrocytes. Alternative PfRH5 polymorphisms occur at different positions in these virulent parasites, and additional polymorphisms are found in P. falciparum parasites that cannot infect A. nancymaae. By allelic replacement methods, we have introduced the polymorphisms of these A. nancymaae-virulent or noninfective parasites at codons 204, 347, 358, 362, 410, and 429 of the endogenous PfRH5 gene in the noninfective 7G8 line. 7G8 transformants expressing the polymorphisms of the A. nancymaae-virulent parasites show neuraminidase-sensitive (sialic acid-dependent) invasion into the monkey erythrocytes, whereas 7G8 transformants expressing the PfRH5 alleles of noninfective parasites show little or no invasion of these erythrocytes. Parasites harboring PfRH5 polymorphisms 204K or 204R are also able to invade rat erythrocytes and are differentially sensitive to the removal of surface sialic acids by neuraminidase. These studies offer insights into the PfRH5 receptor-binding domain and interactions that support the invasion of various primate and rodent erythrocytes by P. falciparum. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ACL) is caused by protozoan parasites of the Leishmania genus, and transmitted by females of the Phlebotominae family. The role of wild and domestic hosts in the cycle of Leishmania is still unknown. ACL is endemic in the province of Formosa where Nyssomyia neivai was the most abundant species in several captures and 31 cumulative ACL human cases were reported between 2005 and 2011 in the province. The present report describes the detection, by PCR-RFLP and confirmed by sequencing, of subgenus Leishmania (Viannia) DNA in four free-ranging owl monkeys (Aotus azarai azarai) from Formosa Province. The sequence amplified was the mini-exon gene present in tandem repeats in all species of the Leishmania genus from buffy coat samples. The absence of inhibitors in the samples was checked by a β-globin protocol originally designed to amplify the human β-globin gene. However, other free-ranging primates were found with natural infections of L. (V) braziliensis complex and Leishmania (Viannia) subgenus by parasitological means in America. To the best of our knowledge, there are no published reports on detection of subgenus Leishmania (Viannia) DNA by PCR-RFLP in argentinean free-ranging primates. Additional eco-epidemiological and parasitological studies are necessary to confirm owl monkeys, or any other natural infected mammal species detected by PCR, as a reservoir, incidental host or to propose it as an animal model for research on this topic. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Based on the material collected in central, eastern and northern Poland, we compared species composition of bats as prey items (n=253) of tawny owls Strix aluco at different roosting sites: trees (n=93) or buildings (n=160). Percentage of bats described as vertebrate prey in studied material was not dependent on collecting site. However, there was a difference in the presence of individual bat species: Nyctalus noctula occurred more frequently in pellets found under trees or in bird boxes, than in pellets found in buildings, while an inverse pattern was recorded for Eptesicus serotinus. No difference was obtained for Plecotus auritus as well as for remaining, rarely preyed species. Due to typical roosts of bat species selected or avoided by the two groups of tawny owls, it could be expected that many individuals were captured in or close to the raptors' roosting sites. The results presented in this paper confirmed an opportunistic behaviour of owls in taking occasional prey. © NwjZ, Oradea, Romania, 2012.

ABSTRACT: We show, based on morphology and especially vocalisations, that the Philippine Hawk Owl Ninox philippensis requires treatment as seven allopatric species and at least one additional subspecies. Morphological distinctions between three groups of taxa are striking, and although taxa within one major group are relatively similar in plumage they vary rather consistently in size and proportions. It has not been possible until now to resolve the species limits in this complex due mainly to the lack of sound recordings of key taxa, a problem now rectified. Vocalisations differ significantly between all seven species, the limits of which are incongruent with all previous taxonomies. Taxa from Mindoro (mindorensis), Mindanao (spilocephala), Camiguin Sur (named herein), and the Sulu Islands (reyi) exhibit especially great vocal differences from all other taxa along with smaller but consistent differences in plumage and morphometrics. Although specimens have been in museum collections for many years, two of these species and one subspecies have heretofore remained undescribed, and we formally name these taxa for science. The recommended species-level treatment and English names of the N. philippensis complex are: Luzon Hawk Owl N. philippensis; Mindanao Hawk Owl N. spilocephala; Mindoro Hawk Owl N. mindorensis; Sulu Hawk Owl Ninox reyi; Romblon Hawk Owl N. spilonota; Camiguin Hawk Owl new species; and Cebu Hawk Owl new species.

ABSTRACT: Understanding population dynamics is of great interest in many different contexts. Traditionally, population dynamics have often been considered in terms of individual-based demographic parameters (e. g., abundance, survival, and reproductive rates), estimation of which generally requires information from marked individuals. Alternatively, in some situations, it may be appropriate to consider population dynamics at a landscape level where the focus is shifted from numbers of individuals to the status of the population at places on the landscape. One consequence of doing so is that information from marked individuals is no longer required. Recently developed methods allow the estimation of landscape-level population vital rates in the realistic situation where the current status of the population might be misclassified via field methods (e. g., because of imperfect detection). Here, we consider the case of the California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) at the Eldorado study area in central Sierra Nevada, California, USA, where interest is in the occupancy rate of potential nesting territories, and in whether owls in an occupied territory successfully reproduced each year during 1997-2004. We analyzed the data using multistate occupancy models and found no evidence of annual variation in dynamic occupancy probabilities. There was strong evidence of annual variation in successful reproduction, with the pattern of variation being different depending on whether there was successful reproduction in the territory in the previous year. Of the three environmental variables considered, the Southern Oscillation Index appeared to be most important and explained some of the annual variation in reproduction probabilities. © 2010 Dt.

ABSTRACT: Stressful situations during development can shape the phenotype for life by provoking a trade-off between development and survival. Stress hormones, mainly glucocorticoids, play an important orchestrating role in this trade-off. Hence, how stress sensitive an animal is critically determines the phenotype and ultimately fitness. In several species, darker eumelanic individuals are less sensitive to stressful conditions than less eumelanic conspecifics, which may be due to the pleiotropic effects of genes affecting both coloration and physiological traits. We experimentally tested whether the degree of melanin-based coloration is associated with the sensitivity to an endocrine response to stressful situations in the barn owl. We artificially administered the mediator of a hormonal stress response, corticosterone, to nestlings to examine the prediction that corticosterone-induced reduction in growth rate is more pronounced in light eumelanic nestlings than in darker nest mates. To examine whether such an effect may be genetically determined, we swapped hatchlings between randomly chosen pairs of nests. We first showed that corticosterone affects growth and, thus, shapes the phenotype. Second, we found that under corticosterone administration, nestlings with large black spots grew better than nestlings with small black spots. As in the barn owl the expression of eumelanin-based coloration is heritable and not sensitive to environmental conditions, it is therefore a reliable, genetically based sign of the ability to cope with an increase in blood corticosterone level. © 2012 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Trophic habits of the Common Barn-Owl (Tyto alba) have been widely studied in Argentina, mainly in the center and south of the country. However, in the north-western region these studies are scarce. We studied the diet of this raptor by analyzing pellets collected in six localities of the Chaco Seco ecoregion. Cranial remains were taxonomically determined, and the minimal number of individuals, relative frequency and percent biomass of each prey item were calculated. Moreover, we calculated food-niche breadth and standardized food-niche breadth, the geometric mean of prey weight, and the diversity. We obtained 1231 prey items, mainly of the genus Calomys, which was dominant in five of the six localities. Number of individuals varied among 83-508 and at all localities, two species (Calomys cf. C. venustus/ fecundus and Calomys cf. C. laucha/musculinus) contributed more than 50% of the consumed biomass. Standardized food-niche breadth varied between 0.111-0.661. Geometric mean of prey weight was lower than the established value for the Neotropical Region. The abundance of Calomys spp. in the diet was positively related to the degree of transformation of natural lands into agroecosystems, whereas species diversity was negatively related. These results contribute with novel data for the Chaco Seco ecoregion in northwestern Argentina, supporting the patterns found for the Common Barn-Owl in other regions of the country.

ABSTRACT: Rodent prey contained in two temporally distinct collections of Barn Owl (Tyto alba) pellets from the same roost in southeastern Washington state (USA) differ in terms of taxonomic abundances. Deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) dominate the fauna in the pellet sample deposited while much of the landscape was productive wheat field, and voles (Microtus spp.) are a distant second. The fauna in the pellet sample deposited after 20% of the surrounding landscape was placed in soil bank and converted to a grass non-producing field is dominated by voles with deer mice a close second. The coincident changes in local vegetation and in the rodent fauna are causally as well as temporally interrelated. Previous local studies have focused on the agricultural economics of coincident shifts in agricultural practices and rodent faunas. Results presented here indicate potential benefits to owl faunas of changes in agricultural practices and suggest that study of curated owl pellet faunas collected decades ago may reveal much about the long-term history of anthropogenic influences on rodent faunas. © 2012, American Midland Naturalist.

ABSTRACT: The use of artificial nest boxes has led to significant progress in bird conservation and in our understanding of the functional and evolutionary ecology of free-ranging birds that exploit cavities for roosting and reproduction. Nest boxes and their improved accessibility have made it easier to perform comparative and experimental field investigations. However, concerns about the generality and applicability of scientific studies involving birds breeding in nest boxes have been raised because the occupants of boxes may differ from conspecifics occupying other nest sites. Here, we review the existing evidence demonstrating the importance of nest box design to individual life-history traits in three falcon (Falconiformes) and seven owl (Strigiformes) species, as well as the extent to which publications on these birds describe the characteristics of exploited artificial nest boxes in their "Methods" sections. More than 60% of recent publications did not provide any details on nest box design (e. g. size, shape, material), despite several calls >15 years ago to increase the reporting of such information. We exemplify and discuss how variation in nest box characteristics can affect or confound conclusions from nest box studies and conclude that it is of overall importance to present details of nest box characteristics in scientific publications. © 2011 Dt.

ABSTRACT: The increasing road networks threaten ecosystems by direct effects such as increased mortality due to collision with vehicles and by various indirect effects leading to road avoidance. We censused Tawny Owls Strix aluco and Little Owls Athene noctua in 2005, 2007 and 2009 in a rural landscape in Southern Portugal in order to study the effects of roads and habitat characteristics on Tawny Owl density and Little Owl presence. The presence of both owl species in the 70 census locations was coherent among years. Our results showed that Tawny Owl density near major roads was lower, with the negative effects extending possibly up to 2 km. The probability of Little Owl presence was also negatively affected by the proximity to major roads. The negative effects of roads were significant even considering habitat preferences and spatial autocorrelation, which had the most marked effect on the density or presence of both owls. The reduced occupancy by Tawny Owls and Little Owls of habitats near major roads may be caused by several factors, including increased mortality, disturbance caused by high traffic density, and increased fragmentation. Traffic noise in particular may affect intra-specific communication and hunting efficiency. Consequently, habitat near roads may represent lower-quality territories for owls.

ABSTRACT: Small-scale ecological variables, such as forest structure and resource availability, may affect primate groups at the scale of group home ranges, thereby influencing group demography and life-history traits. We evaluated the complete territories of 4 groups of owl monkeys (Aotus azarai), measuring and identifying all trees and lianas with a diameter at breast height ≥10 cm (n = 7485). We aimed to determine all food sources available to each of those groups and to relate food availability to group demographics. For analyses, we considered the core areas of the home range separately from the 80% home range. Our results showed that groups occupy territories that differ in size, species evenness, stem density, and food species' stem abundances. The territories differed in the availability of fruits, flowers, and leaves, and most fruit sources were unevenly distributed in space. Differences among territories were more pronounced for the whole range than they were for the core areas. Despite marked differences among territories in structure and food availability, the number of births and age at natal dispersal were quite similar, but 1 group had a consistently lower group size. Our results suggest that owl monkey groups occupy territories of different structure and composition and food availability, yet ones that contain similar quantities of, mostly, dry season fruit sources. We propose that groups inhabit these territories to overcome food shortages safely during limiting periods, specifically the dry season, in this markedly seasonal forest. The occupancy and defense of territories with strict boundaries may therefore be associated with food resources available during limiting seasons that may be the ones influencing life history patterns and demographics. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

ABSTRACT: Capsule Recovery distances of Barn Owls ringed as pulli are conditional on ringing date but not on population density. Aims To test whether ring recovery distances (proxy for natal dispersal distances) were conditional on population density and reproductive timing. Methods We used ringing data of pulli ringed in Denmark (1921-2009; n=590) and glmms to test density, recovery time, ringing date and brood size for their influence on dispersal probability and recovery distance. Results The probability of being recovered>1 km from the nest-site as well as total recovery distances increased steeply from 0 to 100 days after ringing, being stable thereafter, and was also impacted by brood size. Owls ringed very early or late in the breeding season were more likely to be recovered<1 km from the nest-site at a recovery time where dispersal seemed to be completed. Conclusions Owls from early and late broods showed lower dispersal distances than others on average, despite non-philopatric owls having equal recovery distances regardless of ringing date. Overall, dispersal probability and recovery distances did not correlate with population density, but there is some evidence that young owls dispersed faster in denser populations. © 2012 British Trust for Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: The recent increase in the numbers of Eagle Owls Bubo bubo in Britain has led to widespread concern about the potential impact of this top predator on populations of other birds and mammals. We present data on the recent colonisation by Eagle Owls of the Doñana protected area, in southern Spain. The preliminary results provide a relevant case study for analysing the increasing Eagle Owl population in Britain. We describe population density and distribution, breeding biology, diet, home-range behaviour and natal dispersal of the species. Four years of research have highlighted the complexity of the situation in Doñana, and suggest that decision-Makers should act with extreme caution when contemplating population control. © Brithsh Birds.

ABSTRACT: Owl monkeys Aotus spp have the potential to be a great model to accomplish a thorough integration of zoo and field research. Their most salient features are their nocturnal habits, monogamous social organization and paternal care, features that should make them of interest to the public. Following a brief historical perspective on our knowledge of owl monkey biology, I describe in detail, drawing from research with both captive and wild animals, those aspects that make owl monkeys unusual among primates and mammals. First, owl monkeys are the only anthropoids with nocturnal habits, and the study of their remarkable activity patterns has benefited enormously from an integrated approach that combined field research with research in semi-natural conditions and the laboratory. Second, up until recently, our understanding of social monogamy and the involvement of the ♂♂ in infant care, two defining characteristics of the genus, have been primarily informed by studies of captive individuals. In the future, a truly integrated laboratory-field approach that focuses on certain areas that cannot be examined in only one or the other setting (e.g. reproductive biology, communication, energetics) will offer unique opportunities for synergistic interactions between zoo and field research that will have both intellectual and practical benefits. © 2012 The Author.

ABSTRACT: Context. The population dynamics of many wildlife species are associated with fluctuations in climate. Food and abundance may also influence wildlife dynamics. Aims. The present paper aims to evaluate the relative effects of climate on the annual instantaneous population growth rate (r) of the following three bird species: grey heron and barn owl in parts of Britain and malleefowl in a part of Australia. Methods. A priori hypotheses of mechanistic effects of climate are derived and evaluated using information theoretic and regression analyses and published data for the three bird species. Climate was measured as the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) for herons and owls, and rainfall and also the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) for malleefowl. Key results. Population dynamics of grey heron were positively related to the winter NAO, and of malleefowl were positively related to annual rainfall and related in a non-linear manner to SOI. By contrast, population dynamics of barn owl were very weakly related to climate. The best models for the grey heron differed between time periods but always included an effect of the NAO. Conclusions. The annual population growth rate of grey heron, malleefowl and barn owl show contrasting relationships with climate, from stronger (heron and malleefowl) to weaker (barn owl). The results were broadly consistent with reported patterns but differed in some details. Interpretation of the effects of climate on the basis of analyses rather than visual assessment is encouraged. Implications. Effects of climate differ among species, so effects of future climate change may also differ. © CSIRO 2012.

ABSTRACT: We identified the diet of owlets of the Daito subspecies of the Ryukyu Scops Owl Otus elegans interpositus on Minami-daito Island during late May and early June 2009, by means of high-resolution color photography. Cockroaches were provided by parents to their young at all eight nests studied, and contributed the largest single component of the diet (33%). Orthoptera species, which inhabited open grassland habitats, constituted >20% of the total occurrences in the diet of owlets. It is suggested that Ryukyu Scops Owls depend heavily on food items obtained from habitats that have been modified by human activity on Minami-daito Island. Diets for owlets differed widely among nests, and the differences were considered to result from individual differences among parents and/or the environments surrounding each nest. © The Ornithological Society of Japan 2011.

ABSTRACT: Anti-predator training of juvenile little owls was tested in a sample of recovered owls raised in captivity in Brinzal Owl Rescue Center (Madrid, Spain). Mortality caused by predators has been described previously in released individuals. Nine little owls were conditioned during their development to a naturalized goshawk and a large live rat, whose presence was paired to the owl's alarm call. All nine owls and seven non-trained individuals were then released during the late summer and autumn and radio-tracked for six weeks to test their survival. In total 71.4% of the trained owls survived while only the 33.3% of the untrained group were alive at the end of week six. The only cause of death that was detected was predation. Antipredator training, therefore, seems to be beneficial in maximizing survival after the release of juvenile little owls. © 2011 Museu de Ciències Naturals de Barcelona.

ABSTRACT: Capsule Barn Owl pellets can be used to assess population changes in small mammals though with certain important reservations. Aims To conduct a large-scale, long-term analysis of pellets regurgitated by Barn Owls collected from a defined area of countryside within the UK south Midlands and compare results with those of other studies that have used pellet analysis to investigate the diet of Barn Owls. Methods Over 61000 Barn Owl pellets collected over 20 years in the south Midlands of England were analyzed. Results We recorded a steady increase in the proportion of Field Voles in pellets over time at the expense of Wood Mice, and a positive relationship between various rainfall measures and the proportion of Field Voles in pellets. We suggest that the conclusions of previous studies of the diet of Barn Owls have often been predicated on inconsistent or untenable assumptions. Conclusion We challenge some of the premises on which Barn Owl pellet analyses have traditionally been based. We do not think that either a shortage of Field Voles in pellets, or of pellets containing the remains of more, smaller prey items, are indicative of foraging difficulty. Barn Owl pellets can be used to assess population changes in small mammals, so long as possible causes of bias, which we discuss, are acknowledged. © 2012 British Trust for Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: Iron, manganese, copper, lead and cadmium were measured in the livers, muscles, kidneys and bones of Eurasian Eagle Owls (Bubo bubo), Brown Hawk Owls (Nixos scutulata) and Collared Scops Owls (Otus lempiji) from Korea. Iron concentrations by tissue within species did not differ, but there were significant differences among tissues across all species. Manganese and copper concentrations in muscles, kidneys and bones, but not livers, differed among species and also differed among tissues in the three owl species. We suggest that manganese and copper concentrations from this study were far below the level associated with their toxicity. Lead concentrations significantly differed among all species for livers and bones, and among tissues for each species. Cadmium concentrations were significantly different among species for all tissues and among tissues in Eurasian Eagle Owls and Collared Scops Owls. For most samples, lead concentrations in livers and bones, and cadmium in livers and kidneys, were within the background levels for wild birds. For some Eurasian Eagle Owls and Collared Scops Owls, lead concentrations were at an acute exposure level, whilst lead concentrations were at a chronic exposure level in Brown Hawk Owls. Cadmium concentrations were at a chronic exposure level in all three owl species. Acute and chronic poisoning was significantly correlated between indicator tissues. We suggest that lead and cadmium contamination in Eurasian Eagle Owls may reflect a Korean source, Brown Hawk Owls may reflect Korean and wintering sites, and Collared Scops Owls may reflect breeding and/or wintering sites. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

ABSTRACT: Characterizing the migration strategies of Northern Saw-whet Owls (Aegolius acadicus) has proved difficult due to variation in movement patterns within and among regions. Such variation underscores the need for information from sites throughout the species' range. To elucidate regional patterns in Northern Saw-whet Owl migration ecology, I studied migration in northern Montana from 200106, banding a total of 668 owls between 30 August and 31 October. Capture rates varied greatly among years, as did age ratios. Capture rates peaked between mid-September and early October. Weather variables did not have detectable effects on migration magnitude, but capture rates decreased approximately 2 for every 10 increase in moon illumination. Two owls originally banded in Alberta were captured at my banding site during this study. Additionally, two owls banded during this study were encountered elsewhere: one found dead in southern Montana and the other recaptured in Massachusetts, approximately 3322 km east of my study site. Results were consistent with the hypothesis that high rates of breeding dispersal and density-dependent migratory responses yield annual, latitudinal migrations that vary in magnitude and have a nomadic component. © 2012 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Knowledge of the migration geography of Flammulated Owls (Otus flammeolus) is limited. We combined data from multiple studies in the western United States to evaluate patterns of variation in Flammulated Owl morphometrics. Measurements from autumn migration study sites in New Mexico, Nevada, and Idaho followed a geographic cline from southeast to northwest across the species' range. Our objectives were to: (1) describe age- and sex-specific variation in the morphometrics of Flammulated Owls captured at the three sites, and (2) discuss the implications of this variation for understanding the species' migration geography. Based on a hierarchical series of factorial two-way ANOVAs, we discovered significant overall sex-specific differences in wing chord, exposed culmen length, and hallux length, and a consistent pattern of site-specific differences for most measurements. Most measurements increased from southeast to northwest, consistent with previous data on clinal variation in the species. Evidence of significant variation in the morphometrics of owls captured at the three migration sites suggests little longitudinal mixing of migrants in the region. © 2012 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Semantic web makes the applications understand by the machines. Ontology is the building block of semantic web because it provides semantics to the information. OWL is the knowledge representation language for creating ontology and helps the system to automatically process and integrate the information. UML is unified modelling language which provides a set of graphical notation to create visual models. UML helps in designing and documenting a system and many enterprises have their schemas in UML. By using the existing UML models, OWL can be generated because similar properties exist between them. The class diagram plays a major role in conversion because both are based on classes, their relationships and instances. During conversion problems like inconsistency and redundancy in UML models gets reflected in the OWL. So we propose an approach for resolving the inconsistency by converting UML to Description Logics. Check for the consistency using reasoning properties of DL. Resolve the inconsistency using the resolving algorithm and map the resultant DL to OWL code. © 2012 EuroJournals Publishing, Inc.

ABSTRACT: To test the efficiency of playback methods to survey little owl (Athene noctua) populations we carried out two studies: (1) we recorded the replies of radio-tagged little owls to calls in a small area; (2) we recorded call broadcasts to estimate the effectiveness of the method to detect the presence of little owl. In the first study, we detected an average of 8.12 owls in the 30' survey period, a number that is close to the real population; we also detected significant little owl movements from the initial location (before the playback) to the next locations during the survey period. However, we only detected an average of 2.25 and 5.37 little owls in the first 5' and 10', respectively, of the survey time. In the second study, we detected 137 little owl territories in 105 positive sample units. The occupation rate was 0.35, the estimated occupancy was 0.393, and the probability of detection was 0.439. The estimated cumulative probability of detection suggests that a minimum of four sampling times would be needed in an extensive survey to detect 95% of the areas occupied by little owls. © 2011 Museu de Ciències Naturals de Barcelona.

ABSTRACT: Post-fledging care constitutes a large proportion of the total costs of parental care in many bird species. Despite being recognized as of critical importance to the survival of the offspring and their recruitment into the breeding population, post-fledging care, including the relative contribution by male and female parents, is under-studied. In this study, we quantified food provisioning (prey deliveries) by male and female Tengmalm's Owl (Aegolius funereus) parents to their offspring both in the nestling and the post-fledging stages, in years of differing natural prey abundance. Parents and at least one offspring in 26 families were fitted with radio-transmitters. Male parents exhibited higher delivery rates than did females throughout the late nestling and post-fledging stages, but the intersexual difference was smaller in broods that were not deserted by the female at any stage. The female deserted her mate and offspring at some stage in 63% of the broods. Overall, deserted males delivered more prey to their offspring than did non-deserted males. Delivery rates were generally higher post-fledging. Prey delivery rates differed among years, and were highest in low vole years (probably because of smaller prey items), intermediate in peak vole years, and lowest in years of vole increase. Prey delivery rates increased with increasing brood size for both sexes, but the response was stronger in females. We suggest that female Tengmalm's Owls contribute less than males because they are in a position to decide on their level of provisioning effort first, and because of the potential for re-mating after deserting the first brood. © 2011 Dt.

ABSTRACT: We collected and analyzed 286 Barn owl, Tyto alba (Scopoli, 1769), pellets from two nests in different environments along the mid-Araguaia River in central Brazil. Our analyses revealed that these owls feed mainly on small mammals, especially rodents. Owls from the riverbanks at Fazenda Santa Fé had a more diverse diet, preying mainly on rodents that typically inhabit riparian grasslands - Holochilus sciureus Wagner, 1842 - and forests - Hylaeamys megacephalus (Fischer, 1814) and Oecomys spp., which probably also occur in forest borders or clearings. On the other hand, owls from an agroecosystem at Fazenda Lago Verde preyed mostly on rodent species common in these agrarian fields, Calomys tocantinsi Bonvicino, Lima & Almeida, 2003. Additionally, we compared small mammal richness estimates based on the analysis of owl pellets with estimates from live-trapping in the same areas. Owl pellets revealed two rodent species undetected by live traps - Euryoryzomys sp. and Rattus rattus (Linnaeus, 1758) - and four rodent species were trapped, but not found in owl pellets - Oecomys roberti Thomas, 1904, Pseudoryzomys simplex (Winge, 1887), Rhipidomys ipukensis Rocha, B.M.A. Costa & L.P. Costa, 2011, and Makalata didelphoides (Desmarest, 1817). Traps yielded higher species richness, but these two methods complement each other for surveying small rodents. © 2011 Sociedade Brasileira de Zoologia.

ABSTRACT: Analysis of ring recovery data for Short-eared Owls Asio flammeus spanning 96 years, 1912-2007, identified spatial and temporal differences in migration patterns. Birds with breeding areas or natal origins in the Boreal (principally Fenno-Scandinavia) and Continental (principally central Europe) regions tended to move the greatest distances. Although birds from the North Sea littoral and Britain tended to move shorter distances, recoveries included far eastern Europe (Russia), the Mediterranean and North Africa. Recovery distances showed a marked quadratic relationship with time, generally increasing through to the 1960s and 1970s and then subsequently declining, with the apparent turning point being latest for birds from the Boreal region and upland Britain (areas that retain the strongest populations). Temporal changes in recovery distances appear to be positively related to breeding population density (at least in some areas), but vagaries associated with knowledge of the past and current status of Short-eared Owls in many areas adds difficulty to assessing the validity of such an association. Movements of birds between different breeding seasons suggests considerable potential for connectivity between areas; however, a tendency for reducing distances for such movements since the mid-twentieth century might limit the viability of some 'populations' in more southern and fragmented parts of their range. © Dt.

ABSTRACT: To guide monitoring of burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia) in the Coachella Valley, California, USA, we analyzed survey-method-specific seasonal variation in detectability. Point-based call-broadcast surveys yielded high early season detectability that then declined through time, whereas detectability on driving surveys increased through the season. Point surveys without call-broadcasts yielded the lowest detectability rates overall. To maximize detectability, we recommend coupling early season pointbased call-broadcast surveys with late-season driving surveys. Occupancy models proved useful for integrating data from multiple methods to analyze distributional patterns while accounting for variation in detectability. © 2012 The Wildlife Society.

ABSTRACT: Preening is the principle behavioral defense used by birds to combat ectoparasites. Most birds have a small overhang at the tip of their bills that is used to shear through the tough cuticle of ectoparasitic arthropods, making preening much more efficient. Birds may also scratch with their feet to defend against ectoparasites. This is particularly important for removing ectoparasites on the head, which birds cannot preen. Scratching may be enhanced by the comb-like serrations that are found on the claws of birds in many avian families. We examined the prevalence and intensity of ectoparasites of barn owls (Tyto alba pratincola) in southern Idaho in relation to bill hook length and morphological characteristics of the pectinate claw. The barn owls in our study were infested with 3 species of lice (Phthiraptera: Ischnocera): Colpocephalum turbinatum, Kurodaia subpachygaster, and Strigiphilus aitkeni. Bill hook length was associated with the prevalence of these lice. Owls with longer hooks were more likely to be infested with lice. Conventional wisdom suggests that the bill morphology of raptors has been shaped by selection for efficient foraging; our data suggest that hook morphology may also play a role in ectoparasite defense. The number of teeth on the pectinate claw was also associated with the prevalence of lice. Owls that had claws with more teeth were less likely to be infested with lice, which suggests that larger pectinate claws may offer relatively more protection against ectoparasitic lice. Experiments that manipulate the bill hook and pectinate claw are needed to confirm whether these host characters are involved in ectoparasite defense. Finally, we recovered mammalian ectoparasites from 4 barn owls. We recovered species of mammalian lice (Phthiraptera:Anoplura) and fleas (Siphonaptera) that are commonly found on microtine rodents. The owls probably acquired these parasites from recently eaten prey. This represents 1 of the few documented cases of parasites "straggling" from prey to predator. © 2012 American Society of Parasitologists.

ABSTRACT: We used information compiled by the U.S. Geological Survey's Bird Banding Laboratory to identify sex-specific trends in annual Northern Saw-whet Owl (Aegolius acadicus) movement during autumn migration across eastern North America. The study included 40710 individuals with assigned sex, 14% of which were assigned male and 86% were assigned female. Males were disproportionately banded at higher latitudes, and regional differences existed in sex ratios of owls at different banding stations, suggesting sex-specific migration patterns exist in this species. We used DNA analysis of 592 saw-whet owls caught in eastern New York to evaluate the accuracy of the morphometric methods used by banders to sex the majority of saw-whet owls reported in the Bird Banding Laboratory archives. Eighty-five percent of these owls could be sexed morphometrically and 97% of the morphometric assignments were congruent with genetic analysis. However, the current morphometric method disproportionately assigned males to the "unknown" class. We tested measurement reproducibility between banders and morphometric plasticity by comparing measurements of owls banded and subsequently recaptured by different banders. Mass changed 0.66 ± 6.82 g and wing chord changed 0.29 mm ± 3.34 on average between captures. The low variation in measurements between captures and the high congruence between genetic and morphometric sexing methods support the sex-specific migration hypothesis. © 2012 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: In this study the structure of the larynx, trachea and syrinx of 7 eagle owls (3 females and 4 males) were morphologically examined by means of a steoro-microscope. Cone shaped papillae at each side of the mons laryngealis were observed. The caudal part (Mons laryngealis) in comparison to the cranial part was larger and possessed four transverse rows and two sagittal rows. Cartilaginous roof of the larynx was formed by the cricoid, procncoid and double arytenoid cartilages. The trachea passed to the left side of the esophagus at the 1/4 of the neck. The number of tracheal ring changed from 107-110 and all were complete. The sternotracheal muscle arised from the craniolateral process of the sternum and attached to the tracheal ring at the level of the 96th ring. The last 4-5 tracheal rings and the first 1-2 bronchial rings were involved in the formation of the syrinx. The first tracheal ring was complete whereas the dorsal and ventral ends of the last 3-4 tracheal rings were in a shape of open half moon. The pessulus was noted between ventral ends of the second tracheal ring. The tympanium was formed by the last 1-2 tracheal rings and the first bronchial ring. The number of bronchus from syrinx to the lung were observed being between 19 and 20. © Medwell Journals, 2011.

ABSTRACT: We studied the dietary niche of the Barn Owl (Tyto alba) in temperate agroecosystems of central Argentina by describing seasonal and geographic variation in the food habits of this owl in four districts of the Pampean region (Flooding, Inland, Rolling, and Southern Pampas). We identified 21,925 prey items from samples of fresh pellets collected in summer (n = 23) and winter (n = 26). Mammals,' mostly sigmodontine rodents, were the main prey items (91.9%), followed by amphibians (6.5%) and birds (1.6%). Arthropods were also a common prey item (found in 45% of the samples). The consumption of arthropods and amphibians was higher in summer than in winter, indicating that seasonal changes in prey abundances are reflected in the Barn Owl diet. We found no differences in food-niche breadth among the four study districts, but food-niche breadth varied between seasons, being higher during summer. Six rodent species were common to all districts: Calomys spp., Akodon azarae, Oligoryzomys flavescens, Mus musculus, Rattus spp., and Holochilus brasiliensis. Calomys spp. was numerically dominant in 46 of the 49 samples, and together with A. azarae and O. flavescens comprised the bulk of the diet (> 80%). Predation on rodents may reflect population dynamics of the prey species with high predation rates when peaks in abundance of sigmodontine rodents occurred (autumn-winter). © The Neotropical Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: We studied the nest sites, diet, and habitat use of the endemic population of the Daito Scops Owl (Otus elegans interpositus), a subspecies of the Elegant Scops Owl (O. elegans), on a small oceanic island, Minami-daito, in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. We also investigated the relationships between habitat characteristics and breeding performance in the fragmented and developed habitats on the island. Most owls used nest cavities in introduced casuarina (Casuarina spp.) trees (n = 30), whereas a few owls used vertical hollows in broken native fan palm (Livistona chinensis; n = 2) as their nest sites. Owls fed on prey inhabiting both forests and open areas, including spiders (Heteropoda), cockroaches (Blattodea), grasshoppers (Orthoptera) and geckos (Gekkonidae). We tracked 17 territorial males and seven females using radiotelemetry in 200207. More than half of the owls selected Ficus forests during the breeding season. During the nonbreeding season, most owls selected edges between forests and open areas such as grasslands and sugar cane fields. Owls with more edge habitat within their home ranges laid eggs earlier (n = 88 breeding attempts) than those with smaller amounts of edge. Daito Scops Owls exhibited behavioral flexibility in their use of human-altered habitats on Minami-daito Island, which may have contributed to their avoidance of extinction. © 2011 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: We describe an ecotoxicological model that simulates the sublethal and lethal effects of chronic, low-level, chemical exposure on birds wintering in agricultural landscapes. Previous models estimating the impact on wildlife of chemicals used in agro-ecosystems typically have not included the variety of pathways, including both dermal and oral, by which individuals are exposed. The present model contains four submodels simulating (1) foraging behavior of individual birds, (2) chemical applications to crops, (3) transfers of chemicals among soil, insects, and small mammals, and (4) transfers of chemicals to birds via ingestion and dermal exposure. We demonstrate use of the model by simulating the impacts of a variety of commonly used herbicides, insecticides, growth regulators, and defoliants on western burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia hypugaea) that winter in agricultural landscapes in southern Texas, United States. The model generated reasonable movement patterns for each chemical through soil, water, insects, and rodents, as well as into the owl via consumption and dermal absorption. Sensitivity analysis suggested model predictions were sensitive to uncertainty associated with estimates of chemical half-lives in birds, soil, and prey, sensitive to parameters associated with estimating dermal exposure, and relatively insensitive to uncertainty associated with details of chemical application procedures (timing of application, amount of drift). Nonetheless, the general trends in chemical accumulations and the relative impacts of the various chemicals were robust to these parameter changes. Simulation results suggested that insecticides posed a greater potential risk to owls of both sublethal and lethal effects than do herbicides, defoliants, and growth regulators under crop scenarios typical of southern Texas, and that use of multiple indicators, or endpoints provided a more accurate assessment of risk due to agricultural chemical exposure. The model should prove useful in helping prioritize the chemicals and transfer pathways targeted in future studies and also, as these new data become available, in assessing the relative danger to other birds of exposure to different types of agricultural chemicals. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Insect diversity correlates negatively with increasing management intensity of grasslands and with latitude. We supposed that similar patterns might be found in the diet spectra of insectivorous birds. The diet composition of the insectivorous scops owl was studied by analysing the prey remnants collected from 21 nests during 2008-2009 in an extensively cultivated rural area in the centre of the owl's distribution range in Central Romania. Altogether 831 prey items belonging to 45 prey taxa were identified. Similarly to the other parts of the scops owl range, orthopterans were high dominant prey items (86.8%) - especially bush-crickets Tettigoniidae (78.6%). In food samles were found also beetles (Coleoptera, 5.7%) and rarely spiders Araneidea, moths Lepidoptera, mantids Mantodea, Hymenoptera and Neuroptera (<1.5%). Vertebrates were rarely represented by rodents (2.5%) and passerines (1.3%). The following diagnostic prey species were identified in 20 nests using the MDFM method: bush-crickets Tettigonia viridissima, Decticus verrucivorus, Metrioptera bicolor and other species of the family Tettigoniidae, the beetle Onthophagus spp., the cricket Gryllus campestris and other unidentified beetles Coleoptera g. sp. Furthermore, the scops owl's diet in different parts of its range was compared. As expected, there were more Orthoptera and generally more prey taxa in food in the range centre than at its northern limit. © 2012 Raptor Protection of Slovakia (RPS).

ABSTRACT: Developing strategies that reduce the impacts of climate change on biodiversity will require projections of the future status of species under alternative climate change scenarios. Demographic models based on empirical data that link temporal variation in climate with vital rates can improve the accuracy of such predictions and help guide conservation efforts. Here, we characterized how population dynamics and extinction risk might be affected by climate change for three spotted owl (Strix occidentalis) populations in the Southwestern United States over the next century. Specifically, we used stochastic, stage-based matrix models parameterized with vital rates linked to annual variation in temperature and precipitation to project owl populations forward in time under three IPCC emissions scenarios relative to contemporary climate. Owl populations in Arizona and New Mexico were predicted to decline rapidly over the next century and had a much greater probability of extinction under all three emissions scenarios than under current climate conditions. In contrast, owl population dynamics in Southern California were relatively insensitive to predicted changes in climate, and extinction risk was low for this population under all scenarios. The difference in predicted climate change impacts between these areas was due to negative associations between warm, dry conditions and owl vital rates in Arizona and New Mexico, whereas cold, wet springs reduced reproduction in Southern California. Predicted changes in population growth rates were mediated more by weather-induced changes in fecundity than survival, and were generally more sensitive to increases in temperature than declines in precipitation. Our results indicate that spotted owls in arid environments may be highly vulnerable to climate change, even in core parts of the owl's range. More broadly, contrasting responses to climate change among populations highlight the need to tailor conservation strategies regionally, and modeling efforts such as ours can help prioritize the allocation of resources in this regard. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

ABSTRACT: We investigated the post-fledging ecology of the Northern Pygmy-Owl (Glaucidium gnoma) at two study areas in the Rocky Mountains of Montana and Idaho from 2002 to 2009. We observed 16 successful nesting attempts that fledged from two to seven young. Fledging dates ranged from 18 June to 5 August and all nests were vacated within a 2-day period. Post-fledging behavioral data were collected regularly from fledging through initiation of natal dispersal from five radiomarked family groups and opportunistically from three additional family groups. Post-fledging movement data were collected from eight family groups and two males that were suspected of nesting. Adults attended broods for 9 to 30 days (females) and 31 to 34 days (males) postfledging, after which they were not observed associating with their young. Young remained within the natal territory for 1 to 10 days following departure of adult males, after which they abruptly initiated natal dispersal. Areas used by family groups during the post-fledging dependency period ranged from 34.6 to 94.5 ha. Family groups were active throughout the day, but activity was notably more intense during crepuscular periods. Our earliest observations of young hunting occurred 9 days after fledging and 47% of all fledgling hunting attempts observed (n = 75) were successful. Adults and fledglings used vocalizations in contexts consistent with previous descriptions with the exception of an undescribed two-note vocalization that appeared to function as a contact call preceding prey deliveries. © 2012 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: Nominate Barn Owls Tyto a. alba can be sexed based on flecking patterns of the underwing and underbody, but in the Dutch population consisting of the nominate subspecies and T. a. guttata, overlap in flecking exists between the sexes. In this paper we describe a new method to sex Barn Owls based on apical bar widths of the primaries. Data were obtained from 240 dead Barn Owls that were sexed by autopsy. The apical bars of the primaries 10 and 8 were narrower than 7.5 mm in males and wider than 7.5 mm in females. The widths of more basal bars of the primaries and secondaries overlapped between the sexes. The method was validated by providing 20 carcasses to 10 instructed volunteers, who measured the apical bar widths to sex the birds. The measuring error per owl specimen averaged at 2.2% (range 0.8-3.9%), and the proper sex was assigned in all cases.

ABSTRACT: Partially migratory populations provide excellent opportunities to study why animals migrate. Three hypotheses have been proposed to explain the variations in individual migratory decisions: the body-size hypothesis, the arrival-time hypothesis, and the dominance hypothesis. These hypotheses were developed for long-distance migrants breeding in the temperate region; whether the same mechanisms affect small-scale partial migration in the subtropical zone remain to be examined. In this study, we analyzed the condition dependence of the small-scale migratory behavior of Lanyu scops owl (Otus elegans botelensis) and examined the costs and benefits of alternative strategies. We found that migrants gained more weight than residents during the nonbreeding season. Resident males were more likely to breed the following year than migrant males, and resident females were more likely to breed successfully than migrant females. Our results showed that male owls tended to be resident, supporting the arrival-time hypothesis. The sexual difference in migratory tendency does not support the body-size hypothesis, which predicts the lighter weighted male to be more migratory than the heavier females. Also, within the same sex, migratory tendency was not related to body mass. The patterns that younger owls and nonbreeders were more migratory than older ones, and breeders are consistent with the dominance hypothesis. However, Lanyu scops owl does not demonstrate winter food competition as assumed by the dominance hypothesis. We propose that the difference in the probability of breeding between dominant and subordinate owls lead to dominance-dependent partial migration. © 2011 The Author.

ABSTRACT: Capsule Despite very high breeding density, no density-dependent effects on reproductive parameters were detected. Aims To describe the distribution, abundance and breeding performance of Eagle Owls and to analyse density-dependent effects on breeding parameters. Methods We censused a high-density population of Eagle Owls in southeast Spain between 2003 and 2010. To census the population we employed acoustic signals and searched for field signs. Breeding performance was determined by nest monitoring. Results The population's density, productivity and fledgling rate were the highest recorded for this species. We detected a negative relationship between the laying date and productivity. Despite breeding pairs' high density, no density-dependent effects on reproductive parameters were detected. Conclusions Our results suggest that resources in the study area (mainly the availability of Rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus) and adult turnover might be responsible for this population's high density and breeding success. © 2012 Copyright British Trust for Ornithology.

ABSTRACT: The IAEA is currently preparing a new Technical Reports Series (TRS) Handbook on the Transfer of Radionuclides to Wildlife. Key deficiencies have been identified and one is the lack of data for birds. In this study we measured the transfer of a range of elements measured by neutron activation analysis (NAA) and gamma analysis in four Barn owls (Tyto alba) and one Tawny owl (Strix aluco) from archived samples available from the Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme, http://pbms.ceh.ac.uk. Transfer was quantified as the whole organism concentration ratio (CRwo-soil) and values for Co, Fe, Rb, Sc, Zn and 137Cs are presented. The work demonstrates the potential for existing sample archives to be exploited for radioecological purposes. They represent a cost effective means to derive CRwo-media values for organism-radionuclide combinations relevant to radiological assessments without the requirement of field sampling. © 2011 EDP Sciences.

ABSTRACT: The diets of the barn owl (Tyto alba) and the spotted owlet (Athene brama) inhabiting the periphery of the Cholistan Desert at Ahmedpur East, southern Punjab were compared. Pellets of the two owl species were analyzed to learn more about their diets. The barn owl mainly consumed Suncus murinus (60.2%), birds (24.1%) and rodents (12.7%), while the spotted owlet depended on Mus species (36.8%), Suncus murinus (20.1%), birds (14.1%), reptiles (8.9%) and insects (6.7%) for its food. There was a low degree of food overlap of the two owls among the seasons. © 2012 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.

ABSTRACT: During the last decades, farmland habitats in central European countries have changed significantly, seriously affecting populations of many farmland bird species. We compiled available published data on densities of three owl species, Athene noctua, Asio otus and Strix aluco collected in the Polish farmland. All results of censuses based on the playback method conducted between 1980-2005 were included in the analysis. The proportions of grassland, fields, built-up land and forest at each studied plot were estimated and used as predictors in additive models. Proportions of main land use types, extracted with the principal component analysis, explained much of the variation found in owl densities, although some of the relationships were nonlinear. In general, owl densities were found to be affected positively by a high percentage of grasslands and built-up land, and negatively by the amount of fields and forests. Little owl densities showed a significant negative trend over the study period. It seems that high prey availability is an important factor accounting for the positive relationship between grassland proportion and owl density. The significant decrease in grassland areas and increase in forest coverage that were recently recorded in Poland may thus negatively affect populations of the three owl species studied here. © 2012 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Wien.

ABSTRACT: Conservation planning for the federally threatened northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) requires an ability to predict their responses to existing and future habitat conditions. To inform such planning we modeled habitat selection by northern spotted owls based upon fine-scale (approx. 1.0 ha) characteristics within stands comprised primarily of mixed-aged, mixed coniferous forests of southwestern Oregon and north-central California. We sampled nocturnal (i.e., primarily foraging) habitat use by 71 radio-tagged spotted owls over 5 yr in 3 study areas and sampled vegetative and physical environmental conditions at inventory plots within 95% utilization distributions of each bird. We compared conditions at available forest patches, represented by the inventory plots, with those at patches used by owls using discrete-choice regressions, the coefficients from which were used to construct exponential resource selection functions (RSFs) for each study area and for all 3 areas combined. Cross-validation testing indicated that the combined RSF was reasonably robust to local variation in habitat availability. The relative probability that a fine-scale patch was selected decreased nonlinearly with distances from nests and streams; varied unimodally with increasing average diameter of coniferous trees and also with increasing basal area of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) trees; increased linearly with increasing basal areas of sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana) and hardwood trees and with increasing density of understory shrubs. Large-diameter trees (>66 cm) appeared important <400 m from nest sites. The RSF can support comparative risk assessments of the short- versus long-term effects of silvicultural alternatives designed to integrate forest ecosystem restoration and habitat improvement for northern spotted owls. Results suggest fine-scale factors may influence population fitness among spotted owls. © 2011 The Wildlife Society. Copyright © The Wildlife Society, 2011.

ABSTRACT: Herpesvirus saimiri was naturally transmitted from squirrel monkeys excreting the virus to one of two owl monkeys housed in the same cage. The owl monkey became infected approximately three months after contact was initiated. H. saimiri was consistently isolated from the peripheral lymphocytes until this animal died eight months later. During this period the owl monkey developed specific antibody to H. saimiri to a maximal neutralization index of 5.5 logs. The other monkey remained uninfected for an observation period of one year. The documentation of this horizontal transmission of H. saimiri infection from squirrel monkeys to an owl monkey suggests that owl monkeys developing spontaneous malignant lymphomas associated with H. saimiri infection may also have acquired the infection in this manner.

ABSTRACT: This is the second in a series of periodic monitoring reports on northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) population and habitat trends on federally administered lands since implementation of the Northwest Forest Plan in 1994. Here we summarize results from a population analysis that included data from longterm demographic studies during 1985-2008. This data was analyzed separately by study area, and also in a meta-analysis across all study areas to assess temporal and spatial patterns in fecundity, apparent survival, recruitment, and annual rates of population change. Estimated rates of annual population decline ranged from 0.4 to 7.1 percent across federal study areas (weighted average of 2.8 percent). Covariates for barred owls (Strix varia), weather, climate, habitat, and reproductive success were analyzed and had varying degrees of association with owl demographic parameters. We now have more evidence that increasing numbers of barred owls and loss of nesting/roosting habitat contributed to demographic declines in some study areas. We also summarize results from a habitat analysis that used the above data in conjunction with remotely sensed data from 1994 to 2007 to develop "habitat suitability" models and habitat maps. These maps were used to quantify the amount and distribution of owl habitats. We also report on causes of habitat change during this period. On federal lands, nesting/roosting habitat declined by 3.4 percent rangewide, with some physiographic provinces experiencing losses of 10 percent. Dispersal habitat increased by 5.2 percent, but dispersal-capable landscapes declined by 1 percent. Wildfire remains the leading cause of habitat loss. We developed a rangewide "wildfire suitability" model and map to illuminate the portions of the owl's range where suitable nesting/roosting habitat overlaps with landscapes suitable for the occurrence of large wildfires. Barred owls and management of owl habitat in fire-prone areas continue to be topics for future monitoring, research, and management consideration.

ABSTRACT: An anomalously large and coloured egg was found within a clutch of the Northern Saw-whet Owl (Aegolius acadicus) in Nova Scotia; all other eggs of the clutch were within the normal size and colour range for the species. Analysis of three mitochondrial genes suggests all eggs in the clutch were laid by Northern Saw-whet Owl(s) with similar genetic make-up. This is the first report of an anomalous egg from this species, and a rare example of added pigment. © The Canadian Field-Naturalist.

ABSTRACT: Previous studies of short-eared owl Asio flammeus (Pontoppidan) diet in Ireland have all been relatively small in scale and restricted in time. A total of 759 prey items were recovered and identified for this study during six winters (2005/2006-2010/2011). A further 271 prey items collected by the same authors in 2004/2005 for a previous study makes this the largest body of work on the prey of short-eared owls carried out in Ireland to date at 1030 prey items. Bird prey made up 55.9% by number and 83.1% by weight, and mammal prey made up 42.4% by number and 16.9% by weight. Thirteen invertebrates were also recovered. Dunlin Calidris alpina (L.) was the most frequently taken bird species, followed by snipe Gallinago gallinago (L.) and redshank Tringa totanus (L.). Together, these three wading birds formed 62.2% of prey by weight. Passerine birds were also taken, but only the thrush family (Turdus spp), collectively, was of any importance at 10.1% of prey by weight. The wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus (L.) was the most frequently taken mammal species (8.2% by weight), while smaller numbers of other rodents and shrews were taken. Dunlin was an important prey species up to February, but declined thereafter, while snipe and redshank remained important throughout the winter. Passerine birds were also taken throughout the period, but their overall contribution was lower than that of wading birds. Brown rats Rattus norvegicus (Berkenhout) and small mammals were taken throughout, but their monthly contribution was generally below 20%, except for one occasion in April in one year. Chi-square tests showed significant differences in some prey species and categories between months and years. While the reasons for some of the differences remain unknown, others are related to prey numbers available in any given month. There is also a suggestion that the severe winter of 2010/2011 influenced the higher than expected number of dunlin, and the lower than expected number of small mammals taken as prey in that winter. © ROYAL IRISH ACADEMY.

ABSTRACT: Satellite telemetry can provide valuable information on spatial ecology of animals, especially in species inhabiting remote areas such as the Arctic. However, caution is always needed when selecting transmitter size and attachment methods because of the potential negative impact of the device itself on individuals. We determined survival and reproductive performance of adult female snowy owls (Bubo scandiacus) tracked by satellite to evaluate potential adverse effects of transmitters. In summer 2007, we captured 12 adult females on their nest in the Canadian Arctic, marked them with 30-g harness-mounted transmitters, and tracked their movement for up to 3 years. All marked birds resumed normal activities shortly (<60 min) after release and none deserted their nest. We had 2 known deaths and 2 transmitters that stopped moving over 3 years, yielding an annual survival rate between 85.2 Â± 7.0% and 92.3 Â± 5.7%. Moreover, summer movement patterns, combined with ground checks in several cases, suggested that all successfully tracked birds initiated a nest every year after marking. Finally, laying date and clutch size of individuals did not differ before and after marking. Overall, our data indicate that life history traits of adult female snowy owls were not affected by satellite transmitters. © 2012 The Wildlife Society. Copyright © The Wildlife Society, 2012.

ABSTRACT: In 2011 and 2012 two breedings by a pair of Eurasian eagle owls were observed in an old white-tailed eagles' nest at Blatná Polianka in the Senianske rybníky SPA. The nest was situated in a grey poplar tree 15-20 m above the ground in a treebuffer by the rivulet Okna, in open lowland landscape without woodland, just with linear tree vegetation and scattered trees. In 2011 incubation of the clutch was observed and the female was present in the nest even at the end of April, when the fledglings were probably already present in the nest, but no more data on their further success were obtained. In 2012 the pair of Eurasian eagle owls bred in the same nest again, but in May the nest was already abandoned and we suppose predation of the clutch, probably by ravens. This occasion is the third known breeding attempt by the Eurasian eagle owl in a raptor nest built in a tree, and the first known occasion of breeding in a white-tailed eagles' nest in Slovakia. The obtained data also document the further spreading of the species in the Dolný Zemplín region into unusual habitats of a lowland agricultural landscape with very few trees. © 2012 Raptor Protection of Slovakia (RPS).

ABSTRACT: Abstract. Background: Rabies causes an acute fatal encephalomyelitis in most mammals following infection with rhabdovirus of the genus Lyssavirus. Little is known about rabies virus infection in species of New World non-human Primates (NHP). To investigate the suitability of the owl monkey Aotus nancymaae asissue sections examined were unremarkable for inflammation or other histologic signs of rabies a viable animal model for rabies virus candidate vaccine testing, we used clinical presentation, serology, viral isolation, and PCR to evaluate the incubation period, immunity, and pathogenesis of infected animals. We tested the hypothesis that no viremic state exists for rabies virus. Methods. Eight monkeys divided into two equal groups were inoculated intramuscularly either in the neck or footpad with 105 pfu of rabies virus (Pasteur/V-13R) and observed for >130days. Oral and blood samples were collected and analyzed. Results: Two monkeys inoculated in the neck displayed classic paralytic rabies. The mean incubation period was 11.5days. The average maximum IgG response (antibody titer >0.200 O.D.) was achieved at day 10.0 and 62.3 in the clinical rabies and non-clinical rabies cases, respectively (p=0.0429). No difference in IgM or IgG time to seroconversion or average maximum IgM level was observed between neck versus footpad inoculation groups. No viremia or viral shedding was detected by PCR or viral isolation during the observation period, including within the two symptomatic animals three days after disease onset. Tissue sections examined were unremarkable for inflammation or other histologic signs of rabies within the asymptomatic animal. Similarly none of the brain sections exhibited immunoreactivity for rabies virus antibody. Discussion. This study demonstrates there is no difference in time to immune response between inoculation sites and distance to the brain; however, immune response tends to be more rapid in cases of clinically apparent disease and prolonged in cases infected at sites further from the brain. Conclusions: Our findings support the hypothesis that a viremic state for rabies does not exist in the New World Monkey, Aotus nancymaae, and it appears that this species may be refractory to infection. The species does provide a suitable model to assess post infection immune responses. Additional studies that address the limitations of sample size, length of observation, and lack of measurable infection should be conducted. © 2012 Reaves et al.;The article is a work of the United States Government; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Despite the widespread distribution of Northern Saw-whet Owls (Aegolius acadicus), little is known about their population numbers, trends, or migratory behavior within the Canadian prairies. We studied saw-whet owl population trends and migratory behavior in the north-central portion of the species range, and evaluated possible mechanisms explaining these observed patterns. We examined population trends, demographics, and migratory timing using 9 yr of banding data collected by the Delta Marsh Bird Observatory (DMBO) migration-monitoring program. We documented a regularly timed autumn migration consisting of primarily hatch-year males and females and adult females. Large annual fluctuations in owl abundance resulted in low statistical power to detect trends. We detected no significant trend in total owl numbers; however, we detected significant increases in the numbers of second-year and after-second-year females. We compared DMBO migration data to spring abundance data from the Manitoba and Saskatchewan Nocturnal Owl Survey (NOS). Significant positive correlations between the DMBO and NOS datasets provided confidence that our annual owl abundance estimates were representative of actual changes in owl abundance, and suggested that population trends were synchronized over large geographic regions spanning both provinces. © 2012 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The Blakiston's fish owl (Bubo blakistoni) population on Hokkaido Island, Japan, decreased to less than one hundred individuals over the last century due to habitat disruption by human activity. Although the ongoing conservation management has slightly restored the population, it remains endangered. In order to assess the genetic variation and population structure of the Blakiston's fish owl in Hokkaido, we genotyped eight microsatellite loci on 120 individuals sampled over the past three decades. The genotype data set showed low levels of genetic variation and gene flow among the geographically isolated five subpopulations. Comparative analysis of past and current populations indicated that some alleles shared by past individuals had been lost, and that genetic variation had declined over the last three decades. The result suggests that the genetic decline may have resulted from inbreeding and/or genetic drift due to bottlenecks in the Hokkaido population. The present study provides invaluable genetic information for the conservation and management of the endangered Blakiston's fish owl in Hokkaido. © 2012 Zoological Society of Japan.

ABSTRACT: The maintenance of phenotypic variation is a central question in evolutionary biology. A commonly suggested mechanism is that of local adaptation, whereby different phenotypes are adapted to alternative environmental conditions. A recent study in the European barn owl (Tyto alba) has shown that natural selection maintains a strong clinal variation in reddish pheomelanin-based coloration. Studies in the region where phenotypic variation in this owl is the highest in Europe have further demonstrated that dark-reddish and pale-reddish owls exploit open and wooded habitats, predate voles and wood mice, and are long-tailed and short-tailed, respectively. However, it remains unclear as to whether these traits evolved as a consequence of allopatric evolution of dark colour in northern Europe and white colour in southern Europe, during which owls could have also evolved different morphologies and foraging behaviour. This scenario implies that covariation between coloration and foraging behaviour could be a specificity of the European continent, which is not found in other worldwide-distributed populations. To investigate this issue, we studied a barn owl population in the Middle East. The results obtained show that, as in Central Europe, dark-reddish female owls breed more often in the open landscape than their pale-reddish female conspecifics, their offspring are fed with more voles than Muridae, and they are longer-winged and longer-tailed. These findings indicate that, in the barn owl, the association in females between pheomelanin-based coloration and foraging behaviour and morphology is not restricted to the European continent but may well evolve in sympatry in many barn owl populations worldwide. © 2012 The Linnean Society of London.

ABSTRACT: Lepidoptera fauna of five owl species nests were investigated in Japan. Seventeen moth species were identified: Niditinea striolella (Tineidae), Agonopterix sp. (Elachistidae) from Blakiston's Fish Owl, Ketupa blakistoni, nests; Monopis longella (= pavlovskii), M. flavidorsalis, M. sp., M. congestella, Niditinea baryspilas, N. striolella, N. sp. (Tineidae), Martyringa ussuriella (Oecophoridae), Mabra charonialis (Crambidae), Pyralis regalis (Pyralidae) from Ural Owl, Strix uralensis, nests; Tinea translucens, Niditinea baryspilas (Tineidae) from Brown Hawk-Owl, Ninox scutulata, nests; Opogona sacchari, O. sp., Phaeoses sp. (Tineidae) from Collared Scops Owl, Otus lempiji, nests; and Opogona sacchari, Phaeoses sp., Setomorpha sp. (Tineidae), Endotricha theonalis (Pyralidae) from Ryukyu Scops Owl, Otus elegans, nests. The moth nest fauna varied among owl species. The differences were related to owl prey (fish, small animals and birds, insects) and habitats (urban area, forest), and the tineid species selecting the nest. Tineids are presumed to decompose keratin found in owl nests and help maintain the cleanliness of the nest chamber, and such relationships between tineids and owls may be mutualistic. Rapid burrowing into owl nest materials by tineids may reflect a strategy to avoid being preyed upon by the nest owners. © The Ornithological Society of Japan 2012.

ABSTRACT: We studied reversed sexual dimorphism (RSD) and foraging behavior of Barn Owls (Tyto alba). Bill length, tarsus length, wing chord, tail length, and mass of Barn Owls showed RSD. Mass of the prey items brought by the males was significantly less than that brought by females, which may be attributed to the positive correlation between size of the owl and prey mass. However, male owls had a significantly higher frequency of visits with prey than did females. There was relatively little overlap in the species and mass of prey captured by males and females, suggesting that food-niche partitioning between the sexes may exist, possibly to reduce intersexual food competition. Further, because these differences were also observed between the male and female owls within each pair, our findings support reproductive role division as a possible explanation for RSD in Barn Owls. © 2012 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Much of our understanding of vocal geographic variation in birds is based on the dialects of oscine songbirds that learn their songs. Recent studies have revealed that nonoscine vocal behavior is more complex than previously thought, yet we still have a rudimentary understanding of how vocalizations of suboscine and nonpasserine birds are infuenced by genetic and geographic variation. We examined geographic variation in male calls, female calls, and duets of Barred Owls (Strix varia) among 10 locations across the southeastern United States. Recent molecular work revealed two genetically distinct clades of Barred Owl at either end of our transect, with substantial introgression in between. We predicted that calls would vary with genetic distance in a clinal pattern, but that duets and duetting behavior might exhibit dialects similar to that of learned bird song. Discriminant analysis did not reveal any components of vocalizations or vocal behavior that could be used to assign vocalizations to the correct recording location. There were no relationships between any aspect of vocal structure or behavior and geographic distance. Some characteristics of male and female calls and duets varied among locations, but there was no discernible geographic pattern. We suggest that such inconsistent geographic variation in vocalizations is not unexpected for non-song-learning species. The lack of geographic pattern in vocalizations may be due, in part, to high levels of individual variation, recent signal evolution, and local adaptations. We discuss the application of these results to the ontogeny and evolution of complex, coordinated vocal behavior in nonpasserines. © The American Ornithologists' Union, 2012. Printed in USA.

ABSTRACT: This note reports an attack by an adult Tawny Owl Strix aluco on an adult female Long-eared Owl Asio otus on its nest. The event occurred on 1 April 2007 and was recorded with a high definition infrared camera installed near the nest ten days earlier. The Long-eared Owl nest was in a stone pine Pinus pinea and contained four six-day-old chicks. Some 261 meters away from this nest, an oak contained a Tawny Owl nest with two about 20-day-old chicks. The Tawny Owl attack lasted for five seconds, during which time the Long-eared Owl repelled the attack and kept her chicks safe. Interspecific competition between Long-eared and Tawny owls is known, although attempts at nest predation have seldom been described.

ABSTRACT: We studied the diet of the Common Barn-Owl (Tyto alba) in the Dry Chaco of Santiago del Estero, Argentina. From 332 pellets collected between 2007 and 2009 we analyzed the seasonal variation in number and biomass of prey-items, diversity, and trophic niche width. We identified 1170 individuals belonging to 14 prey-items, corresponding to mammals (87%), birds (7%) and insects (6%). Cricetid rodents were the most frequent group (85%) with the highest biomass contribution (>75%), being Calomys spp. the most abundant item. During the dry season of the first year, the abundance of micromammals reached the highest values while birds and insects showed the opposite pattern. Diversity and trophic niche width showed their highest values during the wet season and niche overlap was lower between samples of different seasons. Seasonal variation in biomass was mostly due to a higher consumption of birds during the wet season of 2008. In the wet season of the second year the diet showed an anomalous behaviour, in some cases showing the opposite of the expected patterns, probably related to a pronounced decrease in rainfall. The results of this study allow us to confirm a generalist-opportunistic diet, with high consumption of micromammals during the dry season probably explained by their high population sizes. Environmental modifications could be explaining the extreme dominance of Calomys spp., as it has been documented in other regions of Argentina.

ABSTRACT: Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine insecticides (OCs) were analysed in 58 Eurasian Eagle owl (Bubo bubo) unhatched eggs collected between 2004 and 2009 in Southeastern Spain. Levels of p,p'-DDE were found to be higher than in eggs laid by other European owls in the same decade, probably due to the greater agricultural activity in our study area. Compared to other European raptors, exposure to PCBs can be considered intermediate, but low to PBDEs. Land use differences and prey availability were the rationale to divide the study area in two subareas in further assessments. Temporal trends of HCB, p,p'-DDE, β-HCH, PCBs and PBDEs were significantly different in each subarea, generally increasing over time in the Southern but decreasing or remaining stable in the Northern. On the contrary, levels of cyclodienes tended to decrease in both subareas. Dietary shifts with a greater amount of birds are suggested as a cause for increasing organochlorine loads in raptors. This may explain the increasing trend in the Southern territories. However, due to the proximity of most of these nests to Cartagena, an important industrial city, increasing environmental pollution cannot be ruled out. Although average levels of the compounds analysed are below threshold levels, 17% of the samples exceeded 400pgg-1ww (wet weight), the LOAEC for Total TEQs. Moreover, a negative correlation between TEQ concentrations and the metabolizable fraction of PCBs (Fprob=0.0018) was found when TEQs values were above 10pgg-1ww. This could be indicative of hepatic enzymes induction in the birds exposed at higher concentrations, which are mainly breeding in the Southern subarea. These females could be suffering from Ah-receptor-related toxic effects, some of which have been related to altered bird reproduction. Finally, a significant negative correlation between p,p'-DDE levels and eggshell thickness (r=-0.469, p<0.001) was observed, with about 17% of eggshell thinning for eggs with p,p'-DDE levels above 100μgg-1lw. The persistence of this degree of thinning over a period of time has been related to population declines in other raptor species. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Abstract We investigated if relative abundance of invertebrate prey for Athene cunicularia floridana (Florida Burrowing Owl) differed between two pre-translocation (i.e., non-mined) sites and one translocation (i.e., reclaimed mine) site. We trapped a combination of 21 arthropod families and orders. We observed some differences among non-mined sites and the reclaimed mine site in invertebrate prey abundance and owl diet. Fewer than 50% (10 of 21) of trapped prey items were present in pellets, suggesting that our traps may have limited capture of particular prey. Additionally, it appears that owls were hunting in nearby aquatic habitats due to the remains of frogs, turtles, and crayfish in pellets. The general similarity in prey abundance and diet between the pre-translocation and translocation sites suggests that reclaimed mine sites may serve as adequate refugia for Florida Burrowing Owls. However, more work is needed to determine to verify the general applicability of our results.

ABSTRACT: The ecology and function of many Australian predators has likely been disrupted following major changes in prey base due to declines in distribution and abundance of small mammals following European settlement. This study investigated various aspects of the dietary ecology of sooty owls (Tyto tenebricosa tenebricosa), including sexual variation as they potentially exhibit the greatest degree of reversed sexual dimorphism of any owl species worldwide. Sooty owls are highly opportunistic predators of non-volant small mammals, consuming most species known to exist in the region, so their diet fluctuates seasonally and spatially due to varying prey availability, and is particularly influenced by the breeding cycles of prey. Significant intersexual dietary differences existed with female sooty owls predominantly consuming much larger prey items than males, with dietary overlap at 0.62. The current reliance on relatively few native mammalian species is of conservation concern, especially when mammal declines are unlikely to have ceased as many threatening processes still persist in the landscape. Sooty owl conservation appears inextricably linked with small mammal conservation. Conservation efforts should be focussed towards improving prey densities and prey habitat, primarily by implementing control programs for feral predators and preventing the loss of hollow-bearing trees throughout the landscape. © 2007 CSIRO.

ABSTRACT: In the United States, new regulatory restrictions have been placed on the use of some second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides. This action may be offset by expanded use of first-generation compounds (e.g., diphacinone; DPN). Single-day acute oral exposure of adult Eastern screech-owls (Megascops asio) to DPN evoked overt signs of intoxication, coagulopathy, histopathological lesions (e.g., hemorrhage, hepatocellular vacuolation), and/ or lethality at doses as low as 130 mg/kg body weight, although there was no dose-response relation. However, this single-day exposure protocol does not mimic the multiple-day field exposures required to cause mortality in rodent pest species and non-target birds and mammals. In 7-day feeding trials, similar toxic effects were observed in owls fed diets containing 2.15, 9.55 or 22.6 ppm DPN, but at a small fraction (<5%) of the acute oral dose. In the dietary trial, the average lowest-observed-adverse-effectlevel for prolonged clotting time was 1.68 mg DPN/kg owl/week (0.24 mg/kg owl/day; 0.049 mg/owl/day) and the lowest lethal dose was 5.75 mg DPN/kg owl/week (0.82 mg/kg owl/day). In this feeding trial, DPN concentration in liver ranged from 0.473 to 2.21 lg/g wet weight, and was directly related to the daily and cumulative dose consumed by each owl. A probabilistic risk assessment indicated that daily exposure to as little as 3-5 g of liver from DPN-poisoned rodents for 7 days could result in prolonged clotting time in the endangered Hawaiian shorteared owl (Asio flammeus sandwichensis) and Hawaiian hawk (Buteo solitarius), and daily exposure to greater quantities (9-13 g of liver) could result in low-level mortality. These findings can assist natural resource managers in weighing the costs and benefits of anticoagulant rodenticide use in pest control and eradication programs. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC (outside the USA).

ABSTRACT: We explored the breeding biology of the Northern Pygmy-Owl (Glaucidium gnoma) from 2007 to 2009 in a forested reserve in Portland, Oregon. Large body size is often assumed to give animals reproductive advantages, and we tested whether body size affected timing of breeding and examined variation in diet, breeding date, clutch size, and reproductive success to explore whether the presumed benefits of large body size are evident in this species. The average size of 13 clutches was 5.8, and nest success was high (92%); 22 successful nests fledged an average of 5.2 young. Dates of first laying varied over an 18- or 19-day period in each year and averaged 3 weeks earlier in 2008 than in 2009. Early breeders laid larger clutches. After the effect of breeding site was controlled for, small rather than large female pygmy-owls bred earliest. The same pattern of small size was evident in all years. Diet varied by year in regard to whether mammals (2008) or birds (2007 and 2009) were the dominant prey taken, and the owls bred earlier in 2008 occurred when mammals dominated their diet. Although small females tended to breed earlier in all years, it was only in 2009 when pairs bred very late and birds dominated their diet that small females also laid larger clutches and fledged more young. These data suggest that the merits of small or large body size may vary with stages of the breeding cycle and ecological conditions. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2012.

ABSTRACT: Little is known about the habitat and ecology of suburban Barred Owls (Strix varia), a species sometimes considered the nocturnal equivalent of Red-shouldered Hawks (Buteo lineatus). We compared nesting habitat of Barred Owls to that of Red-shouldered Hawks nesting in suburban and urban areas, in and near the city of Cincinnati, Ohio, to determine whether any features distinguished owl nest sites from hawk nest sites. We characterized habitat and land-cover metrics in circular plots of 100 ha and 15 ha, centered on the owl and hawk nests, using ATtiILa software operating within a GIS environment. For the 100-ha plots, the primary cover type in the plots surrounding nests of both species was forest, 41.4 ± 3.4 for Barred Owl plots and 45.9 ± 3.4 for Red-shouldered Hawk plots, followed by low-density residential land: 29.8 ± 4.8 of the Barred Owl plots and 29.3 ± 3.7 of the Red-shouldered Hawk plots. Pasture composed <15 of the plot area for both species and the remainder of the cover types contributed even less. Values of land-cover percentages and metrics did not differ between the species (P > 0.05), for either the large plots or the small (15-ha) plots. Using stepwise binary logit regression analysis, we found that no variables discriminated owl plots from hawk plots. We concluded, based on our methodology, that habitat of suburban Barred Owls differed little from habitat of suburban Red-shouldered Hawks in southwestern Ohio. © 2012 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Increases in yolk androgens within and among avian clutches have been correlated with decreased incubation time, increased aggression within a nest, increased begging behaviour, decreased immune response, and decreased life span. Although the mechanisms that lead to variability in yolk androgens within and between clutches are not completely known, yolk androgens can be a function of both social and environmental conditions. We were interested in if and how nesting density, laying date, and laying order influenced yolk androgens in Western Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia hypugaea (Bonaparte, 1825)) in which nest density varies considerably. In 2006 and 2007, we used radioimmunoassay to quantify the concentrations of testosterone, 5a-dihydrotestosterone, and androstenedione in the egg yolks from one early and one latelaid egg in 47 nests of Burrowing Owls located in the Morley Nelson Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area in southern Idaho. Nesting density had no detectable effect on yolk androgens. Yolk androgens varied temporally and peaked in the middle of the laying season while being low before and after this time period. Within nests, late-laid eggs had higher testosterone and dihydrotestosterone than early-laid eggs; adrostendione exhibited a similar pattern in one but not both years of our study. It is possible that the seasonal pattern in yolk androgens that we observed is related to aspects of mate quality for females or declining chances of fledging success for later nesting females, whereas rises in egg androgens between early and late eggs within clutches could reflect a mechanism to assist nestlings from late-laid eggs that hatch one to several days after their siblings to better compete for resources within the nest or promote survival in the presence of larger siblings.

ABSTRACT: Athene vallgornerensis nov. sp. (Aves: Strigiformes: Strigidae) from the Early Pleistocene of the island of Mallorca (Balearic Islands, Western Mediterranean) is described. The material came from a fossil assemblage obtained in a collapsed gallery from Cova des Pas de Vallgornera (Llucmajor, south of Mallorca), the longest karstic system currently known in the Balearics. Associated remains include primitive representatives of the insular endemic fauna of Mallorca (Myotragus, Hypnomys, Nesiotites), as well as fossils of bats, birds (among them, Tyto balearica), lizards and toads. Although only two bones of Athene have been obtained, its highly distinctive tarsometatarsus-short, highly robust and significantly small-differentiates it from the remaining extant and extinct Athene species from the Palaearctic, justifying its description as a new species. At least four insular species of Athene are now known from the Mediterranean area, and two groups can be identified according to the shape of their tarsometatarsi. © 2011 Dt.

ABSTRACT: We investigated the effects of habitat structure and composition, rainfall and nest spacing on the productivity of an Eagle Owl Bubo bubo population in Piedmont, northern Italy, at 10 sites from 1996 to 2007. We modeled the effects of the above factors on the productivity of 85 breeding attempts through a mixed model procedure. The number of fledged young per pair was affected positively by wetland interspersion index (a potential estimate of prey abundance) and negatively by rainfall during chick-rearing and by cover of urbanized land in the nest surroundings.

ABSTRACT: Local adaptation is a major mechanism underlying the maintenance of phenotypic variation in spatially heterogeneous environments. In the barn owl (Tyto alba), dark and pale reddish-pheomelanic individuals are adapted to conditions prevailing in northern and southern Europe, respectively. Using a long-term dataset from Central Europe, we report results consistent with the hypothesis that the different pheomelanic phenotypes are adapted to specific local conditions in females, but not in males. Compared to whitish females, reddish females bred in sites surrounded by more arable fields and less forests. Colour-dependent habitat choice was apparently beneficial. First, whitish females produced more fledglings when breeding in wooded areas, whereas reddish females when breeding in sites with more arable fields. Second, cross-fostering experiments showed that female nestlings grew wings more rapidly when both their foster and biological mothers were of similar colour. The latter result suggests that mothers should particularly produce daughters in environments that best match their own coloration. Accordingly, whiter females produced fewer daughters in territories with more arable fields. In conclusion, females displaying alternative melanic phenotypes bred in habitats providing them with the highest fitness benefits. Although small in magnitude, matching habitat selection and local adaptation may help maintain variation in pheomelanin coloration in the barn owl. © 2011 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Animal populations are often limited by food and rearing offspring is energetically demanding. Life history theory predicts that parents of altricial bird species will often reduce their current reproductive effort when given supplementary food. Previous food supplementation studies have mainly focused on effects on female parents, while the importance of paternal behaviour has largely been neglected. We addressed the effects of natural and experimentally increased food abundance on male ranging behaviour and provisioning rate, female and fledgling condition, and final reproductive success, in the Tengmalm's owl, . Aegolius funereus, a species with obligatory biparental care. We found that males adjusted their parental effort by reducing provisioning rate at food-supplemented nests. Food supplementation induced an increase in body mass of females, and in body mass and haematocrit levels of fledglings. This suggests that the amount of extra food provided was enough for females to increase body condition sufficiently to start allocating extra resources to enhance the quality of current offspring. While the home range size of radiomarked males was not affected by food supplementation, it decreased with cover of spruce forest, which is a habitat that is denser in structure and richer in prey than pine forest and especially clear-cut areas. This suggests that habitat-specific prey abundance and/or cover may be strong determinants of home range size for males. Overall, the results provide novel insights into how habitat quality and food supply affect male hunting behaviour and biparental care, and how this in turn is reflected in fledgling condition. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

ABSTRACT: Mobbing behaviour is considered an anti-predator adaptation that functions to alert other birds to the presence of a true predator, confusing and causing the latter to retreat. We tested the prediction that the ornithophagous Striped Owl Asio (= Pseudoscops) clamator should generate heavier mobbing than the Barn Owl Tyto alba, an occasional predator of birds. Fieldwork was conducted between July and August 2006 in a savannah of the EstacSo Ecologies de Itirapina (22°13'S, 47°53'W), southeast Brazil. At 64 trial points we displayed one of two dummies (a mounted T. alba or A. clamator specimen) and broadcasted their respective typical calls. Two days latter this was repeated at the trial point with the other model (32 trials for each model sequence). Forty-five bird species mobbed both owls, specifically 38 for A. clamator and 33 for T. alba. Mobbing bird composition was similar for both models, which attracted birds disproportionally closer (< 10 m) than would be expected by chance. As predicted, a significantly larger number of bird species and individuals mobbed A. clamator than T. alba. Additionally, mobbing intensity was higher against A. clamator than T. alba, suggesting differential predator recognition by mobbing birds. © The Neotropical Ornithological Society.

ABSTRACT: We assessed dietary exposure of the little owl Athene noctua to trace metal contamination in a Dutch Rhine River floodplain area. Diet composition was calculated per month for three habitat types, based on the population densities of six prey types (earthworms, ground beetles and four small mammal species) combined with the little owl's functional response to these prey types. Exposure levels showed a strong positive relationship with the dietary fraction of earthworms, but also depended on the dietary fraction of common voles, with higher common vole fractions resulting in decreasing exposure levels. Spatio-temporal changes in the availability of earthworms and common voles in particular resulted in considerable variation in exposure, with peaks in exposure exceeding a tentative toxicity threshold. These findings imply that wildlife exposure assessments based on a predefined, average diet composition may considerably underestimate local or intermittent peaks in exposure. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Unbiased estimates of burrowing owl populations (Athene cunicularia) are essential to achieving diverse management and conservation objectives. We conducted visibility trials and developed logistic regression models to identify and correct for visibility bias associated with single, vehicle-based, visual survey occasions of breeding male owls during daylight hours in an agricultural landscape in California between 30 April and 2 May 2007. Visibility was predicted best by a second-degree polynomial function of time of day and 7 categorical perch types. Probability of being visible was highest in the afternoon, and individuals that flushed, flew, or perched on hay bales were highly visible (>0.85). Visibility was lowest in agricultural fields (<0.46) and nonagricultural vegetation (<0.77). We used the results from this model to compute unbiased maximum likelihood estimates of visibility bias, and combined these with estimated probabilities of availability bias to validate our model by correcting for visibility and availability biases in 4 independent datasets collected during morning hours. Correcting for both biases produced reliable estimates of abundance in all 4 independent validation datasets. We recommend that estimates of burrowing owl abundance from surveys in the southwest United States correct for both visibility and availability biases. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.

ABSTRACT: We characterized the landscape-level habitat use of Megascops asio (Eastern Screech Owl) in a suburban/urban region of New York and Connecticut using citizen-science methodologies and GIS-based land-use information. Volunteers sampled their properties using call-playback surveys in the summers of 2009 and 2010. We modeled detection and occupancy as functions of distance to forest and two coarse measures of development. AIC c-supported models were validated with an independent dataset collected by trained professionals. Validated models indicated a negative association between occupancy and percent forest cover or, similarly, a positive association with percent impervious cover. When compared against the systematic dataset, models that used forest cover as a predictor had the highest accuracy (kappa = 0.73 ± 0.18) in predicting the occupancy observations in the systematic survey. After accounting for detection, both datasets support similar owl-habitat patterns of predicting occupancy in developed areas compared to highly rural. While there is likely a minimum amount of forest cover and/or maximum level of urbanization that Screech Owls can tolerate, such limits appear to be beyond the ranges sampled in this study. Future research that seeks to determine this development limit should focus on very urbanized areas. The high accuracy of the citizen-science models in predicting the systematic dataset indicates that volunteer-based efforts can provide reliable data for wildlife studies.

ABSTRACT: We predicted sex of 140 Snowy Owl (Bubo scandiacus) nestlings out of 34 nests at our Barrow, Alaska, study area to develop a technique for sexing these owls in the field. We primarily sexed young, flightless owls (3844 d old) by quantifying plumage markings on the remiges and tail, predicting sex, and collecting blood samples to test our field predictions using molecular sexing techniques. We categorized and quantified three different plumage markings: two types of bars (defined as markings that touch the rachis) and spots (defined as markings that do not touch the rachis). We predicted sex in the field assuming that males had more spots than bars and females more bars than spots on the remiges and rectrices. Molecular data indicated that we correctly sexed 100% of the nestlings. We modeled the data using random forests and classification trees. Both models indicated that the number and type of markings on the secondary feathers were the most important in classifying nestling sex. The statistical models verified our initial qualitative prediction that males have more spots than bars and females more bars than spots on flight feathers P6P10 for both wings and tail feathers T1 and T2. This study provides researchers with an easily replicable and highly accurate method for sexing young Snowy Owls in the field, which should aid further studies of sex-ratios and sex-related variation in behavior and growth of this circumpolar owl species. © 2011 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Ontologies are being developed for the life sciences to standardise the way we describe and interpret the wealth of data currently being generated. As more ontology based applications begin to emerge, tools are required that enable domain experts to contribute their knowledge to the growing pool of ontologies. There are many barriers that prevent domain experts engaging in the ontology development process and novel tools are needed to break down these barriers to engage a wider community of scientists. We present Populous, a tool for gathering content with which to construct an ontology. Domain experts need to add content, that is often repetitive in its form, but without having to tackle the underlying ontological representation. Populous presents users with a table based form in which columns are constrained to take values from particular ontologies. Populated tables are mapped to patterns that can then be used to automatically generate the ontology's content. These forms can be exported as spreadsheets, providing an interface that is much more familiar to many biologists. Populous's contribution is in the knowledge gathering stage of ontology development; it separates knowledge gathering from the conceptualisation and axiomatisation, as well as separating the user from the standard ontology authoring environments. Populous is by no means a replacement for standard ontology editing tools, but instead provides a useful platform for engaging a wider community of scientists in the mass production of ontology content.

ABSTRACT: Replacement clutches can be crucial to the breeding success of avian species, although several factors may influence their outcome and the quality of chicks. Here we compare first and replacement clutches of Eagle Owls in terms of chick quality, timing of breeding, and number of eggs and fledglings .We hypothesize that the propensity to abandon nests and start a new clutch could have evolved because females are able to produce chicks that are as good as the ones of the first clutch. We found that nestlings in replacement clutches were not significantly different from nestlings in first clutches, in terms of immune system and body condition; nor were there significant differences in clutch and brood size. Our findings may be explained by the fact that clutches were laid early in the season, perhaps by high-quality parents, and that food resources are plentiful in the study area. In order to maximize fitness, individuals have to adjust optimally the investment of resources in different life-history traits. Thus, the re-nesting behaviour of Eagle Owls may be seen as a way to solve the trade-off between one trait (survival) favoured over another (reproduction), when one of them has a disproportionate effect on fitness.

ABSTRACT: The arms race between predators and prey has led to morphological and behavioral adaptations. Different antipredator strategies can coexist within a population if each strategy is the result of a trade-off with competing demands. Antipredator behavior can be associated with morphological traits, like color patterns, either because in the context of sexual selection, coloration signals the ability to avoid predators or because coloration is a naturally selected trait useful in avoiding predators. Because in the barn owl (Tyto alba), heritable eumelanic plumage coloration is associated with the glucocorticoid-dependent response to stress, we tested whether antipredator behavior is also related to this trait. Compared with small-spotted nestlings, individuals displaying larger black spots hissed more intensely in the presence of humans, feigned death longer, had a lower breathing rate under stress, and were more docile when handled. Cross-fostering experiments showed that the covariation between the spot size and the duration of feigning death was inherited from the biological mother, whereas covariation between spot size and docility was inherited from the biological father. Our results confirm that melanin-based coloration is associated with suites of behavioral traits, which are under both genetic and environmental influence. Coloration can thus evolve as a direct or indirect response to predation, but it can also be a signal of antipredator strategies to potential mates. © 2012 The Author.

ABSTRACT: The extinct Madeiran Scops Owl Otus mauli n. sp. is described from fossil bones found in Quaternary sites on Madeira Island (Madeira Archipelago, North Atlantic Ocean). It is the first extinct bird to be described from this archipelago and the first extinct species of Strigiformes known from anywhere in Macaronesia. The forelimb bones of the new taxon are similar in size to those of the Eurasian Scops Owl (Otus scops Linnaeus) but the hindlimb bones are longer, especially the tarsometatarsus, which is much longer and more slender than in O. scops. The estimated body weight and wing loading, together with the proportions of hindlimb bones (femur, tibiotarsus and tarsometatarsus) in relation to total length of leg bones (femur+tibiotarsus+tarsometatarsus), seem to indicate a ground-dwelling life-style. Human arrival and subsequent habitat alterations (introduction of alien taxa, burning, etc.) are the most probable causes of its extinction. The same species or a close relative is documented from dunes on the island of Porto Santo, but the quality of preservation of its bones precludes more certain identification.

ABSTRACT: Animals should continuously assess the threat of predation. Alarm calls inform on predation risk and are often used as cues to shape behavioural responses in birds and mammals. Hitherto, however, the ecological consequences of alarm calls in terms of organization of animal communities have been neglected. Here, we show experimentally that calls of a resident nocturnal raptor, the little owl Athene noctua, triggered a response in terms of breeding habitat selection and investment in current reproduction in conspecifics and heterospecifics. Little owls preferred to settle in territories where calls of conspecifics, irrespective of their type (i.e. alarm versus contact calls), were broadcasted, indicating that either conspecific attraction exists or calls are interpreted as foreign calls, eliciting settlement as a mode of defence against competitors. Also, we found that little owls seemed to invest more in current reproduction in safe territories as revealed by conspecific calls. Innovatively, we reported that a second owl species, the migratory scops owl Otus scops, preferred to breed in safe territories as indicated by little owls' calls. These results evidence that the emission of alarm calls may have, apart from well-known behavioural effects, ecological consequences in natural communities by inducing species-specific biases in breeding habitat selection. This study demonstrates a previously unsuspected informative role of avian alarm calls which may modulate the spatial structure of species within communities. © 2012 The Royal Society.

ABSTRACT: A comparison of the isometric forces and levers of the pectoralis muscle in red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis) and barred owls (Strix varia) was done to identify differences that may correlate with their different flight styles. The pectoralis consists of two heads, the anterior m. sternobrachialis (SB) and the posterior m. thoracobrachialis (TB). These are joined at an intramuscular tendon and are supplied by separate primary nerve branches. As in other birds, the two heads have distinct fiber orientations in red-tailed hawks and barred owls. SB's fiber orientation (posterolateral and mediolateral from origin to insertion) provides pronation and protraction of the humerus during adduction. Electromyographic studies in pigeons show that it is active in early downstroke and during level flight. TB is more active during take-off and landing in pigeons. The anterolateral orientation (from origin to insertion) of its fibers provides a retractive component to humeral adduction used to control the wing during landing. In our study, the maximum isometric force produced by the combined pectoralis heads did not differ significantly between the hawk and owl, however, the forces were distributed differently between the two muscle heads. In the owl, SB and TB were capable of producing equal amounts of force, but in the hawk, SB produced significantly less force than did TB. This may reflect the need for a large TB to control landing in both birds during prey-strike, with the owl maintaining both protractive (using SB) and retractive (using TB) abilities. Pronation and protraction may be less important in the flight behavior of the hawk, but its prey-strike behavior may require the maintenance of a substantial TB for braking and controlled stalling, as it initiates strike behavior. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ABSTRACT: We studied how human induced structural changes in forests affect stand use of the Rufous-legged Owl (forest-specialist) and the Austral Pygmy Owl (forest-facultative), in a gradient from lowland disrupted forests to protected Andean forests in Chile. We also tested if the calls of one species influenced the calling behaviour of the other. We detected a total of 34 Rufous-legged Owls and 21 Austral Pygmy Owls during the four seasons. Rufous-legged Owls were found principally in old growth Araucaria-Nothofagus stands (32.4%), and Pygmy Owls in old growth evergreen stands (52.4%). For both species there was a seasonal effect on call response, with a drop in responses in autumn and winter. Our models suggested that Rufous-legged Owls inhabit a more specific range of habitat characteristics than Pygmy Owls. The former selected stands with tall trees, relatively low tree density, and high bamboo density. Pygmy Owls selected stands with tall trees and relatively high tree density. There was no evidence that either species influenced the calling behaviour of the other, suggesting no negative association between use of a territory by the two species. Our results emphasize the importance of structural components of old growth forests for both species, but also the relevance of stands surrounding protected areas. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

ABSTRACT: Wildlife management strategies can be improved by accurate predictions of species distributions and sound estimates of population sizes. Species distribution models that relate occurrence or abundance of a species to environmental predictors can be applied for both purposes. We build a generalized linear model relating the distribution of breeding Tawny Owls (Strix aluco) to remotely sensed environmental data to estimate the current distribution of breeding territories throughout Denmark. Additionally, we apply three different methods to calculate population estimates from the model predictions. The most parsimonious model includes only coverage of deciduous forest and its squared effect as significant predictors. Correspondence between predictions of breeding territories and atlas data on breeding Tawny Owls is high (73%), indicating that our model captures an essential part of this species' habitat requirements. The three population estimates suggests the number of breeding pairs in Denmark to be ∼ 4,800, ∼ 7,200, or ∼ 20,500, respectively. This case adds to the existing body of literature that illustrates that species distribution models can be useful to predict the distribution of species and for estimating population size. © Dt.

ABSTRACT: The largest irruptive migration of the Great Gray Owl (Strix nebulosa Forster, 1772) recorded since 1831 occurred in Minnesota, USA, during the winter of 2004-2005. We tested the hypothesis that morphometric indicators of nutritional stress covary with stable isotope signatures in a sample of 265 owls killed by vehicle collisions. The ratio of carbon to nitrogen in muscle (C/Nmuscle) was shown to be a reliable proxy of nutritional stress. δ13C values for liver and muscle were significantly higher in owls in poor condition, reflecting the depletion of lipid reserves in fasting individuals. On the other hand, δ15N values for liver and muscle were marginally lower or unchanged in owls in poor condition. Stomachs of emaciated owls were less likely to contain prey, implying that many nutritionally stressed individuals were too weak to hunt and were near the tipping point of irreversible fasts. In a broader context, sexual differences in the correlative relationships between stable isotope signatures, C/N, and body condition suggest that the consequences of reversed sexual size dimorphism extend to physiological processes during the nonbreeding season.

ABSTRACT: According to the Evolutionary Theory of the Family, the replacement of one pair-member by an intruder may have profound consequences for the existing offspring. Step-parents are expected to provide less care towards unrelated immatures than to genetic offspring, unless caring also serves as a mating strategy. Furthermore, because an intruder will be a potential mate for opposite-sexed offspring, relationships between offspring and same-sex parents are predicted to deteriorate. To test these predictions, we studied an Azara's owl monkey (Aotus azarai) population in Argentina exhibiting serial monogamy and bi-parental care. Since 1997, we have collected demographic data from ca. 25 groups and inter-individual distance data from ca. 150 marked individuals. First, we compared survival and dispersal age of immatures in groups with and without replacements to investigate whether parental care serves as a mating strategy. Second, we compared sex-specific age at dispersal for groups with replacement of opposite-sex parents, same-sex parents, or in stable groups in order to test whether relationships between offspring and same-sex parents deteriorated after the replacement of the other parent. Survival and dispersal ages were not negatively associated with replacements, suggesting that male care might serve, at least partly, as a mating strategy. The time lag between a replacement and the subsequent dispersal of female offspring was greater if the intruder was a male, while the offspring and same-sex parents were less often nearest neighbors after replacements than before. Our results suggest that family disruption through the replacement of a parent is not associated with decreased offspring survival or early dispersion of juveniles, but deteriorates parent-offspring relationships. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: With the development of e-commerce over Internet, web service discovery received much interest. A critical aspect of web service discovery is web service similarity search or matchmaking. To enhance the similarity precision, several solutions that do not limit to a syntactic comparison of inputs and outputs of the compared services have been proposed. Most of them introduce the structure of web service operations in the similarity measure. In this paper, we analyze these approaches and point out their time complexity drawback. Then, we propose a more efficient matching algorithm based on the concept of decomposition kernels of graphs. We study the complexity of our approach and present performance analysis.

ABSTRACT: Many species of owls are able to fly noiselessly, and their wing feathers play an important role for the silent flight. In this paper, we studied the sound suppression mechanism of the eagle owl (. Bubo bubo) by Stereo Microscope (SM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope (LSCM). To investigate the effects of special characteristics of wing feather on owl silent flight, the acoustic properties, including the sound absorption coefficient and flight noise, were compared between the eagle owl and common buzzard (. Buteo buteo). The results show that the eagle owl generates lower noise than common buzzard during flight, and its wing feather has better sound absorption properties. The leading edge serration and trailing edge fringe can improve the pressure fluctuation of turbulence boundary, and suppress the generation of vortex sound. The elongated distal barbules form a multi-layer grid porous structure which also has an effect on sound absorption. This research not only can give the inspiration for solving the aerodynamic noise of aircraft and engineering machine, but also can provide a new idea for the design of low-noise devices. © 2012 Jilin University.

ABSTRACT: A 12-year-old male burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia) was presented for evaluation of a mass in the right cervical region. A thymoma was diagnosed after surgical resection and histopathologic evaluation. Extensive adherence of the thymoma to the esophagus and suspected invasion into the right jugular vein contributed to a poor postsurgical outcome. Diagnosis and treatment of thymomas in avian species is similar to that in mammals. Surgical removal of noninvasive thymomas is usually curative. Thymomas are rarely reported in avian species and this is the first report in a strigiform bird. © 2012 Association of Avian Veterinarians.

ABSTRACT: It is a challenge to understand how barn owls (Tyto alba) reduce noise during flight to be able to hunt small mammals by audition. Several specializations of the wing and the wing feathers have been implicated in noise reduction. What has been overlooked so far are the fringes at the inner vanes of remiges. We demonstrated, by using precise imaging techniques combined with morphometric measurements and air-flow studies, that these fringes merge into neighboring feather vanes by gliding into the grooves at the lower wing surface that are formed by parallel-oriented barb shafts. The connection of adjacent feathers results in a smooth lower wing surface and thus reduces sharp and noisy edges. This finding sheds new light on the mechanisms underlying noise reduction of flying owls. © 2012 The Authors. Journal of Anatomy © 2012 Anatomical Society.

ABSTRACT: Four cases of Columbid herpesvirus-1 infection in great horned owls (Bubo virginianus) were identified in Calgary, Alberta. Necropsy findings included severe multifocal hepatic and splenic necrosis, pharyngeal ulceration and necrosis, and gastrointestinal necrosis. Occasional eosinophilic intranuclear viral inclusion bodies were associated with the foci of necrosis and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing confirmed a diagnosis of herpesvirusinduced disease. The sequence of a PCR amplicon had 99.7% homology to Columbid herpesvirus-1.
